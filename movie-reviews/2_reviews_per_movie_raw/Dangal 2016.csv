"MR_Heraclius","10","47","50","23 February 2020"," the best indian movie in the history
","If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016."
"lykansdonnie","10","27","30","23 January 2019"," Omg what a great movie.
","I watched this because my son wrestles and I didnt know it was a inspirational but also a tear jerker. Never heard of this movie until our wrestling community here in Ohio talked about it. Definitely one to watch!!"
"gskrocks","9","160","214","21 December 2016"," Aamir is back with a stellar performance of a decade !
","DANGAL is a masterpiece. A terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded. A brilliant film that restores your faith in Hindi cinema. Actually, it won't be erroneous to state that DANGAL is the finest film to come out of the Hindi film industry in a long, long time and mark my words, it will be remembered as a classic in times to come. It blends drama, emotions, sportsmanship and patriotism extraordinarily the icing on the cake being Aamir Khan's towering act. This rich-in-merits film has a major advantage too -- the holidays ahead Christmas and New Year -- which will ensure a glorious run at the ticket counters. A must, must watch!"

","What just happened?A better karate kid?
Amazing movie.Reminds me of what Hollywood use to be."
"Fella_shibby","10","128","175","23 December 2016"," Awesome film n wonderful performance by Aamir. Disney n Aamir did a miracle with this film.
","I saw this with my family in a theatre. Awesome experience.
Aamir's acting, effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique. First thing Dangal has going for it is Aamir khan.
Aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Phogat. He is the best actor in bollywood. Period. He shocked me by his transformation. I myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation. Without Aamir I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has.
The child actors were good too. The music was good. The direction by Tiwari was the best of 2016. This movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director. The cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real.
Overall you don't have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie. Its a wonderful movie. The movie is written very well. Superb screenplay n crispy editing."
"umashankarpati1997","9","96","136","23 December 2016"," This is AAMIR KHAN's by far the best one.Finest casting and terrific acting by all.
","Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. He is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever. The opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of Phogat's passion for the sport – wrestling. The first half of Dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler – invariably sure of its moves. The film's second half is all about victory. Mahavir's transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to Geeta's string of losses before she finally wins a gold during Common Wealth Games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat – every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier. But not even once does the film loses its focus.<br/><br/>A word here about Mukesh Chhabra's casting: he has done a tremendous job of the casting. Nitesh Tiwari's direction is amazingly terrific. AmitabhBhattacharya's lyrics are great. Pritam's music is in terrific sync with the mood of the drama. 'Dangal dangal' is a very inspiring song and will soon become a rage. 'Dhaakad' and 'Haanikarak' are also very well-tuned. The 'Gilehariyaan' song has terrific charm of a different kind. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics are great. The song writer may pick up some awards for his lyrics. Bosco- Caesar's choreography is very real. Pritam's background music deserves distinction marks. The actors who play the young Geeta and Babita (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) do a competent job of maintaining the audiences attention. And both Shaikh and Malhotra carry it forward, especially when they spend a lot of the second half on the mat, learning how to lose, and, above all, to win. Since it encapsulates the historic win of the phogats who bought India glory so it is bound to inspire women. Dialogues are absolute gems. Without being overtly long, they are so effective that they invariably touch the heart before reaching the ears. On the whole, Dangal is not just a movie; it is an experience to be cherished. The film is destined to be one of the biggest blockbusters of Indian cinema.As it content oriented so The movie is both for the single screens as well as for the multiplexes and people of all age can watch.so this movie is a must watch. So I Rate it 10 stars out of 10 because I was thinking movie deserves it.I usually don't rate any movie 10 but This movie ""HatsOff"". Don't Expect a better story than this.Finest piece.Dangal hai yeh."

","Umm where to start? First of Aamir sir has done it again. He really has a good taste in selecting movies. Not only the acting even the fighting scenes were quite real to me & reel Geeta and Babita were just too awesome. There is certain moments where you're gonna laugh out loud, get anger, get emotional and obviously feel proud the most that's what the movie brings out of itself. I hope this movie brings joy to all family and a chance to look at all daughter's of their's potential.<br/><br/>Should you go for it? Hell yes<br/><br/>Songs are smartly enough and pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Ps. I wished the movie to be a bit longer."

","Just came home after watching the premier show. It really is a masterpiece! A compelling narrative based on a true story. Add stellar acting performances and humor. Pour in cinematography, location, songs & meaningful lyrics. Voila! Everything amazingly fits together in a single string. Truly clean entertainment. In all sense of the word. Worth watching with family. A good movie should entertain. A great movie must connect. And connect, it did. I could almost feel as if I were there, throughout. The plot development is deep, and engaging. Did I mention the child actors, especially the one portraying Geeta? Outstanding performance by all. In a nutshell, my time & resources spent were fully worth. And Aamir Khan! Boy, he never disappoints. =)"
"dineshprakash","10","86","131","22 December 2016"," Ultimate triumph
","Director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes, you just forget that you are watching film. You simply start witnessing the journey of Phogat's family. Makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to Divya Rao, which reflects their honesty. She is not in writing team but gets her due credit. There are four writers, Director himself, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra and their work is fantastic. Screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness. Film starts with glimpse of Mahavir Singh Phogat's passion for wrestling, while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner, while commentary comes over on them which is fresh. When that person gets defeated he says 'Tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai' Then Mahavir Singh replies ' Tension mat le, tum national level champion se hare ho'. Words may be a bit different but meaning was same. Which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph. Dialogues just nourish your senses, inducing correct emotions. A simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter, clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too. Girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married, then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute, emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted. Best part of this film is it's continues ascending graph in every aspect. First half is cute, funny with subtle dose of emotions. Second half takes this graph to the horizon. Full of emotions, either it is of defeat, victory or relations. Another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling. I dint know a bit of it but I enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film. Hats off to the team behind wresting choreography .Though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation. Climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques, which makes you true winner and enriches self confident. Performance makes you thunderstruck. Words can not justify or compliment, Amir Khan's performance as Mahavir Singh Phogat. Zaira Waseem as younger Geeta is brilliant. She is so good that when Fatima Sana Sheikh takes over as grown up Geeta, you miss younger one but soon Fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead. Same happens with younger Babita played by Suhani Bhatnagar and grown up by Sanya Malhotra. Skashi Tanwar as wife of Mahavir Singh is very good. Girish Kulkarni , who had played coach is superb, you do hate his character but love his performance. Actor, who played younger cousin of Geeta and even grown up one, both actors are cute and endearing. Kudos to casting director Mukesh Chhabra and team. Music by Pritam and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya, are integral part of this film. Without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too."
"adityapaihy-724-884968","10","75","114","22 December 2016"," Very Nice Movie
","Excellent movie. Stellar performance by Aamir Khan. Movie of the year. The girls - kids and the grown ups portrayed their role very well. Special mention should be given to Nitesh Tiwari - the director. Music by Pritam is good. The cinematography is nice. The story telling is superb. Overall very nice movie. Watch this movie for Aamir Khan. Hands down to Aamir. His role as Mahavir Singh Phogat will be marked as one of his best. This film will come as one of the best sports films based on the life of coach after Chak De and Iqbal. I strongly recommend this film. Wish other actors think like how Aamir Khan thinks. He is brilliant actor. That makes him special and perfectionist. My rating 10/10."

"aashkaran2006","8","10","13","23 December 2016"," Aamir's Chak De India of 2017 !
","My Dangal Review/Thoughts:<br/><br/>In the moments of tension, I believe everyone exhibits their own unique body language to deal with nervousness and anxiousness. Mine involves folding hands (christian style). I am worried that I folded my hands for so long during the film that had I done the same in a temple, I would have been some Shah Rukh Khan myself. Yes ! The film is that excellent in its portrayal of the sport that it makes you grudge every time a player lands back first on the mat. We are so used to applauding action set pieces in other films that it will be criminal if the action choreography for Dangal goes unappreciated. This is the best and most realistic we have ever done!<br/><br/>The whole cast is so great that I can't do anything but wonder why we need the glam actresses for each and every big film..why not some Sakshi Talwar? The new faces do wonders when it comes to making the illusion of cinema feel true. And, when Aamir (the superstar) sheds former self to becomes some chachajaan, it adds to the illusion instead of taking the magic away. I am bound to praise Aamir, but that guy has lost that element of surprise to make you go WoW. He is just aamir being aamir in yet another film that'll be brought in his already long good list. This is what happens when you submit yourself to the script and director (<= full marks)<br/><br/>Most sports film are marred by clichés. Its impossible to evade the conventional trappings of the genre. Dangal has its fair share of those, but the biggest thing is that it knows when to stop, and that's what makes it a stadium like live experience. My adrenaline rush was high, and it made me very nostalgic as I got reminded of CWG Delhi days when I was 24*7 glued to DD sports. At this point, I feel my review is deviating from its path so I will put breaks by making a concluding statement.<br/><br/>This is Aamir's Chak de India! I am speaking this both figuratively and literally ( :) ). But, who in the right mind would mind another one of those."
"sarkar-64044","8","9","12","23 December 2016"," Energetic,emotional,patriotic and a good message

"KeremUlucay","8","3","3","23 January 2019"," MOTIVATIONAL
","Dangal has Indian box office record of all time and it deserves it. It is the best biopic Bollywood can make. It has every quality Hollywood biopics have. Cast did an amazing job. Preparing this project as an actor is hard. Aamir Khan's transformation proves that. They brilliantly show us their characters' moods and reactions about every event they have been through. Also, Dangal has great descriptions about public and important social messages. I really respect that. I think it is almost a masterpiece but it miss that by a step. Best thing this movie have is showing us great character motivations and relationships. They made it nicely. Worst thing this movie have is telling wrestling's technical details so superficial. It shows something about that but it doesn't explain."
"raheelafzal","10","3","3","19 January 2019"," Dangal - A strong message to Indian Society
","A movi with very strong script and an emotional theme. This movie has certain background that highlights a concerning issue that Indian society is going through right now.
In India child sex ratio (0-6 years) is about 914 girls per 1,000 boys according to latest report and every year approximately 2000 girls are killed before or just after birth. This ratio is increasing with the passage of time. In India girls are often viewed as a burden because of structure of the society and complex dowry system.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Modi has taken many inititatives recently like ""Beti Bachao Beti Padhao"". I don't know if this movie is the part of that compaign or not but it's story is very strong. Amir Khan performed very well. A must watch movie if you like social movies.
No hit song or romance; that's the only weak point this movie has."

","It's conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat, but who'd have thought it would bring tears to your eyes. Dangal does both in large doses. Right from the opening scenes through to the awesome climax, this is one movie that will keep you glued to the screen. I can't remember the last 3 hour movie (nearly) where absolutely nobody took a toilet break apart from in the intermission.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie is superb from the cinematography through to the script writing. The movie is superbly directed and there are so many stellar acting performances that it would be unfair to single anyone out.<br/><br/>One thing about sports movies is that the action can often seem staged, but the fight sequences in this movie are superbly done and brilliantly filmed.<br/><br/>Everyone knows an AK movie is going to be great, and this definitely doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>A must watch."
"Filmaholic_Khan","9","8","11","24 December 2016"," High Level of Detail makes Dangal Stand Out! Inspirational True Story
","Nitesh Tiwari, Amir Khan and the team has put an extra-ordinary effort to make such an intelligent blend of Inspiration, Emotions and Humor that standing ovation at the end is irresistible. Dangal has a very unfamiliar high level of detail which is too good for Bollywood. High detailing make actors live the character, which doesn't go unnoticed and Dangal proves this point. Each actor wasn't just playing the character, they were truly living it. It was the Phogat family viewers saw on screen instead of the actors. That makes Dangal stand out. Acting is brilliant by both the lead and supporting actors. Mr. Perfectionist was great like always. No words to describe his level of commitment. Special mentions are the debutantes Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra and Zaira Waseem. All the wrestling scenes are perfect and viewers can't mistake them for actors. The way these girls portrayed the characters of the wrestlers Geeta and Babita is commendable and worthy of every award. Story was based on a true story and the director stuck to it with some slight additions to make the movie more emotional and enjoyable which is good for Bollywood audience. But as a critic I must say there was a little bit of over dramatization in the end. Also I want to mention that AK and Nitesh didn't include any usual romantic crap and dance sequences which must be appreciated. Casting could have been better. Fatima is too cute for Geeta's character and this matters a lot while making a Biography. But she minimized this shortcoming by her flawless performance. Movie is 2hr40mins long but its well crafted so its enjoyable. ____________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ Its a must watch movie and Amir Khan keeps on setting standards for other producers of Bollywood which makes us hope for a better future of movies in India."
"maulin5","9","8","11","24 December 2016"," Bhed Ki Haahakaar Ke Badle Sher Ki Ek Dahaad Hai Pyaare- Dangal!
","Aamir Khan is back after 'pk' as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the Gold for the nation. It is a biopic of Mahavir Phogat. And believe me, it's a must watch biopic to get inspiration. To achieve something you have to let go the rest of the things.<br/><br/>A simple story with great performances make this film a worthy watch. Aamir Khan is as usual fantastic. But, the girls are true heroes of this film. Fatimah who plays Geeta is a sure shot winner. She looks exactly as per her character and delivers great impact as a wrestler. Younger girls of Geeta and Babita are also very fine. Sakshi has a small role, but she plays it safely. Aparshakti Khurana is doing a voice over here and plays a role of the girls' cousin brother. He is funny and entertains the audiences for sure. Girish Kulkarni is also there, who delivered a classy performance in Ugly. So, the star cast and their performances are the biggest point of Dangal.<br/><br/>Direction and writing by Nitesh Tiwari are worthy enough for viewers as they don't get bored in any situation. Except one, after interval song, that is like something slow paced. Everyone has to applause him as he gives justice to Phogat's family and doesn't add any extra material which we often see in Bollywood movies. He has delivered the frame as it is, so the middle class viewer can easily be able to connect with the film. <br/><br/>What I like the most in the film apart from the performances is Music. Pritam has given it with the lyrics of Amitabh Bhatacharya. Both were amazing in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. This time also they are killing the stereotypes. I loved all the songs. I'm downloading it. Hanikarak Bapu and Dhakad are pitch perfect. They have some English words as well as some pure Hindi words in them which make them enjoyable. But the best song is by far the Title track in the voice of Daler Mehndi. Full marks to the music department!<br/><br/>Yes, it is very emotional film. Those who get the connection easily with films, may cry during some scenes. Even I'm one of them, too. It is better than Sultan, because it's a pure wrestling movie with a family background. Sultan was like a love story with a background of wrestling till interval and then box fighting post interval. I wish, Dangal may cross the record of Sultan at Box Office.<br/><br/>On the whole, just go and enjoy the perfect film with your entire family as many time as you can. Btw, I will go for the second time for sure. So, 2016 has ended with a perfect film. Jai Hind!"
"hsm2310","9","8","11","23 December 2016"," Dangal is very special. Ultimate mix of technical film making and popular cinema
","Dangal (9/10) is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists. It has universal appeal, is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism. It is going to reach tens of millions of people without having compromised the quality of storytelling.<br/><br/>An extraordinary story of some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also a society which had the negativity to kill their dreams even before they were born.<br/><br/>If Chak De was a fine example of exemplary editing in a sports film and Pan Singh Tomar was an exceptional sports film with great depth and realism, Dangal would forever be remembered as one of the best Indian sports film for the sheer reach it will have. Wrestling is a fast paced technical sport. To make the whole thing look as authentic as it has looked in the film, it would have required some meticulous planning and extensive training and they have done it really well.<br/><br/>The fact that you feel the frustration that Mahavir Singh Phogat feels in the final scene and you along with the whole audience begins to clap after each of Geeta's winning bout as if there was a live game at display shows how supremely engaging the film is. One negative, though not significant enough to harm the film is that it has over dramatazied the narrative at the cost of slight misrepresentation of the facts.<br/><br/>Only if the majority of Indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible to make good cinema with popular appeal, we would start getting more than just a couple of Hindi films every year worth watching. Now is a good time to list Top Films from India in the Sports/Drama genre: 1)Paan SIngh Tomar 2)Dangal 3)Chak De India 4)Iqbal 5)Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander 6)Lagaan 7)Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"
"arpanmitra3","9","8","11","23 December 2016"," Grit and Determination
","Its a movie decked up with the classic acting of the veterans and the novices and bore the testimony of the unorthodox approach to bring to light the dream of Mahavir Phogat. The fire of 'dangal' ignited in the hearts of the sisters which paved the path of demolition of gender discrimination. The film portrays the affectionate bonding of a father and a daughter and emotional rendition escalates barriers when the elder sister has kept the very words of her father's dream. In fact it is beautifully carved that our ignorance towards our family elders hinders our progress. The film has been peppered with humour every now and then and it has added extra spice to the viewers."

","Honestly I was a bit determinant after watching Sultan thinking that this film could be a remake but honestly after watching this movie, it was a lot different. <br/><br/>This movie just melted my heart with the fantastic writing, direction, performances, and editing. <br/><br/>Nitesh Tiwari brought 2 average films which were Bhoothnath Returns and Chillar Party. But for this film, he deserves a bow for the amount of hard work he managed to put for this film.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie were absolutely phenomenal. <br/><br/>Aamir Khan is back to becoming nuanced and self confident Khan we always admired. His fat to fit video really created a lot of inspiration for me and my friends and that increased our eager level in watching this movie. <br/><br/>Sakshi Tanwar is a pretty decent actress. Her role was absolutely strong and withheld but her dialogues in certain places were quite awkward and almost out-of-place.<br/><br/>The girls who played Geeta and Babita just kept me to the edge of my seat. What amazement these girls did and how they used their empowerment to pull of a male-sport with such ease.<br/><br/>The screenplay and direction was something I really loved just like how Haryana was shot and how the wrestling scenes were shot.<br/><br/>After Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, I managed to enjoy Priam's music but the songs in Dangal were average and I wouldn't consider them at loop-listening soundtracks. Not many songs really stand out as such.<br/><br/>Honestly, I enjoyed this movie much more than Sultan based on its true story and fantastic direction. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a masterpiece with beautiful direction, performances, and acting. This motion picture really touched my heart. Leave your house and grab your tickets, this is definitely a cinema watching movie.<br/><br/>In any society, it is very important to understand the meaning of women rights. No matter how boyish something could be, women are considered human beings. Girls have the right to do anything ranging from being a police officer to a taxi driver. These are typical jobs that mostly men pull off but women can also pull these jobs off but much quicker. Try to understand that men and women are the same professional wise."

","Amir Khan a person always amazes everyone,recently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy base.That kind of movie is a ""movie"". Dangal is a good example it has a classic taste and digestible fun which peels off the people eyes. It is a true story full of suspense and when you're watching a fight you feel like you are wrestling in between this kind of quality is difficult to be produced and Amir is good at it. The reason for giving 9 stars is because of its ending I think it should be made better by showing scene like he is putting that medal at the wall of Honor.

"anupapu8","9","9","13","23 December 2016"," This Years Best along with PINK
","DANGAL - its such a good thing that both PINK and DANGAL , two top movies of this year are women centric. Its such an improvement for Bollywood which doesn't make movies on women because such movies doesn't make money , which is a wrong fact , PINK made almost 300% profit. You just need to make a good movie and it will make you money. And by saying women centric m serious, the character of Mahavir Phogat is not the real hero of the movie , rather its his daughter Geeta Phogat who is in the center of the movie. For understanding what MAhavir Phogat has achieved in his life , we must know the fact that Hariyana is one of the worst state in India for girls. A very low sex ratio and a very low Literacy rate for women. And in such scenario what Mahavir Phogat has achieved is tremendous. That said , one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from AMIR's movies like 3 idiot , PK and TALAASH , because its a biopic , so they have to show what actually happened , which is not exactly bad things , in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story. First i would like to mention two things which i don't liked. 1st - The way the wrestling coach of NATIONAL SPORTS ACADEMY has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train , was wrong. 2nd - there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing. Apart from these two things , everything else is either good or great in the movie. The movie tackle through different themes. Sometimes it tackles them one by one , and sometimes simultaneously. But the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly. For example when we see Mahavir training his daughters rigorously , there comes a thought that, what kind of dad he is. He just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams. But after some scenes on the wedding of Mahavir's daughters' friend both the daughters complaining about Mahavir her friend (who is getting married) reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as Mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person. That particular scene convince the audience that what Mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living. Another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time. Almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches. And those matches were done extremely well on technical level , and hook you like you were watching a real match. I mean as compared to this the matches show in SULTAN were just nothing. Among the performances ZAIRA WASIM (also the lead actor of Amir's next SECRET SUPERSTAR) playing Young GEETA was delight to watch. The scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking. And she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that ZAIRA was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training. But when it comes to fight scenes , FATIMA SANA SHEIK as the older Geeta was best. She fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen. On her dramatic acting front she was awesome too. Both the actresses who played young and old Babita were good too , but got less screen time as compared to Geeta's character. Aparshakti Khurana(brother of Ayushman Khurana) as the nephew of Mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy , and surly will make you laugh many time. But for Amir Khan , what to say , he blends so nicely , that he became MAHAVIR , and the actor Amir is nowhere visible anywhere. He just makes me wonder why cant other actors (yes pointing at SRK and SALLU) stop-showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies . Around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening , that i was not able to here the dialogues many times. But just before climax , the NATIONAL ANTHEM runs in common wealth games after GEETA PHOGAT won her gold medal(i hope that's not a spoiler) and the whole theater stands in respect of NATIONAL ANTHEM you just cant help and get OVERWHELMED. 9.4/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","I got the privilege to watch this film earlier than the India release as I happen to live in North America. Thank you Disney! Now, what to say about 'Dangal'? It's not a typical Bollywood film, yet it is easily the best Bollywood film ever, even in terms of every, so called, Bollywood masala trick. The incredible storytelling, based on true events, every small detailing, amazing cast, the message it had without being preachy or pretentious but still powerful-there was not one single boring moment in the movie-well, probably one, if you are too picky!,though it is nearly three hours! Kudos to the director! And what to say about Aamir khan? Though he did not have any dramatic moment in the movie (those belong to the girls, who were fabulous by the way), he is not the charming usual boy next door, sexy or cheeky person(the traits which are generally associated with Aamir Khan); rather he is a brute, has a tummy for the majority length of the movie-yet you will not be able to keep him off your mind, even after the movie ends, and easily the best Aamir khan performance ever (and yes, I have seen every Aamir khan film, each a million time)."

"SAMTHEBESTEST","8","15","27","23 December 2016"," Another Classic from Aamir but this time a Tribute to Mr. Phogat
","DANGAL REVIEW :- ""Dear Sam, remember the day 23 Dec 2016 when you watched Best Film ever made on Wrestling."" This is what my heart said to me after the very first sec i finished watching Dangal. Without wasting time let me elaborate my views about Film. <br/><br/>Acting - Aamir Khan does excellent Job, not the Best of the year but surely in top 5. Never saw Fatima before but she was the Best among star cast. Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra got limited screen space and gave their Best. Supporting Starcast is good too.<br/><br/>Writing - Excellent ! I Don't except better story/writing than this for any Wrestling based film (It was expected due to Biopic Thing).<br/><br/>Screenplay - Notable ! It really keeps you hook from the first frame to the last, especially in last 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Music - Good but not the Best. Reason is, expectations from Pritam are always high. Not a single Filmy Song, every song is situational so Video Songs looks better than Audio. Background Score is Awesome, helps film in emotional scenes.<br/><br/>Cinematography - Average ! Its good actually but Nothing impressive except those Fight sequences. Some scenes are pacy and some are Slow, overall Average. <br/><br/>Direction - Nitesh Tiwari at his Best. He has succeeded in Whatever he wanted to present to audience. He is The real master behind this Classic, with any other director it would have become typical Filmy movie but Nitesh kept it strictly as an Art Film which is needful for Biopic like this. In some scenes he loses it, few scenes are too filmy but receives Claps and Whistles so i must say he wanted to keep it Classy but forcefully added some Massy scenes. Will meet him soon and thank him for giving us Classic Called Dangal.<br/><br/>Final Words - Dangal is not a Commercial film like PK and 3 Idiots i mean some Massy elements and comedy is missing which is needed for high Repeat Value so i believe this film won't get that High level success which these films got. It is less in Quality compared to Epic Taare Zameen par and less Commercially compared to PK, it misses the Masterpiece Tag just because of few scenes and minuses but it is another 'Classic' by genius called Aamir Khan. He gave 2 years for the film and it worths. Film has many Goosebumps and Emotional moments which you will remember even after leaving theater. It worths your money, it is Best Film of the year among all High Budget Film released so far, i recommend don't miss this film. And last thing don't even think to compare it with Sultan cause it will be like comparing Sachin Tendulkar with Murali Vijay. 8/10* stars by me. And last but not the Least 'A Grand Salute' to the 'Mahavir Phogat and his Family'. True Heroes like him needs to be recognised for their Hardwork in our Country."
"i-33712","9","12","21","20 May 2017"," Best wrestling movie ever
","It is a big step for India to produce such a movie to show discrimination against women.Even the father didn't follow the mind of his daughters, he still did something to free women from being limited by outdated conventions although he did things out of love for wrestling.I agree with the father's behavior like his daughters because I grew up in such a circumstance(not such a family).In Asia, we respect our eldership and follow their instructions.I didn't get bored during the whole movie because of its good pace.Wrestling is not really interesting to me in real life.But the sequences of wrestling scenes in the movie fascinated me a lot and they aren't repetitive at all.Aamir Khan is a great actor which you can see from his different shapes in this movie.In summary, it is a good movie that you shouldn't miss in theaters.I am practicing my English by writing movie comments.Thank you for tolerating my terrible grammar."

"sriramanadvocate","8","5","7","26 December 2016"," Dangal is Sincere in narration, Perfect in detailing, True in spirit, Patriotic and Inspiring at its core.
","Aamir Khan is back to the big screen after two years. Many people from the industry had been dropping tweets at various times raving the project increasing the whiff of expectations and then came the physical transformation & trailer videos heightening the anticipation. Based on real events and characters, rarely do films excel on all departments propelling them into a league of their own. Dangal is one such achievement.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Setu Sriram needs to be applauded for very consistent and non ambiguous presentation of the subject. The rustic, rural Haryana and the commonwealth games portions are lit in tune with the tone of the film. The wrestling scenes, the angles used to capture them are perfect and the research that has gone into it is clearly visible on the screen. Editor Ballu Saluja has also cut this screenplay perfectly working in tandem with the cinematographer, aids hugely in the neat presentation of this motion picture. Sports films in general, especially ones which are very detailed like Dangal requires clarity to keep the audience engaged and on that count the Editor has done an extraordinary job. Even though the running time was around 2 hours 40 minutes, the all frames and scenes were fully justified with the narrative structure and expertly edited.<br/><br/>The stunt choreography in this movie is noteworthy and one of the best to come out of the country. Kripa Shankar Patel and Shyam Kaushal act has huge pillars for the movie and again the research, detailing of the wrestling sequences and the references from the original footage go a long way in making this the best choreographed sports film from India. Music from Pritam ably supported the film with the theme song being the stand out. The songs were never too long or distracting and the background score underlined the tension and drama of the story. Few moments of silence are noteworthy.<br/><br/>The story based on the life of Mahavir Singh Phogat adapted and written for screen by the team of Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain & Nikhil Meharotra. The sincerity in writing and detailing was evident throughout which has become a rarity in Indian Cinema nowadays and the writing was simple, realistic, effective and highly impactful. The dialogues also stood out as there was no over dramatization attached to it and criticism against institutions were conveyed seamlessly. The rules and technicalities involved in wrestling were explained in depth without being distractive and that keeps the audience glued to the screen. Director Nitesh Tiwari in his third directorial venture has achieved perfection in storytelling and the screenplay was handled like a bullet moving towards the marked target without any distractions whatsoever.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie are some of the best to come out of Indian Cinema in recent times led by Aamir Khan. The believability, the majestic presence and at the same time, feeling of longing, of relentless determination, emotional sincerity he brought to Mahavir Singh is quite extraordinary. The Star always took the back seat making headway for the story and the character. A benchmark indeed. All the physical strains and transformation added immensely to the movie. The two kids playing the younger version of the wrestlers Geetha and Babita looked at ease in their roles as if they had tons of experience. The adult version of the wrestlers played by Fatima Sana Sheik and Sanya Malhotra showcased holistic understanding of the character, emotions. Especially Fathima was extraordinary and the strains, rigorous training undertaken for providing an authentic wrestling performance deserves a standing ovation.<br/><br/>The fact that when the national anthem was played twice (once before the start of the film and again during the movie), the audience were asked to stand during the former yet during the latter, they stood on their own, speaks volumes of the enduring nature of the movie. A monumental achievement for sports based films from India. Dangal is one of the best movies of the year and a must watch with the family. Dangal is Sincere in narration, Perfect in detailing, True in spirit, Patriotic and Inspiring at its core."

I watched this movie two times, and this thing has been observed that during the climax scene the National Anthem was played but not all audiences respond to that by paying respect. Anyhow I would recommend this movie to everyone to watch this movie and understand the concept. Movies are made for social message and for some untold stories which people must understand. Watch this with friends & family members (WITHOUT ANY DOUBT). Personally, my dad was too coach for me but I couldn't fulfil his dreams. Don't compare DANGAL with SULTAN. Watch for Haanikarak Bapu, Dhaakad, Naina & Title track (SONGS). One more blockbuster in the bag for Aamir Khan. Please stop piracy and encourage the movie's entire cast by watching in theatres."
"debitaradutta","10","5","7","25 December 2016"," One among the Best Indian films
","Very rare one would come across a film that leaves a lasting impression. That not only entertains but also empowers. A film that compels each & every person in theatre for a standing ovation. Dangal is one of its kind film. While watching this awe-inspiring film I cried, laughed, cheered & became spellbound. Based on an incredible real life story of Mahavir Singh Phogat & his daughters Dangal strikes a Gold. It outshines in every department of film making. From very first scene Dangal stays focused to its story thus helping viewers attention remain clinged to the essential theme of the film; i.e Wrestling.The opening credit is a spectacular ode to the game with the close- up shots of the Wrestlers in Akhadas. Daler Mehandi's thundering voice from the background added more to its brilliance. The strength of Dangal lies in its treatment of storytelling. It never glorifies any of its characters unnecessarily. We are introduced to a gloomy faced Aamir Khan with unfulfilled aspirations and then succumbed to circumstances forcing him to take up a Govt job.No extravagant entry scene. From this very point you know that you are seeing the National Champion Mahavir Singh Phogat, not the superstar Aamir Khan. The actor as we know him, never fails to amaze us. He did not actually play the character. He lived it. A performance of life time. I believe if this film was made in Hollywood, Aamir Khan would surely be given an Oscar. Though we are quite familiar with Aamir's style of method acting but the other cast of the films have equally given a stupendous performance. Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra, Suhani Bhatnagar, Zahra Wasim, Apashakti Khurana, Sakshi Tanwar everyone acted convincingly maintaining the authenticity in accent, body language & dialogue delivery. The girls in lead really worked hard. Their commitment & dedication was clearly visible in the wrestling scenes. Not for a single moment they made us feel that they are not professional wrestlers. Dangal is also an eye-opener for biopic film makers in India. Previously I have seen in Mary Kom,Priyanka Chopra acted the whole film without knowing properly how to punch! This is where lies the difference. Dangal also soars high as a matured sports film. Never before any Bollywood films has shown the sports technicalities in minute details. Dangal is a winner all the way. Kudos to director Nitesh Tiwari. It takes immense courage & strong vision to helm such a project. And once again credits to the Santa Claus of Indian cinema- Aamir Khan for being the flag-bearer of 'Meaningful Entertainment' & gifting us the most wonderful cinematic experiences. Dangal is definitely one of the best films ever made."

","I am a big fan of Aamir Khan and I watch all his movies. Aamir sets a high expectation bar for his movies in all departments. Dangal also had a high bar to climb and it did so with aplomb. Aamir chose a great subject of encouragement for female wrestlers in India. Against all odds Mahavir Singh Phogat decides to train his daughters in wrestling to win a gold medal for India. Movie's casting was excellent with all actors doing so well in their characters. Aamir was great as usual but I was really impressed by how well the four girls did as growing wrestlers. They were strong and they were agile and they owned the court they were in. I am sure there were some technical help provided in shooting all those wrestling scenes but you will not be able to tell that while watching the movie. Their scenes were authentic and you were rooting for them as they were gritting their teeth and fighting tooth and nail to defeat their opponents. Dialog delivery in Haryanvi was on the money and you really will come out thinking that these actors speak that way everyday. I am not going to provide any spoiler but will just say that this is a movie to watch. It is a shame that release of such a beautiful movie had to be delayed by more than a year because of political fear."
"nandidot","10","5","7","25 December 2016"," Inspiring and original, the year's best film
","An Aamir Khan film is special. It's an event that happens once every two years or once a year if we're lucky. We've come to expect excellence from a man who can go from playing a college student to an alien to now an aging overweight former wrestler with such pure passion and dedication that you're left wondering if there's anything Mr. Khan can't dobut we already know the answer to that question. He pours his blood and sweat into each project and I truly believe that no other individual in the Indian film industry understands the pulse of their audience as well as Aamir does. He graces our screens rarely but the wait is worth it. We think we've seen the year's best film and here comes Aamir with a bang!<br/><br/>Dangal is a remarkable movie. It's inspiring, emotional, and very entertaining. It's based on the extraordinary true story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, a man determined to win a gold medal in wrestling. When his dreams don't bear fruit he hopes his son will do what he couldn't but fate has something else planned for the father of four daughters. Mahavir realizes that his (and society's) mindset needs a drastic switch and transfers all his energy and efforts into training his two daughters, Geeta and Babita. Nothing and no one can come between him and his ambition. He is relentless and focused to a fault which, to be fair, is needed to achieve greatness. You have to be a little mad to live your passion. The film makes many such points very well. You're only crazy until you're first to cross the finish line and the spectators cheer. We want it all but few of us are willing to put in the hard work it actually takes to win. Not many sports based films are as real as Dangal. You feel each aching muscle and nothing comes easy. Defeat is heartbreaking and victory is earned.<br/><br/>More than anything, the movie is about family and relationships. There's a father who gives everything he has to make his daughters succeed, a concerned and strong mother in the background, and daughters who are confused and resentful until they realize what they can achieve. Each character is beautifully fleshed out and finds strong connect with the audience. The casting director has outdone himself, everyone looks and plays their part with utmost conviction. It's hard to say if the young Geeta and Babita are better portrayed by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar or if Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra do more justice to their roles as the older Geeta and Babita. Aparshakti Khurana plays the girls' cousin and reluctant sparring partner in some of the films' funniest and most heartwarming scenes. The bond that the entire family shares brings a genuine smile to your face. Sakshi Tanwar infuses quiet strength in Daya Kaur, the mother and wife who makes the decision to watch her daughters weep, struggle and, eventually triumph. Aamir is the only well known actor in this team and he is so consumed by the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat that you realize that you're watching Aamir the actor not Aamir the superstar. You make method acting look good, Mr. Khan.<br/><br/>Four writers are credited for writing the movie that was two years in the making. The attention to detail shows, not a scene or emotion is out of place. Several instances stay in your mind after the final reels play, the most notable of those being: when the little girls' hair is mercilessly cut off and you don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for them, when Geeta literally takes down her father and later calls to apologize, and every time one of the girls enters the ring to wrestle. The music and background score are smoothly blended into the screenplay, time isn't set aside to play a song but when they come up you appreciate them as your senses are heightened. Director Nitesh Tiwari has worked tirelessly to come up with a movie that captivates moviegoers. It's a colorful journey that never strays from the plot and at no point becomes boring or slow. Mission accomplished!<br/><br/>Dangal is refreshingly feminist without being a movie about feminism. That in itself deserves a standing ovation. There's talk about the differences between sons and daughtersboys and girls but it soon morphs into a film about athletes. Gender isn't used as a crutch nor is girl power shoved down your throat. At no point is the fact that the main characters are girls irrelevant nor should it be because going against the grain and succeeding should always be celebrated. Dangal is one of those rare films that surpasses its own aspirations. Take a bow, team Dangal, you're worthy of all the praise coming your way."

","Dangal is a film based on real life biography of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two daughters, though you will nowhere feel like you are watching a film on a big screen. The emotions portrayed so well and the bonding connect with the audience so perfectly that it feels like it actually was a story of the same man on the screen(Aamir Khan) and his daughters(reel life actresses). All credits to the great director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari. I must tell it is not really a masala movie like the Bollywood industry usually offers, but a 'flicky roller-coaster' having ups and downs during different chapters of life. And moreover, the last half an hour of the movie is just gonna leave you in a nail- biting situation and if you watch it in theaters then you surely gonna get many chills and be making unwanted movements on your seats.

","If you think Dangal is another textbook biography flick, I reckon you will be surprised with the entire flick from head to the toe. Dangal is a masterpiece and well-directed movie. Nearly perfect story line, without any doubt. Every cast played their roles naturally, especially Aamir Khan. I have watched an array of his previous movies but Dangal demonstrates his masterclass. In addition, credit should be given to all of the casts for the eminent acting. Granted, there are no typical love scenes, no unnecessary scenes and no visible technical non-senses. The time line was crystal clear. At 160 minutes, this film is fairly long. However, the background music and soundtracks were absolute stellar to uplift the ambiance of this movie. Overall, this flick is such an inspirational and elevating especially to drive our motivation to clinch the success. Highly recommended."
"jagesara","10","8","13","24 December 2016"," review film Dangal by AJ
","Review by AJ. In cinemas now: ""DANGAL"" MUST SEE, at least 2 or 3 times ! One of the most beautiful and bold films made by one of the jewels of India, mr Aamir Khan. It's such a loving and touching film about making a dream come true. To endure hardships and pain, to hold on to the trust, faith and innerstrength. Especially for women, not only in India, but all over the world, there's more to Life than the responsibility of the kitchen & family. Women have so much potential, if every woman would live her dream and exploit her own talents, can you imagine how fast forward this world would become. It's not about competing with men, or slaying them. It's about the real power women possess. What they can give to the world. And second it's about the delicate (and strong at the same time), the father-daughter relationship, the tears, the love, the hard life-lessons, seeking his approval, trying to say sorry when pride gets in the way (such a heartbreaking scene). I promise you, your tears will come straight from the heart, cause every girl has gone through this moment in her Life.. It has such an impact on the thoughts of men and women. There is no doubt anymore. It is proved, a woman can achieve what she wants, so no more excuses. But you have to be ready to go beyond the boundaries, conquer your fears, confront yourself, accept your weakness, be greedy enough to taste the victory. You want it so bad, you are willing to give up what you cherish most about yourself. But more important you must be able to distinguish what is good for you and what is bad. Cause pride can make you do things that are horrid to your character, it is not you and it is no part of your dream. But it is the lesson you have to learn on the path to becoming the champion. Becoming the winner you already are. To become a wrestler, one has to be stripped down from all thoughts one has had till now. And learn from a different source of knowledge and that's where the powerful father also guru steps in. He can mould her, but she has to do the job. It's not easy to get up at 5 am and go jogging in the fields, but if you are focused you will do it. If it means you can't eat all the sweet and tasty meals you used to eat, you will make the decision to not eat them. There's the difference, no compromise, it's just a yes or no, that simple, cause that will make you the winner. Some people are meant to be great, they work harder than anyone else. To make his dream come true, the father, Mahavir (even his name is great) changed his mindset. Men and women are equal, that's what he believed (unlike a lot of other people). He's a man who is a true man from the core. His respect for Life, for his parents, for his medal, for his lovely family, it's so grand. His daughters are his pride and strength. And if he says something, you can bet it will touch your heart and mind. He's so powerful without being rude or disrespectful. He's the ultimate teacher ! And he is right about the fact that sport in India has no support from the government. Cause if they would create a department for sports only, can you imagine how many medals India would win in all those world-competitions. So many talents are wasted as we speak, sporters settle down for a job, cause they have to eat, one can't eat a medal. The fight-scenes are exquisite in quality, you can actually hear and feel bones being cracked and crushed, muscles being tightened and bodies being slammed to the ground. It's Shakti-power all over the place. The songs are heartwarming and daring, it's tough to be a girl in a man's world and have the heart of a Lion, be strong as a bear and sharp as an eagle. Thank you Aamir Khan, once again, in making this world a better place, showing us the path to positivity and progress !"

","When going for a movie its customary to check the run time. If its more than 2 hours, it is expected to have some intimate moments with your mobile, during the movie. that's the kind of quality we have in movies these days. There is only one moment during the 161 min run time of this movie, when you take out your mobile from your pocket to check your messages & missed calls, that is the interval.and most likely you will do that with blurry eyes. There are good movies, there are excellent movies and then there are movies that leave you speechless. you don't know what part of movie to praise.Every element is so perfectly woven together. This movie is an encounter of the third kind. No matter what kind of movie goer you are, you will love it."

You become so integrated with what's happening that you start living every moment, every character. You feel invested in the motivations and its outcomes.<br/><br/>I don't know if Dangal is the best sports movie India has ever produced but it's right up there; and then it's so much more than that. It's not an Aamir Khan movie. In fact, Aamir Khan isn't there in the movie; instead there's a character named Mahavir Singh Phogat who is obsessive about winning International fame for his country. And then there are his daughters: to whom the movie belongs. No one could have played the characters better than what you see on screen.<br/><br/>For once, the Supreme Court order wont cross your mind while standing up for the National Anthem at the cinemas; you will do it because you feel like a proud Indian at the end."

First half was too good and is enthralling, however after intermission you could feel like there were one or two odd pieces where the direction was not that good and 'bollywood' dramatization also ruled few scenes. <br/><br/>Overall movie is great and with the voices of Daler Mehendi in title track make it inspiring and a must watch."

Beyond all the filmatic Bollywood elements Dangal is a Revelation to be reflected upon!! The competitive aspects of wrestling and its strategies are well depicted in the movie.

It has all the necessary elements of entertainment, humour, action, thrill in complete balance. The characters' struggle to fulfil the big dream is praiseworthy and the makers of Dangal portrayed it on celluloid in the most entertaining manner. <br/><br/>Based on the life of ace wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two daughters – Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari – Dangal shows the emotional and physical struggle that the two girls went through to fulfil their father's biggest dream. Although the movie is very emotionally driven, it is well mixed with a good amount of humour and entertainment.<br/><br/>To conclude Dangal is a movie that will make you laugh, then will make you cry and in the end, will make you blow whistles in the theatre.

"binducherungath","10","7","11","23 December 2016"," Dangal, a sports biopic, is a powerful, inspirational and incredible story of women empowerment.
","Dangal (means a Wrestling Competition), a biopic on Phogat Sisters Geeta and Babita and their father Mahavir Singh Phogat, by Nitesh Tiwari is a triumph over odds. Geeta made history by being the first Indian female wrestler to win the Gold medal (55kg) and Babita won Silver medal (51 Kg) in 2010 Commonwealth games. Offlate, Bollywood has certainly made a few very good sports biopics viz. Chake de, Bhag Milkha Bhag, Mary Kom, M.S. Dhoni etc. Most of them have done justice to the players and their lives. It is true that films about real heroes can become predictable. The story telling needs to be authentic too without misconstruing the essence. And that is where Dangal scores like anything. It is unadulterated, and remains true to the core. <br/><br/>Dangal focuses on a father and his perseverance, persistence and eccentricities to fulfill his dream of fetching gold for the country through daughters. Under the umbrella of this main plot, the film tries to create awareness about so many pertinent issues. The film not only talks about the fight which one has to do in the real Dangal but also about the fight which one has to do against the mindset of people viz. certain games and sports defined as a taboo for girls by the society, the thought that girls are born just to get married, raise children and do household chores etc. The fight is also against the scarcity of resources, the lack of infrastructure support for the sports people especially sports like wrestling. One can instantly connect with the father who has deleted 'impossible' from his dictionary. One can also very well connect with the girls who just want to enjoy the bliss of being children and dressing up like girls, find their father to be overbearing, and their transformation to achieve what their father dreamt for them. The end is indeed predictable since we all know about Phogat sisters and their achievement but Dangal brings to us their journey which is simply incredible, inspiring and awesome. The best part of the film is its tone which is kept very much real, authentic and light. There are moments of humour too.<br/><br/>Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a National Level Wrestling Champion who had to make a choice in his life and leave wrestling. But his passion and love for the sport never died. He used to enjoy all the fights in the local Dangal and always felt nostalgic of his wrestling days looking at the medals and certificates he had won. He is hopeful of living his dream through his to-be-born son. He gets disappointed every time when his wife Daya Shobha Kaur (Sakshi Tanwar) delivers a baby girl instead of a boy. He is definitely unlike those fathers who disown their girl children. Mahavir loved his girls but was just disillusioned about how to fulfill his dream of fetching gold for the country without having a son. But the day he realizes that his girls Geeta (Zaira Wasim -young Geeta), and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar - Young Babita), have the potential to be wrestlers, he decides to go against the societal norms, fights all odds to train his girls. This is where the incredible journey of Phogat sisters begins. <br/><br/>Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat is terrific. It is one of his best performances, which would be remembered for ever, be it in terms of his physical transformation, his dictatorial approach with girls, his determination, never-to-quit attitude, being a possibilist as a path finder; he excels in every frame.<br/><br/>Sakshi as Mahavir's wife Daya Shobha Kaur has given such a powerful and natural performance. She has fewer dialogues, but she speaks through her eyes and facial expressions. She plays perfect bridge between her unyielding husband and daughters.<br/><br/>Phogat sisters are real discoveries be it the younger versions of Geeta and Babita (Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar) or their grown up versions (Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra). They are so much convincing. Zaira and Suhani are adorable. Fatima and Sanya are also very good. They have played their roles with so much of conviction.<br/><br/>Another character which needs special mention is that of Omkar, nephew of Mahavir Singh Phogat. Ritwik Sahore (Ferrari Ki Sawari fame) has played his role very well. Aparshakti Khurrana (brother of Ayushman Khurana) plays the role of grown up nephew, he has less screen time, but he has made his presence felt. He narrates the story in typical Haryanvi accent. His scenes generate humour.<br/><br/>Girish Kulkarni as coach in National Sports Academy has done justice to his role.<br/><br/>The songs go with the flow of the film. Pritam's music clubbed with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya is great. The lyrics are in absolute sync with the story. <br/><br/>Dangal would certainly touch your hearts. I failed miserably in letting the tears come out of my eyes at many occasions, be it father- daughter relationship, their triumph over all odds, attitude to remain positive even amidst challenges. Felt like jumping out of chair and cheer their every victory on and off Dangal. Got goosebumps when the National Anthem is played along with the tricolor in the air. Many scenes have stayed with me.<br/><br/>Dangal, a sports biopic, is a powerful, inspirational and incredible story of women empowerment. It not only talks about the fight Mahavir Phogat and his daughters Geeta and Babita had to do in the real Dangal but also about the fight which they had to do against the mindset of the people, patriarchic society, scarcity of resources etc. A must watch film."

","Yes, Indian films are a breed of their own, but ranking the film as high as top 250 all time - better than Vertigo for instance - is pure ridicule.<br/><br/>The drama follows the Rocky saga, after difficulties a winner emerges. There is nothing new to the genre, there is nothing surprising and it is all so predictable from the very beginning. The acting is usual childish Indian - good, but yet the storyline is so thin...<br/><br/>...there a honestly better Indian films (like Wednesday or 3 idiots) where the story line is more unique - and includes better music with the ever beloved Indian dance scenes.<br/><br/>I wish IMDb would introduce a regional voting - keeping these films out of Top 250."

","What a staunch paunch and what a strong punch!?!? That's what Dangal is. Simple, true, gritty, raw, real and determined.<br/><br/>Before coming to the name under whose name the film opens, let's first salute the actual person on who this is based on. Hats off Mr Phogat for being such an awesome person and father. Someone who saw the germ of gems within the girl child and didn't live in the fiefdom of monomania<br/><br/>The portrayals by each character that adorned the screen were meaningful and said it all. Even the eye movements and glances from Sakshi Tanwar replaced the unwarranted dialogue that would have taken its place. <br/><br/>All four girls depicting geeta and babita in both age brackets have done a tremendous job considering that they were untrained and this is not just one chick flick wherein just emotions would help them carry off a portrayal. This required both the mental as well as the physical strength and stamina and very importantly perseverance. In the earlier years Zaira took the cake, ate it as well as relished it in her depiction. <br/><br/>We have all by now seen KWK and heard the story of how Fatima and Sanya hid their injuries to be a part of the project and not be replaced. That's good learning in the art of method acting and what a good tutelage they have had. They are truly blessed to have a mentor in the form of the one and only Amir Khan. <br/><br/>And what do you say about him - Maestro's best performance yet. It's truly worth the wait for an Amir film as when he comes he ensures that you are witness to the best that the world has to offer. He has taken the form of acting to a different level. The kusti between him and his daughter were specially telling. It spoke reams of each of their insecurities, their wants and aspirations. <br/><br/>They say a picture says a thousand words, well this one just spoke an omnibus."

Aamir was outstanding in his role as Mahavir Singh Phogat. The girls (both in young ages and when grown up) were good in their performances.

If you are movie goer like me, it is high time that you go line up in a theater near you and watch #DANGAL. Now a day amidst nudity, cheapness and useless love stories very rare to see people clap for a movie, that too in the US it is never easy to get the audience to clap. You will be thrilled to take the journey with Amir as a father. you will be on the edge of your seat for many scenes. you will come out of the theater inspired.

"heartbeats123","6","36","80","28 December 2016"," labeled Based on a True Story but simply Fictionalized
","This movie proves that India is not yet ready for an honest biopic film. Although the film excelled in every other aspects such as acting, cinematography, special effects, music; especially MUSIC, But it couldn't capture the real aspect of the story of the wrestlers daughter and her sisters. We never get to know her enthusiasm towards wrestling. Was it her relationship with her father who imposed his dream of winning a gold on her? or her duty towards her nation to win it? or was it her own desire to never give up or lose to a competitive opposition to satisfy her own ego?<br/><br/>This film was heavily clichéd just for the purpose of entertaining the masses and clearly may have aggravated many characters who are related to this story. TOO much HYPE may have given this movie the attention that it pursued, and why not? this is business after all.<br/><br/>Much disappointed with the makers of the film for adulterating such an awesome script which may have had made everybody proud. Current IMDb score :9.2 with over 13k users. Where have we gone wrong?<br/><br/>Final verdict: Its a good watch, but one wouldn't rate this movie 9/10 unless he/she had any personal attachment towards the film. it has good social message/dialogues.

","This is a MUST WATCH film. Deeply entertaining, Dangal manages to do what few other Bollywood movies have ever accomplished: move and inspire the audience. A beautiful true story with themes of family legacy, gender dynamics and expectations, courage, and the state of Indian sports - all of which are seamlessly sewn together in a film that, though almost 3 hours long, keeps you glued to your seat from beginning to end. Aamir Khan is excellent, but Dangal's highest triumph lies in the power and grit of the young actresses portraying Geeta and Babita, as well as their older counterparts (especially Fatima Sana Shaikh, who steals the show with her raw beauty and strength). The wrestling scenes are realistic and flawless, containing some of the best editing I've ever seen in a sports film."

","After watching Sultan, I was repelled with any more Haryanwi style movies going forward. I don't know if its lack of entertainment availability or have people completely lost their minds to enjoy the Sultan buffoonery. I saw the trailer for Dangal and decided I'm not going to watch this movie. Just last week, I saw a 30 second trailer where Mr. Aamir Khan's character has a dialogue with his office colleague while watching a wrestling match. And that included Mr. Aamir slamming a man twice his size on the floor with perfect form. I knew I had to watch this movie and erase the negative mindset that had been created because of Sultan the clown. Nonsense.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Mr. Aamir Khan has trained for 8-10 months for wrestling and went through a huge transformation from being fit to fat for 90% portion of the film and then trained for 5 months to go from fat to fit to work on the initial portion of the movie that is only for 5-7 minutes in duration. He really got into the skin of the character.<br/><br/>The man needs no words to describe his dedication and passion for film making. But this movie is not just about him. It's also about his two daughters. They've trained for 8-10 months with wrestling their body language is extremely professional and their Dangal scenes will blow your mind! The training they've gone through for the wrestling and the way the story has been shown will leave you speechless. Mr. Aamir Khan has put everyone on this project through hell, after all you don't create a masterpiece by rubbing your nose with your thumb at every instance and pretending a fake American nasal accent. <br/><br/>Dangal is a masterpiece, there is no doubt about it. The trailers give away the story, so there is nothing mysterious about it. What's amazing is the way it has been put together. It is a linear movie, no flashbacks (except the initial portion) and they keep it very short to get started with the subject of wrestling. There are a few scenes that will absolutely choke you, the phone call scene between father and daughter, no dialogue, just expressions and they understand each other's tears over the phone, freaking brilliant! Another one is the wrestling scene between father and daughter. Mr. Aamir Khan's expressions, body language, marvelous! The younger portion played by the girls is amazing and so are the actors playing the grown up portions. The bhatija character is amazingly funny and perfect comedy timing. Not loud or obnoxious, just perfect!<br/><br/>The movie is an experience and some jokers are comparing it to Sultan. Please don't be so over-smart, we know you saw the common factor Wrestling and just to look over-smart, compare it to another wrestling movie. Please don't show your intelligence by making such ridiculous statements, please think before you talk. The only commonality between Dangal and Sultan is the Sport Wrestling. Comparing them to each other is like saying every moochwala is Anil Kapoor. Stop looking for comparisons and save yourself a ton of embarrassment. <br/><br/>The movie has brilliance written all over, flawless, all heart and entertaining. The undertones and sarcasm are minimal with humor associated without digressing into any other topic.<br/><br/>This one is truly the best Sports Film to come from India and will definitely make it to the Oscars just like Lagaan did years back. The sincerity with Dangal from every actor in the movie brings the experience to a whole new level. Mr. Aamir Khan has raised the bar, not just for the Indian Film Industry, but also for cinemas worldwide.<br/><br/>This one is definitely amongst Mr. Aamir Khan's top 5 list (Jo Jeeta Wo Sikander, Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Lagaan, Dangal). Mr. Aamir Khan releases a movie towards the end of the year and sweeps every other movie off the floor, similar to a wrestling move, dhobi pachaad style. Do not miss this one!"

","First off - this is not just another movie that showcases an athlete's struggle. It shows the Indian society's struggle. i.e. - How women are not considered equal in many of the domains. - The dilemma of an average student where formal education and parental/informal education have different approaches. - How emotional bonds have a strong role to play in any success. <br/><br/>The movie is not just motivational but also realistic. Despite these struggles, if a female athlete from India becomes victorious it only conforms the statement that where there is a will there is a way! And, true passion & parental support goes a long way in bringing out the best in a child!<br/><br/>Last but not the least the cinematography is awesome, and everybody's performance is very much up to the mark!

","#DANGAL review (No spoilers) The best thing about DANGAL is that there is no Aamir Khan- the superstar in the entire movie. There is just Mahavir Singh Phogat and his family. Their day to day struggles and their small triumphs ultimately leading to gold. It's a story of wrestling, of family, of emotions and basically everything which a person pursuing sports other than cricket experiences in India. It is also a deeply inspiring story of feminism. Geeta does what Aarfa Khan in Sultan couldn't. Aamir does what Salman couldn't- bring a character to life without the use of VFX. His character has many layers throughout the film. Was it his best performance till date? Well, we say that every alternate December. But like Virat Kohli, Aamir keeps scaling new heights in his every new innings.. <br/><br/>A special mention of Daler Mehendi whose energetic rendition of title song which keeps giving you an adrenaline rush. Watch it for pure cinematic brilliance. For the amazing dedication of actors Zaira Wasim and Fatima Sana Shaikh who play the younger and grown up Geeta in the movie respectively. Their wrestling scenes are unimaginably real and goosebumps inducing. <br/><br/>And yea, if you can also stand up for the national anthem."

"sahusatyajit-69570","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Yet another classic from Mr Perfectionist's stable
","Along with some of the greatest sports movies ever made in Bollywood, Dangal will probably be amongst the top 3 or top 5. Chak De India, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (yet another Aamir Khan movie), Bhaag Milkha Bhaag maybe few more that comes to mind. One of the brilliant facts about the movie gotta be its casting. Almost entire starcast is unheard of. Yet everyone have given such an amazing performance! Again, it maybe easier to find another actor who can dance and sing around. But not easy to find someone who can wrestle like an International athlete. I maybe biased for Aamir's best work being Taare Zameen Par, but this certainly comes close. The transformation of a National level wrestler to an aging old father, past his prime, the Haryanvi accent, the gait, everything about Mr Khan is just perfect. Besides, when was the last time you could take your entire family to a movie you were cringing at certain scenes, maybe some scenes were too violent, or raunchy - this is a movie you could and should take all your children (esp girl children) to watch. It also tends to be patriotic without being preachy. Last word: I wish they make this film tax-free. Everyone, esp all children and parents should watch this."
"adityaupadhyay1","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Dangal: A fresh air in the era of melodramatic sportsmen biopic
","""Dangal"" is the kind of movie,you would think will border on jingoism on match winning moments or the constant cribbing about sports system in India. But it's more than that. In a nutshell the story revolves around the journey of Mahavir Singh Phogat(Aamir Khan) and his wrestler daughters who want to win Gold medal for India in International Competitions. <br/><br/>The film started with the narration from Phogat sisters' cousin who explains the life and journey of Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he raised his daughters. Aamir Khan as the protagonist has looked confident in the character of Mahavir and got him effortlessly into the skin of the character. He carried the film on his strong shoulders. At the same time he allowed other actors to shine in their parts. But brilliant actors like Aamir Khan easily overshadow others with their élan. This movie is not only about wrestling but it's a lot more than that. It is about a father who is ready to take on the world to make his daughters something worth in the eyes of society. It is about a father who is ready to do anything for his daughters. This does not stop him from being punitive on them or giving up his job to train his daughters better. A father who is ready to lose everything so his daughters could gain. <br/><br/>A person who shamelessly accepted he wanted a son who could accomplish his dream of winning a gold medal for India which he could not achieve because of lack of support from his family. But he still has the courage to make his daughters wrestle in a male dominated sport in a male dominated society. He wants to make them international level wrestlers. <br/><br/>There is scene where Mahavir who was a national champion lost a bout to his daughter Geeta who returned on a vacation from Patiala from National Sports Academy. Those 2 minutes very well showcases the emotions of a daughter who learned new tricks of the trade wanted to prove her father that what he taught is orthodox and old, the emotions of a father who was experiencing his daughter was moving away from her and going in a wrong path in her career. Those 2 minutes of acting epitomizes Aamir Khan as actor.<br/><br/>There are several scenes like that which engross you throughout the movie. Coming to the acting part Aamir Khan has lead the pack effortlessly, Fatima Sana Sheikh (Geeta Phogat) and Sanya Malhotra(Babita) have acted well in their parts. Sakshi Tanwar (Mahavir's wife) was underused in the movie.She showcased her brilliance in some moment, but the screen time given to her did not do justice to her talent. Only person who could give a slight tussle in acting to Aamir was Girish Kulkarni who played the role of sly and arrogant coach Pramod Kadam. His acting is so good that you would want to hate him. The person who played the cousin of Geeta and Babita has acted well. <br/><br/>A common trait across the best of the movies is their simplicity which touches your heart. This film too will touch your heart and remain in your heart even after leaving the cinema halls. The development of the story is so effortless and has an undertone that it pervades the mind in no time. <br/><br/>Overall a really good movie with good intention and the credit should go to the director Nitesh Tiwari."

"purayatonline","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Its Dangal Dangal.
","ITS DANGAL DANGAL.............<br/><br/>Yet another Christmas and the perfectionist is back with a bang. It is inspiring, it is emotional, it is thrilling and they named it ""DANGAL"".<br/><br/>If you are going to avoid this movie by comparing it with Sultan with a prejudice mind, I must say you are terribly mistaken. Sultan was a mere entertainment while Dangal is a class apart. Amir khan once again proved why he is called as the perfectionist of Btown. His efforts for this move has to be appreciated. We all know what this man is capable of and must say that he deserves the credit for portraying such a role which eventually concentrates on the female characters as the movie progresses. That shows how passionate he is about this art called cinema. His transformation from the macho man to old age fatty human was absolutely magical but the same time his eyes had the same intensity all the way long.<br/><br/>Coming to the caste, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar as the young Geeta and Babitha were absolutely flawless and charming. For me they were the Pick of the caste considering their age and experience, while Fatima and Sanya were there pretty closely with their outstanding performance. Supporting casts comprises of Sakshi Tanwar, Rohit, Gurish Kulkarni and others did a pretty decent job that even their comparatively small roles made the movie much more engaging.<br/><br/>Music by Pritam Chakraborthy have already made big buss in the market and I believe that this definitely there as his one of the bests. DOP and Editing were top notch and editing deserves a special mention for making the movie thrilling. It is pretty evident that they have done great homework on the script and even a single minute of the was not boring.<br/><br/>The movie tightly slaps on the conventional thinking of society that the women are only intended to live to look after their family and should stay back behind the curtain for specific reasons and the Man Mahavir Singh Rana was their to thrash all those concepts and in the end we could feel the satisfaction he might have had in the real life. Like I said before the movie had many thrilling moments to make you bite your nails. It made my eyes wet at times, It even made me proud when the national anthem sounded in, knowing the facts that its just a movie. The movie starts of with, showing the passion Mahavir Singh has for wrestling from their the half an hour it was Amir show and slowly he handed over the baton to the ladies to perform. I do not want to spoil the experience by detailing the script and moments which made me enthralled. The good thing was the makers did not use their cinematic freedom to exaggerate the things and whatever we saw on the big screen were quite convincing within their limitation of detailing a real life event<br/><br/>Now to the real life Mahavir Singh and Daughters, You people are the true champions, Hats off to your efforts and you people will always be remembered in our hearts. I hope your stories will inspire many others to follow and apparently it will bring many Olympic medals and fame to our country in the coming years.....<br/><br/>I just do not want to rate this movie, Rather a movie I love to call it as an experience. It is indeed a MUST WATCH"
"rushabh-bora","7","4","6","24 December 2016"," A movie worth the hype. Off the beat, still mainstream. Hard-smart work, and it shows.
","These lines from the title track of this movie quite sum up Aamir Khan's work ethic and dedication. I am an ordinary cinema-lover, not a critic. I like to take the things for what they are and not for what they should have been. Now let me come to the point.<br/><br/>Dangal is not just a movie, it's an experience. It does not end with its credits, it stays with you. It makes you laugh with its light humor, it makes you root for the leads presenting the juxtaposition of views in the beginning, its dialogues question your mind. It is said that 'Cinema is reflection of the society.' Well at-least that's what textbooks say. I need not explain the utter disregard in major mainstream cinema of India. But this movie, it creates a difference. It's mainstream because a 'super-star' (as we Indians like to call them) acts in pivotal role, but at its heart its an honest to God attempt to tell something which has been conveniently ignored by our mainstream cinema for quite some time, quite rebellious and off-the beat. <br/><br/>The soundtrack uplifts the already brilliant scenes, the title track 'Dangal Dangal' and Dhaakad give you goose-bumps, whereas 'Naina' leaves you teary-eyed. Nowhere in the movie has a song been put for headlong reasons, every song carries the story forward. Efforts by its actors are 'effortless', whereas the most of the material I have read till now doesn't mention Aparshakti Khurrana, who plays nephew of Aamir Khan, in line with the entire cast, he also deserves a special mention. Boy, he made me laugh with perfectly timed delivery of jokes!<br/><br/>Now, as I have stated, I am no film critic. So obviously, this movie may have its fair(?) share of flaws or its share of beyond comprehension brilliance. My write-up is completely based upon how I felt while watching the film and what stayed in my heart (and hope it stays for a long time) walking out that theater door. <br/><br/>Take a bow, Aamir Khan, Nitesh Tiwari, The Girls, The Boys and Team 'Dangal.' What you've created here is here to be a 'misaal'."
"rajnish9","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Near-perfect multi-layered film crafted into simplicity
","Is this a sports movie, or a movie with a social message or about women empowerment, or about a male's ego to win medal through his daughter even though he himself fails to do it, or its a collage formed with different layers? The 160 min long film relies much on a strong screenplay that transition slowly into the perception of society towards the women, to the determination of Aamir khan to mold them into a world class wrestler and then struggle with the system to eventually end up with the rather predictable ending. The movie main hero is screenplay which keeps binding you with funny nuances, and yet emotional drama and relationship of father and daughter, and people around them. The actors have done their life's top performances. The film may have been perfect if the editing and cinematography have matched to the other department. However, this is smaller flaw compared to the much originality and simplicity that the movie brings."
"tinkubhardwaj","10","4","6","24 December 2016"," We see the blood, sweat and tears that go into the making of champions.
","Dangal is an outright winner - A film that will pin you down and keep you in its grip all the way through. Dangal works on the twin parameters it sets up for itself. One is a straight-forward film about a popular sport and those who play it: we feel and smell the 'mitti' of the 'akhara', the 'daanv-pench' (moves) that truly skilled wrestlers use to face down formidable foes. We see the blood, sweat and tears that go into the making of champions. The actors who play the young Geeta and Babita do a competent job of turning into eager combatants from young-girls-who-just-want-to-have- fun. Dangal sees Aamir Khan as wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trained his daughters Geeta and Babita Phogat who went on to win medals for India in wrestling."
"kapil-t-trivedi","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Fantastic all round performance
","There are very few movies which hit most of the right boxes and I feel like watching again and again. Dangal is surely one of them. Despite being an inspirational sports movies it avoids being preachy or cheesy. Performances by the entire cast is amazingly restrained with no over- the-top dialogues or emotional melodrama. Aamir's transformation for the role is unbelievable, Fatima is a surprise find and is here to stay.<br/><br/>The plot and dialogues are spot-on and hit the right notes. Music and songs are good too.<br/><br/>A must watch movie."
"gishu_pillai","9","4","6","24 December 2016"," Well made movie to shed light on a inspiring real life miracle
","Aamir if you ever read this... Sabaaas!!!<br/><br/>Mr. M Phogat, you are a true inspiration.<br/><br/>Casting was top-notch. Aamir was good as usual. The background score & music enhance the story telling, two thumbs up. The duels are shot well - real nail biters. Like every human being, the protagonist has flaws - the movie downplays it a bit. <br/><br/>Personally, I think Taare Zameen Par was a better movie. Dangal however has better mass appeal and would probably make a helluva lot of more money. Clever script that intertwines the girl child issue, rags to riches, a dash of national integration and patriotism & the apathy to pursuing sports in India.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"rajdoctor","7","17","39","2 January 2017"," Sugar coated Regressive portrayal of feminine gender
","I am aware that many people would not like to read my review. <br/><br/>I have no doubt that the movie viewing experience with its emotional pot-boiler roller coaster ride engages and is a good one, better than the Indian, regional and vernacular soap-opera dished out on Indian television. (That is why I am giving 7 out of 10 rating)<br/><br/>But if a sensitive person looks beyond the cosmetics of movie dazzles – you will find someone is selling a regressive message through this film. Kodus to Dangal team for achieving such a feat. Here is my take..<br/><br/>When the first poster of the movie was released I did not like it. Even though being a wrestler, why four girls should look like boys was the first question I raised.<br/><br/>Now after reading so much appreciation and reviews of the movie I say this:<br/><br/> This is another patriarchal portrayal of regressive India  A father forces his dreams on children. One should never do  Children should be kept free to develop and grow as they want <br/><br/> This is again patriarchy dominance on the feminine gender and forcing it with the power of parenting to subjugate the flourishing of women's gender. <br/><br/> For sure the flourishing of women's gender is not in imitating men and/or boys and becoming fighters, wrestlers and looking masculine. This is degrading the pride, dignity and respect of being a woman <br/><br/> To use a true success story of a single case and successfully use it as propaganda for women's emancipation is sickening to say the least. The negative fallout of this movie could be: <br/><br/> Irrespective of boys or girls many parents will force their children (and more so to girls) to do what they failed to achieve in life. Make their children do things that they as parents have dreamed. Sick mentality! <br/><br/> Many girls may start behaving like boys - wearing boys dress, cutting hair like boys, fighting like boys etc. etc. not at all in the spirit of humanism <br/><br/> Father in the movie saying that ""My girls are no less than boys"". Such comparisons are not needed in today's evolved society. This is a phrase of sixties India. It is similar to always call a girl ""Tom Boy"" and demean and insult her sexuality. Such comparisons just distort the femininity of girls and women, who mis-understand such statements as being treated like boys rather than girls <br/><br/> Addressing girls as a male gender and treating one like that - the society like India - parents may do that to destroy the little bit of remaining self-esteem that girls and women - have on their given gender and sexuality <br/><br/> I also am bothered - as I always tell everyone about it is MAN - in capitals that drive the so called women's emancipation and empowerment agenda - It is so disturbing to see this. The four writers of the movie are men, the director of the movie is wearing men's glasses, the so called super-star gender sensitive actor Amir Khan is too wearing a man's hat.<br/><br/> In propaganda of spreading regressive message through this film the team too is of men - the director, writer, producer and lead actor - all men - who drive to influence the society in a way that may create a distorted image of what is meant by women empowerment. <br/><br/> In real life on which the movie is based the father of the wrestling girls drives their lives. Such case studies should have been presented more sensitively by showing – such things need not be done – even though in the end it brings laurels for the country. <br/><br/>Though I agree the medium of cinema when used with shrewdness can garner enough emotions within ignorant movie goers about nationhood to back the protagonist in whatever s/he is doing. <br/><br/>That is what has happened in this movie - the art of good film-making -tends to overlook and ignore finer aspects of women empowerment and digs more deep into the patriarchal systems to further strengthen patriarchal roles to build the women's liberation and freedom movement <br/><br/>I hope some readers who are sensitive human being will try to understand the point I am making and deplore such popular presentation of regressive concepts on feminism despite its all-time record breaking All India Collection. <br/><br/>It confirms my review - Indian is still a Patriarchal society with male dominance.<br/><br/>Have a look at the film with those lenses."
"ksnayadi","5","7","13","6 January 2017"," Watchable just once
","Nitesh Tiwari needs a real script and real story. This movie almost put me to sleep but the fact that it was based on a true story made me go through it. Some of the dialogues were cringe worthy and scenes dragging. I have absolutely no idea how this movie is now a blockbuster. I must be seriously missing something. The editing was so lacking that I wanted to fast forward to what I wanted to get at rather than relish the pace. Indian cinema needs a visionary filmmaker and stories. Chak De was 10 times better and can be enjoyed even to this day. Not that Aamir didn't work hard for it but the package just didn't come in as well as it could have been. Compromises must have been made to alter the story in favor of mass consumption but then that is what will happen when you bring in a big star. Alas Mahavir Phogat just got a very limiting picture of his life and sacrifices which means a lot to us more than this 150 minutes of lazy filmmaking"
"cinematic_aficionado","8","7","13","3 January 2017"," Great film, but not for the reasons you might think
","A wrestler with potential and big dreams; to make the country he loved proud. Despite his best efforts he did not succeed but he did not give up. One day he aspired to have a son to follow his footsteps.<br/><br/>He did get married but to his (pre-conceived) misfortune he had two daughters, thus leaving his dream of a son who would become a world class wrestler in tatters. Of course, this was to change when one day his daughters got involved in an altercation with a boy and ""properly"" punished him for misbehaving. This was his epiphany: the fact that he had daughters should not be an impediment to his lifelong dream of having a progeny that would end up being a champion.<br/><br/>That was also the moment, the tragedy for his two daughters begun. Without any consideration for their wants or needs, he begun to groom them for a life of professional wrestling and international glory. Those girls were not asked or considered, they were forced since the only thing that mattered was daddy's dreams. The fact that they were robbed of their childhood was immaterial. Mahavir Singh Phogat just did not care; gold metal was on his mind.<br/><br/>The girls grew up biologically but not emotionally; the fear and need for dad's approval never went away. Even as they progressed in the sports world all their strife was about pleasing dad. It never went away.<br/><br/>This film is a brilliant portrayal of child abuse covered in success. A determined person with no resistance from a submissive spouse went on to take over the lives of his children and formed them in his own resemblance.<br/><br/>Sure, there were successes. The girls became champions, won medals and some will say their father never stopped believing in them when in fact he never ceased to believe in his own sporting ambitions using his children as vehicle. He even buttress it as women's right going so far as to say ""no one should say a girl cannot do what a boy can do"" or ""they would have ended up housewives performing chores"". Anything to make himself feel better and justify the emotional robbery he performed on his children.<br/><br/>A brilliant and highly poignant and emotional film, made me want to jump to the screen and rescue Geeta and Babita."
"utkarshbansal1995","5","10","21","29 January 2017"," A perfectly mediocre film only worth watching for the terrific fight sequences
","Not only does Dangal methodically check off every sports movie cliché out there, it goes a step further into general movie clichés. Initially, I almost forgave some of them because it is, after all, ""based on a true story"", but as it turns out, it changed a lot of facts to fit those clichés. Artistic liberty makes sense when used to increase dramatic tension, but to make the story worse? That's just missed potential.<br/><br/>The actors do a good job, especially Fatima Sana Shaikh, who plays the wrestler Geeta Phogat with just the right mix of intensity and vulnerability. Babita Kumari, played by Sanya Malhotra, is unfortunately sidelined to a mind boggling degree, the film being only concerned with what she meant to Geeta, and never interested in her as a subject.<br/><br/>Thematically, it gets tricky. From a sports drama perspective, it is definitely inspiring to see the sacrifices that are required for Geeta and Babita to get where they need to be, but the film also tries to push itself as feminist, which doesn't work because the sacrifices the women make are forced on them by their father, Mahavir Phogat, who seems far more concerned with seeing his children fulfill the dreams he once held for himself than he is with helping them achieve what they want for themselves. When the girls complain about this, there is actually a scene, and I'm not kidding, where another girl tells them ""at least your father isn't forcing you to get married to someone you've never met."" Because forcing them to give up any hope for a happy childhood in service of a dream they do not dream is so much better *sarcasm*. A big part of the reason this doesn't work is the presentation, as instead of leaving the question of whether Mahavir's position was justified up to the viewer to answer, the film glorifies him as an ideal to follow, and every time there's an opportunity to show us that the sisters are, in fact, enthusiastic for the sport, the moment is instead used to depict enthusiasm for winning, enthusiasm for respect, enthusiasm for pleasing their father, and even, out of nowhere, enthusiasm for making the country proud.<br/><br/>Apart from being thematically muddled, the movie is plagued with narrative problems such as unnecessary voice-overs explaining how a character is feeling, abrupt transitions to pointless songs, simplistic, one-dimensional villains (why did this film need villains anyway? Wasn't society enough?) and montages that last forever, leading to a bloated 160-minute runtime.<br/><br/>And yet I think it's overall an okay movie because outside of the fights, the humor is enough to tide you over, and when the fight scenes are on, in spite of the predictable outcomes, it's a blast.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing Dangal. It's not like it's in dire need of your money anyway."

","I normally don't write reviews but this movie is so good that I felt its my responsibility to spread the word. I too feel this movie should be made tax free so more n more people are able to see it. As we know its a true story which makes it truly special. Its true that truth is stranger than fiction and lot more inspiring as well. <br/><br/>But a good story means nothing if its not directed well... director being captain of the ship is the main force behind a good movie. We have often seen good movies being made with lesser known actors which is precisely the case with this movie bar Aamir Khan. He's really a perfectionist there's no doubt about that but this movie has a lot to offer than its Main Star. <br/><br/>Special Mention for the young Kashmiri Zaira Wasim who played the younger Geeta... She's the second best reason of watching this movie... she's a revelation can't believe its her first time on screen. She's nailed the role and has outperformed Fatima Sana Shaikh who plays the elder Geeta. Ritwik Sahore is another talent right up there with Zaira. He's hilarious every time he comes on the screen. his expression alone can crack you up. Young Babita played by Sohani Bhatanagar is also excellent she has a light humorous character while elder Babita played by Sanya Malhotra is heavy and she's done impeccable job she's a great actor and has performed better than her co star n BFF Fatima Sana Shaikh. Another actor worth a special mention is Aparshakti Khurana brother of Ayushman Khurana. He's hilarious and resembles his brother. I find he's a natural actor and lot better than Ayushman who's never in character and is pretentious. Aamir's wife played by Sakshi Tanwar has done good job but I feel she had a small role also her n Aamir had no chemistry though. but the movie is not about them. <br/><br/>All other characters in the movie like Girish Kulkarni who plays the coach or Badrul Islam who plays the Chicken seller have done fantastic with whatever time they had on screen. <br/><br/>Movie might be exaggerated at times to give it more depth and emotions it seems but overall its been adapted really really well. It mostly touches on women empowerment but its the element of father daughter relationship that touched the cords the most. Father may seem MCP to most of the feminine brigade of the time as he's tough with the gals but that is the reason why his daughters both won gold for India. sometime this activists lack the vision and don't see the bigger picture.<br/><br/>We don't have to say much about Aamir do we? Finest Actor of India I call him the India Tom Hanks intact I like him even better. He's effortless with his Haryanvi accent. Provides lot of laughs initially and makes you easily cry around the post interval story line... One of his best work till date. <br/><br/>Movie is lot superior than his earlier super hits be it 3 idiots or PK or Lagaan. Please do yourself a favour go watch this movie near you... RUN"

"sumeerm-18507","9","6","11","25 December 2016"," An Emotional and Inspirational Masterpiece!!!
","Dangal is truly a masterpiece! It's literally a breath of fresh air watching a masterpiece like this. Dangal is a very inspirational and emotional movie that will leave you completely speechless once you leave the theater. Here are the Pros and Cons that I've found in the movie. <br/><br/>Pros: Performances: First and fore most, Aamir Khan is amazing in this movie! Like many people I consider him a perfectionist but if you are the kind of person who doesn't believe that, his performance in this movie will prove you wrong! Aamir Khan is so brilliant and outstanding in the film. In every single scene of this movie, he gets into the skin of Mahavir Singh Phogat and portrays that character perfectly. Aamir Khan is hands down one of the best actors in Indian Cinema! In the role of Geeta Phogat (the older daughter) both Fatima Sheikh and Zaira Wasim give an excellent performance. In the role of Babita (the younger daughter) Sania Malhotra and Suhani Bhatnagar both give an outstanding performance. Sakshi Tanwar as the mother is brilliant. The rest of the supporting cast do an outstanding job portraying their parts. This is one of those movies in which every single actor leaves a major impact in the movie. Overall, the performances are top notch!!<br/><br/>Direction: Nitesh Tiwari for his third film ( Chillar Party and Bhootnath Returns were his first two movies which were great) directs an incredible movie. His narrative style and visual perspective of the story is absolutely marvelous that you can't think of any other director who could have done a better job! Nitesh Diwali had done an amazing job directing this movie!<br/><br/>Music: The music and background score by Pritam are amazing. While all of the songs are situational, all of the songs are very well composed. Whether it's the title song, Dhakkad, or Gilehiriyan. All of the songs in Dangal are amazing. The music by Pritam is absolutely wonderful!<br/><br/>Story/Screenplay/Dialogues: The entire script of Dangal is absolutely marvelous. The screenplay of the movie is so well written with amazing dialogue. The first half of the movie has so many funny and light moments that you are amazed by how entertaining the film is. The second half is the sole of the movie, there are so many emotional and inspirational scenes in the movie that will make you tear up. The script of Dangal is wonderful and since it's based on a true story the story is so simple yet very impactful. <br/><br/>There are many more Pros in this movie.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Honestly, there were barely any Cons in this movie. There was absolutely nothing in this movie that bothered me. I'll probably say that there are just about a few scenes in the movie that slightly dips the screenplay mainly in the beginning of the movie. Other than that I have no major flaws with this movie!!<br/><br/>Overall, Dangal is an outstanding film that will inspire you and motivate you. This is a great film on not just female empowerment but it's an amazing movie on family and human emotions in general. Dangal is a triumph and is one of the best movies I've seen this decade!!!"

","The year 2016 has been good for Hindi cinema. We have seen some very good films like Pink, Nil Battey Sannata, Sultan, Kapoor & Sons, Neerja, Airlift, MS Dhoni, Wazir and a few more.<br/><br/>However, the year ends with Dangal, the finest & realistic Hindi sports film ever made and definitely the masterpiece of 2016.<br/><br/>The film is based on national level wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat who taught wrestling to his two elder daughters Geeta & Babita at a time when women wrestling was looked down upon in India and Indians failed to get medals in international events. <br/><br/>The film highlights their journey from childhood, their rigorous training, their sacrifices and the challenges and setbacks that they faced initially at the international level. However, both later went on to win gold and many other medals for India in several international championships in female wrestling.<br/><br/>Talking about performances, every actor in the movie appears so realistic that one tends to forget that they are actors. Both the child actresses playing the two wrestlers are simply superb and their grown up versions are amazing as well. Aamir Khan playing their father with a huge paunch is as usual a riveting watch.The supporting cast is also terrific.<br/><br/>Hats off to the director for making such a brilliant film. I can't find an obvious flaw in it. Well Done! :D"
"pavanjantikar","10","6","11","25 December 2016"," Excellent!!!
","One of the best Hindi movies ever.Aamir's acting was on the spot. Direction wise,Nitesh Tiwari has done an excellent job.The actors who played the role of Geeta and Babita were so apt to that role. Songs are in sync with the situations in the movie and they sound good. The role played by Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat was one of his best performances ever. Overall,it was an excellent all-round performance from story- telling,cinematography,acting,direction,screenplay and music.It is definitely worth to wait Aamir's movie every time. Even though he makes very few movies but he makes sure that he delivers best performances every time and addresses the flaws in the Indian society in a meaningful way.The best Christmas gift for everyone from Dangal Team."

Movie is based on true story with a powerful message for women. Stellar performance by Aamir Khan. Top notch performances from the entire cast. Dangal has it all-Great direction(Nitesh Tiwari),powerful dialogues,perfect mix of humour and emotions. Music by Pritam is great.The cinematography is nice. The story telling is excellent. Aamir Khan brilliantly portrayed the role of real life wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. His daughters Geeta (Fatima) and Babita (Sanya) deserves equal credits. The national anthem played at the end will certainly give u goosebumps."
"Tanay_LKO","9","6","11","24 December 2016"," ""DANGAL - Making of the Medalists in ""Wrestling of a Lifetime""
","In a rural town of North India, what would possibly be the concern of a father of ""four"" young girls? Many would say earning sufficient sustenance and arranging dowry to get them married. Gratefully one such father was pondering over a different set of anxiety all together – ""how to make world champions of his children"". <br/><br/>""Dangal"" (Wrestling Arena) is a sports-biographical drama based on the lives of Indian Wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two daughters – Geeta and Babita, transpiring the events to their glory in Commonwealth Games 2010.<br/><br/>Opening up in the dusty arena of the mud-slapping ""desi-pehalwaans"" (wrestlers) with the pulsating title-track, where Mahavir Singh (Aamir Khan) himself prepared his way to become the national champion in Freestyle Wrestling. Due to financial constraints he gave up his sport to earn bread-and-butter; although, he refused to give up on his dream to win an international Gold for India. He wished to raise his son to such stature; little did he know that he would only be blessed with daughters, thus, a bane for his dream. <br/><br/>Until he discovered that even they possess the stamina and the spark of a wrestler. Thus, with a new found belief he began the training of the young 'Phogat Sisters' (Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar), marked with much resistance and hindrance from the wee kids, their mother and the society, in general. The endurance of severe nerve-wracking months began under their father's coaching as Geeta and Babita scaled fields, heaved through push-ups, beaten down in sparring by their frailish cousin brother and cried their eyes out as they begged to not chop off their hair – all to no avail. <br/><br/>Till, one day they realized how fortunate they have been to be raised unlike other girls who are married off at an early age or merely shoved into the ""chuhlah-chaukah"" (kitchen) of their homes; motivating enough to make them into better wrestlers, upto the mark that they jostled their way to national championships and international team selections. <br/><br/>Even as the adult - Geeta and Babita (Fatima Sana Shaikh, ""Chachi 420""; and Sanya Malhotra) had miles to cover. The journey ahead for them was marked with egotism, training disarray and self-doubts, "" wrestlers aren't made overnight. They have to be tended and cared for a lifetime."" Indeed, the bout had only begun. What's remarkable is that even on covering a plethora of topics bordered by societal norms of male-favouritism, disfavor to sports and discriminating girls, it doesn't lose a beat and neither time. It's almost surprising to see such level of fine and crisp editing (Ballu Saluja, ""Lagaan"") which not just puts the perspective, but even the narrative right. The cinematography (Sethu Sriram, ""OMG – Oh My God"") is a plus, along with the most blending of scores (Pritam, ""Barfi!"") produced in recent times. <br/><br/>Aamir Khan is, as well-known, a natural performer and could be easily moulded out of his star-persona. He possesses a master control and gumption in his style, which is almost too simplistic, yet brilliant.<br/><br/>However, the real ""hero"" is the National Award recipient Writer- Director, Nitesh Tiwari (""Chillar Party"", ""Bhootnath Returns"") who has not only drawn career-best performances from the likes of Aamir Khan and stars, but at the same time portrayed a universal-story of human endeavor, spirit and triumph without losing the vision of wrestling, as it is. <br/><br/>Even with some creative liberties, such was the environment within the theatre that my co-viewers were jumping and cheering from their seats for the recreated matches. I found myself joining in and stood fervently, when the National Anthem was played for that Gold for India.<br/><br/>Dangal is undoubtedly a rare and sparkling gem of Indian and World Cinema, alike. If not already, please do watch at the earliest. <br/><br/>A revered 9/10."

"jay-techie2007","9","6","11","24 December 2016"," Great movie to watch... to understand, not just the wrestling, but the struggles our athletes overcome on their journey to win medals for the country.
","While off late, Bollywood have witnessed many sports movies, very few have been so focused on the sport as Dangal. Meticulously detailed to perfection - as expected from Aamir Khan, Dangal scores on almost every aspect - be it detailing, story telling, entertainment value, drama or humor. The last sports movie that was closest to this one was Chak De India.<br/><br/>Story (10/10): In the backdrop of Hindi heartland state Haryana, the story depicts the struggle of a father against the rampant and age old gender discrimination in India, especially in the northern belt, to get his daughters into the wrestling, something which is considered a male-only profession, to fulfill his dream of winning the gold for the country. He himself was a part of that brigade, thinking that only a male child can fulfill his dream, before he realized two things - winning a gold for the country is not a privilege of men and his daughters have a wrestler's blood running in them. The story depicts his fight - socially, financially as well as administratively (with the sports authorities) - to enable his talented daughters bring gold medal home. While the story is impressive, the best part is the details that doesn't restrict itself to Mahavir Singh Phogat but goes beyond to touch issues around the social exploitation of women, gender based discrimination, the mentality of treating girl child as a baggage, the male-child mania, the state of sports infrastructure in the country, the importance of a right coach for a sportsperson and even religious harmony. However, it also depicts something wrong in the Indian society which is the obsession of Indian parents' using their children to fulfill their dreams. The story largely revolves around Mahavir Singh Phogat, played by Aamir Khan and his elder daughter Geeta Phogat, the child version played by Zaira Wasim and the elder version played by Fatima Sana Sheikh. The evolution of the relationship is shown beautifully and something to look forward to in the movie. <br/><br/>Acting (9/10): After Dear Zindagi, this is another movie where we see the Khans taking a back seat and allowing the newbies to be in the limelight. The movie saw a lot more of Zaira Wasim in the beginning and Fatima Sana Sheikh later. Famita looks very authentic as wrestler during the fight scenes and her acting otherwise as well, is very impressive. Some of the emotional scenes between Aamir Khan and Fatima Sana Sheikh are really well executed without any melodrama. Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. His commitment on keeping an original body in both the versions of Mahavir Singh (young and old) along with hours of training on physical fitness and wrestling pays off really well. Sakshi Tanwar plays a very noticeable role with multiple projections of an apologetic wife in the beginning who turns into a strong homemaker and a mother who tries every bit to draw line when her husband's obsession becomes a nightmare for her kids, especially with a fragile relationship of her husband and her eldest daughter. Sanya Malhotra, playing the younger daughter, did a pretty great job. Even with less than a minute of wrestling time in the movie, she looked more formidable than Fatima. The other supporting characters of Aparshakti Khurrana, playing Mahavir Singh's nephew, and Girish Kulkarni, the national coach, have done a decent job. The lead cast's hard work on learning wrestling to make the entire movie look very authentic and the command over the Haryanvi accent brought the movie to life. <br/><br/>Direction (8/10): The direction of the movie has been spot on. The movie has been extremely focused on wrestling unlike other sports movies like MS Dhoni, Mary Kom, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag which had unnecessary side plots and diversions. This is something which worked for Chak De India as well. From the first scene till the last, the director kept the hero of the movie as wrestling, which makes it very enjoyable throughout the 161 minutes. Although some of the details have been altered from the real life to increase the entertainment value, none of them seemed unnecessary or disconnected from the story. The clever use of humor and capitalizing on the Haryanvi accent and words was great. Interestingly, for the scenes that had narration voice in the background, the director chose Omkar's (Mahavir Singh's nephew) view to bring an unbiased perspective, which has worked well (same approach used for Dil Dhadakne Do). The climax is where the director lost his grip a little with some unbelievable sequences that didn't make sense. <br/><br/>Music (9/10): Normally, I don't put music section while rating the movie but Dangal has the kind of music that is really enjoyable as the movie proceeds. The lyrics, in particular, of the songs like ""Haanikarak Bapu"", ""Dhakkad"" and the title track are so apt to the story-line and the songs are woven into the movie very seamlessly. Great work by Pritam in the music and Amitabh Bhattacharya in penning down the lyrics. <br/><br/>Overall (9/10): Overall, it's a great movie to watch, especially for the Aamir Khan lovers, and for the general public to understand, not just the wrestling, but the struggles our athletes overcome on their journey to win medals for the country."

","Sports, the most important discipline of life, reboots your spirit mentally, physically, even professionally irrespective of you being a sportsperson or not. So also is DANGAL which primarily soars high on a balanced cocktail of women empowerment, discipline, emotion & moral values has captured the ardent relationship between father and daughter so candidly that you will find it impossible to control back your tears. Visionary veteran Mahavir Singh Phogat, against all odds of society, religiously manufacture his raw and uncooked daughters with utmost care prior to their introduction into the World of Wrestling which has been deliciously portrayed (literally yummy) by the ingenue Phogat siblings. While the energetic songs blend in seamlessly with a masterly written screenplay, the elder Phogat siblings raise the bar to the horizon performing through bout to bout. The choreography of bouts feel incredibly authentic on mat which is yet another genuine flavor in the biopic & as a vivid sports follower I must say that the dramatized scorelines will maintain the tempo upwards inside the theater. The entire cast & crew and the witty dialogues are again the contributing factor in this successful biopic besides the unnecessary pre-climax stunt and yes, Aamir- take a bow!!! It would be a sin if you don't watch DANGAL, it's movie of this era, it's gonna etch real hard on your thoughts and reverberate again and again. Go Play! Live your Life! 10/10"

Makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to Divya Rao,Aamir Khan and the two lead actress are the best cast roles in a long time, but overall cast done an amazing job.

","This is how you make a phenomenal sports drama, this is how you make a real authentic wrestling movie. Compared to this, you'll forget Sultan.<br/><br/>This is the real story of former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trains his own daughters Geeta and Babita to achieve wrestling greatness. First half is all about how Mahavir wants a boy to achieve his own long lost dream of getting gold for India. But, instead he gets 4 daughters. Somehow he realizes that his daughters can fulfill his dream and then begins the vigorous training of Geeta & Babita as children. After years of preliminary training, Geeta gets closer to her goal by winning nationals.<br/><br/>But the real drama starts with 2nd half, as the daughters had to now get trained by National coach to get ready for International matches and eventually the Commonwealth Games.<br/><br/>Amir Khan is absolutely on top of his role at every age of his character. Whether as young wrestler, middle aged or older. The kids acted so well it almost looked natural. The actresses for adult Geeta n Babita deserve all the applause for the effort they've put in to portray the real wrestlers.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is how real and authentic is the wrestling shown in the movie. What you see in Sultan looks absolutely choreographed (and garbage). But here, you even learn about the game and get involved. At the end, you'd really feel proud for India and those daughters.<br/><br/>A must watch and should be considered for Oscars."

Okay direction and lots of exaggeration which you can feel right there. After 1 week the films rating will drop like anything once the fans finish watching it. Dangal's cast is good and you could just watch once it's available for streaming.

","I don't watch Bollywood movies...For obvious reasons.....The absurd stereotypes....The dramatics...the unnecessary songs and dance...The clichés...the unreal sequences...the bad acting....stupid scripts...<br/><br/>Having said that, every year or two, I wait eagerly for Aamir khan movies...This is the one actor who makes enjoyable commercial movies(3 idiot)..sometime real good ones (TZP, RDB, Dhobi ghat)..and I was eagerly waiting for this one.The critic reviews and IMDb rating of 9.1 put fire on that excitement fuel.So i went to see the movie last night 11 PM in Atlanta...<br/><br/>So was I disappointed?? is the movie worth 9.1 (Better than Moneyball, Fight club, Shaw shank, Forrest Gump, Inception??)<br/><br/>Well it wasn't ...and truly if people are going to rate a Bollywood movie in IMDb based on their knowledge of movies (of course Dangal is masterpiece when you compare it to the movies that Bollywood produce every year like Dilwale, Befikre, Sultan etc etc) , I would suggest IMDb to have separate page on Bollywood movies so that people like me, who are a devoted movie fan and do watch movies from all over the world , don't get deceived by the ratings<br/><br/>As I said its better than average Bollywood movie ..however its an average movie itself....The first 1 hour is good..its funny..its smart..its fast paced...and you connect to the character and their emotions....the struggle of those girls looked almost real....the dangals authentic....the film takes a flow thats rarely seen in Bollywood<br/><br/>However, the problem comes in second half...there is not much left to be told in the story.....so the film drags...drags to unnecessary wrestling game scenes...After seeing hundred of Sport movies,I can say the good ones never shows the actual games in the movie...the movie is not about showing those games but the drama around the sport...Dangal in the last 1 hour is essentially nothing but extended version of those wrestling games...So , eventually all the drawbacks of a Bollywood movie cripples the movie....the stereotypes comes back ..Conspiracy against dad, fight between coaching ideology, the Australian wrestler insulting Geeta in the press conference (which are factually never there or maybe false)...a grown up cousin who tries to be funny ..but not funny.... And finally the most grave mistake...the facts were distorted in the second half...you never do that in a sports movie based on real story ...none of the fights and scores were correct...they were fabricated to make the movie Bollywood style Dramatic (like winning a 5 pointer last second)..<br/><br/>So overall...good try..still a solid six, because we need a movie like this in Indian sport..However when it comes to a movie it just another average sport movie (similar to a coach carter or mcfarlad, etc).....So do watch it ...its a decent movie but be aware of the 9.1 rating here...its just over the top...people who don't watch any other movies but Bollywood movie are going ga ga over it because as I said earlier, if you watch Befikre, Dilwale all year..its a masterpiece to you.."

"srivardhanms","6","5","9","2 January 2017"," Not as great as hyped!
","Though story is based on real life story, the movie fails to impress! I had a lot of expectations from the movie but was disappointed after watching it. The story is supposed to be about women wrestlers fighting against patriarchal society to win a gold medal. But in the movie, there is little to show that those girls were discriminated because they were girls! The movie would still be same if the protagonist were boys instead of girls (apart from a couple of dialogues)! There seems no struggle for phogat girls because they were girls! Many talk about this movie telling its patriotic! I fail to see there point! Patriotism is just a masala in the movie. Basically, Mahavir phogat wanted to win gold but failed, so he prepares his daughters for the win. Thats it! It's the dream of any sports person to win gold for the country and that is what is shown here! Thats it! Nothing different! Good thing about the movie is you won't get bored. There is a lot humour throughout the movie which keeps you entertained. Overall its just a one time watch."

","Aamir Khan (yes that idiot) is back with a bang and now this time around he 'dangals' with our minds! After watching this movie i felt that Dangal is that infectious cologne once sprayed its misty scent stays with you for a long long time. It is one of the rarest & finest Hindi movie in its genre, a much needed biopic on sports drama in the era of trash movies and junkie talkies. For the concept of women empowerment alone Dangal needs to be watched and cherished. Kudos to the entire cast for making this movie with so much grace, love, ambition, passion and devotion. Every single actor or individual associated with the movie seems to have dedicated themselves completely produce such effective cinema. And what can i say about the maestro himself? Aamir Khan at his best. Watch him in a scene when he engages in an argument/fight with Geeta or that phone conversation or the way he trains and coaches his daughters as it feels like you are watching the real Mahavir Singh himself who has so much passion for wrestling....absolutely brilliant! After watching him in Dangal I am convinced that NO OTHER ACTOR HAS GONE ABOVE & BEYOND LIKE AAMIR KHAN when you look at the types of movies, shows and roles he has played which are all very dynamic - be it sarfarosh, lagaan, rang de, TZP, 3 idiots, PK or DANGAL or even satyamev jayate...Aamir Khan knows cinema's reach & its powerful impact so why not use it wisely to produce/make movies which the audience can easily connect to known subjects/issues and then they righteously decide the impact for themselves - epic! Regarding the story, see it to believe it. There are few stumbling scenes in the 2nd half but its forgettable when you look at the big picture. One thing I would like to say though is take few napkins because you will need it!"

","Born and raised in the small village Balali,in the state of Haryana, promising young athlete Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) made a mark on the national level for himself through wrestling,However his ultimate goal of becoming the first Indian wrestler to win a gold medal for India in the prestigious Commonwealth Games never fulfilled due to lack of physical & financial support. Mahavir finally succumbed to family pressure to find a real job and get married. He hoped for a son whom he could coach to become a wrestler who could represent India in the Commonwealth Games to win him the medal he dreamed of winning for himself.However things didn't panned out well as all his four children were born girls,it appeared that his dream has finally come to a standstill. The real story begins to twist when Mahavir's adolescent daughters Geeta (Zaira Wasim) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar) get into a brawl with some rude neighbor boys and beat them up. Suddenly Mahavir realized that all he wanted is a successor of him who could win the medal in his place irrespective of the gender. He starts training his daughters to wrestle, building them their own training ring in a nearby field and intentionally pitting them against boys because,he believes, the only way athletes learn is by competing up with stronger & meaner opponents.If his daughters Geeta & Babita (played as young adults by Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra respectively) have the heart and skills, then there is no force that could stop them from winning & ultimately fulfilling his long held ambition & make him proud.The story then Plots on their journey to stardom. They put on the extra miles that serves to prove that will power,determination & self believe ultimately transforms into immense strength and endurance which enables one to do the impossible. This is what follows when finally one of Mahavir's daughters Geeta against all odds reached a mid-line between triumph and defeat when she reached the finals of the Commonwealth Games 2010 & Australian Wrestler Emily Bensted stood on her way to glory. Despite a nervous beginning she managed to recover from it & then lashed onto the opportunity & managed to win the Gold Medal that has eluded the Indian wrestlers on a global scale. Mahavir now a proud father was simply overjoyed & finally his daughter made him & others realize that being a girl or boy doesn't matter unless you have the strength to face reality & it's consequences. Truly a inspirational story for everyone to watch & specially to those women who are still fighting for a place that they are deprived off by others.This will act as a emotional boost for them & give them the strength they had been seeking for a long time."

The story then follows Mahavir's strict native coaching as the girls grow up (Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra) and try to climb the ladder, albeit while facing a series of stereotypes, hurdles, and rampant demoralization from the society.<br/><br/>As a viewer who is still in awe with the film, I will only talk about one specific (and the most important) sequence, which occurs towards the end of the first half. Without giving any spoilers - in order to prove that she doesn't need more of her father's guidance, Geeta gets into the pit to fight against the man who helped create her. The two-minute montage that Tiwari and cinematographer Sethu get absolutely, perfectly right, all with Aamir and Shaikh's emotive reactions, is the most poignant scene seen in any Bollywood film this year. There is so much in that short sequence that defines the powers of human vanity, egotism, and haughtiness - all blended with humanity's most vital feelings - it will make you cry. That particular sequence is what got me, and I am going to break order by recommending this film right in the third paragraph itself. Go watch it in your nearest theater now.<br/><br/>Five minutes is all it will take you to get hooked into the otherwise long film (at 160 stimulating minutes). Delightful sequences that will lay out what is to be expected as you move forward with Mahavir and his daughters' story. The cause of women empowerment is loud and clear as Tiwari and his allies etch a story about the usual stereotypes that surround when it comes to ""women in sports"". The male gaze also makes an appearance here as Mahavir gives zero care to the world and moves ahead with his talented daughters in an attempt to shift mountains. How a father does what he does, regardless of his approach, but still thinks of his girls' upbringing and a bright future is what Dangal essentially talks about. It tries to smash and subdue the voices that sway in the air about inequality, and oppression of women and their rights. As far as the narrative is concerned, it's a triumph, because it sheds light on both sides of the coin. Mahavir's wife is worried about her daughters' food-making skills, but she is cajoled that people are not living in caves anymore. <br/><br/>Of course, the narrative is formulaic, as Tiwari uses the usual elements (think Chak De! India (2007), Sultan (2016)) to ignite chatter about the much-talked-about cause, patriotism, the decrepit sports authority of India, and other related things. The ability to shed light into how it is the government which is to be blamed for sportspeople not winning medals should be lauded, but let's not give the film the hat of a pioneer. Other films in the genre think of it as water under the bridge.<br/><br/>The young girls do a very good job at enacting kids who are growing up and who love pani-puri, yet are forbidden by their father. Their determination in portraying their characters is terrific. Same with Fatima Sana Shaikh who is well- directed, yet her character is written with some traces of bad Bollywood in it. She steals the show, nonetheless. Sakshi Tanwar and Aparshakti Khurrana support the main cast very well, with the latter providing comic relief.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan justifies his role, and makes it obvious why he is showered with certain adjectives and nouns. After Talaash (2012) and Dhoom 3 (2013), his authority as a game-changer in Bollywood was beginning to diminish, but this one here surely has the strength to resurrect him as the man. His fitness regime for the portrayal (can be watched on YouTube) reassures that he may still be in the game.<br/><br/>Dangal is a film that makes the right use of background music, slow motion capturing and editing, and other film factors. It keeps its audience at the edge of their seats throughout the film, yet stays relevant, and never bores. Thumping songs will get you higher and make you marvel at the cinematic excellence as it unfolds layer by layer. Overall, there aren't enough sentences to describe the lists of things that this film achieves. It rhetorically asks if women aren't better than men. Then it proves that it's all about equality, making feminists cower at the backseat. What took them years and years to start, this film here did it in less than three hours.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Nitesh Tiwari's ""Dangal"" is surprisingly brilliant for a sports drama. It is a film that is not only about sports or the spirit of winning, but about a father's quest to make his children understand what passion can do, and how one can set an example. Other than learning some good wrestling strategy, Dangal is a triumph that will appeal to everyone. Go for it!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

","Movie Name : Dangal Genre : Sports / Drama / Biography Rating : Outstanding 5/5 <br/><br/>There comes a movie in a while which you are awaiting with bathed-breath and after watching it, your joy knows no bounds. ""Dangal"" is a perfect example that exceeds the expectations and would give you a right dose of entertainment with an inspiring message.<br/><br/>""Dangal"" is a biography-drama about the former Indian wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan) who dreams of winning a gold medal for India at the Olympics. He earns enough respect in the field of wrestling but disowns the sport due to money-crunch. However, he trains his daughters, Geeta (played by Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (played by Sanya Malhotra) who makes his dream come true.<br/><br/>Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, who earlier made ""Bhoothnath Returns"", ""Dangal"" focuses more on the relationship between the Haryana wrestler Mahavir Phogat and Babita Kumari and Geeta Phogat. Unlike the Salman Khan's ""Sultan"", the wrestling drama is an emotional journey of a father teaching his daughters about the wrestling sports rather than full-fledged action film. The film opens well with Aamir Khan wrestling with his colleague at office. The subsequent scenes where he teaches his daughters the art of wrestling is brilliantly portrayed. The wrestling arena scene where the young Geeta fights with a boy for the first time is eye-popping. Kudos to Nitesh Tiwari for keeping us engaged at this time. <br/><br/>The second half tells how Geeta Phogat joining the NSA (National Sports Academy) but in spite of having a wrestling coach, gets trained under her father to win the gold medal at the Common Wealth Games 2010. The wrestling scenes are probably the best scenes you will witness on the silver screen. The semi-final and the final match for gold is the highlight of the film. Thanks to wonderful screenplay written by Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain, Nikhil Mehrotra and Nitesh Tiwari, ""Dangal"" will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. Background score is rocking and gels well with the mood of the film. Art direction is effective along with efficient cinematography for capturing the charms of rural India. Editing is crispy. Special mention to Shyam Kaushal and Kripa Shankar Patel Bishnoi for executing the wrestling scenes effectively. Songs are good but definitely the pick-of-a-lot is the title song ""Dangal"" which hair- raising.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, I cannot imagine any one apart from Aamir Khan playing the role of mentor to his daughter, Mahavir Singh Phogat. Aamir has chosen to put on lot of weight to look like an aging pehelwaan and his performance is impeccable. Just like ""Sultan"" was not just a Salman Khan's film and had other characters well-defined, ""Dangal"" boast off some brilliant actors as well. Zaira Wasim (Young Geeta) and Suhani Bhatnagar (Young Babita) are simply superb. Same goes for Fatima Sana Shaikh (Elder Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Elder Babita) who are spell- binding. Sakshi Talwar does well in her part. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are lying low in life, ""Dangal"" is the right dose of medicine to motivate and inspire you. Go and grab the tickets now. Outstanding 5/5"

","AAMIR KHAN, TAKE A BOW! What you have done as an actor in the 21st century is an epitome of perfection in work. You are a trendsetter. All box office records & critical acclaim is deservingly yours. Right from Lagaan, Dil Chahta hai, Tare Zameen Par, Rang De Basanti, Gajani, 3 idiots, PK & now Dangal! OUTSTANDING WORK!! Though I must say that you should avoid working in films like Dhoom 3 & even Talaash, they were successful at box office but still these movies didn't do justice to your talent & vision. Also, avoid doing guest roles for the sake of friends, family & acquaintances like you have done in DhobhiGhat, Delhi Belly & Secret Superstar. DANGAL is incredibly impactful and a positive approach towards women empowerment. Fatima & Sanya have given impressive performances. The young Geeta & Babita aka Zaira & Suhani have also acted like mature artists. Dangal is must watch movie, which deserves your time. The best thing about the film is the wrestling fights. They are spontaneous and you feel like you are actually watching them live. The realism in characters, energy in wrestling and honesty in acting makes this movie a brilliant sporting journey. India needs more films like these. The level & quality of cinema is improving and that's a very ominous sign for things to come in future."

","Sublime efforts has earned a place in the hearts of movie goers. Excellent movie. The initial scenes have set the movie well – No time consuming introductions – and the narration gets intense when Mahavir starts training his daughters to be a wrestler. Funny dialogues and comedy sequences with Geeta's cousin were entertaining in the first half. The Haanikaarak Bapu song was so cute with the two daughters struggling to keep up with their father's training. Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who played the role of young Geeta and Bhabita have showcased exceptional acting.<br/><br/>Fatima Sana Shaikh, who played the role of Geeta Phogat has justified her role in every scene. Be it the scene where she tries to show her father is wrong or being emotional after understanding the truth she scores distinction<br/><br/>Sanya Malhotra (Babita Phogat), has been a cute addition to the scenes. The scenes where she feels pity for her father's age, her trust on her father will make you like her more than Geeta.<br/><br/>Amir Khan, no words to explain this man's acting and dedication. He has once again proved that he is the Mr.Perfect of Bollywood. He has done his job with ease when being a strict father he really annoys us, when he cares for his daughters he impress us, in emotional scenes he makes us cry. He has been one of the greatest actors of all time. He was seen only once in a wrestling scene but for just one scene he has undergone an immense change in his physic (A standing ovation).<br/><br/>Nitesh Tiwary the man behind this emotional biographical film has done a great job. His detailing was the one I admired a lot. A scene were Amir Khan share the sweets (laddu) between his daughters, the scene when Amir serves chicken to his daughters and the small girl behind him watching the scene with two hands on her chins were so cute. The way he shot the wrestling scenes has to be the top notch. The moves of the wrestlers, the holds, the point system everything was captured superbly. I haven't seen any other sports movie explaining the rules of the game so clearly to the audience."

"pshyams-59489","9","4","7","26 December 2016"," Top effort from Aamir Khan
","DANGAL<br/><br/>It is easy to classify Dangal as just another feel good movie – but it goes way beyond that. Much has been written about the story line which does not bear repetition; the unfulfilled dreams of a champion wrestler who feels cheated of an opportunity to seek an international Gold and glory for the country due to circumstances, who seeks to fulfill them through his offspring.<br/><br/>Where the Dangal experience becomes different is in the nuances and narration of the story. The reaction of a dejected Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan) to the complaint by the villagers after his daughters beat up a couple of boys is one of surprise and elation – the real 'aha' moment for him when he realizes a Gold medal is a Gold medal, whether won by a girl or a boy. The natural resentment of the young girls to the harsh discipline imposed by the ambitious father is played out charmingly through the pranks and scheming of the siblings. The odds which are stacked against girls getting into a typically 'macho' sport like wrestling, starting with a conventional mother who refuses protein rich non vegetarian cooking at home to snide comments from the audience who wait to see how the girls will dress to wrestle against boys are emphasized without using high drama or decibels but with telling effect. The underplaying of the politics and harassment of women sports persons and stressing only on the inflated egos of the national coaches at the National Sports Academy keeps the focus strongly on the sport and ensures that the audiences are not distracted from the main story.<br/><br/>The performances of the female cast is outstanding; Sakshi Tanvar who is better known for her role in the TV serial Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki plays Mahavir's quietly supportive but strong wife adequately. The Phogat sisters played by Fatima Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra bring the right balance of emotion and natural exuberance of youth. A very special mention needs to made of the young lad who plays their young cousin Omkar (whose grown up role is played by Aparashakti Khurana) who is brought in by Mahavir as the first sparring partner for the girls when they are initiated to the sport; he is in complete awe of his Chacha Mahavir but as a rather unlikely wrestler takes a lot of spills and beating in the process of helping the girls realize their métier.<br/><br/>Aamir always brings something special to his home productions. As the emotional, temperamental and obsessive father and coach he walks the thin line between being a tough coach and a doting father. Without going over the top, he maintains his authority over his children with no screaming or third degree methods; however, there is never any doubt about who the boss is! Another masterpiece from him.<br/><br/>The real test of a biopic is the ability to sustain audience interest when you know what follows next. Director Nitesh Tiwari has kept up just the right momentum through the movie to ensure that we look forward to every stage of the movie in spite of knowing what to expect. Perhaps the contrived climax scene and the prolonged early training scenes could have been constructed better; but then this is really nit picking on an otherwise exhilarating movie. After starting the movie with the National Anthem thanks to our Supreme Court, finishing it too on screen with the anthem at the medal ceremony was a master stroke which make sure that you leave the theater on a high!"

"aakash-03","10","4","7","26 December 2016"," Triumph of Indian Cinema - Aamir Khan & team deserves a Oscar for this one.
","#Dangal - Certainly the triumph of Indian Cinema. A Film Not To Be Missed!! Caters to each & every section of the audience, even who are not movie lovers. Highly recommended!!<br/><br/>Highest accolade for any story-teller is when the audience are not only curious for the next moment but starts living the story with the storyteller and are being emotionally delighted by the ups and downs of the story's protagonist. Amazed by the screenplay and direction of Nitesh Tiwari. Glad he presented such a strong subject in front of Indian audience with sheer brilliance. Even strong dialogues are presented in a very subtle way. No superficial melodrama. Every department excels.<br/><br/>I don't know how to define the best Indian movie but 'Dangal' is certainly the Best Indian Sports Drama till date and for a very long time it will remain steady because of its story, performances and brilliantly shot sport (wrestling) scenes. In fact the quality of the sports scenes can compete with any Hollywood sports drama - highly gripping, emotional and very inspirational. Every 2nd or 3rd scene you just get goosebumps. I was genuinely spellbound. It deals with a very strong social issue of uplifting women in a society which is surrounded by strong patriarchal culture.<br/><br/>As far as performances are concerned, the actors are being well cast on the grounds of their true potential. Zaira Wasim as young Geeta leaves strong screen impact (Born Superstar). Whereas, Fatima Sana Sheikh and Sanya Malhotra as Geeta & Babita (respectively) were super- awesome. All the four girls were just terrific in their concerned roles. Sakshi Tanwar justified her character beautifully. Special mentions: the actor who plays the coach Girish Kulkarni was great and Aparshakti who plays the cousin and narrator of 'Dangal' was endearing. And, finally the most passionate actor who has always changed the face of Indian Cinema,'Aamir Khan' - He has given a top- notch performance. In every scene, Aamir has just lived Mahavir. He truly deserves to be called as the finest actor. He seriously doesn't play Mahavir but he just becomes him. That pain and joy which he has shown on screen was so lively that you tend to salute Mahavir Singh for his sacrifices and struggle he has gone through.<br/><br/>Although, there are minor flaws in the movie but surely can be ignored in front of the subject.<br/><br/>But, I really don't have words to express the internal strength of #MahavirSinghPhogat & family #ExtremeRespect There's a line in the movie's title track - ""Bande ki mehnat ko kismat ka saadar pranaam hai pyaare, Dangal Dangal"" Hardwork always pays off!"

Dangal is answer to this years Oscar, I hope to this more brilliant movies by Aamir expectations just got more high now.There was no one in the cinema hall who didn't stood up by the patriotic move at the end.

","watched the movie today and At last at the end of the year we got to see some thing special. Aamir Khan comes once in 2 or 3 years and he seldom disappoints us.<br/><br/>If we are considering the true story based on which the film has been made, there is no entertainment value as such, but some fictional characters added along with some added incidents which we all can feel that it would never had happened in real life. But this is Hindi film and we all expect some emotional drama and the director well portrayed these things. So full credits to Mr.Nitesh Tiwari and Mr.Aamir Khan who worked physically to play the character.<br/><br/>The film shows some light towards our social systems which never supports women empowerment . It also point fingures towards why India cannot bring medals by simply showing an official who denies to offer fund for buying synthetic mats.<br/><br/>The movie also points towards the Indian Coach selection and the Human egos which results in loosing the medals. I hope the Concerned coach during the 2010 common wealth games is not targetted here.<br/><br/>Now talking about the comparison with Sultan there is nothing other than Some funny sponsorship like Pressure cooker in Sultan and here a Chicken shop keeper.<br/><br/>Another relief is that it is not a romantic movie as we are fed up of almost 100 such movies this year in different languages.<br/><br/>One thing which I cannot digest in this movie is that Aamir saying "" all will remember only gold winners and not silver or bronze. I have to say that we still remember Leander, Rajya Vardhan Singh Rathore, Vijender Singh, Karnam Malleswari, Sushil Kumar,.Upto PV Sindhu and Sakshi Malik along with the gold winner Abhinav Bindra.<br/><br/>Other than this I like all other aspects of the movie<br/><br/>So it is a must much movie for all categories of audience .<br/><br/>Considering the business, repeat audience will be more and hence crossing 300 cr in India is assured, But whether it will overtake PK is still a question as holidays are limited in view that X-mas and New Year Fall on Sundays."

","If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down.<br/><br/>SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light- hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary.<br/><br/>DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character.<br/><br/>FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack- lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide- shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication.<br/><br/>ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016."

","If I had seen Dangal last year, it would have easily blazed into my Top 30 list. Being a sport genre film, you will know what will transpire in the final climatic scene from a mile away, but it does hit all the usual tropes and emotional beats with verve and aplomb. The good ones in this genre know how to make the arduous learning journey resemble inspirational life lessons and will also make you feel vested in the story. This is not just a good one, it is a great one. <br/><br/>Dangal is a biographical sports drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari. It stars Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. The former is India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal (55 kg). Her sister Babita Kumari won the silver (51 kg). <br/><br/>I have seen inspirational life-affirming stories like this but what makes Dangal stands out from the multitude is that it got all the basics right. The film never sermonises the age old themes like sexism, gender inequality and patriotism, instead it hits the usual repertoire of greatest hits with a deft balance. There was never any need to hammer some of the ideas into your consciousness like nails to a wall. It trusts us to understand the issues because so many predecessors have already done so. It just presents them in a refreshing way to make them come up smelling like roses. For example, in a scene where the sisters lament their father for forcing them to learn wrestling, their friend who is a young bride-to-be shares with them how she wishes she has a father like theirs. In that simple monologue, a light is shone on the plight of the female gender in India. <br/><br/>The film also got another aspect right - it manages to explain the sport with superb clarity, so much so that it almost feels like a wrestling 101 manual. It is never boring or preachy, and when the climax rolls in like the tide, you will smile gleefully because it has succeeded in actually making you feel smart. Talking about the climax, my wifey turned to me and whispered how the final bout would be won. I concurred and added that it will be underscored in extreme slow-mo. Of course, both of us were right. But the thing to remember is that even if we could guess it, it is always the mechanics behind we couldn't see. By then we were so vested in the story we were welcoming the final scene with opened arms and warm streaming tears. <br/><br/>Dangal is also buoyed by convincing fight choreography and the wrestling sequences are well shot and without quick edits which are cheat-codes. You will believe the principals are wrestlers first and actors second. Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) are truly commendable in their roles. Even all the peripheral parts are well portrayed. That leaves Aamir Khan, who went over and above himself to turn in a superb performance and to think that he put on 38% body fat to play the role really made me want to salute him. But when I learned that he later went back to a lean mean fighting machine to play a much younger man in the initial part of the film, I wanted to bow down in front of the master. <br/><br/>This is one powder keg of a movie with loads of great humour and infectious music. It doesn't matter that it is familiar because it feels like a great home-cooked meal and the Yoda-esque training lessons mirror what life throws at you. This one will definitely make you appreciate the sport that has been demonised and trivialised by WWF."
"santoshfrgt10","8","3","5","3 January 2017"," Great movie !!, but with some Bollywood-ish masala.
","Dangal is a biography of former National Wrestling champion Mahavir Singh Phogat. The performance by Aamir Khan is stellar and also the actors portraying both Geeta & Babita ( both young and mature) are par beyond excellence. But this movie like any other typical Bollywood movie plays with true incidents to introduce emotional content for grasping audience. Many incidents portrayed are not true if the context of biography should be taken into account. Ex- the climax where Aamir's character is cunningly locked in a room by Coach Sodhi, which actually never happened. This movie is not only a great entertainer but also showcases how sports and athletics is suffering in India due to backward attitude. It also shows a great deal about women empowerment. I wouldn't say its the best performance of Aamir, but definitely one of his best. <br/><br/>A must watch for all."
"lbenot","10","3","5","2 January 2017"," Rare Entertainment!
","Everything a film should be, but very RARELY is: Entertaining. Just the right sprinkling of humor, inspiring, well-cast, well-acted, well- paced, well-edited - an absolute joy to watch as the story played out to it's conclusion. <br/><br/>The wrestling competition scenes by these young girls were the most believable and realistic sports-action scenes I've seen in ANY movie. Sound track was very good. Subtitles were short and not a distraction to viewing the film at all, and oddly seemed to add to the overall impact and success of the film.<br/><br/>The few photos of the family who lived this story, as the credits rolled, were a delight. As depicted in this film, there are aspects of the Indian culture and family values that are worth emulating. <br/><br/>New Years Day theater was packed. Thank you to AMC for making this limited release gem available at one of your theaters in our area (only one!!?). It deserves a much wider release."

","When I saw the trailer for Dangal, I thought it was going to be above average at best. Then the movie was released and I heard positive reviews all around. On Christmas day, I went with my family and saw the movie. It was stellar, look I can talk about how Amir Khan's acting is brilliant but everything Amir Khan does is brilliant. I have seen this movie twice, the first time around I was blown away by the acting and story. The second time I saw the movie, I tried to pick it apart. I was ready to be bored the second time around, but I simply was not. The second time I appreciated the cinematography, and how things played out. The screenplay was beautifully written. Even though the movie is over two hours, it does seem like it. It flows pretty consistently. There is just enough drama throughout the movie to keep it interesting, but not to much to overwhelm it. Also I would like to add that this is not a typical Bollywood flick. I really like where the film industry is going. The action scenes were so alluring to look at. They were not big jump cuts in between each action scene. I don't have to say anything about the actors who played Geetha and Babita, they were amazing in their respectable roles. Overall, if you want to get inspired or want to watch an amazing bio-pick, I would highly recommend you watch it. I really hope that this at least gets nominated for Oscars."
"Yankee_annie","10","3","5","25 December 2016"," Now thats what I call a masterpiece cinema. My gym instructor persuaded me to watch this.

But this movie was awesome. Not even for a sec I found it to b boring or unnecessary. This movie is entertaining n inspiring. The screenplay n editing is superb. Not at all predictable n without any clichés inspite of being a biopic. The best part  was Mr Aamir's acting. I think without Mr Aamir, bollywood wud hav been crap. Bollywood sucks without Mr Aamir. The effort n passion the actor possess is beyond reachable by any bollywood actor. I really liked the child actors. The 2nd child actor was cute n very believable. The 1st child actor really did some awesome wrestling scenes with swaggering attitude. The direction was awesome too. A perfect Christmas gift. Thanks Mr Aamir."
"debmalya-dgp","9","3","5","25 December 2016"," My take on Dangal
","The film industry has churned out a slew of sports films this year, ranging from Saala Khadoos to Sultan, from Budhia Singh to MS Dhoni.<br/><br/>2016 ends with the release of the much awaited Aamir Khan starrer 'Dangal', helmed by Nitesh Tiwari who previously made 'Chillar Party' and 'Bhoothnath Returns'. Dangal is based on the true story of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat who trained his daughters to become world-class grapplers. The movie is set in Balali,Haryana where daughters are born to be taught household chores and married off at the age of 14. Mahavir Singh Phogat goes against these social norms to build the future of his daughters and complete his unfulfilled dream. <br/><br/>Dangal is a story with mixed emotions. It's a story of humanity at the end of he day. Viewers will at one point feel as if they are watching the journey of the Phogat family and not a movie. The father-daughter bonding is shown beautifully. <br/><br/>Director Nitesh Tiwari and the writers have done a splendid job. The wrestling scenes are choreographed brilliantly. As far as the performances go, Aamir Khan looks the part. The opening scene where he wrestles with a state level champion is superb which sets the tone of the movie. After the 'Chak De' girls, come the 'Dhaakad' girls and they are a real treat to watch. The performances lift the movie tremendously.<br/><br/>The movie patronizes nationalism over feminism. It shows the true essence of being a world class champion. Chora hoye ya chori gold toh gold hi hota hai. Overall, Dangal is a delightful gift this Christmas and should not be ignored at any cost."
"vkalchuri","9","3","5","26 December 2016"," Dangal Review
","Dangal Review:- I believe that movies with longer shelf life's are getting lesser day by day..there are very few movies which qualifies into that category that urges you to stop and watch them whenever you found them while changing any movie channelsI am pleased to announce one more entrant into category which is the latest AK blockbuster  Dangal. AK has been 5th time lucky with his December release Last time when you have seen AK at the village backdrop you were cheering him for the nail biting cricket match and I am sure this time you would do that for his daughter thrilling wrestling techniques, as he moved into much mature real time character Mahavir Singh Phogat. Not in a single frame you found him glamorous but still he manages to steal the show just by his sheer flawless performance n into the character approach. Mind you this movie is far beyond any comparison with Sallu Bhai Sultan, except for Harynavi & Bajaj Scooter. This one apart from giving you many insight about wrestling as a game (points 1, 3 &5 was explained very well) also deals very beautifully about the father-daughter relationship along with social hurdles for a women wrestlers. All in you could found a different AK with various shades of father, coach, mentor, wrestler etc. and the dialogue delivery from him that too in Haryanvi style was just a killerwith various inspirational and true to life messages. The movie is lengthy but with amazing screenplay, balanced 1st and 2nd halves, great supporting cast it makes the overall experience joyful n memorable right from beginning till end. Moreover even though the songs are not chart busters but it was superbly placed and it gels properly with the flow of the story and you would never found people moving out of the halls for some refreshments even when the songs are being screened. Daler Mehndi voiced title track which keeps coming in between pumps you with excitement n energy. Very well written and well sung. The second half was a clash between father ideology and daughter's approach which was so well portrayed and the father vs daughter wrestling and the climax was just mind-blowing. The new director had done full justice to the script and characters, from the opening scene of the movie one could very well judge his caliber and could hope that he keeps up the good work in his next venture otherwise he would be also gone missing like director of Sarforash. The pre- climax discussion between AK and his daughter will reminds you of Chak De 70 mint. But this time it was more emotional and realistic in Haryanvi style. Dangal's Mahavir Singh gives you many take awaythat a person with strong conviction could change anythingjust look at his confidence and belief during talking with butcher at meat shopI can only be a father or a coach at one point of time""Dangal ladnay se pehalay daar se ladana pedtha hai""etc there are many more and shouldn't be missed. All the sport biopic Chak DeBhaag Milkha BhaagMS Dhoni and this one too sends out a very strong message that ""Success is sweet but its secret is sweat""!! Do watch this Dhakad movie and I promise that you will come out from the hall with happiness all around."

","I'm not a Bollywood fan, so I went along expecting to have a nap. But wow! I really enjoyed this movie. It's well paced, very enjoyable and totally non-Bollywood.<br/><br/>No music scores to slow the pace down; no love interest; no ridiculous fighting scenes; no shrieking female singing voice. Just a good story that keeps you guessing to the end. I enjoyed the humour, and surprisingly, it pulled on my heart strings. The music score was enjoyable and not a distraction. It was limited to incidental music that played during the montages.<br/><br/>The 'fight scenes' were limited to wrestling matches, which were really amazingly choreographed. These were realistic and believable, and the hero didn't always win because she was the hero.<br/><br/>Enjoyed this thoroughly, more than all the (Hollywood) movies I watched this year."

There is no dragging in the script of the film and each and every scene is tailored to perfection.<br/><br/>Since it is a film by Aamir Khan you would have high expectation and this film will break all the bars that you would keep while entering the movie theater.<br/><br/>Before intermission and after intermission this film is gold.<br/><br/>It's a film with two great messages and view-able by everyone."

To some extent it will help people in backward India to improve their awful India n culture for example: killing women, raping women, unfair opportunity for women to choose their career and life.

This movie is nowhere to win Filmfare let alone Oscars. <br/><br/>Another Over-hyped Bollywood Movie . 6/10 It doesn't mean if there is Aamir Khan in movie It has to be best.

","At best an average movie from a technical perspective but audience would still find it engaging because of the lack of competition in serious and honest movie category in bollywood. The subject matter is definitely intriguing for the Global Audience but that's the end of the good stuff.<br/><br/>There are a lot of problems in the movie but the biggest one is that the story is not really cinematic. The second act has some real moments which are engaging but The third act is very weak and the conflict with the coach was shoehorned to keep up the ante for the protagonist (which not very surprisingly was Aamir Khan's character instead of the two girls who fought their way to the top of World Wrestling).<br/><br/>The movie is chock-full clichés.

","after the first half hour i really wanted to be it longer.I am not an expert movie critic.i just enjoy watching movies.i will say there is over dramatize scenes in the movie still i liked it for example at the final match the father being locked down even that wasn't in the real story still nice touch to show that the character Geeta can win this match on her own without her fathers help.unlike we used to it.maybe that was real story.the character young Geeta came forward to me .maybe that's because of the events at that time period. she was cute, beautiful and also bad-ass character.entering wrestling area in slow motion were the moments i enjoyed.feel proud of her like someone i know.i felt the same for Zaira Wasim when i saw Jennifer Lawrence at winters bone.Zaira Wasim will be a big star i imagine.it s a good movie to watch with family.its something inspiring.as for Aamir Khan i always admire actors to gain weight or loose for the role.he stands in a very natural way as a father.well played caring father and hard coach.Fatima Sana Shaikh also played good her role .she makes you feel that she is going out of her purpose and loosing her form.at this moment she will make you say 'come on go to your home. let your father train you'.on the other hand when the characters grow up and need to replace with new actors or actresses,i don't say wait till they grow up and continue with them.i know that's to much to ask as an audience but at least you can look for resemblance when choosing players. that's not only for this movie,generally.that was the only moment i said i am watching a movie.other than that the movie takes you in the story.yet Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Sanya Malhotra and Aparshakti Khurana well played their role.as i said that's not an expert credit.so it has a good story, well played characters.there is too much to say but it s something you wont regret to spend your time.go watch and enjoy it.certainly i will watch this movie again."

","Dangal is a very charming bio pic, I have been a fan of Aamir Khan's work ever since watching ""3 idiots"" and have since been a fan of many Indian films, which gets me quite excited to see this film. Dangal is well acted, directed, the music was great as well, but it seems to lack the depth that was so captivating in Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots or even in the more recent movie ""PK"".<br/><br/>As a real-life inspired bio pic this film couldn't have been done any better, it is a feel good story and focuses heavily on a father- daughter relationship, an element of the film that brings lots of emotions to the table. As many of Aamir's work there are often these very emotional elements and like he has done before he has succeeded in this film. This is an inspiring story and a very empowering film as well. The narrative flow of the story was good and I thought that the song choices were spot on, really helps building the emotions in this film.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan's acting was amazing and so are the other Indian stars who I am unfamiliar with. Because of Indian film's tendencies to last for long durations there really is a chance to tell this story in immense detail which helped to elevate its narrative without drifting away into any irrelevant details. But that really is all that is to say about this particular film, it works well as a sports/drama biopic and is well made, the thing is there is nothing much to it other than that, Aamir Khan's film has a tendency to explore important ideas and to really be able to delve deep into them, while there is the central theme of sexism in India and acts as a powerful social commentary unlike his previous bouts this really isn't as inspiring. <br/><br/>So in conclusion this is an amazing film and deserves many praises however I feel that there is a definite room for improvement."

The best part about this flick is the one and only Aamir Khan himself who is known as a perfectionist of Bollywood when it comes to giving best films to the box office. After two years of super blockbuster film ""PK"" 2014 where Aamir unleashed all the limits of his perfectionism, he is back with a bang again along with his 2016's super powerful flick ""Dangal"" which is a story about a former wrestler champion Mahavir Singh Phogat and his efforts for training his own daughters Geeta and Babita who are India's most well known and celebrated female wrestlers who have also garnered medals in Commonwealth Games. The flick is starring Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra. The film has already hit the theater's on December 23, 2016.

Aamir's honest dedication<br/><br/>Mr. Perfectionist (Aamir Khan) is a keen actor when it comes to exhibit the authenticity of his character in any of his film. In this film Dangal, Aamir has to exhibit one character in two different physiques according to the demand of script in which he plays both young and old Mahavir Singh's character which again has a twist. The young Mahavir Singh in an athletic, muscular and broad shouldered physique whereas the old Mahavir Singh who trains his own daughters for wrestling is a fat, chubby, over weight and pot bellied personality of 97 kg. To play such an overweight personality, Aamir ate whatever he wanted and put on weight to reach 97 kg almost 100 kg and then he prepared himself to lose weight to get back to a fit and muscular physique with six packs to play the young Mahavir wrestler's role. This is what we call honest dedication by an honest actor. Amir Khan fans always wait eagerly for his master flicks because this perfect actor always come up with an excellent and exceptional script to keep his fans and viewers engaged. ""Dangal"" the biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat wrestler is not only about his athletic career but also about his inspirational journey as a father and a trainer of his own daughters who are India's well known female wrestlers."

The stars of the movie remain the two little girls that portray Geeta and Babita. The first half is a master piece.

"banerjeenirmalya","9","2","3","10 January 2017"," Inches away from greatness
","This is the journey of a resolute father pitching his girls in the unfamiliar sporting arena dominated by men wrestling with stern opponents as well as the prevalent norms of our society. Director Nitesh Tiwari's ""Dangal"" is the back story of two sisters, Geeta and Babita's claim to fame in the international wrestling arena. The story starts with their Father Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former National Champion in Wrestling, who nurtures the aspiration that one day his to be born son will fulfill his unfulfilled dream. The dream of bringing gold medal for the country in an international event. But destiny had other plans and the couple were blessed with girl children for four consecutive times. Having given up on his aspirations, a twist of fate enables Mahavir to get rid of the social shackles and urges him to pursue his ambition with his two elder girls - Geeta and Babita. Thus begins the arduous journey of the Haryanvi Wrestler and his two daughters battling with society's gender stereotyping, social taboos and the administration's pathetic disposition towards sports.<br/><br/>Thus begins the compelling tale of the trio which keeps you engaged throughout. The script indeed was the real hero and the team of Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Shreyans Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra did a commendable job. The crux of filming a biopic is all about selecting the interesting events and leaving out the dull bits. Here the selections are spot on. The point at which the placid man turns tyrant and wakes up the girls at the crack of the dawn along with imposing draconian measures like abstaining them from TV shows or spicy foods and even cropping their hair sets the mood of the story. Songs do play a very vital part in narrating the plot. What could have been a stressing training regime was depicted in wry rustic humour in the Haryanvi hip hop and rap ""Hanikarak Bapu"". Daler Mehendi's rendition of the title track as well as Dhakkad chip in perfectly. Kudos to good use of music by Pritam and soulful lyrics by Amitabha Bhattacharya. The Tughlaq like arrogance was brought out well in Aamir but the same got redeemed as well. The scene where Geeta and Babita's schoolmate explains that ""atleast your Father is thinking about you"" is beautifully brought out. The chemistry after a change of perspective of the girls was even more riveting. <br/><br/>The crisis in the script was well injected. The tussle and the mental separation between Mahavir and the young Geeta (Fatima) heightened the tension. The peak was reached during the rumble between the two and it is one of the finest scenes ever. But the plot got a bit derailed during the closing quarter of the movie. The antagonist angle appeared a bit clumsy with unnecessary exchange of words often making a mockery out of the head coach. The concluding doses of inspiration seemed way over the top. Mahavir shouting out amongst the crowd for Geeta may have got along fine in an Akhada but not definitely in a Commonwealth stadium. The National Anthem angle was unnecessarily introduced and the scene failed to create any sort of cinematic impact. The little girl shouting out ""Bharat Mata ki Jai "" finally reiterated the fact that it's a Bollywood movie. Was Aamir Khan trying to make it up for his ""intolerance"" remark? The overdose of jingoism and machismo deprived the movie from it's pristine effort of being a rare sports film in the history of world cinema. Yes you read that right, World Cinema. <br/><br/>Regarding the execution, a 51 year old Aamir Khan with his beefy physique and grey hair plays the stubborn Mahavir to perfection. He literally lived the role displaying great authority and austere training skills. Sakshi as Mahavir's wife gives a controlled yet strong performance. Fatima and Saniya are discoveries with tons of acting talent. Zahira Wasim as the child Geeta and Suhani Bhatnagar as the child Babita are the ones who will be etched in our memory for long.Ritwik Sahore as the girl's cousin Omkar with his deadpan looks and comic timing impresses all. The film is probably the most authentic sports film ever made in India and full credit goes to Tiwari and cinematographer Sethu Sriram for detailing finer aspects of wrestling without pissing off. To conclude Dangal loses it's hold of greatness but nevertheless is a fine movie. Do watch it."

"reachrajdream","8","2","3","9 January 2017"," Screenplay and based on true story tag made it Good from ordinary story
","What stands out in this movie is Screenplay and based on true story tag(maintains the awe of how real people went through this all through), never gives a feel of ordinary simple story. AK is a marketing genius on good content.The 2 standout event in the screenplay really made the story gripping driven by reason are below which is inspiring. 1. The daughters hitting the harassers and AK spotting their wrestling talent. 2. Accepting forced wrestling life as far better then dumb wedded life.<br/><br/>The richness and quality in production has made this ordinary story presentable. The Commonwealth games(US, China and Russia are not part of it) for India is always a cakewalk right from 1960's but still Women achieving in wrestling for the first time from village is commendable(Geetha's younger sister also won silver in the same event(2010 Common wealth games) portrayed in movie and she herself won bronze in world wrestling championship which is more greater then this as its world level competition). AK and Coach conflicting in their instructions to Geetha is interesting. The last scene which has AK locked in room is little dramatic but still reasonable and bearable.<br/><br/>AK acting is subtle as usual with the hype of stout and slim combo, his cameo as young AK is a relief in the epilogue.Just wondering and admiring how he got evoluted so better after his first 15 years movies(good that he survived with less hits until then) after Lagaan(2001). Pre Lagaan many of his movies are just copy/inspired from Hollywood movies(nevertheless he didn't write/direct them indeed) like The Godfather, It happened one night, On the Waterfront, win a Date with Tad Hamilton, Kramer Vs Kramer, An Affair to remember. He has come a long way and learned it the hard way, but now made it bigger with his sincerity. Also surprised by his feminist and out of box movies with less importance to heroism. I think he got better over the age and bangs every time on December release right from TZP. Just like TZP AK has underplayed himself which is great. Still wondering how AK strikes balance between box office and critics. Bangs on Bulls eye as usual for AK this time."
"sivathexpandable","8","2","3","8 January 2017"," A very nice(fictional...I say) Bio pic I have ever seen
","At first, I would like to say that this is a very interesting(fictional-there's a reason) Bio-picture. But this movie is getting too much praise than it actually deserves. <br/><br/>The reason I said fictional because some of the events did not happen. I think most of our Indians realized just now(after watching this movie) that this movie is about nationalism, women empowerment and Sports and they should need this kind of movies and they started posting in social media and praising this movie, giving more attention than it deserves. I agree that this movie is good, it deserves our attention but it's not an eye-opener and it's not a ""one in a million movie"".<br/><br/>I would say this movie's concept is similar to one of the top 250 movies(IMDb) ChakDe India. The words like Nationalism, Sportsmanship, women empowerment better suits 'ChakDe India' rather than Dangal. If you are an Aamir Khan's Fan then I would suggest you watch this movie. The casting was good, this is not a one-man show. And one more thing, this movie is complete sports domestic drama with emotions mixed. Finally, Dangal is a good movie but not the best movie."
"oommenabraham","9","2","3","4 January 2017"," Thumbs up for Dangal
","An American entertainer/comic actor, Late Andy Kaufman once said that "" there is no drama like wrestling"" and truly Aamir Khan and his team has cashed in this concept with 'Dangal'. There was not a single person without moist eyes as the curtains dropped in the theater. In one of the climax scene when the national anthem was played- many stood up (some with emotions and some due to peer pressure...) and applauded when one of the main protagonist wins the wrestling title. Dangal is based (partially) on a real life story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughter, Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. <br/><br/>Soundtrack of the movie is very earthy and so are the lyrics. Credits goes to the versatile Amitabh Bhattacharya who penned the beautiful songs and the music is composed by Pritam Chakraborty. The director (Nitesh Tiwari) and writer (Shreyas Jain) - without hammering the thought into the audience brain, beautifully pass on the message of gender equality and importance of hard work and patience.One of the main hero of the movie is the narrative style story telling and the acting of all the lead actors. <br/><br/>This movie is worth a watch!! May this new year begins for all of us with the message that - There is no short cuts to success. You need to put in your blood and sweat in achieving your goals and have lot of patience to reach the summit in life."
"ashprofessionalways","9","2","3","3 January 2017"," Of wars, ringside and beyond
","Mahavir Phogat leaves the sport at a point with some more to offer to it and some more to receive from it. This incomplete arc leaves a bitter taste on his soul, that just wouldn't go with the eflux of time. It just assumes another form; yearning. The yearning accrues into something bigger, a dream. A dream for a progeny- a son to complete his aspiration, carry his legacy forward. This dream keeps accruing in desperation through the birth of every daughter, till it comes to an eventual halt of acceptance at the birth of the fourth. He genuflects before destiny's hand in fashioning a future in a direction converse to his dream. A few years later, providence springs a surprise at him, in the form of his daughters. As it turns out, they're wrestlers too like their big man. This is enough for him to dust off his locked dream. And he goes after it like a marooned man at a wild boar. Redemption was all that he wanted- the elusive Olympic gold -and begetting a son was the means and not the end to it. Thus begins a fascinating journey of a father who goes on to live his dream vicariously through the achievements of his two daughters.<br/><br/>Dangal is set in a patriarchal system we're so used to despising, just that instead of wrestling had it been cooking and if he was a cook and his ambition was to make it to Masterchef it wouldn't have gained the national veto of being an invigorating movie; especially for families with girl children. As graceful and ambitious as the man was, his underlying chauvinism cannot be ignored. Mahavir manipulates his dreams into theirs, his aspirations to theirs at an impressionable age. They become the monks who're forced into their renunciation to pursue his nirvana. There's something preposterous about sporting achievements- don't know about other countries, but definitely in this part of the world -that colours personal accolades as pride of a nation. Bigger the arena, bigger its subversion into patriotism. Any sport is a spectator event dependent on the emotional gullibility of its fan to thrive. So naturally when a nation is pitted against another at its behest, the similar bifurcation happens in the stands as well. Cheering for a sportsperson representing a nation blurs into national solidarity. For it is the most convenient display of patriotism unlike paying taxes and taking bullets.<br/><br/>Can't remember the last time a lead man walked the screen, so naked of vanity to bring credence to a portrayal.There's a thin line that runs between egotism and mentoring, Aamir Khan's Phogat treads this with absolute precision bringing dignity,grace and empathy to a grumpy man who speaks economically, while constantly finding himself torn between taming his inner demons and his little devils on mud pitches. It's this ego he seeks validation of when he spars with his non abiding elder daughter. Her tresses are shoulder length, her manoeuvres revised. She's no longer the creature of his fashioning, his dreams have dissolved in her indulgences. Age doesn't blunt his resentment- even if it has managed to make his weary limbs, clumsily slow -as he continues to spar. She comes on top and he loses. But this isn't one of those vanilla tropes from mainstream films, where the after taste of a man's loss to his own child is sweet. The sight of a muddy old Phogat gasping for breath in humiliation as his elder daughter stands to taunt is anything, but that. Wrestling transcends beyond the pitch between the two.<br/><br/>There's a scene where Phogat finds himself before a archaic table in a sports federation, he's there to seek funds to support the training of his daughters. The officer in front talks to him in haryanvi almost. Almost because majority of his mouth is in the service of grinding a mothi laddoo from a box he's received from the desperate man before him. He nonchalantly explains the paucity of funds with finger movements for neglected sports like wrestling, especially for women, mockingly. A frustrated Phogat begins to rant about why India fares poorly in the Olympics, when he's cut midway by the officer's abrupt exit for lunch.<br/><br/>It is scenes like this that bring out the odds that were stacked against the real Phogat, the numerous fights he had to take outside the ring- with the condescending villagers, the purists of the game, a sporting system content of mediocrity -to get his daughters into it.It is a story which needed to be told. Dangal tells this story with utmost integrity without circumventing around its protagonist like a demigod. Unlike the Dhoni biopic, which felt like a litany of montages shot for Chivas Regal promotions than a movie, Dangal doesn't sidestep the grey shades of its central characters.It in fact for the most part keeps away from the temptation to celebrate them, instead tells a story that deserves to be celebrated. Even if not for the anthem that played in the final moments, I stood as the end credits began to roll, to doff my hat to- the movie, the people who made it and the ones it was made on. It is that kind of a movie that gets to you. Think it would to most, given the reception it got in the theatre I watched."

"rspringer-01241","9","1","1","22 September 2018"," From www.thegby.com
","We chose Dangal, a biopic about Mahavir Singh Phogat and his daughters, Geeta and Babita. Mahavir (Aamir Khan) is a former wrestler who had to forego his sport to support his family. Even though he is living out his dreams through his children he also gives them a future full of choices. Training also allows them to form a close relationship, which is uncommon in their culture. It is interesting to see the girls learn to appreciate their father as they grow from young girls (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) to young women (Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra). As Geeta and Babita begin to embrace their training, they become more confident and competitive. Mahavir endures the taunts of his village and wrestling peers while having continued confidence and pride in his daughters. The matches are exciting and visceral, I felt myself holding my breath. When Geeta begins training with Coach Kadam (Girish Kulkarni) she seems to lose her edge, which returns when she reconnects with her father. The relationship between the father/coach and the National coach demonstrates how small and petty men can be. The original music gives depth to the storyline."

","Okay, so, I'm an American who has no ties to the Indian Film Industry nor to Bollywood but I love to watch their movies. I've religiously watched Bollywood for the past 3 years and I have not seen a movie so balanced with family and sport and female empowerment than this one. Maybe 'Mary Kom' but even that didn't give me the chills that 'Dangal' produced. 
Geeta and Babita stole my heart, especially when they were younger and just embarking on their journey as wrestlers. The most poignant scene, for me, comes when they were still in their youth, learning a lesson of gratitude that they were blind to before. 
Indian films, in general, make you more aware of how important family is and after watching this it made me think of things differently that my mom had done to me when I was younger, all in the desire to make me a stronger woman. I love this movie so much for that message, the message that a woman can be just as strong, if not stronger, than any man or foe she is against. 
I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so just go watch the movie and realize for yourself how amazing it truly is."
"classicsoncall","7","1","1","4 March 2018"," ""You have to fight in a way that people remember you.""
","Most of the reviewers for this film here on IMDb appear to be folks of Indian background; nothing wrong with that but with most of them offering glowing praise and a '10 rating, it's difficult to get a true perspective on the movie. I thought it was OK, though not a '10' rated film by any means. The picture utilizes a tried and true sports movie formula depicting a rigorous training schedule, a demanding coach and notable accomplishments along the way before the principal character encounters some roadblocks on the way to a Commonwealth Games gold medal. There's also the idea of success achieved by defying conventional thinking, in the way Geeta Phogat (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and her sister Babita (Sanya Malhotra) rise to prominence in the traditionally male sport of wrestling. That's perhaps the film's best takeaway, as the girls in question endured a lot of physical and mental anguish to achieve their goals, thereby serving as role models for other young women to follow.<br/><br/>I couldn't help thinking however, that if the setting for this film was present day America, the father (Aamir Khan) might never have gotten past the first month of training his daughters because someone would have turned him in for child abuse. Cutting the girls' hair and restricting their diet would have gotten someone to notice, and Mahavir slapping his young nephew Omkar for some slight was totally uncalled for. It might not have appeared so bad if the man had lightened up his approach from time to time but his expression was always so grim it looked like he was mad at the world. One could say that his style eventually paid off in the end, but the emotional toll on his daughters, especially Geeta, could have been avoided with a more 'fatherly' approach. <br/><br/>The one American film this most reminded me of was 1984's ""The Karate Kid"", but without a bully opponent and with national prestige at stake in the tournament matches. The film makers for that earlier movie put together a compelling and entertaining story in just about two hours, The additional forty minutes of screen time in ""Dangal"" is padded by repetitious scenes of training activity in the early part of the story that aren't all that necessary, while others are characteristically set to a musical accompaniment that seems to be a trademark of Hindi films. I did like the realism involved in staging the wrestling matches throughout the story, and the climactic final match was filled with suspense. With seconds to go, one will recall Mahavir's earlier explanation of the point scoring system, fully hoping that Geeta would somehow manage a five point take-down to insure a victory. The fact that this movie was based on the real life story of Mahavir Phogat and his wrestling daughters make it all the more fascinating."

","While I understand Aamir khan is just an actor who is portraying a role, I find it highly hypocritical that he does TV shows like satya meva jayate, the essence is to fight for human rights and equality of gender. It is so disgusting how 9.5 out of 10 Indians like this movie without realizing how a failed wrestler is enforcing his will on to his innocent girls. I get it girls can do whatever boys can do ideology but this is not about equal rights this is about free- will. A human be it a girl or a boy has a right to live his or her life without someone telling them what to do with their lives. I wanted to be a doctor but i turned out to be a successful software engineer, I do well with my life but I'm not satisfied. Point is Indian society is succumbed to the idea of do what parents tell you, your life is like a car driven by your parents, what you really want to do doesn't matter in most cases. This ideology has to change. Like how will Smith in pursuit of happiness says to his ""don't ever let tell you what to do with your life, if you want to be something just go get it"". We should let kids achieve whatever they want to achieve rather than enforcing your will into the kids. I know a lot of people will not understand my stance, I'm hoping someone rational understands the point and let their kids achieve their own dreams not the parent's.<br/><br/>Acting in the movie is a perfect 10, story is a 5/10 and I wouldn't like to see Aamir khan doing this kind of role, at the end of the day he's an actor but in India actors are role models and semi gods. I want to see a more meaningful movie like taare zameen par from Aamir khan."

Dangal has songs which progress a scene and that worked well with me.<br/><br/>Aamir is such a genius for a reason. He wowed public by making his transformation videos viral. We all thought, he would have many scenes as the fit Aamir khan. But what impresses me is that he went through all that trouble of putting on weight and then losing it through sheer hard work for just one measly scene. Yes, he only has about 5-10 mins of scenes as the Fit and younger Mahavir Phogat.<br/><br/>Yes there are flaws in this film, no film is perfect but that didn't stop me from giving Dangal a 10\10.

Aparshakthi Khurana brings in the comedy.<br/><br/>Hats off to the real life Mahavir Singh Phogat to have had the vision to empower his children, and think differently and uplift the spirits of women by doing what he did with his family. the reason why this is of importance is that in places like Haryana, women still get discriminated, even after India having had a woman Prime Minister and President! <br/><br/>What I really loved too is 2 other things in the movie..<br/><br/>1) the movie is not all serious. There is a lot of humor in a classic, non-offensive style which tells a story about victory in a humorous way. this has become extremely rare. 2) the songs show scenes of prep or training in the movie. this has become a great way to keep the audience fixed to their seat, so they don't just listen to the song and look around or look at their phones. <br/><br/>I hope that this movie gets an Oscar! if Slumdog millionaire can, I don't see why Dangal cannot!"
"namashi_1","7","6","16","23 December 2016"," A Well-Made, Well-Acted Film With A Strong Message!
","After 2 years, Aamir Khan strikes back with 'Dangal'. And here's a film, that proves the superstar's genius yet again! Director Nitesh Tiwari & Aamir team up to tell The affecting true-story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari, to their eventual triumph. Its a film that delivers entertainment & a message that's important & worthy.<br/><br/>'Dangal' explores Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two wrestler daughters' struggle towards glory at the Commonwealth Games in the face of societal oppression.<br/><br/>'Dangal' is about the human spirit & that talent & passion don't come under any particular gender. If your a Man, you can achieve impossible goals & if your a Woman, you achieve the very same. 'Dangal' is about Mahavir Singh Phogat's courageous journey & how against all odds, he trained his daughters & made them GOLD in the world of wrestling. Early on in the film, Mahavir, who sadly quits wrestling after his father's discouragement, says ""only my son can make my dream come true"". But he has four daughters despite his willing to have a son. To his astonishment, one fine day, when two bruised boys come to complain after receiving a beating by his girls, he realizes his daughters (now teenagers) have the power & punch to rule in the ring. And thus, begins Mahavir's journey with his daughters that leads to history.<br/><br/>'Dangal' is an important film, that is a wake up of call for all those, who underestimate women as a lesser sex. Women are powerful, strong & capable & at par with Men. We cheer for Geeta & Babita as they fight against all odds & your heart goes for Mahavir, who sees his dream come true through his daughters. <br/><br/>The first-hour soars. Its a joy to watch the daughters get entangled in the world of wrestling & also inspiring to see them grow. You're engrossed by the passion Mahavir trains them with & how they grow as people & wrestlers. <br/><br/>The second-hour slows down for a bit & that's where 'Dangal' falters. The sports movie clichés come in & the angle of a unlikable coach (played by Girish Kulkarni) doesn't really work. For a film that starts off with such precision & keeps you glued to your seat all through the first-hour, suddenly turns predictable. Also, Geeta's arrogance towards Mahavir & Family, don't stir up the emotions one might expect. But, things come back with force with a terrific finale, that will leave you cheering. Watching Geeta become India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she wins the gold medal, is something to be witnessed. <br/><br/>Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain & Nikhil Meharotra's Screenplay adapts an inspiring true-story, into an equally inspiring film. Though imperfect due to its clichés & some melodrama, the soul of 'Dangal' remains strong. The message of the film, to be honest, is even bigger than the film itself. The Writers deserve credit for delivering a story that celebrates women as 'heroes' & also, fatherhood. Nitesh Tiwari's Direction is very-well done. He's handled some of the film's most dramatic & emotional sequences, skillfully. Cinematography & Editing are quite good. Pritam's Score is fabulous. Art & Costume Design are perfect, while the wrestling sequences (done by Sham Kaushal) are raw & effective.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Aamir Khan is the heart of 'Dangal'. His physical transformation from fit to fat, to his nicely done haryanvi accent, is note-worthy. But its his eyes & body-language that touch you. He is wonderful as a man who'd stop at nothing to see his dreams come true & at the same time, lend pride to his daughters' achievements. Aamir delivers one of his finest performances to date! Sakshi Tanwar, as Aamir's wife, is marvelous. She's remarkably restrained. Fatima Sana Shaikh as Geeta Phogat, is excellent. And watching her wrestle, looks as real as it could get. Sanya Malhotra as Babita Kumari, is fabulous. She gets a smaller role in comparison to Sana, but shines all through. Zaira Wasim as young Geeta & Suhani Bhatnagar as young Babita, are adorable. They steal some of the best moments in the film. Aparshakti Khurrana is lovable & so is the actor who plays his younger self. Girish Kulkarni is okay. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Dangal' isn't perfect & yet its an important film, that delivers a strong & important message. Definitely, worth a watch!"
"abir-banerjee","6","3","7","16 January 2017"," Not happy.
","Dangal is the most overrated film I have watched in a very long time. Every unbiased movie lover, I think, would agree to the fact that the cinematic representation is not any different from any sports related movie you pick, be it Gavin O'Connor's ""Miracle"" or Shimit Amin's ""Chak De India"". There goes your point for originality. Now if we take the ""Biographical"" thing into account then the film at most can be described as ""Inspired by real life events"". Winning at the last round at the last moment may be more adrenaline rushing for the audience but that, in my opinion, is demeaning for the athlete who originally won the game 1-0, 7-0. Talking of demeaning, the way sports persons have been depicted in the film is something to talk about. The fake things that are shown in the movie in the name of cinematic liberty just for the sake of creating sympathy in the audience, be it locking up Mr. Phogat in a room during finals or the Australian player's interview, both are very against Sportsman spirit. Aamir Khan's dedication is unquestionable, he also is a good actor. He took great efforts to look like a wrestler for so little screen time. All the talks of perfection and look at overweight actress who played the Australian wrestler. Does she even have an athlete's physique? An entire film can not be made with one dedicated actor. There are also contradictory statements about women's equality in the movie, which I am not going into much details as this is a ""biographical movie"". At least let's not hurt other's emotion just to make one person look like a hero when dealing with real people. In our country it's a very dangerous thing to affect people's emotion in a wrong way. I feel bad for the real NSA coach of Geeta Phogat."
"Renjith-0099","5","3","7","4 January 2017"," Aamir Khan was amazing movie is just average
","The performance of Aamir Khan in the movie is more than impressive. He is the best of Hollywood superstars; there is no scope left for disputes about that. Other than that the movie is full of melodrama and predictable twists. There is not a single scene in the movie that surprised me. It was all too predictable. The dramatization of the real incidents kind of made those totally different from the facts. Some light humour in the early part of the movie was impressive. Performance of the entire cast was exceeding expectations. <br/><br/>The national anthem and patriotic scenes to the end of the movie sounded like an apology from Aamir for the stupid things he said last year. All in all the movie is a good watch and value for money. Nothing so great or must watch about it."

But Mahavir with his strong determination & experience help Geeta to overcome all these obstacles. Finally Geeta reach in the final. Aamir Khan & his team successfully make the audience a part of this journey and give them a learning experience. Thanks to director to keep the subject simple.Nothing special to say about camera work except these wrestling scenes. Same thing about editing. Music is used appropriately in this film. You cannot ignore these songs. A good film at the end of the year."
"rusia-aman","7","4","11","26 December 2016"," Not a must watch, but throughout entertaining
","A martinet father, two young girls and a story to instill fear of disrespecting elders. <br/><br/>This is not a movie to promulgate importance of girl child, neither is it a movie to bolster the idea of equality between boys and girls. This is a movie on discipline, being abstinent from worldly pleasures, and on being a believer of conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>This is not a documentary, so don't watch it with the eyes of scrutinizing validity of events. <br/><br/>Is it funny? Only a few bits here and there were. It was not a laugh riot like PK.<br/><br/>Is it emotional? Will you cry? Only if young you had faced a strict disciplinarian father. <br/><br/>Will you be bored? Not at all. Time will fly, thanks to optimal story pace, supporting characters, and sense of learning wrestling with the girls in the movie."

","Nitesh Diwari's Dangal becomes a inspirational sports drama. Fatima Sana Shaikh impersonates Geeta Phogat in this biographical film. Amir Khan plays her father, and Sanya Malhotra portrays her sister. The real life story of Geeta Phogat has created headlines in the wrestling world. India has had a weak reputation in international wrestling, and female athletes, in particular, face oppressive social taboos. Three Indian states could show the movie tax free because it resonates rich tenets of fatherhood, sisterhood, family, and determination. Amir Khan Productions and Walt Disney Pictures would spend a budget of just ~1.2 million USD and gross ~11 million USD due to the popularity!"
"mailtosrikanth","9","2","4","30 January 2017"," Dangal - Extraordinary Movie
","Yet another perfect movie from the perfectionist. Dangal gives you a peek in to people's lives who have a commitment towards sport and passionate towards nation but also the problems they face while they fulfill their dreams. Entire cast Aamir, Sakshi, Fatima, Saanya, Zaira and Suhani did an excellent job and justice to their roles. Needless to say Aamir excels to do what he is good at and keeps you occupied with his intense acting. The female leads (especially the younger and older Geeta) were awesome in their roles when it comes to the tackle scenes be it in the mud or on the turf. The camera work capturing fights in the bout needs a special mention here as they stand out and gives you a treat of a real combat between two wrestlers. For those who saw the trailers multiple times the first half is an easy guess about what happens next, but otherwise the movie is excellent piece of work by the entire crew of Dangal. Full marks to the Director, Aamir and his girls."
"SumanShakya","8","2","4","21 January 2017"," Dangal: an inspirational movie
","With word of mouth, you may have all known what a big hit ""Dangal"" became lately and the critical accolades the film received. Instead of taking the promotions for granted, I insist you to watch this film first.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story of an Indian wrestler, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trains his two daughters, Gita and Babita, to win the international level wrestling competitions. It's commendable that few film makers have started to make movies on the real heroes of the country, whose tales of heroism are often unheard of. It takes a story from a small village of Haryana and takes it to an international milieu. Many are relating this movie with year's another hit, ""Sultan."" But these two films are in no way to be compared of. Though both the films are on wrestling, ""Dangal"" explores many entities like the social discrimination on girls, state of sports federation, father daughter relationships.<br/><br/>Where the film explores the wrestling arena from a small Haryana village to a national level training centre, the film is also filled with emotions, wit, and other finer nuances of life. Aamir Khan as usual is good, but the two girls as Geeta and Babita both were outstanding. Watched this film in theatre, and the audiences were seen applauding when the girls enter the arena and play for their country. The Haryani environment and the dialects used in the film gives it a mesmerizing touch. Just like ""Chakde India"" and ""Mary Kom,"" ""Dangal"" will remain one of the finest sports movies to come lately.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4"

Dil Chahta hai, Lagaan, 3 Idiots, Taare Zameen Par, PK and now Dangal, he keeps on getting better and better.Rest of the bollywood can learn from Aamir on how to make a biopic.<br/><br/>Fatima and Sanya were also great and completely in the skin of their characters Geeta and Babita respectively. A great film by a director not very well known in Bollywood. Cheers to the Dangal team for creating such a superb movie and giving audience a fantastic experience."

","All i can say here, when in doubt watch a Aamir Khan movie because you know you cant go wrong. He doesn't make much movies, but when he does it gets you talking about his movies for as long as one can.. what more movies like 3Idiots/Ghajini/Lagaan etc which has gone down as one of the finest movies in the Indian Cinema. Back to Dangal, it's by far one of the best biopics ever made over the years. No doubt there were a lot of good movies made in 2016, but this movie was a perfect closure for the year 2016.<br/><br/>Absolutely loved every single bit of the movie right from the direction, screenplay and dialogues were kept real. The movie was gripping right from the start and progressed on the 2nd half. One may forget that you were watching a movie. I know nothing about wrestling nor am i a fan, but this movie will keep you hooked up till the very end. Those girls were absolutely brilliant in their respective roles and well as for Aamir.. He had once again delivered a stupendous performance.The message was clear, gold medalists are not made , they are nurtured . It requires sheer dedication, grit,discipline,support and right attitude to get there and this movie was perfection. So much love for the entire team for an excellent execution and terrific performance. Standing ovation!!"

How can I leave their father? Such a commendable role he has played in their lives. Wait wait.... I'm supposed to talk about the the movie and not Geetha and Babitha's life. ""Well, it's not my mistake"". It's the director's mistake to have a wonderful team and also make us forget that we are in a movie. Aamir khan's dedication and passion towards movies is seen in the film. How can I forget the two champs who have put their heart and soul in this. ""Great going girls"". Background score, and music, though I do not know Hindi, the subtitles itself made the music seem sensible and going side by side with the movie. I loved the theme music of this movie. There was no lag in the movie. Sometimes we find our teachers/gurus being so tough (though this can never be compared with Mahaveer Singh), but what is wrong in that? That's how we nurture Dangal- the girls victory"

","It is indeed very rare to find films of this nature in today's Bollywood cinema. A feel good film that is inspirational from which an individual and even the country can look upon. A film needs to have a strong story line to create an impact and DANGAL provided just that. The audience demands good story/script these days and are willing to watch a movie with strong script even if the actors are not well known. Sadly, there does exist some blind fans who blatantly makes other actors such as Salman Khan movies hit even if those don't have good story in it. DANGAL has strong story, great star cast and good performance. A must watch."

","There's no taking away from the actors, but the real stars here are the team of scriptwriters and the director. There is so much respect for the audience. The use of the voice over/narrator (I've hardly ever seen it in Hindi films) was a stroke of genius though its introduction was delayed and bit abrupt. The writing kept me engaged about a sport that I'm pretty sure most of those watching, like me, knew nothing about.<br/><br/>The choreography, direction and editing, particularly of the last 45 minus led to silence in the theater, where there had been much-appreciated laughter and an emotional connect in the first half of the film. This is what a movie going experience should be - to educate, inform and inspire.<br/><br/>It's established now that Aamir is bankable as a producer and bless him for his choice of material!"
"inforaza","10","2","4","1 January 2017"," Dangal is a masterpiece biopic which is Emotional and Thrilling – and worth watching a 2nd time!
","Dangal is a gem of a Biopic film – an unforgettable classic, in fact! It is a well-made film that will touch your heart and soul. It is a very emotional film (my eyes became wet in some scenes) which will make you fall in love with not just each and every character but also with the sport of female Wrestling. <br/><br/>Dangal is not only emotional but also thrilling and highly inspirational as well! <br/><br/>Dangal is now running to full houses throughout the day in all cinema halls. It is heart-touching film that is a MUST watch - not just once- but a few times, before you die.<br/><br/>MERITS of Dangal<br/><br/>1 – It is a based on a very good story (even if it is fictional it'd still be very, very good). <br/><br/>2 –Dangal is another directorial success by Nitesh Tiwari after his Chillar Party and Boothnath Returns. The Pacing and the Build-up of the story are just perfect!<br/><br/>3 – The background music is OK in general but thrilling on certain occasions. <br/><br/>4 – You feel connected to and moved by each and every character – esp. that of Amir Khan and his brave and bindass daughters. If you watch this film, not just through your eyes, but also through your heart, I am sure your eyes will become moist during some scenes.<br/><br/>5 – Amir Khan has given his heart, body and soul for the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. You will be amazed to see his bodily transformation from a young muscular Mahavir to a pot-belied, grey-haired coach of his daughters, Geeta and Babita. His Haryanvi accent is absolutely perfect. <br/><br/>No wonder Amir Khan is Mr. Perfectionist!<br/><br/>6 – And how can I forget the WRESTLING scenes? Each of the WRESTLING bouts is well-choreographed and well-shot and well-edited too! It's riveting, thrilling and very tense. The close-ups just draws you INTO the action scenes. <br/><br/>You will NOT forget the slo-mo scene of Geeta lifting the Nigerian wrestler from the front and throwing her backwards. It was a thrilling scene! That was the move which won her the Gold medal in the 55 kg in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. <br/><br/>It is indeed a refreshing cinematic experience for all of us, & esp. for the ladies, to see FEMALE WRESTLING on screen and the adrenaline rush it has created in those who've seen it on the big screen.<br/><br/>7 – Zaira Wasim (younger Geeta) and Fatima Seikh (grown up Geeta) fought their wrestling bouts in a very realistic manner. In fact, they were actually trained in Wrestling for several months by a national-level wrestling coach, Kripa Shankar Bishnoi Beniwal. <br/><br/>Hats off to these wonderful actresses for putting in so much hard work to learn the Wrestling moves, to make things look perfect!<br/><br/>FYKI, Fatima was a child artist in Chachi 420 (1997). Remember?<br/><br/>But I wonder why Babita (Sanya Choudhary) did not feature in any wrestling bout? Even then, FYKI, she trained with the other girls for months even though she had extremely short fight scenes. <br/><br/>8 – There are many amusing scenes and dialogues which looks very natural and fits well in the flow of the story, rather than looking out-of-place.<br/><br/>9 – The songs in Dangal are very, very exhilarating. I just love the rustic flavour in each of those songs. I am pretty sure, from now onwards, all Indian wrestlers (current and future ones) will be listening to Dangal songs for motivation before the Wrestling match.<br/><br/>10 – I loved hearing the Haryanvi accent in each of the character; although sometimes it may be difficult to understand. All the actors and actresses have got the accent right - and that is a must to create the right flavour in a story that is also based in Haryana. <br/><br/>11 – You will not feel even a single boring moment during the 2 hr & 40 minutes. Guaranteed!<br/><br/>DEMERITS of Dangal<br/><br/>What demerits? It'd amount to nit-picking if I start finding demerits!<br/><br/>Finally, 2016 was a great year for Hindi cinema. We are fortunate enough to witness some very thoughtful and well-made films that touched our hearts and souls. These films were biopics (Nirja, Dhoni, Dangal, Aligarh) and non-biopics (Pink, Parched, Dear Zindagi)."

","The Phogat Sisters, against all odds, created history for Indian Sports in the year 2010. Though we read about them in the headlines, we hurriedly moved on to other 'more interesting' news. They went on, fighting their battles alone, to bring more than thirty international medals for our country. We saw their names in the news, raised our eyebrows, and refocused back on our game of cricket. They again came, this time with their father, and gave an inspiring small interview on the TV show Satyamev Jayate. This time we sat up a bit, and 'spent' on them, a little 'encouragement clap'.<br/><br/>It finally took a two hours forty nine minutes of full fledged Bollywood feature film to make us at last, give them the applause they have been deserving since long. At last, the magic of cinema and storytelling works and the same we, now open new tabs and start to google about Geeta, Babita and their hero, Mahavir Singh Phogat.<br/><br/>Written by four Ad-professionals including the director Nitish Tiwari, Dangal, hooks you from the very first go. The humorous narrative of the 'sacrificial goat-ish' brother becomes almost addictive till the last scene.<br/><br/>Here's the story of a middle-aged man with unfulfilled dreams who has given in to his defeated life as his ill fate. Until one day when he realizes that all this while the road to all his dreams had lain just in front of him, but it was only his own superfluous beliefs, which had closed his eyes. He quickly corrects himself and now aims for the Sun and no less. So what if it is his sparky girls not 'society-accepted' boys who will achieve this feat for him. So the endearing struggle starts of two unwilling girlish girls ( a brilliant young Geeta played by Zaira Wasim) who are turned into tomboys by their 'haanikaarak' father. It is only at a friend's wedding, that they realise their good luck of having such a man as their father who considers them human enough to love and care about their future. A single dialogue of the little bride voices all those vices to which so many Indian households are still entangled. This struggling phase is very thoughtfully shot in a muddy shade of color by Cinematographer Sethu Sriram.<br/><br/>Adult Geeta and Babita Phogat are flawlessly played by Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra. But Sanya surprisingly has got much lesser vocal and fighting scenes in comparison to Fatima. Although she is kind of sidelined, it is she who shines brighter with her sincere portrayal of silent understandings of the war of emotions happening between her sister and father. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Sanya's Babita is at the end reduced to being just a cheer girl to her sister who solely claims the limelight in the later half of the film. One wonders why, considering Babita Phogat's equal if not more, achievements in her own matches. <br/><br/>Amir Khan is so good as Mahavir Singh Phogat that after a point of time, he makes you forget that he is Amir Khan himself. You only see the character. That calls for an applause. Sakshi Tanwar as the wife, Daya Kaur,the silent support system of her family is wonderful. Her large expressive eyes speak volumes more than spoken words.<br/><br/>Dangal is about wrestling. Wrestling on the on mats. Wrestling inside minds. The wrestle between a visionary father and the 'blind' society he lives in. A blind society 'we' still live in.<br/><br/>Celebrating woman power, bringing hope and rekindling patriotism, is Dangal, a perfect end to a Bollywood year full of strong female protagonists.<br/><br/>Hopefully now, the Haryana Government will consider keeping the promise they made to the Phogat Sisters four years ago and finally pay them the much needed, awaited and deserved, 50 lakhs rupees award."

You've got to admit it no one comes close to Aamir in terms of sheer hard-work and performance so natural that his eyes say more than his words sometimes. Sakshi is mighty effective as the mother torn between her husband and children. The girls the real heroes of this incredible film are out of the world. Superior acting with true grit and determination that shows with utmost sincerity. The kid that plays the nephew and then Aparshakti adds to the surprisingly funny moments you'd normally not expect from a biopic. Special mention to the director Nitish Tiwari who has captained this ship like a seasoned campaigner possibly teaching a lesson or two to some of the more commercial directors.

"McBun1","8","2","4","28 December 2016"," Entertains and Inspires, An Epic Movie for all Ages
","Wow - if I could sum up Dangal in one word, and that wow goes especially to the choreography of the wrestling matches between the character Geetha and her opponents and also on the visual capture of these matches. In terms of sports action in Bollywood, I loved Chakde India but Dangal simply outshined it in that aspect. Maybe I can say that the sports action in Dangal is as good as those from Hollywood, at least in terms of sheer suspense and thrill factor. Dangal is even like a beginner's lesson on what wrestling is for viewers :D and that's because there are scenes in the movie that explains(via Aamir's character to his kids) in an uncomplicated, interesting manner on how the points work or explains the various attack or defense moves. <br/><br/>Besides the excellent sports choreography(the Commonwealth Games semifinals match is my favorite) and the cinematography, the performances and also the direction deserve a big applause. Aamir gives an aptly controlled performance as the centrestage actually belongs to the character of Geetha. If he'd not taken a backseat whenever required to let the other actors shine in some key scenes, this movie would have stumbled. Fatima Sana Sheikh as the older Geetha gets the role of a lifetime. She must have trained very hard to do justice to such a physically demanding role and her emotions are spot on too but if I were to choose just one performance in the movie that's my favorite, I would say Zaira Wasim as the younger Geetha. What a natural child actor! And of course, the support cast is wonderful like Sanya Malhotra as the older Babita(sis of Geetha), Suhani Bhatnagar as the young Babita and Ritwik Sahore(young Omkar, the Phogat sisters' cousin). The child actors, I must mention again, Zaira Wasim, Ritwik Sahore and Suhani Bhatnagar deserve lots of appreciation for their acting. <br/><br/>Of course, as it is a movie, the makers take liberties to exaggerate a few moments or scenes or even bring shades of grey to few characters which is all OK but at what point does one limit it? Geetha's national coach in the movie is shown to have shades of grey, exaggerated grey actually, so much so that PR Sondhi(who was the national coach of Geetha & Babita in real life) remarked that his reputation has been hurt by what's shown in the movie and they should have not taken such liberties with the character at his expense. I agree. Otherwise I'd have rated this movie a 9 or even a 10(it's still epic) but I downgrade it to 8 as a symbolic protest to how some of the characterisation was done.<br/><br/>Verdict: It is ""bollywood-ish"" but still entertains, thrills and inspires in equal measure. Bring your family to the theatre too, and also it runs with English subtitle for a wider audience. As soon as the DVD is out, I intend to buy and watch it again. A must see despite any flaws."
"omkar1984","7","2","4","24 December 2016"," Resurgence of technically sensible movies
","An endearing tale of having and dream and the endeavor to achieve it. I must admit that after 'Madras Cafe', this is a movie which has rekindled my hopes that Bollywood can create technically sensible movies. The handling deserves an applause. The movie doesn't give much chance to the viewer to get distracted. One fact that I hate about any Indian work ranging from films to series is the incessant, loud and maddening background score and this is avoided in the movie. Nitesh Tiwari has done a fantastic job while seated in the writer's and the director's chair. The command of all the actors over the dialect is impressive.<br/><br/>Emotions, philosophy and practical scenarios are blended well. Mahavir's realization that his daughters have inherited his talent reminded me of that scene in 'Kung Fu Panda' where the Master Shifu, otherwise disappointed, sees a spark in Po. 'Nothing succeeds like success' - the villagers first condemn, then make fun of the family and finally praise and celebrate Geeta's success. One can even see girls being sent to train with Mahavir. The movie does have some emotional spots - the girls getting accustomed to their father's orders about getting ready at 0500 hours, they realizing that their seemingly insensitive father is, in reality, struggling for their better future, Babita criticizing Geeta and reminding her that their success is solely due to their father's sacrifice and skills and that he is growing old, the mild friction between the sisters over performance and Geeta calling up her father, Mahavir summarizing Geeta's journey and begging the NIS committee for another chance for her, Geeta quoting ""Bahut dinon ke baad papa ki gaaliyan khaayi, accha laga !"", after more than a decade of a fortitudinous journey, Mahavir denied the chance to witness the most important match of his daughter's career Mahavir finally appreciating Geeta after the gold medal.<br/><br/>What I always crave for is having technical/professional(whether it's a sport, an armed conflict, secret services and so on) aspects given the maximum footage in the movie. The training of the girls, the points system, the strategies used and the games shown are perfect pointers for a layman like me to make out the 'head or tail' of the wrestling. The movie shows how vocational skills and what is popularly known 'jugaad' in India are quintessential for survival. Daya's stitching, Mahavir's ideas ranging from building the wrestling ground in his own field, using cotton mats as a low-cost substitute for synthetic mats, using the video parlor to analyse Geeta's previous games are all simple but successful ideas to navigate through predicaments. Mahavir, instead of celebrating Geeta's silver medal, stays back to watch the games of the other semi-final pair to evaluate the opposition in the final.<br/><br/>The movie deserves 10/10 for it's genuine humor sprinkled all over the movie - the girls pursuing her mother to get them relieved from the training, Mahavir's stone-cold attitude to the tantrums hurled by his daughters, Omkar's sufferings and the comments from the crowd generate giggles.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie seem balanced and well-placed. Geeta and Babita - Both the kids and the adults have played their parts well, successfully delivering what is expected from the characters. Omkar - the mascot and the 'comic relief'. Right from his inception in wrestling till the end of the movie, . His narration across the movie . He's the one that has the lion's in the humor. His expressions when his jeans are shortened to make slacks for his sisters, the torture he faces while his sisters learn wrestling and his unfaltering support(jack of all trades) to Mahavir all make him a lovable character. Mahavir Singh - Amir Khan has impeccably played a father and a teacher. Letting his girls have 'Gol gappe' for the last time, putting them on a non-veg diet despite of his wife's protests, giving up his job and disregarding his health and enduring hardships just for the success of his daughters are all. Once again, after 'Ghazani', he has put the efforts to modify his physique to suit the demands of the screenplay.<br/><br/>Success of a person comes from the selfless support of many people who act like background processes. From Daya to the local chicken shop owner, all touch the viewer's heart.<br/><br/>I felt that the music and lyrics have been an odd couple in the movie. Honestly, I was not impressed by the music, Pritam isn't the best choice for such movies. Having said that, the title track is notable. Amitabh Bhattacharya has made a mark in penning apt lyrics, the one I liked most were of the song 'Haanikarak Bapu'.<br/><br/>Similar to the two sides of a coin, the movie has several shortcomings that are both facts and the desire of the viewer to expect more from something that is good or better than earlier attempts. After the intermission, I could feel the emotional drama stepping in increasingly e.g: The discussion between Mahavir and Geeta on the night before the final match(reminds of 'Chak De' final match!). While it's normal in an Indian movie, this consumes valuable time in the length of the film which can be dedicated for more technical aspects of wrestling. The sudden leap of the film from Geeta's adolescence to becoming the national champion was a bit disappointing for me - a journey of being a school girl in a hamlet to being a national champion would have involved aplenty of professional challenges like facing injuries etc. The number of songs should have been less.<br/><br/>The movie, undoubtedly, is one of the Bollywood's fine works and a must-watch(more than once!). I just hope that instead of having one such movie per decade, we have such movies frequently, focusing on diverse sports. I look forward to the movies that take a cue from 'Dangal' and improvise on the technical aspects."
"divyanshusharma","10","2","4","26 December 2016"," This is what you call a MASTERPIECE!!!
","Dangal, without any doubt, can be considered as one of the greatest films of Bollywood. It is a kind of movie that shakes you from inside and touches your every emotional cord. The movie splendidly portrays the struggle of a father for his daughters by going against all odds and thus making the country proud. <br/><br/>Director Nitesh Tiwari has magnificently brought the real essence of the film by keeping the authenticity and beauty of the incredible story intact. The direction and screenplay are so good that the representation makes you laugh and cry at the same time, filling your heart with euphoria and proud. 10/10 for this. <br/><br/>But no perfect story can be succeeded without having a proper engine attach to it, and the most powerful engine of this story is Aamir Khan, who I think, has delivered his career best performance. He makes you laugh, astonishes you and fills your eyes with tears. You can easily see a struggling father in him, who is willing to face any hardships and can go to any limit to make his daughters ""best of all"", and fulfill his dream to make the nation proud. Again 10/10.. <br/><br/>Not only Aamir Khan, other stars of the film like Zaira Wasim (young Geeta), Suhani Bhatnagar (young Babita), Sanya Malhotra, Fatima Sana Shaikh, and all other supporting cast have done extremely well and deserve huge applause. Music of the film mixes well with the taste and genre of the movie. The timings of the songs are impeccably perfect. <br/><br/>So in short, Dangal is once in a lifetime movie that not only entertains you with its great story and performances but also makes you think about the strong message (""Mhaari choriyaan choron se kam hai ke?""), it is trying to convey you. <br/><br/>A great film that gives you a great social message by spellbinding you with its great story and presentation. A MUST WATCH!!!"
"kjvhyd","8","2","4","23 December 2016"," Dangal - ""Dumm-Gals""
","This movie bearing semblance to the triplet (Alphabet D ""Dhoom 3"", Aamir Khan and Pritam) stands out in every frame invoking our lost cherishment of Hindi cinema. Films on Sports, women-centric themes or jingoism have drawn flak from a certain section of the society or the masses due to their biased / judgmental approach to the screenplay. Movies generally exercise many cinematic liberties and cliché that make or break the BO, based on the movie's credentials. In case of Dangal, we get to experience an awesome alignment of production values, screenplay (deftly crafted), music (Pritam pitches to perfection) and artiste's performance (debutantes pull your heart strings!!). As was widely published, the movie is about a relentless father (erstwhile wrestler) who breeds his daughters to be wrestling champions to bring glory to the motherland (mind you, there isn't a slightest overture about ""desh bhakti"" barring the national anthem played In then end). The very premise of the story leaves a gamut of human sentiments to be kindled as per bollywood's formulaic studious, yet, Dangal restrains and sticks to its core theme – ""sportsmanship is all about patience and perseverance, which are the biggest virtues of life too"". Director, less-known for churning blockbusters (no offense intended), this time has struck gold with his tactical treatment of the subject with no submission to any sort of emotional outbursts or commercial compromises. Be it the childhood clutches of the wrestling-sisters, the dramatic episodes in the Sports Academy, the untold emotions between baap- beti, the euphoric display of the wrestling ring, or the tears of triumph which trickle down (the eyes of the artistes and audience alike), every sequence is laced with indelible dialogues, unique expressions, underplayed stardom and subtle transition in the characters. To mince matters, as the film industry draws curtains to 2016, it's a sheer pleasure to watch the ""teen sisters"" hit ""sixes"" in this unparalleled portrayal of WOO(Window Of Opportunity)MEN POWER!!..."

","Aamir Khan has always been known to portray films with meaning. This movie , true to its name has done full justice to the family of Mahavir Singh Phogat. Once you begin to watch the movie, you do not wish to go for the interval because the director gets you so engrossed. Towards the later part of the movie, you begin to appreciate the father role played by Aamir Khan and his sacrifices for the family. You also start to think of your own parents and the life they have lived for you :) <br/><br/>I am a supporter of Women Empowerment and the movie makes you realize again that women can still do a lot in this world, Aamir khan has subdued his role to make the girls shine throughout the movie. There lies the real beauty as the film moves to the second half. Also the frustrations to a talent without much financial backup and the lack of support from the Indian government all makes you think again of our political and financial system. <br/><br/>Finally you begin to think why Aamir khan had to go through all the difficulty of working out when actually his role as a wrestler was only for about 2 minutes. But then you realize what a perfectionist he has made himself to portray the past and present and that's what makes Dangal a must watch!!<br/><br/>Salman Khan has stolen some of the glory with Sultan revolving around the same Wrestling theme but Dangal will surely have its own supporters and inspire the true movie watchers."

","First of all, we should say hats off to Mahavir Singh Phogat, he is an Indian amateur wrestler and senior Olympics coach. He is the father of Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari who had won the gold medal in commonwealth games [1,3,4]. <br/><br/>This movie is all about their life's story including their character's names. This movie says that medals do not need particularly gender either male or female at all to play any game, it's all depends on the way we perceive.<br/><br/>Hero (Amir Khan): <br/><br/>There are very fewer personalities in Indian cinema industry who will dedicate more towards the story. Here, Amir khan molded two personalities by decreasing weight as much as 22-25 kilograms and vice versa for increasing to get the real feel of characters, in spite of having a risk to do the same.<br/><br/>Generally, father and Guru will not be able to show their feelings on a single platform. Here, Amir Khan managed both in a perfect action. <br/><br/>Hats off to Amir Khan.<br/><br/>Direction and Screenplay: <br/><br/>Nitesh Tiwari narrated and directed the movie in a good manner. However, the screenplay is a little bit slow to connect it.<br/><br/>Traditionally we are unable to get more medals in the international forum, because of less motivation from the government and self-motivation as well as from the parents to support completely from childhood on words.<br/><br/>Message from the film:<br/><br/>For any game to play, it should be always habituated from childhood onwards and also make sure as an individual part that it should not have deviation at any point of time/or circumstances.<br/><br/>The bottom line of the film: <br/><br/>Rome wasn't built in a day [4]; in the same manner, we should never get anything in an overnight of hard work. <br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavir_Singh_Phogat<br/><br/>2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babita_Kumari<br/><br/>3.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeta_Phogat<br/><br/>4.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_wasn't_built_in_a_day"

","In the movie, Geeta, the eldest daughter, trains with her father and plays for the first time. Four boys lined up, some thin, some sturdy, and Geeta chose. Of course, everyone in the audience believed that even the weakest boy could beat the Geeta girl. But Geeta chose his strongest rival.<br/><br/>Like all the wrestling scenes in the show, the fight that followed was real and exciting. Opponents at first disdain, suffered a loss, soon learned to handle with caution. Geeta was focused, trying to seize every opportunity. The audience also from the relaxed mood of watching the play, become nervous and engaged. Geeta lost to his opponent but won the respect of the crowd. But she was disappointed. Her father said she had conquered her fear.<br/><br/>Geeta had lived passively under his father's demon training. Even if we agree ideologically with our father, we can't get a glimpse of Geeta's true character. But this simple choice on the field brought Geeta's character to light. As my father later concluded, Geeta was an aggressive tiger. This domineering choice was the best preparation for Geeta's fate. Even if the opponent is bigger, even if Geeta is lost, we also know that this girl's heart sleeps a fierce tiger.<br/><br/>Choice is an exam question.<br/><br/>Let's think about another girl. She lived in developed Europe and America and loved wrestling since childhood. With the support of her parents, she met the best coach and successfully won the Olympic championship. In such a life, the dream is like the lamp, no longer need to choose the trouble. Just such a film is made out, at most is a youth inspirational fairy tale: sweet but difficult to shock people. This is not to say that there are no plain sailing people. It is only in the face of difficult choices that human nature is often fully manifested. Moviegoers are willing to sit in front of the screen for two or three hours, expecting to see the true humanity of the choices.<br/><br/>Because of the choice of time and often, the character of the character becomes three-dimensional. The father is stubborn and conceited, but when he massages his daughter's ankles, he questions his own harshness. Even when he had chosen the road for his daughter, he had added a year's time to his worries. When the professional coach humiliates in front of him, his father, who always refuses to admit defeat, takes it in his face. But when the daughter sobbed on the other end of the phone, the father did not hesitate, the next day to the daughter's city, quietly for his daughter as a practice partner. Throughout the film, amir khan, who plays the father, is unsmiling and has the same serious expression that many fathers do. But these choices, and the hesitancy and determination of his choices, gave me a sense of the richness of this father.<br/><br/>Geeta's success comes with a string of choices. After becoming a national champion, she opted for a more professional-looking coach, abandoning her father's skills. More importantly, she also gave up her focus on wrestling. In subsequent international competitions, Geeta did poorly. Meanwhile, the director deliberately accentuates the scene of Babita, the second daughter, and seems to want to abandon Geeta and turn Babita into a champion hero. In the difficult situation, Geeta chose to let go of her strong self-esteem and retrain according to her father's method. In the last moment of her father's absence, she chose to grow up alone, with a beautiful rainbow to win the gold medal, completed the transformation of an independent woman.<br/><br/>Some film critics argue that a father pushing his daughter to train violates ""women's rights"". Yet women's rights have always been more than a slogan that can be easily uttered. The feminist movement in Europe and the United States began at the end of the 19th century. In the hard, dirty and dangerous textile workshops, working women have a choice to make: be content with what they earn, or fight for more women's rights. As reflected in suffragette, the hard-won right to vote for women was paid a heavy price by the feminist movement. Similarly, in post-world war ii America, when men returned from the war, women in military factories faced the dilemma of returning to their families or staying at work. After years of hesitation, American women have chosen to fight for women's rights. Women's rights meant accepting the ""choice"" test, not the easy life.<br/><br/>Similarly, in India and many other developing countries, women's social status is low. Even if the most outstanding people to cry, it is difficult to change the traditional strong inertia. In the face of difficult choices, there is no way to have it both ways. It is true that the father forced his daughter at first. But as the father proudly declared, ""let the daughter be strong enough to choose her husband"". That's what makes movies valuable. It makes no secret of the cruelty of reality, whether it is early marriage, paternity, bureaucracy, or even the intensity and danger of wrestling itself. But for all the social problems, the film also holds a brave heart to choose. Father and daughter choose, act, then from humble beginning, until their own goal.<br/><br/>Before the screen, we can also have a choice?"

","The movie is adapted from a real story, perhaps placed in our reality, such a straight male cancer father will be vomited: You can't accomplish your dreams, why do you impose on your daughter? But that was in India. In that country, women were destined to marry people when they were 14 years old, and they could only keep giving birth to children and do housework. The father who appeared to be a tyrant imposed his dream on his daughter. In fact, it also forcibly changed their life path destined by this society.
Father's trembling hand sent us to the big world that he had never experienced, and he fully expected everyone to understand us and care for us like himself. How he wanted to put us under his own wings forever, until, until we could reach an impeccable state. But his father was only his father. He had no more abilities. He could only watch his children stumble toward this world full of temptations and traps.
We left the small town at home and came to the so-called big city. We saw more, learned more, and the world of flowers shook us so that we could not open our eyes. The appearance of the so-called friend brings everything you have never seen before, just strange. Gradually, you will lose yourself, thinking that you feel the wind of the world and touch the tip of the world. You disdain everything your father told you, you forgot the rule of being sure when you were young, and you said to your father, ""Your old set is out of date, and no one does that now."" Just like Gita told his father, it is not popular now. Wrestled like this!
We are growing up, and old and new conflicts will eventually occur. Some people say that parental love refers to parting love. They send their children to grow up, and children send them to grow old. For decades in a lifetime, there is only a period of intersection. What should I do when the children are rushing out, and their parents are afraid that they will fall and they will fold their wings? Only anxiety remained.
Gita and his father had a PK on the wrestling field when they were young, which gave me the climax of the whole movie. I clenched my fists tightly, and my tears couldn't stop flowing. I knew that the father needed to lose because of the plot-because the parents never really won their children.
In a wrestling, Gita used the ""pop"" skills taught by the coach to fight against his father's ""old-fashioned"" experience and eventually overwhelmed his father to the ground. What I saw was a battle between a young cheetah-like wrestler and an old wrestler from Maifa, and it was also a conflict between her daughter and her father. Not surprisingly, a young wrestler will win, and her daughter will also win. She flicked her hair and told her father, ""Look, your suit is outdated."" From childhood to the age, he has been trained by the father's devil, and the girl who loves beauty is forcibly cut off her beautiful long hair ... At this moment, she has spent her childhood. Shadow, defeated the mountain-like giant who oppressed herself, she should have a big sigh in her heart. His father was lying in the sand, gray-faced, like an old, bearded black bear. There was no remorse on his face, no anger and anger, just a little bit, so sad and helpless."

","After seeing this movie, I got reminded of famous sher by Ghalib -' Sarsari Tum Jahan -se Gujre, Warna Har Ja Jahan-e Digar tha. Which means, you lived life in such a cursory manner ( sarsari means shallow ) otherwise at every step/place/milestone, there was a story to be heard / learning was possible. We have given Dangal Movie Review based on how the cast performs at different intervals in the movie, This review will let you know how good is the movie to watch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of the movie makers so far (especially till the 90s) really went around movie making in a very cursory manner and took us for a ride assuming that ""public will not like a particular thing"" & fed us trash all along. There are handful exceptions although, but really very few. Our Dangal Movie Review will get you through the role each character has played in the movie, Well the review of Dangal Movie also consists whether the actors have performed to the expectations or not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, we missed out so many stories, like 'Dangal'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dangal is the story that ought to be/had to be told, and lessons were to be learned & it made me realize about the capability of a storyteller, to pick a thread/germ, and stretch it, scale it up, on basic human emotion's graph, and weave it, in such an inspiring , and engaging & awesome manner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As we all know by now, it's a story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, a wrestler from Haryana, who sees potential in his daughters Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra, to become world class wrestlers, and works towards it, and makes it happen. While Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra), portray the adult versions of the two Phogat Sisters, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar their younger versions, Daya Shobha Kaur ( Sakshi Tanwar ) their mother, and Omkar ( Aparshakti Khurana ) their cousin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the real delight is in the finer details, and intricate emotions depicted in a very balanced manner, assuming that the viewer has a reasonably high intelligence & emotional quotient. ( So Sajid Khan & Rohit Shetty movie fans, should stay away from this movie )<br/><br/><br/><br/>So the story and most importantly the screenplay (which captures what will you see on the screen) of the movie gets 100% marks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Instead of getting into story-specific issues, I will highlight some aspects of the screenplay which deserve accolades and appreciation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But before that, one striking feature of the elder daughter Geeta ( played by Fatima Sana ) is that she resembles to Priyanka Gandhi. Her mannerisms ( especially when she is drifting away from the sport ) & the way she carries herself, are 100% like Priyanka Gandhi- Smart, Savvy, Bright & confident and well dressed & well mannered.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The first hallmark of the screenplay is the length and depth. They complement each other. Unlike in the movie - Dhoni-The untold story - the writer didn't know where to stop thus ended up, making a very long movie (actually a very very long movie ) although that story was also an exceptional one, and still held ground, in spite of its long reel length, mainly due to the glorious end / achievements of Dhoni , we all knew already.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The screenplay of Dangal is tight and fast-paced, & does not get melancholic or melodramatic & the writer navigates such possible pitfalls masterfully, with a dash of humor and pun and a bit of fun, without overdoing it, in any manner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first test of the mettle of the director and the screenplay writer comes, when Geeta's first bout with male wrestler begins. An ordinary filmmaker would use (rather a misuse) this opportunity, to use the slur in verbal and physical form - to bring in the element of shock value (which is often used & overdone, by directors like Anurag Kashyap). This scene becomes the hallmark, and a pivotal point in the movie, as the director, handles this scene very beautifully, and the viewer gets conditioned to the high-quality emotional drama which is wrapped up in an earthy, physical sport like wrestling. This scene also captures the various finer nuances of the wrestling as a sport and introduces the viewer how to enjoy this sport, without any hard selling, or without overemphasizing any aspects of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geeta's next wins in various bouts become our wins and our successes and viewer starts identifying himself/herself in Geeta's triumphs & tribulations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geeta then goes to NSA ( National Sports Academy ) and here onwards she really looks like Priyanka Gandhi and looks fabulous and charming but starts losing in bouts as she stresses on techniques instead of focusing on winning the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second hallmark of the screenplay is at a juncture, when it captures her internal struggle & the anxiety & confusion on what to follow / whom to get mentored by / who to get coached by - in a very balanced manner without overdoing it. This is the difficult part, as it would have not looked good / may not have gone well, with the overall tone of the movie so far, if it was captured in lengthy monologues or with sad songs playing in the background ( which is the normal course taken by most filmmakers like Karan Johar).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The third milestone is about the wrestling match between the father and daughter wherein, each one is trying to prove a point, and thus ends up hurting each other emotionally and mentally and drifts away from each other. The picturization, the taking and the way this scene is nuanced & projected , shows that our cinema can be far superior at emotional level than any other cinema in the world and it is capable of striking a chord that can compel you to become that ' character "" for that moment and embrace their sorrow and grief.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The last and final hallmark of this wonderful movie is when the Commonwealth Games begin and Geeta is struggling to cope up with match pressures and the challenges of the international players/opponents and their technique is driven power games. The real skill of the screenplay writer and the director is proven here, one more time in a very emphatic manner. Each bout is skillfully captured by allowing/enabling the viewer to appreciate the game & the struggle Geeta is going through and her resolve to win each and every point in the game and in turn win for her father as by that time both have reconciled to the past misunderstanding and the bonds of love & respect for each other & for the sport have become the driving force for Geeta.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The controversial aspect of Geeta's father being locked up in the room by her official coach while her final match is about to begin adds to the drama & I believe that writer has used his creative freedom to twist the real facts to create this high pitch point in the movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pramod Kadam's ( Girish Kulkarni - the government nominated Team coach ) does full justice to his character and I am actually fearful that he should not get typecast in such roles in the Hindi cinema here onwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aamir Khan proves the point, that, movie making is a collaborative art form and a kraft that very few can nuance it, in such fine manner, as he does.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dangal film's music is composed by Pritam. Lyrics are penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya in Hindi. Daler Mehndi sung a song in the film.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall it's a must watch movie and should not be missed by anyone.

","Director Nitesh Tiwari and Bollywood's perfectionist, Aamir Khan's sports drama Dangal is a clear winner despite its imperfections. Aamir Khan's brilliance in transforming into Mahavir Phogat sees him embody the role at every level. While his dedication and hard work is apparent in the the muscular physicality of the initial sequences, the flabby bulk for the rest of the movie and his embracing the mud and grime of the ring and making the strategies and technique utterly convincing, his acting chops shine through in scenes in which he trains his daughters with a steely resolve playing a ruthless, if not cruel, coach, his wholehearted celebration when he sees her triumph at various levels and those silent moments of frustration and helplessness when he sees his daughter losing focus and going astray or even in the final sequences when he struggles to witness the final match.<br/><br/>Even as he towers over everyone else, the stellar supporting cast too ace their roles including Sakshi Tanwar as Phogat's wife who supports her husband despite her persisting doubts on the path chosen by him, Ritwik Sahore playing the young cousin Omkar who becomes sparring partner for the girls, Aparshakti Khurana paying the older Omkar who is the narrator, Mahavir's aide and adding to the amusement, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who play young Geeta and Babita going through the grueling training regime, Fatima Sana Shaikh playing the older Geeta and Sanya Malhotra playing the older Babita. Fatima brings in the required intensity, athleticism, innocence as well as vulnerability in the role which sees her ascent, sense of innocent awe at the glitzy world outside her village, losing focus and finding redemption.<br/><br/>One can see that a lot of effort has gone into making the bouts look authentic, yet thrilling at the same time. On the flip side, Dangal is flabby by at least twenty minutes, the characterisation of the national coach is more of a caricaturish villain, it plays to the jingoistic gallery with its anthem adjunct, as well as the contrived climax.<br/><br/>Yet, Dangal rises above these niggles, thanks to a star who effaces himself to be the character and sincerity that permeates almost every frame of this venture which makes it a winner.<br/><br/>It may not soar high enough to be the epic Olympian gold it seeks to be; Nevertheless, it is an international gold, albeit at CWG, which is well won !!"
"JakeBrinkman","7","0","0","18 October 2019"," Incredible sports film
","Powerfully emotional and inspiring, Dangal is an excellent sports film that should probably be in the top 10 sports movies of the world. I was actually able to predict nearly every part of the ending, and predictable movies usually aren't able to pull an emotional response from me. Dangal was different, making me eagerly await the predicted final scenes, and I was still fighting back tears when the scenes finally came. With that said, the second act did lull by making one of the characters less likable for far too long. Also, I wasn't a fan of the father playing favorites in most of the second half. So it's not a perfect movie, but the first act was pure fun and the third act was powerfully inspiring, and it's surely worth a watch."

"yvonne-20524","9","0","0","16 November 2018"," A motivational story about how Indian women obtain self-value and achieve social recognition
","The film Dangal, starring Aamir Khan, is based on a true story in countryside India. The father was once a successful wrestler but was forced to give up his dream due to financial straits. He hopes that his sons could fulfill his dream but he only has four daughters. However, he discovers the striking talents of wrestling in his two daughters by accident. Then the father trains the daughters strictly and finally they become champions. The inspirational scenes of wrestling in the movie are so amazing that they arouse strong passion among audience. When watching the final scene in which Geeta defeats her opponent in the final round and the national anthem starts for her championship, I got moved because their father's dream is finally fulfilled after various frustrations and Geeta eventually becomes a successful woman with self value, which is contrasted with the traditional female images in India. She experienced a harsh childhood. Her strong ambition as well as masculine appearance always couldn't be understood by people with traditional Hindustani mind. She is also torn between the hardline approaches of her father and the theory-oriented approach by her coach and fell into confusion after she attends the sports academy. But at the time that she wins in the international competition and the national flag rises for her, we could see that fortunately, all her hard work pays off. The status of women in athletic field gains recognition. And that exciting moment also marked that the deep-rooted stereotype that women are destined to depend on their husbands could be alleviated in Indian people's mind. The film emphasizes nationalism and feminism. The patriarchal father definitely loves their daughters deeply, which could be revealed in the wedding scene. In countryside Indian society, women usually don't have any right to fulfill their own dreams, but Geeta's father firmly allows their daughters to challenge the tradition. He believes that his daughters are so excellent that they shouldn't be chosen by men in marriage. Furthermore, I want to say that the actors in the film are all extremely devoted. I hear from the news that Aamir Khan changes his posture rapidly during the shoot of the film in order to fit the appearance of the father in different periods. Also, the wrestling scenes performed by the daughters are amazing. They remind me of the fighting scenes in Deewar(1975) in which Vijay fights against the villains in a warehouse. Both of them succeed in shocking the audience and the win of the protagonist could push the plot into climax. Compared to earlier melodramatic Bollywood films, Dangal appears to be more authentic and convincing. This inspirational story of how women from Indian countryside win wrestling champion step by step could stimulate audience."

","Dangal is the name of a wrestling competition in India. Former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) discovers that his two daughters have a natural skill in grappling as they beat up two boys who were teasing them.<br/><br/>So he decides to train them as wrestlers and enter them into wrestling competitions where they have to fight others boys as competition for girls did not exist. In the face of ridicule his daughters impress the onlookers with their strength and skill.<br/><br/>Dangal inspired by films such as Rocky and The Karate Kid have training montages set to music, a stern father who coaches them to a strict rigorous schedule. The father then loses his daughters to a national coach who trains the daughters for international competitions but gets the girls to unlearn what their father has taught them which causes a crisis of confidence.<br/><br/>The film has good performances from actresses Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta Phogat) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) who looks to have done a lot of intense training for their roles. Aamir Khan's character is too one-note with very little shade to his performance and I think the film suffers as a result along with the long running time which is par for the course with Hindi films.<br/><br/>This is an inspiring film of the rise of female wrestling in a patriarchal society as the now young women enter the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and go for gold with their father helping them from the sidelines much to the irritation of the Indian team coach.

"fahimay","9","0","0","24 March 2018"," A unique father with unique daughters
","Looking out to watch this blockbuster hit for a long time, I got my chance only a few weeks back. I had faith that Aamir Khan, the certified perfectionist would definitely do a flawless job. We have seen many father characters on screen showering their love on their daughters. But the love and adoration shown here is distinctively exemplary. <br/><br/>As the movie starts, we get the feeling that the father Mahavir Singh (Aamir Khan) is imposing his desires on his daughters. But as the movie progressed, I started wishing that girls get such supportive fathers who are dedicated to bringing out the best in their daughters and show them to the world. <br/><br/>The daughters, both younger and older versions have given a splendid performance. The younger girls portrayed a naive appearance in the beginning that we wonder how the transformation to heavyweight wrestlers was possible. But I realized that putting on weight to become hefty is not necessary, just a tremendous amount of stamina and willpower. <br/><br/>The wrestling scenes have been worked in good detail. More that being a sports movie, this movie spells of female empowerment in the real sense and the forward thinking of a father that a girl's life should not be spent in the kitchen alone. Hats off to the real Mahavir Singh, Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat for being such grand role models."

"Vivekmaru45","8","0","0","10 November 2017"," Another Good Aamir Khan film And Based On The True Story Of Mahavir Phogat.
","I have seen many good Aamir Khan films and this could be among his best ones. But I think my favorite is still Taare Zameen Par because it deals with a wide spectrum of problems faced by mentally challenged individuals in society.<br/><br/>Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a former amateur wrestler and national champion based in Balali, a village in Haryana. He was forced by his father to give up the sport in order to obtain gainful employment. Dejected that he could not win a medal for his country, he vows that his unborn son will. Disappointed upon having four daughters, he gives up hope. But when his older daughters Geeta and Babita come home after beating up two boys in response to derogatory comments, he realises their potential to become wrestlers and begins coaching them.<br/><br/>His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short haircuts to avoid lice. Despite facing backlash from the villagers, he goes ahead with them, training them in his makeshift mud pit. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but soon realise that he wants them to have a good future and not grow up to be stereotypical housewives. Motivated, they willingly participate in his coaching. Mahavir takes the girls to wrestling tournaments where they wrestle with boys and defeat them. Unable to afford wrestling mats, he uses two layers of mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the State and national level before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.<br/><br/>Verdict: acting, direction, photography, background sound-effects and music of the film is superbly executed. Nitesh Tiwari who made his directorial debut by co-directing Chillar Party (2011) which won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film for that year, directs Dangal with an extremely innovative approach. He makes us feel we are in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>Similar films to watch: Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar(1992), Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India(2001), Iqbal(2005), Apne(2007), Irudhi Suttru(Tamil 2014) and remake Saala Khadoos(Hindi 2016).<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper."

"Goloh","6","0","0","20 September 2017"," Modern Story, Classic Style
","The ""spoiler alert"" is here only because I wouldn't know how to write without it. As this film is based on a true story, plot development (for this review, anyway) is probably less important than how the film was made.<br/><br/>Think of the prototypical template for classical Indian films: background, despair, tragedy, redemption, and lonnngg -- with lots of music and some dancing to lighten the load. There you have it. Production values in Dangal are high, and acting from all sides is terrific, right down to the snarky behaviour of the Scottish wrestler near the end. All we missed in this rags-to-riches tour-de-force of athletic accomplishment were a small child dancing around a tree and then getting hit by a train.<br/><br/>If I could have changed anything, it would have been to tighten the editing and reduce running time by about 30 minutes, though most Indian viewers would probably disagree. I also would have given Babita a bit more of her due, since the film opens with Geeta and Babita apparently equal in skill and circumstance. Those musical interludes for me (as a non-Indian) got in the way after awhile. The national coach was also made out to be something of a loose cannon.<br/><br/>But here in Hong Kong, Dangal has generated an unusual amount of interest for a foreign film, and an Indian one to boot. The moral of the story--father knows best--will not be lost on local families.<br/><br/>My last words: excellent film, probably an 8 or 9 if only it had a shorter, tighter running time."

","This year two movies have importantly spoken how sports and the involvement of female gender in the same, Irudhi Suttru\Saala Khadoos (2016) speaked for Women Boxing and Dangal (2016) has spoken Women Wrestling. We had Chak De India (2007) which also focused and emphasized on Women Hockey and was able to present a detailed view of what the sport is about and all the politics involved in the same.<br/><br/>In my view, the above mentioned movies are very important in such a way that they were able to showcase about how the feminine gender is seen across India and their involvement in sports. These movies have touched some specific areas of bold and controversial topics and given a minimum limelight of what's happening in our country for Sports especially considering the female gender.<br/><br/>Dangal directed by Nitesh Tiwari is a multi-layered movie from its start to finish. Let me give some detailed explanation about what i felt when watched the movie.<br/><br/>Dangal is a Movie about Wrestling In India.The initial title track ""Dangal"" has visuals of how really Wrestling is done in India, how the people involved in wrestling look with bulk body even some are with seen belly ,how the wrestlers are trained using rigorous methods , their diet and relaxation methods and much more. For in India many came to know about Wresting mainly through WWE telecasted in Star Sports\Ten Sports which we all believed was real apparently which was just showbiz done faking the viewers.<br/><br/>Dangal is a Movie which speaks about Feminism indirectly. It tells a message that girls aren't only meant to clean, cook, marry, reproduce and spend the rest of their life in monotonous way how the society has been seeing and treating them. A particular scene in the movie depicts a girl saying that how females are treated and seen without even being asked whether they want to live such a kind of life and she advises her friends saying that ""at least you have a father who always thinks and cares about you"" and also she says like ""Girls are seen like a burden in their own home after a certain age hence they are pushed into the Wedding Well"".<br/><br/>Dangal is a Movie about a person who wants to Make His Country In World Arena. Here Aamir Khan plays Mahavir Singh Phogat, who wants to fulfill his dream getting a Gold for India in Wrestling Sport and according to him he feels that only a Boy can do it. In his attempts to pursue his dream,he gets blessed with four daughter which gives him a mild scare feel that his dream may go unfulfilled. Later as the time progresses and happening of some interesting events he realizes and exclaims ""Gold is Gold, it doesn't matter who gets it ; Boy or Girl"".<br/><br/>So coming to Dangal as a movie from a normal audience point of view, this is a Biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his living efforts on how he made his daughters Geeta and Babita make their country proud in World Sports Arena for Professional Wrestling and how they helped him achieve his dream.<br/><br/>The movie is completely shouldered from start to finish by the Stellar Performances of its complete Star Cast; Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Zaira Wasim,Sanya Malhotra,Suhani Bhatnagar. There is not single scene or moment in the movie which is out of the story.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Aamir Khan has a given a splendid performance for Mahavir's role. Be his emoting, reacting and mainly his physical transformation, he has got into the skin of the character and lived the character itself.Sakshi Tanwar anchoring the role of Daya Shobha Kaur has played the perfect foil for Aamir Khan.There are some scenes where she scores without even speaking a word and conveying all the emotions with her eyes and facial expressions.<br/><br/>The main credit and success of Dangal lies with Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Zaira Wasim,Sanya Malhotra and Suhani Bhatnagar who play the Younger and Older Geeta and Babita.Flawless performances from them throughout the movie such they steal some scenes though having Aamir and Sakshi in the same.<br/><br/>Pritam makes his impression with the Dangal Title Track which also runs as Background Music throughout the movie for elevating the scenes.<br/><br/>To conclude my review, Dangal is Terrific Movie powered by Stellar Performances and a Gripping Screenplay which keeps the audiences hooked till the end.A Must Watch Movie for all."

","Yes, this is about girl power in the precise sense of muscle power. But is it about girl power?

If the father would have had boys, there would be no girl power. If they would have failed, the story would have been precisely the same, yet no motivational girl power despite all the time and energy invested. So it's about women acting in accordance with the will of a man to satisfy the man. I failed to see the feminism."
"varun-the-ninja","3","5","16","15 January 2017"," Aamir Khan was good, child actors were'nt good, predictable story.
","Had good heart and good acting (especially Aamir Khan) and the cinematography during the fights were pretty alright but the child actors were pretty bad and the movie was really, REALLY formulated and predictable. (also the message was good, but Cool Cat Save the Kids has a good message. why doesn't that have a 9.1 on IMDb?)<br/><br/>Spoilers from here on out: <br/><br/>At the end when she needs the points to win, it was the EXACT amount Aamir Khan said earlier in the movie, and there was 10 seconds left. hmmm... wonder whats going to happen... and then on top of that, we hear Aamir Khan repeating what the throw is to get the amount of points (i don't remember how many, so lets just say it was 7) at that moment. SERIOUSLY?!?!? It was pretty obvious when Aamir Khan said it the first time that it would be re-incorporated. Then towards the end of the fight when she needs exactly 7 points to win, and the only way to get that is the throw, you know its going to happen. The movie insults your intelligence by just SAYING IT AGAIN. <br/><br/>Also, I had no idea what was going to happen in this movie. The day of my parents said that there was an Aamir Khan movie near us in theaters so we just went and saw it. I had NO idea of what was going to happen in this movie at all. I didn't look anything up or anything, yet I could still predict what would happen in the movie. <br/><br/>another thing to add: the motivation for why the girls continued to fight in the beginning was kind of dumb. Instead of realizing by themselves that women are oppressed in India and they are given a chance, they are just told this by some random girl who we see for the first time who gets married. It was forced and bad. I don't write movies but they could have done this in a way that the girls found out by themselves, which really would have developed their characters more (imo)."

I am not from India and I can say the only Indian movies that are good are romantic ones which this movie is not romantic. This movie might be good for Indian people and I think this high rating on IMDb is mainly coming from Indians, but as an international person, this movie was not good at all. The script/dialogues were awful and some part of the movie (like many other Indian movies) was childish. For example, the national coach and Geet's father competition was very weird and not true. The movie was very predictable and it was obvious from the beginning of the movie that what was going to happen during the movie. The only thing that was great was the camera. It was very good. Amirkhan acting was also very good. Altogether, I give this movie 4 out of 1"

Character is introduced as an ex National Champion.} Fan: Yeah, what an intro! Aamir is the boss. Conn: But, subtlety? A bit on your face, isn't it? Promos have been telling you for so many months that the man is a wrestler, what is the surprise? Fan: Arre, this movie is about woman empowerment and patriotism. Made by Aamir, you know more than him? Conn: I have been watching world cinema for 4 decades now. Did you watch Million Dollar Baby? Or, Creed? Introduction of protagonist is subtle and powerful. Fan: Saala Khadoos! Conn: Yeah, even that was subtle. A character needs to be established for the various dimensions it has, like a normal human being. {Aamir is already making his daughters' life miserable on screen} Conn: His character is so one dimensional! So, is the wife, compliant otherwise but strict about the kitchen. Daughters seem like puppets. From the instance of their introduction, it's only wrestling for them. Did they not have real problems of men touching them intimately in a rural society? What if dangals coincide with their monthly periods? Where is the subtext of a woman in the socio- cultural context? And even the cousin, almost a buffoon and effeminate. Fan: Boss, this is based on real life. Real life has no drama, only hard work. See, how the girl is beating the boys in the street fights? Such message about girl child! That too, in Haryana. Conn: OK, then a documentary on the Phogat family should have done it. Messages would have been real and direct. Isn't it? {The girl has grown up. The new girl is pretty, and there are whistles from somewhere in the dark} Fan: Now, the real show will start! All championship fights. Full paisa vasool! Conn: Oh, have you watched Commonwealth Games videos on YouTube? Fan: Of whom, this girl? Conn: No, the original Geeta. Could have been included in the documentary.<br/><br/>Why make a feature film of that? {Intermission has started. Fan rushed to be early in the queue for overpriced popcorn and cola. His child and wife too went with him. He kept telling wife to take care of the child in the toilet, quite loudly. Movie restarted. Fan rushed back with his family after a little while.} Fan: What did I miss? Father and daughter are fighting I see. Why? Conn: It seems that once the female athletes reach the Academy, they get more interested in fashion, boys, movies etc. They grow their hair. Wonder what P T Usha used to do! Or Malleswari. Fan: Who are these people? Did they win Commonwealth medals? Conn: Malleswari got Olympic medal, my friend! Fan: Arre, Phogats are international wrestlers, Bhai! When Aamir has picked up their life, they must be the best. Conn: Aamir perhaps chose the Haryana story, so that the pretty actresses from mainstream can depict them. Malleswari is from Andhra, stout, not very easy to find a mainstream actress like her. Moreover, weightlifting is not half as glamorous as women's wrestling. {On screen, a national level coach is making an ass of himself. The daughter drifted away from the father and, predictably, lost all the international matches. From the first scene of their conflict, everyone knew that they would reconcile. Aamir gets the control of her daughter's life back and starts phone-training her. The pitiable daughter succumbs to the fatherly diktats} Fan: What an actor! Gained so much weight and now, he has lost so much! Only Aamir can do this? Conn: Ever watched Captain America? Chris Evans was skinny and muscular in the same movie. Fan: That's why I call you anti-national! Why do you always quote America? India doesn't make movies or what? Conn: Sir, this is cinema, world of make believe. In any case, a man who gains weight so much after his athletic days, usually do not have such muscular triceps and biceps. Muscles sag without practice. Fan: You are doubting Aamir's method acting? See, how authentic is his Haryanvi! Conn: Do you speak the language? Fan: No, why do I need to? Conn: Kangana in TMWT would have won by far, if Haryanvi accent were the basis of good acting. {In the meanwhile, there is an announcement in the film about the National Anthem to be played before a match. Spectators stood up like clockwork puppets the moment the band starts playing. This is not the mandatory stand-up, thought the connoisseur and spread on the push-back seat. Fan gave one hard look at him. Connoisseur pulled himself up.} Fan: Now, the climax starts. Oh, my God! Mahabir Phogat ji faced such jealousy? Mean people!That's why nothing happens in Sports in this country! Conn: What sports do you play? Fan: Where is the time? Office, family, child's education Conn: And your child? Which sports does he like to play? Fan: Where is the playing space in an apartment? Look, how close the competition is between Geeta and that Australian girl! Conn: We all know that Geeta would win. Where is the suspense in the climax? And you know, the original match was a smooth sail for Geeta? Fan: Boss, we don't come to a movie to learn history. 'Entertainment, entertainment, entertainement - as Vidya Balan had said. That Dangal has done. I am happy! {Credits start rolling. Connoisseur and fan depart, waving at each other. The crowd of Christmas cum Sunday evacuates. 'Super hit' was the verdict even before the movie was released. Now, it's only a scoring game of the centuries of crores. Savvy marketeer, smart selector of themes, average actor and film maker – this defines the Hindi megastars. Who directed this movie, connoisseur tried to recall. Who cares!

","Dangal (2016): I waited for this film since I watched its trailer.I have waited a lot for its release date but unfortunately this movie didn't got released in our home town.So,I lost hopes of watching this in theater and waited for its Blu-ray version.But surprisingly Dangal showed up in our local theater today.So the moment I saw the poster,I rushed to the theater to watch this already declared classic.SO how is it?<br/><br/>Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogatv(Aamir Khan) is a former wrestling champion had to quit the sport due to his family pressure as it was not helping his family financially.He only dreams that his son should win Gold Medal for India in wrestling but back to back he has four daughter's.Mahavir feels his dream cant be complete and starts staying away from the sport,while his daughter Geeta (Zaira Wasim and Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar and Sanya Malhotra) are growing the notices that they have quality of being wrestlers and starts training them,Geeta and Babita have to get a hard training and start to dislike their father for this but they realize that their father is doing this for their betterment and take the sport seriously.Geeta soon becomes a a known wrestler in the state and wins Nationals too.But fate starts going in wrong direction when Geeta goes far away from her father's training.....<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Performances: Once again,an award winning performance from Mr.Perfectionist Aamir Khan.His dedication and passion towards acting is visible in each and every scene.His transformation for the role of Mahavir is commendable.The two girls are played by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who win us over with innocence and exasperation before showing us how expertly they move.Fatima ass grown Geeta did a wonderful job.Her hard work is seen everywhere where she mimics the true wrestling techniques with perfection.Sakshi Tanwar, who plays the hapless mother, trying to strike a balance between an unyielding father and daughters who just want to be girls a little longer is brilliant in her role.<br/><br/>2)Wrestling choreography: This is the major break through for this movie and definitely helped a lot to achieve a special place in sports based films.In Dangal,the wrestling choreography is excellent and strikingly credible.All the wrestling matches are nail biting because of its realistic making.Kudos to the film makers for bringing a true sports feel.<br/><br/>3)Screenplay and Direction: Screenplay of Dangal is high on emotions and an aspiring father's goals.There are lot of remarkable scenes in Dangal where audience will get emotional.Especially the scene where Geeta wrestles with Mahavir is one of the best moments in cinema.Even the use of National Anthem at the climax is a brilliant taking.Nitesh Tiwari successfully delivered one of the best sports drama to Indian Cinema.He should be applauded for bringing us the tale of unknown heroes who achieved fame for India,.<br/><br/>4)Music: Pritam's music is solid and his background score is brilliant.Dangal title track definitely gives goosebumps every time it plays in the movie.<br/><br/>5)Cinematography: Sethu Sriram's textured cinematography oscillates between the poetic -- there is a lovely slow-motion shot of dirt from a shaking head flying across a red sky -- and the powerfully prosaic, with the wrestling scenes looking startlingly real.<br/><br/>Minus Points: None except that like all sports dramas this one is also highly predictable.But predictability never matters when there is enough inspiring content,<br/><br/>My rating 9/10"

Director, the actor and the stylist/physical trainer who made it possible. <br/><br/>It is normally difficult to find strong emotional moments in a biopic kind of story. So how to exaggerate without deviating much from the actual situation is always a challenge. Then how to screen it in a natural way? With help of art directors can create the canvas. Surely the actual hero had passion. Then delivering that passion in frame is difficult task. The children did a good job here. I even doubted whether they can deliver it. <br/><br/>In an Indian family father has a respect. whether all fathers give great things in return? that question is well asked and answered. Sing was just a villager. surely not that poor. But he had will to overcome that. It also show that Indian system, even anybody can blame it corrupted and bad. but a person with will can always overcome the hurdles. it is a motivating story for all fathers. <br/><br/>Director has a magic of conveying emotion. As audience, we had moments where which we support certain characters and based on certain values, we wanted them to be defeated at certain points. These things are only understandable in an Indian context. i guess.<br/><br/>if possible, we should watch the movie full family. children and parents. Fortunately i watched in that way. Really enjoyed.<br/><br/>There are some points for improvements. like puma shoes are used in certain shots as Aamir wearing. Those small things are negligible compared to the grand output. But noting down for the betterment of the art in the future."

","In a year which has seen more than it's fair share of sports movies Dangal stands a class apart for it's pure authencity. The expectations regarding the movie were sky high ever since the first look poster came out and to do justice to that is no easy feat. The story of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his passion for wrestling which he passes onto his daughters is truly heroic. While the Salman starrer Sultan which was another wrestling movie that came out this year and broke half the box office records, it had more of a commercial touch to it and portrays Sultan in a he's-more-than-human way. But Dangal and Aamir stay true to the core of the story and comes out with flying colours."

Scenes like; Aamir wrestling with Geeta, Aamir pressing legs of daughters at night when they are asleep because he can be a father or a trainer at once.<br/><br/>The wrestling scenes are well choreographed and you will feel that you are watching international level wrestling on screen.<br/><br/>**It is a must watch**"
"vandanagupta7","7","2","5","28 December 2016"," The Great and the not-so-great point of the film - Amir Khan
","Mahavir Singh Phogat is an unbelievably inspiring father, who fought against stereotypes and society, for himself, his girls and the pride of our Nation. It has shown, how once again the bureaucracy of the nation is eating away real chances of the talented athletes. The film is well acted, well scripted and a joy to experience. The success of this film is welcome and is a testament that the Indian audience doesn't just crave for the senseless no-brainier stories.<br/><br/>However, one must not forget that more often than not, the films, with the Khans, are ""Khan-centric"" at the expense of a good story. And this is no exception. <br/><br/>It's a black and white world. Amir's portrayal of Mahavir: my- technique-however-ancient-is-the-winner. The coach, who is against Amir's technique, is shown as The all evil villain, for whom the pride of the nation is less important than his H.U.G.E ego! <br/><br/>The story could have easily being more nuanced with the growth of Amir's character (please note that I wrote Amir, because I think, it was written just to make Amir this awe-inspiring-faultless- unbeatable hero). <br/><br/>The growth being:- Amir comes to terms with the fact that when Geeta does win the Gold,he is proud of who she has grown to become, not because she is his creation, his puppet who has won doing his bidding."
"born-naked-0","10","2","5","28 December 2016"," ""Brilliant movie"" is an understatement.....
","Hard work always pays.....<br/><br/>First about the real characters, Mahavir Singh Phogat(played by Aamir Khan) a wrestler himself has wrestled not only in the ring but with the society also to train his girls Geeta, Babita in a men dominating sport that too in a cult patriarchal society of Haryana where being born as a girl child is seen bane not as boon (now the situation is lot better).<br/><br/>Geeta (played by Zaira Wasim & Fatima Sana Shaikh), free style wrestler who won first ever gold medal in wrestling (India) and the first ever woman to qualify for Olympics but the journey to reach this pinnacle is what is summarized in the movie.<br/><br/>Babita (played by Suhani Bhatnagar & Sanya Malhotra), also an Commonwealth gold medalist of course.<br/><br/>Now the reel characters, Aamir Khan always puts his head & heart to anything he does but in this he went an extra mile, the character and the charisma he possess as a wrestler & as a Father in this movie will indulge you throughout.The girls (both younger and matured) did no less then Aamir rather because of their acting skills the movie is one of the epic movies of Bollywood. The transformation of the energy, persona, character of the girls from the young to the matured is placid. They made acting look so easy. Respect for the fact that the girls went through tremendous hardcore training to justify the character. There is so much to learn from the movie like dedication, parenting, coaching, self-motivation & the stubbornness to make a mark. There are scenes that are so intense and grasping that you will forget breathing for a moment. Every song is meaningful & worth but the title track steals the show, you will have goosebumps, I swear.<br/><br/>Overall its more then a movie its an inspiration to women, a journey of becoming substantial from nobody.<br/><br/>Its a bliss to watch.<br/><br/>Cheers!!"

"Acrix","6","2","6","25 January 2017"," Fun, but overrated
","So, I watched Dangal and it was fun, to say in the least. It had parts which it did well and it had things which it did not do so well. <br/><br/>Now this movie is based on the true story of a family of wrestlers(as everyone already knows) and the landmark of this movie is teenage girls beating up boys and my, was that a lot of fun to watch. Combined with the music playing in the background, it was simply epic! Furthermore, I'd say that the first half was done very well. Aamir's performance was amazing, the fights were well- choreographed (although they ended with the same finishing move) and I'd say it had some pretty good songs as well, although that's my personal preference. <br/><br/>Above all, it was a very inspirational tale. The movie makes sure to show all the backlash the girls received for wrestling and all the struggles they have to face. And the payoff for it all is very rewarding and we clearly get the feeling that the characters deserved all they worked for. <br/><br/>And now for what the movie did not so well. The quality of acting for the actors except Aamir was quite variable depending on the moment. For certain scenes, it was rather stiff and the actors failed to show emotion in a scene which required that. Also, there are scenes where the portrayed emotions felt rather fake. However, the wrestling scenes were incredible and you could feel the passion within them whenever they were wrestling. <br/><br/>Another negative is the inclusion of the Bollywood 'masala' several points into the movie. I understand it's importance in film but the film overuses this to the point that you no longer feel like you're watching a biography. Heck, some changed events are so improbable and ridiculous, you feel like you're just watching another generic sports movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of generic sports movies, the whole story plays out ,like one. It is very predictable and if you've seen a number of sports movies, you know exactly what's going to happen. The first half was nice but the second half is so filled with aforementioned 'masala' that I just couldn't take it seriously at all! <br/><br/>So yeah, I didn't find it to be a great masterpiece as everyone else was saying. It was fun and it has it's good parts but there have been Bollywood movies that have tackled similar themes in a better way."

This movie splashes a strong message to the audience by being the first in its kind. This movies inspires the millions and makes aware of the diligence of Phogat Veteran.

Wow, and he overpasses all of this to achieve what he dream of.<br/><br/>Movie also gives a great message that there should be some Goal, dream to do something in life.

"sounak-60446","10","2","6","1 January 2017"," A must watch movie for everyone
","An outstanding performance from the entire team of DANGAL which includes both the cast and the crew. The film is based on the life of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two elder daughters Geeta and Babita. The film starts with a scene where Aamir Khan( Mahavir Singh Phogat)relives his wrestling moments when he was challenged by his fellow colleague. Even after he quits wrestling he had the dream of winning gold for his country which can be fulfilled only by his son. But unfortunately he was blessed with four daughters and he started believing that his dream will forever remain a dream. The film portrays the journey of his two elder daughters Geeta and Babita from a simple village girl to a wrestling champion and also their relationship with their father. However this journey was started due to an unconventional incident that took place in both of the daughters life. <br/><br/>Though the story of the movie is based on real life events it has been narrated beautifully. The dish prepared by director Nitesh Tiwari along with Aamir Khan and supported by other actors are absolutely marvelous. Dialogue played an important role in this film. Though the language spoken in this film is Haryanvi but it doesn't create any kind of problem in understanding it. It was crisp and enjoyable. Amitabh Bhattacharya and Pritam has done a great job in the music section and was well supported by the singers. Screenplay is equally good. There are many scenes which are well occupied with the wrestling scenes but they are catered to us in such a way that one won't feel bored. The climax scenes are crated in such a way that it keeps one at the edge of the seat.<br/><br/>Now come to the performances.The lead actor Aamir Khan (Mahavir Singh Phogat) acted incredibly well. He truly is a perfectionist. The way he transformed himself to a bulkier figure to play the older Mahavir Singh Phogat and again transforming himself to a more fitter person to play the younger version of Mahavir Singh Phogat. The swing of his role from a strict coach of his daughters to that of the role of caring father is presented by Aamir Khan is really appreciable. The performance of Fatima Sana Shaikh as elder Geeta and Sanya Malhotra as elder Babita is fabulous. The work of Zaira Wasim as younger Geeta has really taken me a back as she seemed to be a debutante. Suhani Bhatnagar as Younger Babita and Shakshi Tanwar as their mother played great supporting roles. The cousin brother role played by Ritwik Sahore(younger) and Aparshakti Khurana(elder) is quite appreciable as he brings those comic scenes which just fits the Phogat family. Overall it is stand out performance for the entire team. Again Aamir Khan has provided us with a film which will remain in my heart throughout my life. Thanks Aamir and the entire Dangal team for such a beautiful work."

","This is how an Biopic should be portrayed, just on the point , showing the dedication , hard work, their journey towards what they are right now. Perfect plot, perfectly showcased. So That's what call a ""Biopic"".<br/><br/>Have you ever seen actors to really do what the scene is needed, when that is not their cup of cake, i mean ""Actors"" doing ""Wrestling"", we all know how hard it is to ""Wrestle"" and for being ""Wrestling"" like a professional in a short span of time that too like a ""Wrestler"" is an commendable job. They were not acting, they were indeed the person they were playing. Hats off to full Star cast for that, they haven't shown us that they are not filming to complete the scene just for sake, but they were living the same moment, and so.. That's what we call ""Acting"".<br/><br/>For an movie to be successful we have many aspects, but what we see is what is ""Piece of work that is directed by an director"" to ""Direct"" this story to what we have seen at last. Beautiful peace of direction!! That's what we call ""Directing"".<br/><br/>Music is intact, and not exaggerating the plot. And Music is so engaging and energising that we get vibes go all our Viens and enjoy each best of it. Title track nailed it. That's what we call ""Music"".<br/><br/>Movie is team work, each section has to be taken care of, and I guess this team was of skilled persona, indeed dedicated persona that made this movie a great example how well it was made and how team has worked on it. That's what we call ""Team Work"".<br/><br/>So...

"Anonymous002","5","1","2","28 July 2018"," Beautiful but biased toward Mahavir Singh Phogat
","In scripting , direction , acting and technical aspects this film is perfect but digging deep into the story , you will find many flaws in the script and the story looks too fake. First thing is Mahavir Singh Phogat's character . The film tries hard to make his character look good. In the scene where Geeta and Babita goes to a friend's marriage and she explains them how their father does right by forcing them to wrestle is completely nonsense. It's a really illogical scene.<br/><br/>Now, as a biography it is completely fake. The character of Coach Pramod Kadam was completely fictional . There were seven coaches in National Academy of sports and no one by the name of Pramod Kadam. There was no such villain in Geeta's real life. And it highly unlikely to believe that the coach in such a big institute gives wrong training to his students .<br/><br/>But I always thought as a film it is perfect despite not being true. But, I was proven wrong when I read Baradwaj Rangan's review . (Following are his views on the film ) . I came to know this is highly fairy tale like film. She follows father's advice and won, she neglects him and she lost. In just one day , Mahavir learns that his girls are strong and decides to make them wrestlers. This film has a very few shades of dark. The atmosphere was always like she will win at the end and she did.<br/><br/>So, for me it scores neither as a biography nor as a fiction."

This movie tells gender equality how a female makes nation pride by winning a gold medal (wrestling) in Olympic Games. Apart from inspiration, movie is filled with emotions and comedies. Main lead role is Aamir Khan who is a father of girls. He used to a wrestler but never won gold medal at international level. He wants to have a boy who can win gold medal, and fulfill his dream. Unfortunately he has four daughters. One moment in movie realized him that gold medal is gold medal whether a boy gets it or girl.Movie covered in two parts.

","yes i voted 1 out of 10 for this movie and maybe i'm the only idiot to do so but hear me out.Dangal shows the struggle of Geeta Phogat an real life girl who was born in 80's and those of us who were know how difficult it was for a girl to compete with men due to our social stigmas.The achievement of Geeta Phogat and how she reached there was no less of a miracle than what was shown in the movie with dramatized scenes to spice it all up. That was the biggest mistake of Amir Khan, i believe that for the real life Geeta Phogat the struggles must have been something that we cannot even imagine and how she won the gold becoming the first Indian woman ever to do so and her story as it happened without any changes whatsoever has to be told to the world because she deserves that respect, instead of the artificiality that was shown in the movie. It would have deserved the Oscar if they would have replicated the exact and perfectly copied fight from the original fight which was historic for Indian women wrestlers,just like they did in ""Miracle"" the movie about Ice Hockey. Or at least have a alternate version of the movie and re-release it before Oscars,so that Amir Khan can win the first Oscar too for India just like her Pahalwan did in real life. <br/><br/>Comments anyone..."

","I think the movie is slightly overrated. There is nothing wrong with the movie but there is nothing new in it. Blame it all on director and screenplay writer. The whole time in the movie, I was getting the essence of Chak DE India and few other sports movies. Like they initially don't want to be trained and then after realizing the good in it, they joined the campaign with full force. 70 minute moment before finals. Obviously, it was 6 minutes only. Rough competition in the semifinal. In short watching this movie makes me feel like I have watched a mixture of a 4-5 sports movie. Especially after the interval. Before the interval, the experience was quite funny. Overall it's a good watch, but doesn't deserve this rating."

But from 2000 Aamir is giving extraordinary film one after another. May be some his film like Dhobi Ghat or Talaash can not be appreciated by masses as it needs refined taste and sensibilities. To me Talaash is better film than Dhoom3 but Dhoom3 made much bigger business than Taalash for his its mass appeal. SRK is very charming person no doubt but if he always look for big director, big production house and popular heroin but on the other hand Aamir work with new or not so successful director and give Superhit after Superhit.

","Dangal is an emotionally made biographical tale that talks about a former National level wrestler who could not win a Gold medal for India due to his personal commitments but fulfills his wish by making his two daughters win medals at the Commonwealth Games. It is not the first time we are witnessing a film that speaks about a wrestler's life, but no matter how many films you might have watched, Dangal stands unique in a lot of ways. Director Nitesh Tiwari has to be credited for the way he has treated the film with not much force fitted theatrics yet grabbing the attention of the audience throughout the film. Yes, there were one or two dramatic moments which looked essential for the script and they were not overdone.<br/><br/>Finally, we have a film that talks about the real struggle of a wrestler. How much they had to lose to win a medal for the nation? People who watch this film might never take wrestling as their profession, but one thing is for certain, the respect for the sport will undoubtedly increase. Aamir Khan hits it out of the park yet again with another emotional masterpiece!"

","This movie based on true story of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat training his daughters in wrestling event to achieve championship at international level , this story is well pictured with a good screen play and direction its well casted by Aamir Khan,Fatima Sana Shaikh,Sanya Malhotra, and all the other characters in the movie did their jobs to build support to the movies success,as required at correct context comedy path is mildly added , with out disturbing the main story line, Aamir Khan's performance was good through out in which he struggles at every instant to achieve a gold medal for the country ,where at one stage he gives guidelines to his daughter indirectly and makes her successful,and at one instant he is trapped up not to see the match ,but the result of match was well executed which must be appreciated, songs are not of much importance to this script, then to dangal dangal song sounds good at situations,credits to the whole team of Dangal."

","dangal is about a selfish & sadistic man who failed to reach his golden medal on his time so he tortures his daughters and turned them into sons to reach his personal ambition !! it's about a regressive dominant male who physically tortures his daughters , makes them slaves against their wishes , steals their childhood & youth and didn't even bather himself to sit as a father with his daughters for 5 min to tell them that what he's doing is good for them ..that's because he really never think what bad or good for them he only has his ambition , his goal & will do anything to reach it.<br/><br/>And then he steal the limelight of the deserving girl's victory in the end PROVING that MEN WILL ALWAYS BE ABOVE WOMEN & WILL BE APPRECIATED MORE.<br/><br/>A twisted massage sent by this movie even that they try to hide it by the marriage scene when there friend envy them on there father who want to make them important by making them slaves to his ambition not like her father who marry her in that age !!!! LOL ..that's so stupid because he exactly did the same here only mahavier obsessed of his medal & her father with marrying his daughter both choose there daughters life bath & didn't ask them , didn't treat them as humans had there choice.<br/><br/>Other scene make me so mad of this movie which is the lecture scene before the last match when he sat with geta and tell her to win for every woman and prove to all whose treat women not equal to men that women can do anything !!!!! are you laughing at me or yourself ???!!! Mahavier never believe in Geta as a daughter but as a son , when she is in the academy & decided to back look like as a woman even she had won on him but when she get back from home she loses every match after that, & when she leave that though of caring about herself and cut her hair back & started to became a boy again And under mahavier coaching she finally won the medal!!!!!!!!you just proved the other wise by the way.. That massage of #Chak De India (2007) & #Mary Kom (2014) No Way to match here.. i'm sorry , can't buy it ..<br/><br/>The real MORAL of the story here , if you think your daughters are equal to boys and can do what boys can do even if they don't want to ,just torture them ,cut their hairs and make them look like boys ,treat them like boys and force them to do what you want just to prove that they are equal to boys . WHAT A TWISTED VIEW ON FEMINISM!!!!<br/><br/>strongly not recommended i wish if i can get back my 2 hours that i wasted in that sadistic movie"

The script was not only well written and careful about tiniest details but also sends a pretty strong message about women empowerment. It was also able to depict almost all the troubles Mahavir Singh and his family face in the society. That is why I have to say Director Nitesh Tiwari did a splendid job in filming this movie.<br/><br/>I do not want write much about the film because I want you all to go watch this outstanding film.

"millenniummilan","9","1","4","31 December 2016"," An Actors' Paradise, but a Biographic waste
","This article is written after a strong analysis and contains a lot of spoilers. So if you hate spoilers, avoid it.<br/><br/>The most awaited film of 2016, DANGAL, is an actor's paradise. Mister perfectionist, Aamir Khan, has turned his everything into this film. Director, Nitesh Tiwari, has shown immense maturity in the type of story telling and screenplay. This movie will pull you to the center of its essence and make you realize the determination, hard work and devotion of all the artists.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan(Mahavir Singh Phogat) : He is flamboyant and one of the best or may be the performance by the perfectionist. Increasing 35 kg for a role and again getting back to form says it all.<br/><br/>Fatima Sana Shaikh(Geeta Kumari Phogat) : She is such great characteristics which can easily make her the star of the film. For a first timer on the big screen(excluding her work in CHACHI 420), she has her mark left and may be she is going to get the BEST DEBUTANT FEMALE award next year.<br/><br/>Zaira Wasim(young Geeta) : She is a beauty with her small but very important role. She has nailed it.<br/><br/>Sanya Malhotra (Babita Kumari Phogat) and Suhani Bhatnagar (young Babita) and Ritwik Sahore(young Omkar) have supported through out in a magnificent way.<br/><br/>Sakshi Tanwar(Daya Kaur) : No one could have done it better.<br/><br/>Girish Kulkarni(GEETA KUMARI'S COACH PRAMOD KADAM) : He is not the real coach even, and yes he needed to act better. <br/><br/>So overall acting : 9/10 stars<br/><br/>Director(Nitesh Tiwari) : From an entertaining film like Chillar Party, he has come a great way to deliver his career best and a superb story line. THE FIGHT BETWEEN MAHAVIR AND GEETA was the highlight of the film before intermission. That was staged so perfectly, it depicts the emotions of a father who fears to lose his daughter and a daughter who wants to prove herself correct and her anger to lead in her own way. The songs have created a charm to bind the audience. The PRACTICE OUTSIDE NSA has been the real charm after the intermission. This depicts the faith of every parents that they should keep on their children. Thank you Nitesh Tiwari for such great works.<br/><br/>Direction : 9.5/10<br/><br/>This film had no flaws as a film, in fact as a film it is highly entertaining and at the same time a lot meaningful. But AS A BIOGRAPHY, IT IS A WASTE.<br/><br/>THE THROAT CUT FIGHTS : These fights kept the audiences to their toes on the verge of their seats and makes you bite your nails and make you relive the actual match, BUT IN REAL GITA KUMARI WAS TOO DOMINANT ON HER RIVALS. the final match score was shown as 4-1 4-6 and 6-5. but reality shows that she dominated her opponent with 1-0 and 7-0 straight.<br/><br/>THE NAMES : Yes, you read it right, The names of all the opponents, coach of Geeta Kumari was changed. The final opponent was from Australia though named Emily which was shown as Angelina. Even the real name of GEETA's coach was PR SONDHI.<br/><br/>THE MYSTERY OF THE LOCKED ROOM : In the film, MAHAVIR was shown locked by the coach PRAMOD KADAM. Now to reality, neither MAHAVIR was ever locked in any room, nor the real name of the coach was Pramod Kadam. Yes, the real name of GEETA's coach was PR SONDHI. So in my views it is unethical to show someone's character in lime light.<br/><br/>THE BEAUTY OF SMALL HAIRS : It was shown that when GEETA lost consecutive international matches, she realized her mistake and again cut her hair short. And even during the CWG2010, she had small hairs. But in reality, GEETA KUMARI had long hairs during CWG2010.<br/><br/>LAST WORDS : These flaws never make the film bad, but covering up all the flaws would have made the film one of the best BIOGRAPHIC film ever in the history of cinemas. This could easily have been a strong contender to Oscar if these flaws would have been covered. So finally, this is a must watch for any Indian. The enthusiasm and patriotism shown in the film will make your blood boil and feel the scenes and the sports. But looking it as a biography, it has some serious issues. And that is why it deserves a 7 star<br/><br/>For me MARY KOM and M S DHONI still remains the best biographic film. This is truly an Actors' Paradise."
"AdityaChaphekar","10","1","4","29 December 2016"," Watch Dangal For Aamir Khan and the Phogat Girls Performances!!!
","Never seen the audience rising during any movie for the anthem... A truly inspiring film by Aamir Khan. Both actors playing Geeta and Babita were exceptional, so were the younger ones. Dangal is a film where Mahavir Phogawat, a national champion, who gives up on his dream to win gold medal for India because of his poverty. He wants his son to be a wrestler, but his every time he becomes the father, its a girl. There's one incident where he realizes that his girls can make his dream come true and starts their training to make them wrestlers. Brilliant work by Nitesh Tiwari, Pritam, Amitabh Bhattacharya and the cast. The movie also throws light on the typical small town mentality people of how they see a girl and the unwelcoming of females in sports like wrestling. An outstanding performance by Aamir Khan- A true perfectionist who transformed his body the way he wanted to be pictured. When you put your blood and sweat in the training, the hard work and discipline pays off for you to become a winner!"
"Ramacc","1","6","69","23 December 2016"," Passable
","Aamir Khan's movie composes the real-life figure of Mahavir Singh, a champion wrestler turned pot bellied clerk who secured his sporting legacy with a rethink on realising his daughters Geeta and Babita had more fight in them than any male heir might have. As with most of this Khan's crowd pleasers, it's acutely attuned to wider realities: beyond the mat, the Singhs encounter superstition, child brides and institutional slackness, each sidebar reflecting a social struggle. However with the Amir Khan's recent intolerant remarks had left a deep scar with Indian audience. However, an open minded Indian would still want to see the movie and laud the content of the movie."
"cableanna","1","2","18","6 October 2017"," Watch Chakde India instead. This is just a regressive version.
","Dangal: This overrated masterpiece? lol. 9 years ago we had a much better, a brilliant and progressive Chakde India. And now we have a regressive tale of a dominant male who physically tortures his daughters, turns them into sons, chooses their career without asking what they want to be which is exactly opposite of the great message given by 3 idiots, steals their childhood and youth and turns them into slaves against their wishes to fulfill a personal ambition? Meh. It is a no-risk same old story with just an average to good performance by Aamir. Nothing great. Anybody could have played Mahavir Singh Phogat. Eating cakes and going to gym isn't great acting. Lol.<br/><br/>Are you planning to rewatch any Indian movies? Could you watch Chakde India, Swades, My Name Is Khan, Dilse.. ,Devdas, Veer Zara or Om Shanti Om? I hope you liked Fan which has a magnificent double lead performances like in Stephen King's Misery and Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy; and Raees which is like Indian Narcos where the lead character dies for the crime he didn't commit. You will also love Chakde over Dangal, Dilse.. over Rang De Basanti, Swades over Pk and Taare zameen par, My Name Is Khan which is as classic as Forrest Gump and Rainman over 3 idiots. You should check out DON series for some good action and psychological thrill. There are martial art techniques like WING CHUN, TRAPPING, KRAV MAGA in Don series. Extremely realistic fights. If you have watched The Notebook, you will love Jab Tak Hai Jaan over it and Om Shanti Om over La La Land. Paheli is a fantasy with women empowerment which is like a live action Disney-Pixar movie. Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani is a comedy satire on media and journalism and politics which was way ahead of its time and similarly Oh Darling Yeh Hai India which is on Netflix is the first bizarre musical thriller and a parody movie of Bollywood, Maya Memsaab is a adaptation of the classic Madam Bovary and a researchgate paper is written analyzing the implications of western influence on Indian women titled ""Colonization of Madam Bovary: Hindi cinema's Maya Memsaab"".You will love others like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Josh, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Dear Zindagi, Kal Ho Na Ho(you will love this over Fault in our Stars, A Walk to remember). Asoka is a wonderful historical fiction and also a biopic on a 250 BC ruler. You will enjoy it because it was actually made keeping international audiences in mind but unfortunately Lagaan got selected for Oscar nomination instead because of bias. The lead performance in DARR is an actual realistic portrayal of a disturbed obsessed person in love. It is a great psychological thriller and doesn't become a parody like Robert Deniro's Cape Fear. You must absolutely watch Baazigar and Anjaam. You will love the laugh in Baazigar, it is more reminiscent of the Joker and Anjaam is a true blue psychopath movie with no scope of rooting for the lead character. Like American Psycho. You didn't know Ra.One is an cross- cultural Indian superhero movie with an advanced futuristic virtual reality technology which is not explained similar to technologies in the Black Mirror show and musical dance numbers? The chase scene of Captain America Civil War seems to be inspired from Ra.one, Also Electro's look in Amazing spiderman 2 and Adam Sandler's Pixels ripped off Ra.One...you will find many pop culture beauties like very different and realistic VFX and H.A.R.T which is like Ironman's arc reactor. And sense of humour is similar to Deadpool's. It is better than its Enthiraan and Krrish counterparts, with a futuristic advanced virtual reality technnology that goes haywire. I think you should give them a chance rather than being biased towards specific film makers and actors. You talked about how you love feelings- driven, light hearted, hangout movies. You should watch Jab Harry Met Sejal. It is made in the style of European slice of life romcoms. Like the Before Trilogy. Have a great Diwali!"

For example Seitan (Thrice the amount of protein than meat). And nuts.<br/><br/>The body can only store a limited amount of protein every serving you eat.

","Mahavir Singh Phogat is a former Indian national champion wrestler. With no support from the government, he failed to get an international gold medal for his country but hoped to be redeemed by a son. He is disillusioned after getting four daughters and no sons. Even the Gods have turned against him. Then neighborhood parents complain that Mahavir's daughters Geeta and Babita had beaten up their boys. He is inspired to train them for girls' wrestling.<br/><br/>This is based on the real family of wrestlers. As soon as he had the first daughter, it seems obvious where this is going. For an hour, this is a formulaic underdog sports movie. At that point, my main complaints are that it uses way too many montages and I thought cutting the girls' hair is a step too far. It follows the formula well and the characters are appealing. It's a solid sports movie. Then the movie keeps going and going. The darn thing is almost three hours and unlike other Bollywood movies, there are no long song and dance sequences. The story takes another step and the relationships get deeper. There is a fight between father and daughter that is tense and emotional. It takes the movie to a higher level. Even the hair has a nice payoff later on. The wrestling at the end is compelling. This is one of the better movies from Bollywood."

His every picture different and remarkable in bollywood.<br/><br/>Dangal story of wrestler and his two daughters, wow what a creation of characters, its realistic story biopic story even there is point to out mistake in each scene. Mr. Perfectionist Aamir performed as Father and Wrestler its tremendous job. He should eligible to win Best Actor role Oscar,National Award and Filmfare awards. I have been fan of him from Lagaan picture after Rang de Basanthi is also good but from 3 idiots movie he changed total bollywood level. 100cr clubs collection is big matter to bollywood his picture entered 300cr club. From there started collection tsunami till not stopped.<br/><br/>Dangal a magic mark of Indian cinema 2000cr collection worldwide, yeas almost 50% more than that from Chinese market. They don't love the movie, they watched movie with heart. So first Indian movie created a big wonder in China. <br/><br/>Coming to Aamir Acting is a major key and his daughters geetha, babitha wow they stunned acting in movie. In childhood characters also superb. Every Scene they are playing wrestling game, Emotional with father and Career, Gold for Country...so admirable. Perfect of Everything Story,Screenplay,Music is awesome a great melodies and inspiration title song.<br/><br/>Dangal has to get many National awards in 2017, I pray to get Oscar Award also with this movie to Dangal picture and Actor. Because India is waiting for Oscar since many decades Aamir attempted with Lagaan movie it missed, but it could give positive i think so. 20 out of 10 is my rating.<br/><br/>Dangal complete hindustani picture and Indian government should encourage every sport except cricket after watching this movie. Wrestling is A game but a girl, woman passion about this type of games to achieve something, of course its father's dream. Indian Government recognize every talented sports persons and encourage them."
