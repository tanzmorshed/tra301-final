","Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!"

","If you are expecting an epic cinematic masterpiece, then ""The Holiday"" is not for you. However, if you are looking for a light, entertaining movie, I would definitely recommend this film. While the previews were intriguing, I was thrilled to find that not every plot element was revealed before I even entered the theater. I completely enjoyed Kate Winslet as hopelessly devoted Iris. She was neurotic, a bit spineless, and absolutely winning. Although I do wish that her story had been developed more thoroughly. I felt a bit like her relationship was rushed through and the film spent a majority of the time focusing on Amanda (Diaz), Graham (Law), and their developing relationship. Despite the fact that I am not a huge Cameron Diaz or Jude Law fan, I was pleasantly surprised with their part of the story! Jack Black kept his character to an energetic hum rather than an explosion of crazy antics. You've just got to love that eyebrow! The scenery was beautiful! The supporting cast was hugely entertaining. I laughed out loud. The ending is fairly predictable. This is a romantic comedy after all. However, ""The Holiday"" is a great film for those of us who would like to suspend reality for a while and just enjoy. Go see it!"

","Do you like chocolate? Do you know that moment, even before you put it in your mouth? You can imagine that taste. You can feel that rich sweetness on your tongue, the smoothness going around your mouth . . .<br/><br/>The Holiday is a romantic comedy. You know what that means. And if you don't like romantic comedies, don't go and see it. If you do, you will know what to expect. The mushy feelings creeping up on you. All those 'If Only . . .' emotions telling you there is a lovely place somewhere in which people fall in love and everything works out kinda perfect. If only for a while . . . say, for the holiday period over Christmas and New Year . . . or for the 138 minutes which this film lasts.<br/><br/>Two Women on the Verge of Emotional Breakdown do holiday house swap. They escape lovelorn predicaments and find 'unexpected' love on their opposite sides of the Atlantic. Cue picturesque English country house just the way Americans imagine it (with sheep out the back). Cue enormous L.A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it).<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is Amanda, owner of a movie-trailers editing firm. Since she's played the same comedy character several times, there are few surprises; but an excellent script, written directly for her and the other three leading stars, projects it rather better than average. Kate Winslet as Iris, a successful writer on The Telegraph, is more nuanced: an actor with considerable range, we cannot but help admire the way she does 'pathetic girl' rather beautifully in a role that she could manage with one hand counting the ways to have fun and get paid simultaneously.<br/><br/>Formulaic it is (wonderful women with scoundrelly fellas eventually get The Real Men They Deserve - meeting puppy dogs, children, and falling snowflakes on the way of course). But, well-done within a narrow genre, it still stands out. No-brainers like this tend to have dumb scripts and dumber acting, but The Holiday contains warm, natural dialogue and heartfelt chemistry. If this was the 40's, you'd want Jude Law and Cameron Diaz to get married off-screen afterwards. Charismatic and entertaining, unless you find Diaz, Law or Winslet personally irritating (some people do), they are a joy to watch, filling their parts with love and light. Excellent production values keep the rather trite story flowing. Everything is picture-perfect, long lenses flattering the features of the already handsome stars, filters and soft-focuses carefully delineating the mood.<br/><br/>There is an overall honesty to the performances. ""You look like my Barbie!"" delights a four-year-old excitedly to Diaz. Ironic? But said with so much affection it is self-deprecating rather than cutting. Jack Black struggles to get out of his music-and-silly-faces typecasting but just manages to look the part for an intellectual Iris who is not attracted to skin-deep. Jude Law, on the other hand, could be an advert for men's skin cream, and too rounded a character to be mere pin-up material.<br/><br/>With more Christmas songs than you can shake a piece of tinsel at, The Holiday is a warm, snuggly romance to lose yourself in before coming firmly back down to planet earth. It might be shallow, but it's seasonal entertainment - and a Swiss chocolate of romantic comedies."
"kclambeth","8","31","36","17 May 2007"," Enjoyable escapism
","I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) fed up with their love lives; Amanda's boyfriend has been cheating on her and the man Iris loves has just got engaged to someone else. They both decide to switch houses for Christmas for an escape from their complicated lives; so Iris jets off to Amanda's place in sunny L.A and Amanda goes to Iris' quaint cottage in snowy Surrey, England (if only it really did snow at Christmas!) Amanda soon meets Iris' handsome brother Graham (Brilliantly played by Jude Law) and Iris meets musician Miles (Jack Black) and you can guess the rest...<br/><br/>The acting is strong and well handled. At first i found Cameron Diaz hugely annoying but as it went on i warmed to her character; she and Jude had lots of chemistry and their relationship was handled well and Graham's secret was a good twist.<br/><br/>I thought Jack Black was great in this different role, he and Kate also had chemistry and he was totally believable. I wish their storyline had been a bit longer though as they spent way more time on Cameron and Jude's part.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet as usual was funny and touching as Iris and maybe one of the best parts of the film was her relationship with the old man (Eli Wallach) they both seemed to have a connection and it was nice to hear his stories of when he was a writer in the good old Hollywood days when he knew Cary Grant and co! If you want beautiful scenery, escapism from the millions of horror and action films out there and good characterisation, than this is for you. It's not as soppy as other rom/com's and it's easy to identify with the characters, it's also very festive and my dad even liked it and he hates romantic films!"
"Redriter","9","194","258","8 December 2006"," Nice~ very nice
","This was a really good, light hearted movie, with GREAT characterization. There are points where the movie is a little slow, but not slow enough to loose your interest.<br/><br/>All of the characters are wonderfully developed especially Jude Laws-the under-story of Jude's character adds an extra dimension to his character and really makes you love him all the more.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's character is another that was well worked out. She helps out this little old man . . . and the character development between her and this older gentleman is wonderful . . . it adds so much to her character, makes her more human, more real, someone very likable and someone you want to end up with a good ending.<br/><br/>Jack Black's character was sweet, not corny . . . and you end up liking him very much. He was not a goober like he usually is in his movies.<br/><br/>Over all, it was a wonderfully character driven movie, that was enjoyable and had you leaving the theater feeling good. I recommend it highly!"
"Rastas","7","8","8","1 January 2007"," A movie without overt sex, violence, gunfire, explosions or profanity...and I still really enjoyed it!
","While this movie is not going to be a masterpiece and held up in the future as an example of ""great"" film making, it was, in my opinion, a well made, albeit predictable, movie.<br/><br/>I did appreciate the storyline was a bit of a formula, but it had enough in the sub plots to keep me interested all the way through.<br/><br/>I got what I expected and a little more from the lead characters, but was a little disappointed in the performance of Jack Black. I am a fan of Jack, but am seeing a lot of the same from him in his facial contortions. Even so the character was ""lovable""! The real surprise for me was the whole ""Arthur Abbott"" (Eli Wallach) sub plot. It was delightful and saved the show from the malaise that plagues the romantic comedy, that being predictability.<br/><br/>I am not a romantic comedy type of guy, yet I was sucked into this movie well and truly.<br/><br/>As I left, I felt like I had been treated as a human being. I had not been assaulted by the violence, overt sexual references, gunfire and the explosions that seem to be everywhere. (Not that I don't like a good ""shoot the baddies"" or ""indecent suggestive action"" type of movie). <br/><br/>This was just good clean ""fun""! And I would see it again (next year maybe!)"
"anoble1-1","10","283","400","8 December 2006"," Best holiday romantic comedy yet.
","I laughed. I cried. I awed. My jaw even dropped a couple of times. This movie surpassed all of my original expectations. At almost two and a half hours, I thought it might drag on, but I never felt like it was really that long. This movie is not only about heartbreak and heart ache, it's about finding yourself and appreciating the true things in life. I felt that Kate and Cameron did a wonderful job. Their characters come from two very different worlds yet they both seek the same thing...escape. They encounter so much more upon arriving at their destinations, and ultimately end up finding the completely unexpected. Jude is a star charmer as always, and Jack, well, he's Jack. Seeing this movie should be on everyone's holiday ""to-do"" lists, and I can guarantee it will be in my DVD collection once it is released. Nancy Meyers hit a home run with this one and it is sure to bring everyone a nice large dose of holiday spirit."
"the-movie-guy","8","134","185","8 December 2006"," A good date movie that is entertaining and sweet
","(Synopsis) Two beautiful women, Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) both find themselves at the end of failed relationships just before Christmas. Amanda decides to take a two week vacation and surfs the internet. She meets Iris online, and they agree to swap their homes for the holidays. Amanda lives in Los Angles and Iris lives in the countryside of Surrey, England. Even though they now have a change of scenery and want no contact with men, they are both still depressed and lonely. But things are about to change when Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) drops by Iris' house and meets Amanda. On the other side of the world, Iris meets Miles (Jack Black) a film composer. Romance is in the air and sparks are about to fly.<br/><br/>(My Comment) If you want to see a romantic comedy with real chemistry, especially between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law this is one chick flick you must see. This movie is a good date movie that is actually entertaining and sweet. You are actually seeing two love stories instead of one. There is a great subplot of the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's character that will touch your heart. Actually, I enjoyed that part of the movie the best. Overall, the movie was enjoyable to watch with touching and funny scenes throughout the movie. The ending is predictable, but what do you expect, it is a romantic comedy. You will leave the movie feeling good, and isn't that what movies are all about. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:18, Rated PG-13)(8/10)"
"rosebraun","8","23","28","3 April 2007"," Loved it
","For the romantic fool in all of us. This is one of the good movies that shows that there are good guys out there is this world.<br/><br/>Jude Law makes a really good Graham. This is one of his first films that he plays a father in and he does it so well. He is fun loving and so sweet. The first scene that he is in with Cameron Diaz in which he kisses her eyes is so romantic. It makes all of us single girls just want to keep Jude on our couch and not let him get away. The kitchen scene is just a heart melting, gut wrenching, make your husband look out.<br/><br/>Jack Black is displaying a different role as Miles. This shows that he has a softer side and is willing to step out a traditional role that we are so used to seeing him in. He still does display the comedy that we are used to seeing but it is downplayed.<br/><br/>The music helps set the mood in this movie. It is all tamed down and helps to set the feeling of again I must say romance. It makes it so easy to watch and if you can find a guy that will sit down and watch this with you it will create feelings that may lead to something else.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well."
"cultfilmfan","8","130","190","2 December 2006"," The Holiday
","The Holiday is about two women who each have recently had problems with the men in their lives. Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. Neither of these women have ever met before, but they both want to escape for the holidays, so they talk online and decide to swap houses and automobiles for two weeks, so in other words Amanda would be staying at Iris's house in England and Iris would be staying at Amanda's house in California. Once they both reach their destinations they are both pretty bitter about men, but each of them soon meets different men in their lives who mean a lot to them and may make their holiday something to remember. The Holiday has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good original music. At first I wasn't really getting into this film and thought it would be a film that would probably appeal more to a woman than to me. Also the Amanda character played by Cameron Diaz annoyed me at first and I found her kind of artificial and ego centric. However as the film played on I found myself really liking this film. The characters grew on me and I found quite a bit to like about this movie. The chemistry between all the different characters works very well and their parts are all quite well written and the actors playing them each do a good job. I found that the film also developed and showed a lot about these characters which I enjoyed because the more I got to know about them the more I liked them and they were able to grow on me more. Each character in this film brings something unique to the table by being different and by really making this film more interesting than perhaps it sounds. The really rewarding thing about this film is how well the characters work with one another and that they are well written and well acted. This film is a romantic comedy and for the most part a lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because I find them silly and more for the female viewer than the male viewer, but this movie offers a lot of humour, heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy. One of the better films of the year and one of the better romantic comedies of recent years as well."
"krazy_k1988","10","22","28","14 March 2007"," Fantastic originality from a would-be cliché storyline
","What would at first seem to be a particularly predictable storyline turns out to be a wonderfully written, beautifully told love story. Two women currently unhappy in their own skins decide to temporarily trade lives, or homes at least. Iris (Kate Winslet) escapes the horror of unrequited love and ends up in an enormously plush house in L.A. Amamda (Cameron Diaz), fresh out of an unfaithful relationship finds herself in a cramped little cottage on the outskirts of a small English town. While Iris is immediately impressed with her new surroundings, Amanda needs a little convincing and this comes along in the form of Graham (Jude Law), Iris's brother, in whom Amanda takes an immediate, if very reluctant interest. The story goes on from there to include a mixture of both wonderfully cliché and surprisingly original situations. The dialogue between the characters is brilliantly written and completely believable and the little snippets of movie trivia along the way keep it interesting and fresh. This movie was a delight to encounter and will be a pleasure to watch over and over again."

","Well I have to confess I was dreading seeing this film, but actually I loved it.<br/><br/>The story is quite fantastical. But once you can go along with the ridiculous plot, it is very funny and totally charming. It's a bit like eating liquid chocolate, and somehow manages to last for 2 hours and 10 minutes without you feeling sick.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, the acting is very hammy, but this removes your desire for believability enough to carry the film. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law look absolutely lovely. Kate Winslett really pulls off her comedic role brilliantly. The are some beautiful touching moments about Hollywood history and a couple of famous faces appear in cameo roles. The English countryside is lovely. Lots of laughter and tears in the audience.<br/><br/>The nutritional value of chocolate is limited. This film will uplift you though if nothing else. Excellent Christmas movie (from a bloke!)."
"StrayFeral","10","23","31","10 August 2007"," Over expectations!
","Today is just one of those days, when you get tired from work and just want to chill a little, with a beer in one hand and remote control in the other. It's been a month or two maybe, since this movie passed on our cinemas, but I was not able to see it on the big screen and here I am - at home playing it on the DVD player. I like Jack Black - this is the reason I got the movie. Like Cameron Diaz, Jude and Kate too, but of all those four, Jack is my favorite and what I was expecting to see was something more like ""The School of Rock"" (2003) or ""Nacho Libre"" (2006) - I wanted something funny to release the Friday work stress. Well... I got something else. ""Different"" is the actual word. I remember I saw the trailer few times months ago, but as I now remember it was little misleading. Jack Black plus Cameron Diaz should be equal to who-knows-what, similar maybe to ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998), I though to myself and that's exactly what I need this Friday night! Today is one week since I work for another company, some more stress as You may guess and I prepared for a little fun. First of all to say - it was not funny. There were some amusing moments, but this movie for me was not funny at all and not a bad one at all either! It just was not ""comedy"", no matter how some label it. Surprisingly for me, this is one of those movies who really could make You think of the world around You and the way we live our lives. This is like ordering a sausage with fries and getting a fine fillet au champignons instead or however some would like to compare it, because in this movie, we see Jack and Cameron in very serious situations. It's not all credit for Jack and Cameron, of course - Jude and Kate did great too, as well as the director and writer did. I almost cried in few moments. It is a long movie - my player stopped at credits at 2h and few minutes, time now is 2:40am but I wanted to write this anyway. As my girlfriend sleeps next to me and I was watching the movie, it really made me thinking and recalling different moments of my life with her. I do not know - maybe I am just too emotional, please tell me Your opinion. Anyway I totally recommend the movie to everyone, really. In brief: story is not bad at all, actor play at the end is great, music is great, great level of originality, make you recall of movies like ""The Cable Guy"" (1996) a little. Great work guys! Now all of You, go and see it!"
"davispittman","10","8","9","10 June 2016"," Found no fault at all
","The Holiday (2006) is an out of the ballpark smash hit! I thought about it after seeing it and just seriously could find NO fault whatsoever. This is such a feel good, cute, romantic, and sweet film. And it's not one of those stupid run of the mill romance movies, it actually has depth and is well made. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are two women recently out of relationships with men, and pretty fed up with life in general, so they decide to go on vacation. They switch houses, Cameron goes to stay in England in Kate's house, and Kate goes to Los Angeles to stay in Cameron's house. The plot in and of itself is interesting and draws you in to keep watching. The script is well written and original, with little sparks of comedy thrown in where needed. And then there are scenes where we get to know our characters, usually through deep conversations with them and other characters. There definitely are NOT cardboard cut out one dimensional characters here, they are characters with real life issues, true depth, and interesting backgrounds. The romance and chemistry between the couples is great! It's truly eclectic and comes so wonderfully natural. I also love the side plot between Kate Winslet and the older screenwriter next door neighbor, it's so undeniably cute and so sweet, it's just endearing, I actually cried during the scene where he is honored at that ceremony! 10/10 for The Holiday! It's so well deserved!"
"Philby-3","6","84","130","9 February 2007"," Love, improbably
","Iris (Kate Winslett), attractive, if somewhat dowdy, young English journalist (she works for that citadel of fogeyism, the ""Daily Telegraph""), on the rebound from an affair with the shiftless Jasper (Rufus Sewell), one of the paper's columnists, decides she needs a Christmas holiday. She goes on-line and has soon swapped her Christmas-card pretty, but cramped, Surrey cottage with a mansion in Bel – Air owned by Amanda (Cameron Dias), the ebullient head of a company that makes movie trailers, who has just thrown out her latest useless partner. The girls swap places and in no time Amanda is romancing Iris's dishy brother Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile in Hollywood Iris is getting to know Miles (Jack Black), a workmate of Amanda's, and a 90 year old neighbour, Arthur (Eli Wallach) who happens to be one of Hollywood's forgotten great writers.<br/><br/>One can of course dismiss this sort of stuff as glossy fairy floss because basically, despite all the money and talent expended in making it, that is what it is - ""Love, Improbable."" This film is rather long for its genre, over two hours, and it does drag a bit, as if the scriptwriters couldn't decide how to end it. However it must be admitted that Kate Winslett and Jude Law are always interesting to watch on screen and Cameron Diaz has a nice line in parodying some of her earlier performances. Rufus Sewell shows he can out-act Hugh Grant any day (not hard I guess). Jack Black on the other hand seemed strangely out of place as Ms W's love interest – romantic comedy doesn't seem to be his forte, he's more of your gross-out guy. It was nice though to see Eli Wallach, a great Hollywood tough guy of old, who at 90 seems to have the market for nice old buffers sewn up, as the neighbour.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am setting my standard too high, but compared to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bedrooms and Hallways"" and even ""Love, Actually"", this was a pile of mush, far too sweet and sticky and nice. Good comedy needs a certain bite, a reality bite, a bit of astringency, whereas what we are given here is pure fairyland escapism. Writer/Director Nancy Myers has a record of light entertaining stuff (""The Parent Trap"", ""Father of the Bride"") and she certainly is not trying to extend her range here."

The movie was a lot better than i thought it would be and even though the plot is very unrealistic you still love the movie as it lifts your mood and makes you feel happy. The soundtrack to this movie is brilliant by Hans Zimmer, the music also has a massive impact on the mood of the movie. When you listen to the soundtrack you can see the movie in your head and remember what is happening at that point.

"cherold","7","7","8","29 August 2019"," Funny, but some casting issues
","This somewhat odd but distinctly likable film involves two women, one in L.A. and one in London, both unhappy in love, who switch homes to shake up their lives.<br/><br/>The movie is often funny and sometimes touching, with solid performances from all. Perhaps the biggest issue is the absence of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jack Black, which gives the movie a false note that could have been avoided if it wasn't so determined to follow the standard romantic comedy path. Winslet has much better chemistry with Eli Wallach, wonderful as an aged scriptwriter.<br/><br/>One interesting thing to note is Jude Law, whose handsome, empathetic, nurturing, understanding character could best be described as lady porn, plays the sort of role usually played by a woman: the perfect person, wonderful in every way, whose main role in the story is to allow the main character to transition to a new phase in their life.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie, and I don't love the structure, which simply involves cutting back and forth between two unrelated stories, but it's a nice feel-good chick flick thing that is perfect for days you don't want your brain to work too hard."
"dleath","6","87","147","30 November 2006"," Good to pass a rainy day
","Although this isn't my typical pick on movies I'd love to see, I have to say I enjoyed screening this one. The run time is a bit long, and the movie gets a bit soft in the middle, but considering you're actually watching two love stories (as opposed to one), I guess the run time is justified. It still seemed a bit forced to get the story told in a descent amount of time (still over two hours). The performances were moderate to good, with exception of Jude Law as Graham, who was wonderful.<br/><br/>If you're tired of holiday films that are so stacked with so much Christmas cheer that it makes you sick, this is the perfect alternative. Light enough for some serious laughs, and with enough drama to keep it interesting to audiences, this one's a good date movie. Leave the kids with a sitter. There are a few adult themes that could be uncomfortable to try to explain to a younger one."
"aggeloskrekas792","9","4","4","11 November 2019"," Such a good movie
","This is what it's all about. This is such a nice, heartwarming, emotional movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie. So much stuff to love about it. I serioualy cannot understand why it has such a low rating here on IMDb.<br/><br/>I overall, loved the message and the theme of this movie and probably even more importantly the execution of it and the way it was delivered. This movie is well made. It has great, complicated, 3-dimensional characters, who actually have a background and emotions, problems, feelings, insecutities, needs...etc. etc. etc. All this maeks them feel real and relatable and that results into us, the audience, to become invested and care, instead of counting down the minutes until the movie ends. This is such a basic concept in order for a movie to be succesful but ironically you rarely find it these days, especially in romantic comedies.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes there are a few very pleasant surprises. When I first watched this movie I knew nothing about it. I hadn't seen any trailers or knew who plays in it so (if you've seen it) you probably know what I'm referring to. But anyway, the movie has a beginning, middle and end. And the journey is very enjoyable to watch. It starts... ok with not much going on and you kinda know where it's going but then the story starts to unravel and it slowldy gets bigger and bigger and it gets better as you see more while more characters enter the story.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing as you'd expect from actors like Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law and Jack Black. Likeable and charming they all do a great job and they convey emotion so masterfully and with such heart.<br/><br/>The supporting characters were amazing as well. The supporting cast is very important as they make the world feel real, they can literally make or break such movies and the actors who portrayed them were great as well.<br/><br/>Like I said, overall, I loved the message and the theme of the movie. It's essentially a story about 4 (2?) troubled adults who are lonely. They seek to find love, find themselves and find happiness. Something which I think the entire world can identify and relate with. And what I liked about it is that the movie and the characters don't pretend like love is something stupid or cheesy or childish. They don't play it tough and strong, they don't deny or try to block off their feelings in order not to open up and be vulnerable (Just like the while of society does today unfortunately). They ARE vulnerable and open and in love. These people need love and affection in their lives and the journey through which they find it in this movie I thought was very charming and heartwarming.<br/><br/>This is a well thought out and put together movie with heart. Perfect for a cozy Christmas movie night if you ask me. Highly recommended if you like romantic comedies."

","We signed up for a Quickflix trial this week and this is one of the first movies we got.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" features some of the world's finest actors, as well as Jude Law. The four main roles go to Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Kate Winslet. The movie revolves around a British and American woman who are having big relationship issues and decide they need to get away. By chance they meet on a house swap website, and impulsively decide to swap houses for 2 weeks. While they are there they both meet some intriguing men and relationships begin to form.<br/><br/>At times there is some depth to the story, which is welcome as this genre lately has thrown out some trash, such as ""Prime"". A good cast, decent enough story...not too bad. Guys, you could sit through far worse."
"Stats87","8","8","10","27 May 2007"," Above Average Story Bolstered by Great Performances and Chemistry
","I saw this movie on my Satellite tonight and I'll admit I was kind of iffy about watching a Christmas movie in May. Without boring you with plot details, the story takes a semi-unique concept and follows a familiar path. While there are no big time surprises, it has a couple turns that might catch some viewers off guard. What elevates this movie to something worth noting are the performances by it's leading characters.<br/><br/>I've always liked Jude Law as an actor and he continues the trend here. He captures the suave and charming nature of a young ""single"" Male and blends it quite well with a touching heartfelt performance as a loving Father, trying to fill a void in his life. Very well done <br/><br/>Kate Winslet as Iris is probably the most relatable of all the characters and that is probably why she is so easy to like. Watching her bounce back and forth in between her emotions is fun, yet the sadder parts bring each person back to a time they went through the same thing. The better of the two female leads <br/><br/>I've never viewed Cameron Diaz as a talented actress,or been much of a fan, but I think this is the perfect type of role for her. She is very believable and the more the movie goes on, the more you begin to like her character. Cameron Diaz has always been an attractive woman, but in my opinion she was nothing special. However, in The Holiday there is this ""loveable prettiness"" that she possesses and she still has a great smile. Not as well done as Winslet, but still a very good job.<br/><br/>Jack Black has a smaller part then the other 3, but is successful in his attempt at a calmer role. While still goofy and funny, it's a different style then his usual role. However, he demonstrates what I saw in Shallow Hal. That when needed, Jack Black can pull off the cute romantic part of a character. Presenting the audience with an average looking guy, with a great personality and charm. Definitely a fun, light turn by Jack Black.<br/><br/>Lastly, Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott is the ""show stealer"". To understand how great of a job he does, you need to see the movie. He brings a subtle brilliance to his performance, making each scene he is in very touching and a treat to watch.<br/><br/>A special mention of the two girls playing Jude Law's daughters. Their performances epitomize the word ""cute"" and are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>These characters come together to form excellent chemistry, making for a very enjoyable movie. I'll be watching this again come Christmas time for sure."
"HotToastyRag","10","6","7","11 December 2017"," Delightful romantic masterpiece
","Writer-director Nancy Myers has created a modern masterpiece in the delightful romance The Holiday. Not only are there extremely likable characters, a storyline that belongs in a fairytale book, fun and fitting music, great performances, and relationships that make us believe in love again, but it takes place at Christmastime! Everything's better at Christmas—how many terrible movies have we all sat through just because they take place in December?—and you can now add a modern classic to your box of black-and-white films you watch every holiday season.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet opens the film with a poignant narration about the different types of love, and a montage overlay introduces us to all the characters in the film. Then we see Kate at her office Christmas party, pining away for her former lover, Rufus Sewell. If there's a woman in the audience who doesn't swallow a lump in her throat inspired by their rapport together, that woman should turn off the film and only resume it after she's had her heart broken. The dialogue is so realistic it's painful, and Kate's expressions are absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>Next, we meet Cameron Diaz, who's having a terrible fight with her boyfriend, Edward Burns. It's a wonderful introduction to her character as well, because even though she appears to be tough and not as sensitive as Kate Winslet, we see subtleties that indicate she has deep feelings in her she's been repressing for a long time.<br/><br/>Without describing every single scene—which I could absolutely do, since I've seen this movie close to a hundred times—I'll get to the main plot. Kate and Cameron swap houses for the Christmas holiday, taking spontaneous vacations from their lives and getting a second chance when they need it the most. Kate is awed by Los Angeles and the sunshine, and she meets new friends Eli Wallach and Jack Black, both in the film industry. Cameron is a little frustrated by the snow and English countryside, but when Jude Law turns up on her doorstep—literally—she remembers what vacations are for.<br/><br/>One remarkable thing about this movie is it manages to take three actors, whom I normally dislike so much so that I try to avoid their movies, and completely change my mind about them. With the exception of the film Carnage, which I hadn't seen until years later, I've usually found Kate Winslet's acting style irritating. At the time of its release, The Holiday was the best acting she'd ever done. She's the heart of the movie, and through her moving performance, women everywhere will believe they'll survive after their heart's been broken. I'm the first to admit that my animosity towards Cameron Diaz had everything to do with her similarity to a rival in high school, but when I watched The Holiday, I completely forgot about the teenager who tried to steal my sweetheart. Cameron shows off her acting chops in this film, and as her character grows, she helps the audience vicariously grow. Jude Law, while normally drawn to upsetting roles, plays a character who should have been named ""Every Woman's Fantasy."" Everything you ever wanted in a man, but deep down know you'll never get, is represented by Jude in this film. If you don't develop a massive crush on him, you must have very bad taste. Plus, he's very believable when he speaks his unbelievable lines, which is a testament to his acting.<br/><br/>I've always liked Jack Black, so while The Holiday didn't change my mind about him, it did show me another side to his acting. He's extremely convincing as an L.A. Hollywood type, and the mixture of his confidence and uncertainty adds another layer to his character. Eli Wallach, at ninety years old, still has a wonderful screen presence. His scenes are some of the most touching, and the film wouldn't be the same without him.<br/><br/>The dual-settings of the film provide an ideal Christmas for everyone in the audience, so whether you like the sun or the snow, you'll be happy. Hans Zimmer's music, to quote Jack Black in the film, is ""very unexpected"", and it adds to the delight of the film, making it clear that someone should snatch up the rights and turn this into a Broadway musical! I absolutely love every part of this movie. It's funny, charming, sad, realistic, inspiring, heartwarming, and irresistible. It's simply wonderful, no matter what time of year you watch it.<br/><br/>DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, there's one tiny part of the movie in which the camera spins in a circle. After Jack Black and Kate Winslet sing ""Arthur is a doodle-y-doo"" on the piano, look away for about ten seconds. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

","In London, Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) write a wedding column in a newspaper and has an unrequited love for her colleague Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell). Nearby Christmas, she is informed that Jasper is engaged and will marry another colleague, and her life turns head over heels. In Los Angeles, the movie-trailers maker Amanda Woods (Cameron Dias) has just broken with her unfaithful boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and wants to forget him. Amanda access a house exchange website, and impulsively swaps her mansion for Iris' cottage in Surrey for the holiday along the next two weeks. While in Surrey, Amanda meets Iris' widow brother and book editor Graham (Jude Law) and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile Iris meet her next door neighbor, the ninety year old screenplay writer Arthur (Eli Wallach), who helps her to retrieve her self-esteem, and the film composer Miles (Jack Black), and they fall in love for each other.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" is a charming and delightful homage to love, and also to the romantic movies of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Nancy Meyers is great in the romantic comedy genre, and this movie is not an exception. Kate Winslet and Cameron Dias are extremely charming and gorgeous in their roles, as well as Jude Law, but the excellent comedian Jack Black is miscast as romantic pair of Kate Winslet. In the end, this predictable film is a great entertainment. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Amor Não Tira Férias"" (""The Love Does Not Take Vacation"")"

Women and chick flick fans, arise and unite! Let's mount noisy protests outside movies like this. Let's demand that Hollywood hire people who can write.<br/><br/>""The Holiday""'s cast is top notch, except for the terminally mediocre Jack Black, whose entire film career is some sort of cosmic joke.<br/><br/>The very best thing about ""The Holiday"" is Eli Wallach's relatively large part as a great writer from Hollywood's Golden Era. Wallach is especially strong; being ninety years old does not diminish his charisma one whit.<br/><br/>It's ironic that a movie with such a disaster of a script features a character playing a classic Hollywood writer, who makes repeated reference to well-written chick flicks from yesteryear.<br/><br/>Jude Law is very winning here. He juggles his external beauty and inner complexity marvelously.<br/><br/>Miffy Englefield and Emma Pritchard are adorable as moppet sisters too cute to live.<br/><br/>Oh, but the script. It's drek. It's an insult. It's a random jumble of utterly bogus settings and complications that some cold heart in marketing stitched together, convinced that this would rake in some dough. You've got Christmas trees, poignant reunions, and tears that appear on cue.<br/><br/>You know, I saw ""Apocalypto"" this weekend as well, and, of the two, ""Apocalypto"" was the feel good movie, and ""The Holiday"" filled me with rage. One had some integrity; the other was an empty exercise in marketing.<br/><br/>How stupid do the folks who made this movie think women are? The answer is very grim.<br/><br/>Save your bucks; stay home, and watch one of the classic chick flick films this movie keeps talking about."

","When I first saw the cover of this movie I thought to myself, why oh why must we see another romantic movie? But, when I saw the actors, I couldn't help but think, ""This is going to be interesting."" And it was! Very! <br/><br/>This movie shows a new side to some actors, especially Jack Black. This movie shows the range that he can act in. I was not impressed, I was stunned. Jude Law also gives a wonderful, emotional, acting that shows he is one of the best male actors to date. <br/><br/>For Cameron Diaz, this movie didn't really take much. For the acting in this movie is similar to some of the older films she has done, her character does not change much, at least not until the end of the film. As for Kate Winslet, this is probably the first time I have seen her play who she really is. A British girl. I liked the change and I liked seeing her like this. <br/><br/>To anyone who wants to watch a comedy, with good acting, I highly recommend this one. I will also point out that the movie was specifically written for these 4 actors. This is a movie about finding love in the strangest, yet not unbelievable circumstances."
"rjaymolina","10","7","9","3 April 2010"," This Is Coming From A Guy Who Hates the Hollywood System
","Hollywood is known for constantly dishing out the formulaic romantic comedy, at least nowadays. There was a time when these movies were good but they've since faded into obscurity. Fortunately I was surprised by this film which has been hailed as a ""romantic comedy."" This is where the film becomes hated by most of the male demographic. The Holiday plays out like an ""indie dramedy"" right up until the last two minutes of the film, which plays very much like your standard romantic comedy.Luckily the rest of the film makes up for that. I won't go into the details of the plot, you can read the synopsis on the IMDb page. But it's definitely one of those films where you read the plot outline and think, ""It's almost too simple to be this long of a movie,"" and yet the movie is filled with so much that one can relate to. Jude Law's character was certainly a surprise, an honest and likable one at that. Cameron Diaz was actually really genuine as a cynic of love. Kate Winslet was a breathe of fresh air as a heartbroken soul trying to escape from her threesome of a relationship. And Jack Black, as short as his role was, was very likable as a romantic who is blinded by love. His Blockbuster scene definitely put a smile across my face, mainly because of the unexpected cameo.... To conclude, this film is barely your run of the mill romantic comedy from Hollywood; despite the ending and poor advertising that didn't do the film any justice. There is also a lot of politics regarding the film industry. If you are a film buff, you'll certainly appreciate one of the messages that this film is carrying. I'm more into independent films, but I figured on giving this movie a try and it was definitely worth the two hours. Take a holiday and enjoy this honest film about love and it's heartbreaks. 8/10"

","When I saw that this film clocked in at over 2 hours I thought I'd be asleep within an hour, but there was enough going on to keep me awake. Although this is strictly a piece of date-flick fluff it has its enjoyable moments. Jude Law and Kate Winslet are good and Cameron Diaz is, well, cute. Jack Black is the only actor who seems miscast and his ""Well, hello"" line that seems to pop up in almost every film is wearing thin. Don't expect any depth in this movie. Just take your girlfriend, hold hands and have a pleasant time. I did enjoy Eli Wallach as a octogenarian screenwriter although seeing him I was constantly reminded of his role as Calvera the bandit leader in ""The Magnificent Seven."" There are some unbearably cutesy moments with Jude Law's ""sugar and spice and all things nice"" daughters (ugh). But the film provides enough light-hearted and heart-warming moments to last for the rest of the year."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","12","18","8 December 2006"," A very sweet and charming film, I loved it!
","My girlfriend and I just saw The Holiday this afternoon on it's opening day and I have to say that honestly, I really did like The Holiday. It was a nice breath of fresh air for an all together feel good movie for the season. I think because in one way or another we can relate to the characters and their love lives, because they each had different situations. Like Cameron couldn't commit, Jude had a hard time opening up to his real life, Kate couldn't get out of love with someone who wasn't treating her right, and Jack was falling in love with the wrong women. This movie was a very special treat for the holidays.<br/><br/>Iris and Amanda are two women who have just been horribly bashed around in relationships and need to get away for a while. Iris lives in Surrey, England, and Amanda lives in L.A. in the states, they look each other up on the internet for a house exchange to get away from their problems for a while and agree to do the arrangement. When both ladies arrive, they are excited and anxious about their new lifestyles and countries, they also both meet each other's brothers and while Grahm, Iris's brother, and Amanda hit it off immediately, it takes Jack's character and Iris a while to realize that it's time to move on from their unhealthy relationships, of course, it's difficult since they live on separate sides of the world from each other.<br/><br/>The Holiday may be a bit hokey and cheesy to watch, but for a girl's afternoon, I think this was a great film that was honest and anyone could use for those broken hearts. I would highly recommend The Holiday, it did actually have good acting, a wonderful story, and lovable characters that weren't too over bearing or annoying. Please, don't listen to the critics on this one, it was a very touching and lovely story and I hope it is an honest success at the box office this weekend.<br/><br/>9/10"

","OK<br/><br/>Previous comments on this film have already said it as well as I can but I really want to save people from wasting time and money and try to persuade them to see something else instead. If you're convinced of this already but you're being dragged along by your girlfriend, stop her, because she'll dislike this movie too.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't even live up to its genre. There is no romance in it - any sexual frisson having been replaced by awkward moments badly acted, and there is no comedy in it - just cringey moments delivered by (you guessed it) more bad acting. I could go on about the script being predictable and tired. Indeed most failed movies go back as far as script or storyline calibre; but not as far as the initial premise which, in this case is okay if not a little familiar to Hollywood punters.<br/><br/>However the main thing you'll find is you don't care for the plight of the characters because they're badly drawn, do unrealistic things and we see neither enough of their back-story or their relationships developing with each other.<br/><br/>I'm a real fan of the cast; top actors such as Law and Winslet, a great comedian in Black and, when well cast, a huge talent in Diaz. I really felt for the actors combined career low-point and hope they will recover. <br/><br/>The movie business seems to be driven by money rather than story-telling and in this the movie will no doubt succeed. But there are many examples of strong RomCom scripts so I don't think we should excuse the producers. Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant is practically a seal of approval and then there's Bridget Jones, Forget Paris, If Lucy Fell to name a few.<br/><br/>I was laughing in the wrong places, cringing at the (assumed) intended jokes, planning my week in my head during most of it and feeling utterly tortured and cheated out of 2 hours of my life afterwards.<br/><br/>Sincerely hoping Meyers doesn't write any more screenplays.

"isabelle1955","Null","32","58","25 May 2007"," Is Physical Assault Really Funny??
","I watched this movie on a 14 hour plane ride from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and believe me, I can't imagine any other circumstances in which I would have sat through the entire thing immobile. I'm not a great fan of Romantic Comedies, which I find are rarely very romantic and even less frequently funny. Possibly I'm just too old and cynical. But there wasn't much choice as a combination of boredom and a very efficient Cathay Pacific stewardess, had tied me to my (coach class) seat. And I started about a third of the way into the movie, which I realized later was definitely the best place to start.<br/><br/>This is a movie about two young women Amanda (Cameron Diaz  not one of my favourite actresses) and Iris (Kate Winslett  I adore Kate Winslett so I'm almost prepared to forgive her this dire interlude), who swap houses on a whim one Christmas, to escape their various romantic entanglements. Of course they meet new men and fall in love, as one always does when swapping houses, in this case with Jude Law and Jack Black. And I can't even recall the name of their characters (Graeme and Thingy? Ben and Jerry?) Amanda, who owns her own film promotion company and is a skinny over achiever (portrayed as a bitch of course, because she is successful), trots off (first class) to the English countryside where she wrestles with every British cliché in the book, such as driving on the left and stumbling across snowy meadows to reach the quaint, idyllic but chilly Rose Hill Cottage. Iris, an under achieving journalist, wronged in love by a classic British cad, legs it (economy) to LA, where she finds herself living next to a curmudgeonly old screen writer who turns out to have a heart of gold  no surprises there then. I came in where Iris arrives in LA and Amanda arrives in the UK.<br/><br/>Amanda falls for Iris' brother (Jude Law), widowed tragically and left with two sweet children. We never find out how he was widowed so young but I spent most of the movie hoping that it would turn out he had murdered his wife, and wishing he would do the same to Diaz. This would have cheered me up enormously, but I guess Cathay Pacific wouldn't have shown it on a long haul flight? (This script has definite possibilities as a horror movie. Isolated cottage, stranger knocking at the door at night, etc. In Surrey, no one can hear you scream.) I have rarely seen a worse matched pair than Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. She is all sharp angles and a whiplash tongue, playing the crazy LA stereotype and he is wildly miscast as stoical Graeme (or Thingy?) Diaz here reminded me of a piece of barbed wire. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Iris is getting up close and friendly with Jack Black's character in LA, who has himself been wronged by some actress or other. I actually found Winslett and Black a much more convincing couple than Diaz and Law, although it looked briefly like she might get shacked up with the curmudgeonly old screen writer. Jack Black is actually very good here, playing it very straight, and his character won my sympathy even if I can't recall his name. I found myself warming to them both by the (very predictable) end. I could see why she found him appealing. <br/><br/>Then, as the film looped back to the start, I saw the first third. Oh dear. Truly awful. <br/><br/>Diaz' character, Amanda, is just appalling. Can she seriously enjoy playing this kind of stuff? Or does it fill the time between surfing? Does anyone really find this offensive portrayal of modern, successful, young women entertaining? Is it me or is this just so unfunny? <br/><br/>At one point, Amanda actually physically assaults her ex lover, with two right hooks to the chin which knock him flat. This is presented as amusing entertainment. Just imagine if you can the reverse; a couple splitting up, so he decides to go out on a high note by punching his ex girlfriend to the ground. Would we still be expected to laugh? We have spent years trying to convince the world that men assaulting women is wrong, and here we have a woman assaulting a man presented as light entertainment. Is that really OK with everyone?<br/><br/>Yes I know this is just a popcorn movie, and I'm not the target audience  far too old and boring. But it matters, it's insidious. I don't want my teenagers watching this trash. And the worse part? It was written and directed by a woman. She should be ashamed of herself."

","Seriously, it was like someone had spilled Fondue over everything it was that cheesy. It was also completely predictable and formulaic. Winslet and Diaz overacted (and badly so) throughout the whole movie.I was actually cringing when Cameron's character tells Jude that her family was so close they used to call themselves ""The three Musketeers""! In fact, I was actively cringing for most of the film. I thought Kate Winslet's character was excessively stupid for being in love for three years with a cardboard man that used her when he needed to and then ran back to his fiancée. And to get over him she decides all she needs is two weeks in LA? And he still doesn't leave her alone then, but she never outrightly tell him to F*** Off, which really really got my goat because if she had the film might, just might, have been worth the 9.20 I paid to waste 2 hours of my life on this dire atrocity. The only thing I liked about the film was Jack Black but he was woefully underused. It was also as if the director told him "" OK we're going for completely formulaic here, NO IMPROVISING, no off-the-cuff funny stuff, nothing, just work from the script"". And they probably cut any bits out that he did do on the spur of the moment. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want to numb your brain and do have a few hours and a bit of money to waste, by all means go and see this."

","Three of us went to see this movie -- me, who is open to an occasional chick-flick, my boyfriend who was accommodating enough to be open to seeing it, and his mother, who only watches chick flicks. None of us thought anything good of this movie. After the first scene I found myself regretting choosing this movie. Before half the movie was over I found myself busy talking to my boyfriend about all the ridiculously bad acting and terrible script-writing that was going on. The Cameron Diaz story seemed to be the main focus of the film (even though it was the worse of the two stories). Every scene between Diaz and Law was awkward and contrived. Law falls in love with Diaz after having sex with her on the first meeting. My boyfriend told me he would think she was a whore, not fall for her. I agree. Someone said there was GREAT characterization in this film, which is an opinion I, personally, do not hold. Jude Law's character starts out as a man who sleeps with a different woman every night, then with little to no transition becomes a loving father falling for Diaz (a materialistic career woman with no maternal instincts and no desirable traits as a long-term partner), and finally ends as a pussy boy sobbing to himself when Diaz leaves. Diaz's character was anything but a character. The Winslett story was slightly better but not much. She interacts with Jack Black (usually hilarious but in this movie it seemed like the producers must have killed his dog or something because there was nothing funny about him) and their story also involves some old man who miraculously is able to walk without his walker within a week (and I'm not sure about what the point of having this old man in the movie is at all besides to insert a Jewish celebration of Hannukah). I don't have time to go into more detail but I can tell you this: if you like your movies to have a single bit of wit, make any sense, resemble anything like a story that could actually happen, and are not retarded, you will not enjoy this movie."

Thanks to IMDb I now know why: there are clearly enough utterly and completely stupid people in the world to make it some money. But: shame on all of you IMDb users who have boosted The Holiday right here: shame on you for being lame brained, feckless and dim. This movie is less intelligent than a Lassie movie, and I tell you this: far less entertaining.<br/><br/>The word 'money' has also been revolving around my brain, as in this sentence: 'Why did these stars do it? They don't need the money, surely?' What in the name of all that is an actress with the talent of Kate Winslet (who I last saw in Extras, for goodness sake)doing in this dog-muck? And Jude Law also? Their careers deserve a couple of years of freefall after this. And Jack Black? The magnificent tyro of School of Rock? Your cred is in the shredder, baby (Mind you, he did, come to think of it, at times look embarrassed, so perhaps there is hope for him after all). Did someone threaten to kill their parents or children if they didn't do it? It must be that or something like that: there is no other rational explanation.<br/><br/>I was in physical pain whilst watching it in Chesterfield last evening. If the extraordinary cynicism of its religious adherence to every immoral and unethical strand of formula-Hollywood drek in here isn't bad enough: if the fact that the script that could have been written by a 12 year old dewy-eyed girl weaned and educated on every piece of schlock Disney every produced, or some kind of parodist with nothing better to do, but was apparently written by an adult isn't bad enough; if the torrent of clichés isn't bad enough - including the intensely vomit-inducing, utterly laughable inclusion of olde-tyme Golden Age of Hollywood writer winning a lifetime achievement award scene - AND CAN I TELL ANY American READING THIS THAT IT HASN'T SNOWED IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY BEFORE AND AROUND Christmas FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS?; if the complete lack of verisimilitude to real life, like the fact that women of thirty-odd don't make love in bra-tops, isn't bad enough; if the fact that Jude Law's character begins as a woman-a-night beer-slugging rogue then by half way becomes a winsomely sincere widowed single Dad who adores his two girls (and one is called 'Miffy' in real life: for God's sake, what next?!)isn't bad enough; if the fact that Cameron Diaz's 'performance' was the most embarrassing I've ever seen isn't bad enough; if the woolly mammoth-esquire touch of the miserable, shoddy direction isn't bad enough; if the fact that the studio thinks this pathetic nonsense is so good they let it stretch on for over two hours isn't bad enough, then the fact that these film-makers actually gave this evil monster of a movie pretensions to intelligence and relationship-profundity most certainly is.<br/><br/>I was going to say that The Holiday is an insult to anyone who ever went to school and earned a single GCSE pass or a 25-metre swimming certificate, until I logged on here and found that people presumably over the age of 12 actually liked it. Tell me again: you actually liked this film? <br/><br/>And to pass off Cary Grant as coming from Surrey - ""I know!"" pipes Kate, ecstatically when the old geezer tells her this - is mind-numbing is what is tells us about the attitude of studio producers (and for good measure, this director and screenplay writer)to all of us: factual accuracy in movies: ""Forget it, it doesn't matter, because you numbskulls, chuckleheads, mimbos and bimbos chewing popcorn and sucking down Coke won't notice and don't matter."" For the record, just in case no-one else has mentioned it in this review section - and do forgive me for not reading every single one because to me, suicide is immoral - Cary Grant was brought up (or 'raised' for you USA'ers) in Bristol, which is a port in Gloucestershire, which is in the west of England and therefore, nowhere near bloody Surrey.<br/><br/>So The Holiday takes its place in my pantheon of the absolute and utter crap where it joins Orlando, The Piano and Cronenberg's Crash. It makes for a very strange bedfellow. I suppose this proves that if there's one thing worse than a supposedly intelligent art-house movie that stinks the place out from sheer badness and pretentiousness, it's a movie which by all that is sacred should be presented as being as dumb as it looks and which doesn't so much insult the intelligence and good nature of the audience as trample up and down on it with hobnail boots with sharp nails sticking out of the sole, pointy end down. <br/><br/>I came home, switched on the TV and watched an hour of House. All, thankfully, is not lost. Yet.<br/><br/>PS Since more and more people have logged on to the website to sing the praises - supposedly - of this film, I have become completely convinced that all of them, especially the one's saying, 'Phew, thank Heaven for romance', are kidding. No one intelligent enough to press the 'On' button on a computer can possibly like this movie: it is, simply, the worst movie ever made."

","THE HOLIDAY, in my opinion, is one of the most romantic, funny, and touching holiday season films of all time. When Iris (Kate Winslet) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz) met and started seeing Miles (Jack Black) and Graham (Jude Law), I was really touched. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. If you ask me, everyone looked nice in the dressy clothing they wore. At the beginning of the film, when Iris got dumped by Jasper (Rufus Sewell), I felt a lot of sympathy for her. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the direction was excellent, the performances were terrific, and the production design was lavish. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of any of the stars of this romantic, funny, and touching holiday season films of all time, I highly recommend it."

But... I found 'The Holiday' somewhat of a disappointment. Although it has some good lines (particularly Kate Winslet's ones), beautiful sets and - to me - astonishing(!!) similarities (from Iris' profession to the interior of her house up to the exact disastrously manipulative, lying and cheating ex-lover - like I have been secretly visited by some fly on the wall with a hidden camera) the corniness of the structure and annoying too-over-the-top acting of totally miscast Cameron Diaz drove me up the wall. Darn, what a pity... could have been such a cute film. And Nancy Meyers did so well with 'Something's Gotta Give'. Now why did she go só wrong here?... A shame.

Despite all the evidence before their eyes, they refuse to just accept the probable and search for a microbe of inconsistency upon which to proffer the improbable.<br/><br/>Is this movie predictable? Of course it is. Is this movie a little contrived? You bet. Are some performances stronger than others? As always, yes. Does it represent English/U.S. reality? Not a chance. Would Kate Winslett ever consider getting it on with Jack Black? I seriously doubt it. Is Cameron Diaz's smile widely annoying? Oh yes. Is this movie a classy piece of seasonal escapism that makes you want to hug the nearest bad guy? Yes it is.<br/><br/>Despite the many minor flaws (if that is the right word) this movie achieves what it set out to do, which is to provide a thick slice of non-challenging, non-threatening Christmas feel-good fare.

"CalDexter","1","23","46","12 December 2006"," A sentimental sickening load of rubbish.
","I took a date to see this film and halfway through it she turned to me and said 'This is torture for you, is it not?' I replied 'Yes, especially Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet trying too hard to be funny and only making me more depressed.' There's a nauseating bit where Diaz's Amanda puts on The Killers' Hot Fuse album and dances her head off to the great band's Mr Brightside while slugging from a bottle of beer. Believe me, the cinema was full and no one was laughing.<br/><br/>Oh Yes! The plot. Cameron Diaz (five miles OTT) is Amanda, an American cinema trailer editor with her own business. After dumping her man (Ed Burns) because he slept with his secretary she desires to get away from Los Angeles to a place where there are no males. After chatting on the computer with Iris (Kate Winslet) they agree to swap places for a few weeks or so. After arriving in England, Amanda finds herself falling in love with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris at Amanda's place, bonds with an old screenwriter veteran (the magnificent Eli Wallach) and slowly, SLOWLY falls for film composer and Amanda's work colleague Miles (Jack Black, on autopilot).<br/><br/>This is one of those films that tries too hard to make you feel good and warm inside, like the Al Pacino film Frankie and Johnny. Anyone who is a bad egg gets their just deserts and anyone who is a good person triumphs in the end up. Not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>However, Cameron Diaz is absolutely beautiful in every scene shes in. And the scene where Iris is telling Miles about her unrequited love for Jasper (Rufus Sewell) while he listens had me in tears of laughter when it reminded me of the scene in Airplane! when Ted Striker is boring the old woman passenger to death about his love for Elaine.<br/><br/>If there are any witty scenes in this dross, its when Miles and Iris are in a DVD rental store and Dustin Hoffman has a five second cameo, when you see it you'll smirk. The rest is utter garbage."
"madkira","3","19","37","16 December 2006"," Disappointing and Bland
","The Holiday is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy, with very little romance and even less comedy.<br/><br/>The main plot of the movie revolves around Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz's characters switching homes for the holiday, allowing each to meet their obvious love interests. The predictable plot would be far less painful if the actresses were given something to work with in the script. Sadly, the dialog is clunky and without wit, and while Winslett struggles to rise above the material, Diaz flounders. By the middle of the movie, her scenes are painful to watch, and one can only hope that the scene switches back to Winslet's character, whose scenes with the elderly screenwriter are genuine and sweet.<br/><br/>The men exist only as romantic foils, and Jude Law plays this part well, managing to exude some charm and playing believably off of Diaz, despite their lack of chemistry. Jack Black, on the other hand, probably shouldn't have even bothered with this movie at all. His comedic lines are generally unfunny, and as a romantic partner, he is given essentially nothing to do. If you were hoping to see Jack Black branch out as a romantic lead, don't bother with The Holiday.<br/><br/>In the end, The Holiday doesn't earn the title of romantic comedy, and ends up being another piece of cliché chick flick fluff. Lovers of the genre would be better off renting Love Actually, French Kiss, or His Girl Friday for their holiday entertainment."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","7","20 January 2009"," Charming Holiday Romances
","Sweet syrup is expected from romantic comedies but what makes them tick and likable, even if they are predictable is the charm factor. 'The Holiday' is a charming romantic comedy. It pretty much has all the ingredients of romantic comedies and I loved how Myers has used numerous references to old classics. The locations are marvelous. Amanda's luxurious condo contrasts well with Iris's cozy cottage but they both give exude a feeling of comfort and home. The soundtrack is a plus and cinematography is brilliant.<br/><br/>'The Holiday' tells two simultaneous stories (which are interlinked of course) but I liked Iris's holiday story more than that of Amanda. Thankfully, the director does not overtly focus on contrasting the two and the dialogues are a nice inclusion. Most of the comedy is not overdone either as its genuinely funny.<br/><br/>The Amanda and Graham love story is more or less the typical holiday romance one has witnessed earlier but it is still a fun watch mainly due to the two leads. Both Cameron Diaz and Jude Law share wonderful chemistry. The genre is not anything new to Diaz and she definitely has become quite skillful at it. In the beginning of the movie, she reminded me a little of Meg Ryan. Law holds his own proving that he is competent in this genre. Edward Burns has a small but hilarious scene which reminds one of the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene except this one is the reverse of that.<br/><br/>Iris's holiday has the added charm of the endearing Kate Winslet - Eli Wallach track which was such a delight to watch. This story is more about Iris's growth into an independent self-sufficient woman. Winslet's chemistry with both Black and Wallach is beautifully displayed and the actress demonstrates a flair for comedy. Black too downplays his comedy making Miles different from the usual goofy characters he is normally associated with. Eli Wallach is simply superb.<br/><br/>'The Holiday' is quite a warm and fluffy piece of entertainment and a good enough holiday movie that will entertain. One should not expect anything other than a rom-com but this one has an extra appeal of a stellar cast and a splendid subplot."

","When i see the names Jude Law, Jack Black, Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz in the cast, i'm likely going to see the film. Nancy Meyers is a writer first, and i enjoyed Baby Boom, so i went hoping for the best. Although there were no surprises in this boy)s) meets girl(s)film, it was a charming piece brightened by the performances by all four principals. i especially enjoyed Kate Winslet, who woke up air-rocking to the music in the morning, and Jack Black playing that theme-song game in the video store which i have done myself many times for a lark. Jude Law was a great love interest, this time not an AI love droid, nor an assassin, sniper, sky captain, paraplegic, rich playboy, cad...he has a surprise about his life sure, but a normal one, and a sweet one to boot. Oh, and the wonderful Eli Wallach; he was simply a joy to see in this film. Nobody ran away from love, at least not true love. The characters were running from relationships which weren't reciprocated nor appreciated, only to run in to the love of their lives while on the run. Not particularly inventive, but charming and satisfying all the same. Is it a date movie? yes. Is it a deep film with deep meaning? nope. Is it a pop-corny movie? yup. nothing wrong with that. A very charming, sweet-natured film."

","I saw this movie with my boyfriend, and we both walked out of the theater thinking (in his words), ""That's easily one of the best movies I've ever seen."" His one complaint was that the women in the theater (about 95% of the audience) all sounded incredibly close to orgasm every time Jude Law appeared on screen. The plot, or rather, the way the plot unfolds, reminds me of Love Actually. (The Holiday wasn't quite as complicated since there were really only five important characters.) I laughed, sighed, and cried, and plan to see it again with my girl friends soon. I'll also be buying it the minute the DVD is released. It's definitely something I'd recommend as a date movie or as a movie to see with a group of friends."

","I'm not sure where to start. Have you ever spent $10 to suffer in your seat for two hours and twenty minutes while watching some of your favorite actors lose years of credibility acting in a film with a story that is written for people that have an IQ of 80 or below? That's what happened to me. The film is touted as a ""romantic comedy"". This was neither. There is nothing romantic about two single women with successful careers being portrayed as pathetic if they don't have ""Mr. Right"" in their lives. Additionally, no one was funny. Miles, played by Jack Black, who I think is brilliant, was not even close to funny. The painfully bad acting and spoon-fed dialogue between Cameron Diaz and Ed Burns in the first scene, two actors that I usually like and respect, set the tone for the movie which never changed. The premise of the story, the ridiculous time-lines, the painfully contrived dialogue, and unlikable characters, made this one of the worst films I have ever seen. This may be a good time for Nancy Meyers who wrote and directed this film to apologize for hurting the careers of some of Hollywood's most promising and established actors. This movie should have possibly been titled ""The Recycled Hollywood Crap Holiday Movie""."

Her scenes with Jack Black were good but it's her times with Eli Wallach (as the charming and oh-so-modest screen writer) that are most wonderful.<br/><br/>Law has a secret (actually three of them) that Diaz doesn't learn about right away. When she does find out, the story takes an interesting and sweet turn.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly entertained by this picture.

","Although this is indeed a chick flick, I hope men will enjoy the show. Unlike all other Nancy Myers films, this one is actually entertaining and sweet. I loved it, the audience had a great time, and there was applause at the end credits. It will be one of my favorite Christmas movies.<br/><br/>Favorite scenes: Hannukah party and Eli Wallach's performance throughout the entire film. The Santa Ana winds was also a nice touch, it makes me miss Christmases in San Diego (just for a moment).<br/><br/>It's odd, but the love stories are not what make this film so good to me. It was the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's characters. They brought each other back to life. I especially love how he told her not to be the supporting actress in life, but to be the starring role.<br/><br/>There's a romantic love of Old Hollywood in the movie that was magical in a way. It was nice to hear what Eli's character had to say about his past and to hear him and Iris discuss great women in film (Stanwyck and more).<br/><br/>Another good touch, which is seldom done in contemporary romantic comedies, is closure between Kate's character and the character Rufus Sewell plays in the film. There's no loud fight or over-the-top Bridget Jones action, it was a bittersweet moment, but filled with emotion and thought.<br/><br/>Jude Law played his part very well, as did Jack Black. Cameron Diaz was cute, but nothing spectacular there. Finally, the cameo from Dustin Hoffman was a hit with the audience.<br/><br/>This is one movie that I plan to see again in the theaters this Holiday season."

The Holiday is a very poor imitation of Bridget Jones, the only difference being that this time you have the American Bridget as well as the English Bridget. The scenery is nice, the script however is hopeless. None of the four stars were able to distract me from the standard of the script. It all felt very forced and so very predictable. It was a very disappointing experience as it had such a good cast who are all capable of so much better. I was not expecting an epic but this film failed to deliver on too many levels.

","Amanda, (Cameron Diaz) is a brash, neurotic and highly successful business woman, living the jet set lifestyle amongst the orange groves and palm trees of sunny L.A.<br/><br/>Iris, (Kate Winslet) is a belittled and insipid newspaper wedding correspondent existing in a permanent state of self pity in windswept and snow battered England.<br/><br/>Despite these contrasting lifestyles, these two very different women have something in common. They are both lonely, hurt, depressed and facing one of the most miserable Christmases either of them have ever experienced.<br/><br/>Could it be that Amanda and Iris each hold the answer to the others prayers? Of course they do!!! After meeting online it is agreed that they would swap lifestyles in a two week home exchange whereby both women can escape from their immediate misery and enjoy a well earned rest in new and novel surroundings.<br/><br/>The arrival scenes for each of our heroines is fun to watch as we see the English Iris amazed and excited by her new L.A. mansion and king size swimming pool, and the well off Amanda looking with equal disdain on her quaint Victorian cottage in the Surrey downs with no mod cons and its tiny bath tub.<br/><br/>Yet each adapt quickly to their new surroundings after all its only a means to an end, which is an opportunity to spend a Christmas without the worries and hassles of men complicating matters.<br/><br/>That is until Amanda is visited by Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) who just drops in unexpectedly on his way home from where we can only assume to have been the English charm school, and Iris meets and befriends part-time film score composer and full time eye-brow flirt, Miles (Jack Black)<br/><br/>Okay this is a Rom-Com and therefore I need not go into too much detail of how things turn out for our intrepid foursome, yet the rest of the film is not just the run of the mill romance you might expect, there are other plots and sub-plots which give this movie greater scope and depth which also goes a long way in making the main characters more tangible.<br/><br/>One such plot involves Iris and an aged Oscar winning screen writer named Arthur played brilliantly by Eli Wallach, who now lonely, infirm and forgotten by almost everybody, finds a new friend and confidant in the compassionate and caring English tourist. Indeed at times it is this relationship that pulls at the moviegoers heartstrings more than any of the others.<br/><br/>The Diaz/Law thing was fun to watch too in what is essentially a mutual love at first sight relationship, between two people who for different reasons refuse to acknowledge that it is anything more than a minor fling., Two people who are both determined to keep things uncomplicated despite the overwhelming feelings each have for the other.<br/><br/>I suppose my one criticism would be that so much screen time was given to the Diaz/Law relationship, and the Winslet/Wallach friendship, that when the Winslet/Black thing came about, it didn't really fit into place as believably as the others. I feel more screen time was needed to flesh this one out a little more. This is nothing against Jack Black who many have said was unsuitable in the role and unbelievable as a love interest. Rubbish in my opinion. He was great in the role and perfectly believable, its just the essential scenes that would have made made it work were just not here.<br/><br/>Despite this one criticism this movie is definitely one for the DVD shelf. A classic Rom Com and a classic feel good movie which for once sees everyone deliriously happy at the end which at this time of year especially, is always nice to see."

Kate Winslet does the best she can with the poor script while Jude Law is the same as always! The star of the film by a long way is Eli Wallach, who delivers a top notch performance.<br/><br/>There are too many scenes (particularly in the beginning) with just one character (Winslet or Diaz) in it. The actors narrate every single movement they make during these scenes which I found very irritating.<br/><br/>The plot is so clichéd its amusing. This is a combination of many other run of the mill Christmas films. The characters are very clichéd, particularly Jude Law. They cram more clichés into Jude Law than I thought possible.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'What Women Want' and expected an awful lot more from this.

","I have to say I am shocked that so many people online are posting that they liked this movie. Not only liked, but LOVED this movie. In the theater people were laughing at scenes that were not meant to be humorous, and I myself rolled my eyes so many times throughout it that my eye sockets got sore. I nearly walked out of the theater. I only stayed because someone else had paid for my ticket. Let me start with CAMERON DIAZ's character since she is the loudest distraction from the scanty elements that make this movie bearable. I think she squeaks, whines, moans, grunts, growls and bounces up and down more than she speaks. And no, I'm not referring to any sex she has in the movie. I almost wish I was, so she could have gotten it all out in a bedroom scene instead of tormenting us with her overacting and childish dramatics throughout the film. In the scenes where she actually does talk, her acting is so atrocious my efforts to ignore it were easily overpowered. Jude Law was fine, except that he got stuck with Diaz as his only real character to bounce off of, which left him flat. And his character was overdone and very very contrived. Kate Winslet was good, though she seemed ten times better than she really was in this because of the contrast of Cameron Diaz. Jack Black added some easy humor to it. He and Kate Winslet had some chemistry, surprisingly. It was clearly a very American film, despite half the cast being British, and being that half the story is supposed to be set in England it was, in my opinion, unrealistic and hard to believe. And yes, I have been to England. Another problem with the movie is it dragged terribly. It could have been an hour long. They took forever to advance the story line, and the scenes were bland. Over all I felt that I got half of a movie. The story between Winslet, Black and the old man was plenty. Perhaps a better-done version could toss in Jude Law as Winslet's character's charming brother or something. Get rid of that three-yea-old Cameron Diaz person. Nobody would accept Law as anything but a main character, but it would have been fine for me. Some have described it as a romantic comedy with a fairy-tale sensibility. I love movies with a fairy-tale feeling added to real life drama, but this movie was nothing more than baldly unrealistic. I'm just glad the money spent on my ticket wasn't out of my pocket."

","At first this seemed a light piece of fluff and, as it has some actors that have done well in other films, I hung on to the bitter end. THE SPOILER IS THAT THE END IS UTTERLY PREDICTABLE FROM THE FIRST SCENES' A SPOILER IS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE. Well, a predictable end is not bad per se; we all know how Hamlet ends but we will still watch a good production. Alas, Yorick, the director sank this cast into the most juvenile dialogue ever written; the editor mismatched the pace and timing throughout (it dragged on so!); and the love scenes were wooden and uninspired. The lovely cottage in Surrey looked like a movie set (if 'twas, 'twas done poorly; if 'twasn't, even worse). I can't imagine how the actors got trapped in this grade C date flick for the under 14 set; those agents responsible should be hanged. Of course it wasn't rated R; there was nothing adult about it whatsoever. The best scene: none comes to mind. The worst scene: the driver refuses to take the visitor to the lovely cottage because he can't turn his car around; throughout the rest of the movie Jude Law tottles about it in his Land Rover. Doesn't anybody check these scripts for logic? Obviously nobody checks for banality."
"Sweet_Ophelia","1","11","22","11 January 2007"," Embarrassment of the 'chick-flick' genre
","Amanda in L.A (Cameron Diaz) is an emotionally retarded workaholic who has just kicked her boyfriend (Edward Burns) out for cheating on her with his secretary. Iris (Kate Winslet) in Surrey, England is a writer for a London newspaper and has just been delivered the biggest blow at an office Christmas party when it is announced that the ex-boyfriend (Rufus Sewell) who she is still madly in love with, has become engaged to the woman with whom he cheated on Iris with three years ago. Both women find themselves at an utter loss. Iris mopes about her little cottage, near suicidal, while Amanda desperately wants to prove something to herself and her ex  namely that she can relax, cry, and be happily alone. Amanda's solution? A holiday. She finds a website where people swap houses for 2 weeks and decides that Surrey is the perfect place for a vacation, choosing to swap her L.A mansion for Iris's quaint 'Rosehill Cottage'. In Surrey Amanda meets Iris's handsome, drunkard older brother, Graham (Jude Law) and Iris meets the best friend of Amanda's ex, music composer Miles (Jack Black) and you can most definitely guess the rest.<br/><br/>This is an atrocious film. And what makes this film all the worse is the irony of a character called Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) who is Amanda's next door neighbor in L.A and fast becomes companion to Iris. What's funny is that Abbott plays a man who was a screen-writer during Tinsletwon's hey-day. Abbott prescribes fantastic classics for Iris to watch and appreciate and in one scene lets out a great long spiel about how awful today's cinema is; specifically that box-office and blockbusters hinder creativity. Was writer/director Nancy Meyers shooting herself in the foot or what!?<br/><br/>It's not just that 'The Holiday' is predictable to the point of boredom. Chick-flicks are usually predictable, but that doesn't mean they can't still be good. Take 'Bridget Jones's Diary', for example. Everyone knew that book was based on Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' and therefore that Bridget wins Mr. Darcy in the end but it's still a bloody good chick-flick, even though the ending, and in fact the entire plot is some 194 years old. The film's plot leaves a lot to be desired. For one, it's not particularly encouraging to women, which is surprising since it was written by a woman (the same woman who wrote 'Something's Gotta Give', no less)  the whole story hinders on this idea that even though Amanda and Iris are both successful working women, they are lacking because they don't have a man in their lives. Amanda's boyfriend cheats on her and instead of rejecting his claims that it was her, who deliberately sabotaged the relationship (forcing him to cheat?) she privately agrees with his claims and unintentionally sets out to try and be the sort of woman he wished she was. <br/><br/>No, 'The Holiday's' failure does not solely lie in its plot, a lot of the film's faults have to do with the cast. Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, both actresses who have proved in previous films that they do indeed have acting chops, both over-act. Diaz more than Winslet, but the over-acting is completely and utterly cringe-worthy. Honestly, watching Diaz jump around hysterically after punching her boyfriend in the face, I felt nauseous. And what really didn't help matters was the fact that these characters were specifically written by Nancy Meyers with Law, Diaz, Winslet and Black in mind. The result is a mixed caricature of each actor, compiled of previous film roles and media persona's. Cameron Diaz plays the breezy goof-ball slash every man's ideal woman; hints of her from 'There's something about Mary' and 'in her shoes' shine through. Iris seems more inspired by the real-life Winslet, as Iris is self-deprecating and entirely modest. Jude Law's Graham also seems to have been created with a great deal of influence from the actor's real life  as a womanizing drunkard in the beginning, but then becoming a sort of 'fantasy' of what his female fans wish the real Law was, a sexy wounded white knight with demons in his closet who just needs to be saved by a beautiful maiden. Jack Black of course plays the clown, though in this he seems to be going through the motions, and his 'comedy' is hollow for it. <br/><br/>This is a really, really awful film. I thought, in the last half hour or so, some tragedy would befall one of the pretty couples: perhaps one of the relationships would be abandoned, or the old man would die. Nope. I won't be spoiling anything for you when I say that there is a happy ending (well, theoretically speaking Lord knows I didn't come out of this film 'happy'). Perhaps the film could have been salvaged with entirely different casting, or if the story was a bit more balanced  though it is meant to be about both women, we mainly follow Diaz & Law, who had the most banal storyline of the two. <br/><br/>So, so bad  don't even bother hiring it on DVD when it comes out."

","I can't think of one redeeming feature in this piece of schlock. Except, maybe, that it gave me a chance to get about 30 minutes sleep in a near deserted theater on New Year's Eve day. Apparently we must have missed the word that The Holiday is a total waste. But we had absolutely nothing else to do that afternoon..so we ""snuck"" into the theater under the senior rate. Just a couple of questions I'd like to pose...<br/><br/>Does it really snow that much in suburban London? Did I miss a sex scene while I was napping? Does Cameron Diaz have a shape? Do all women wear bras during sex? Would any less than desperate woman, take back Jack Black after getting dumped in a restaurant for another woman? Is the over-acting, comic wannabe, Jack Black, miscast in this disaster movie? Would any sensible person let a total stranger stay alone in their multi-million dollar mansion without even meeting them first? Would you lend your home to someone, travel 6000 miles away and expect to find it in perfect shape when you return? AND..who can I write to to get my money back?

"kreamykonez97","4","13","28","1 January 2007"," The Holiday...AKA...The Cheesefest
","THE HOLIDAY 2006 (KATE WINSLET, CAMERON DIAZ, JUDE LAW, JACK BLACK) DIRECTED BY: NANCY MEYERS ~ THE RUNDOWN: Nancy Meyers asked Santa for something special, instead he left the moron a pre-packaged cheese fest chocked full of enough sentiment to fill a baseball field. ~ Okay, just as a warning to like the four people who are actually going to read this review, it's a bit complicated, because within it, I'm not only going to try and sort out the mess that is this sickeningly bad romantic comedy, but also define 'Chick Flick' along the way. ~ First off, I might as well state the obvious - this movie was unnecessarily long, including some random subplot about an old man that Meyers apparently threw in there just to be a bitch, or maybe to just give all the idiots in the theatre something extra to cry about towards the end. I really don't know. Secondly, this is listed on IMDb.com as a comedy, yet the most that came out of me was a muffled chuckle at the hands of Hoffman's cameo in Blockbuster. And this fact that I didn't laugh was not my fault; I know what's funny...this isn't. If you are a man who saw this and laughed more than twice you were A) High on a bad dose of Holiday Cheer B) Drunk off of Egg Nog and whiskey, or C) Held at gunpoint. Simple as that. Thirdly, DIE CAMERON DIAZ!!! My God, she's not even hot anymore! Her face has turned as disgusting as her acting, which, by looking at her resume, has gone nowhere...unlike the careers of Jude Law (filling in for Hugh Grant's day off) and Kate Winslet which immediately took dives on the day this came out. Jack Black, on the other hand, was good, and served as the only charming thing about this movie, making up for his mediocre looks and going with the whole ""I'm full of energy"" thing again. ~ Often, this movie somehow manages to waiver in and out of Chick Flick territory instead of just staying there the whole time. It is, afterall, well shot, and its messages about love are true and relate to just about everyone. Yet, by the end, it had taken too many trips to this Chick Flick Land and ended up getting trapped there. But, what exactly constitutes a 'chick flick'? Well, I've put much thought into the matter and I've concluded that it's simply a term used to describe movies that are stupid - movies plagued by implausible, clichéd scripts usually founded upon the stereotypical viewpoint of relationships. Chick Flicks seem to, most of the time, fall into the Romantic Comedy genre, but can go elsewhere and can really be about anything, as long as they're composed of stupidity and made for the purpose of cute but ridiculous entertainment. Now, I'm really not sexist at all, and I don't believe women are somehow naturally prone to like stupid movies, especially since both women and men seem to agree on the all-time greats like The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. So, although the name is a fallacy, it seems women have been conditioned to prefer these films...but that's for you to think about because this is a movie review and not a lecture. My point, I guess, is that The Holiday is indeed a chick flick, basically saying its a predictable, extremely clichéd, sickeningly sentimental excursion about love created to entertain people that simply haven't seen enough good movies. ~~ NEXT REVIEW: 'BLACK XMAS'"
"rkearney-1","2","10","21","10 December 2006"," Painfully contrived, far too long
","I knew what I was getting myself into when I accompanied some friends to this movie. I knew it was a ""chick flick"" but I didn't dislike it for this reason, I disliked it because it was a lesson in bad film making regardless of genre. The plot is so contrived that from the outset you just don't believe the characters are real. Horrible screen writing, chock full of expository speech, you don't have to draw your own conclusions about the characters because their only actions are explaining what they think about themselves and the other characters. Jack Black is laughable as a romantic lead, and I do mean laughable because its hard not to laugh at how bad he is. His romantic gaze comes off as downright creepy. Diaz, Law and Winslet try really hard but the dialog is so bad that they have very little to work with. I'll give credit where it's due, Law is the only one that rises above the horrible script to inject some life and charm in his character. You can see why Diaz likes him, but not the other way around. And the Winslet, Black romance is just strange. Oh and did I mention that its over 2 hours long? The final painful detail, is that there is a subplot about an old Hollywood screenwriter (played by Eli Wallach quite well) and this leads to all sorts of idealism about great storytelling that is quite ironic in this film. There are a bunch of ""awww"" moments and some funny moments that will make the film watchable for non-discerning film goers, but on the whole this is just a bad movie, and I wish I could have those two hours of my life back."
"ahawks","9","5","9","30 March 2007"," Charming and slightly under appreciated.
","This film gets it. There are no grand statements, no hidden agendas, just an enjoyable story about relatable people interacting. Not all movies have to move mountains.<br/><br/>Someone can identify to some degree with at least one of the characters. This alone could be what makes this movie good... but it doesn't rest on that.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie was written with this specific cast in mind makes it worth checking out. On the surface, their dynamic might seem contrived, but I think thats just the point. I think this movie is partially saying 'Throw out your misconceptions about Cameron Diaz, she is worthy of a partner of a different nature, like Jude Law.' and vice versa. As well as 'See beyond the superficial.', riffing with Jack Black can be fun. Even for an actress who has excelled in more of a dramatic sense.<br/><br/>Essentially, It is saying love is blind and hits you when you least expect it...<br/><br/>And come on, who can't use a dose of that every so often? So, take these four, a fantastic Eli Wallach and solid, decent, meaningful writing and you have an enjoyable 2 hours spent."

So we watched it. I can say that it was ""the right movie, at the right time at the right place"" that day was terrible cold and foggy outside and we have enjoyed ourselves much much more than we expected.

It isn't the funniest romantic comedy ever (there were not that many jokes) but it will leave you with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. I thought that Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet were well-cast and put in good performances. I thought that Jack Black was under-used in a comedic sense but it was nice to see him in a 'straight' role. For me though, the real star was Jude Law, who knew he could do romantic comedy? He was excellent! I've never really warmed to his acting before (maybe I was watching the wrong films) but he was so sweet and funny (in a heartbreaking way) in this film, that you couldn't help but fall in love with his character.<br/><br/>The locations are very film-like. The LA locations are very palatial and the England locations very quaint but it is a movie after all! Overall, it's a good film. Watch it, you might be surprised at how much you like it!"
"abeburnett","10","5","9","17 December 2006"," Leave the theater happier than when you entered
","I really liked The Holiday. Normally I wouldn't see it since it's rated only (right now) a 6.5/10 on IMDb, but a gal friend of mine highly recommended it. I took a chance on it, and was rewarded with a fun, satisfying evening for one. That is, I'm a single, 29 year old, straight male...who likes chick flicks--or pretty much any movie that's well made, genuine, and makes me feel better about life. Who needs dark and depressing movies to beat us over the head with what we already know: life sucks. Moving on. The Holiday struck me as really speaking to the nature of romance in the 21st century. But then, I'm a child of the era, so maybe it's just a limitation of my perspective, but I think that anymore our communication skills--as a society--have diminished to the point where romance gets more and more challenging. Rather than organically connecting with someone through light, harmless, small-talk, we interrogate them--if we're interested--and don't speak to most, at all, if we're not. We have email conversations, IM conversations, and telephone conversations, but fall on our face when confronted with actually genuinely connecting with others, face to face. This is unfortunate, and sometimes tremendously intimidating. Dates become job interviews, and people that may actually be a good match for each other dismiss each other because--in the course of the interview--they didn't see the spark of...whatever they're looking for.<br/><br/>I felt like The Holiday somehow managed to encapsulate the nature of modern dating, and the issues that make falling in love so challenging these days. I left the theater feeling like, just maybe, I wasn't completely romantically hopeless--even at 29 or beyond. Yes, the time it takes to find that love, and the loneliness and frustration that will be experienced in that time, may be arduous...but, ultimately, it is worth it. This movie connected with me, and left my life a little better, if only for a short time. And that, is priceless in its own way. See it!"

","Of the three Meyers films, ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""The Holiday,"" 'Holiday' is the least creative and fulfilling as a movie. If you like Cameron Diaz, it's great, but for people who don't find her particularly attractive or a good actress, it's tedious. She was cute, but not an interesting character and it was hard to have empathy for a rich, spoiled movie industry person who is so unhappy and silly. Jude Law was wasted in this film. He looks great but his character is shallow and there is too much talk throughout about how 'complicated' they and their lives are. Kate Winslet is wonderful in this film but is cast aside for Diaz and Law. Jack Black, although not a leading man, is given his first chance to be one and is quite acceptable. Ms. Meyers runs out of ideas when she steals a scene from her earlier and superior film, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" where Diaz does a less funny crying scene while trying to write, which Diane Keaton did so expertly. While I could sit through that film with its compelling characters again, I could not watch this one a second time. Choice of songs, as ever, adds to the drama, and the ending is taken straight from the great film, ""Holiday Inn."" I surmise this was the reason for its title, ""The Holiday."""

","Maybe I got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning because I ""went"" to bed with this awful movie in my head.<br/><br/>On the surface it's one of those sweet things that make people go awww, but it immediately evokes a feeling that you've overdosed on unrefined cane syrup.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz acting is pretty awful. In her first scene she is so unbelievable that you feel she must have just read the script and wondered why she said yes.<br/><br/>Ed Burns tries to turn in a nice job opposite her, but maybe it's because it's his only scene in the film and he knows he can leave and be home in time to watch Dancing with the Stars.<br/><br/>There's a Mexican gardener who gamely tries to mug a couple laughs from us while Ed & Cameron battle. I didn't.<br/><br/>Then the writer/director (Nancy Shyer) must've gotten bored with this because we then go to England where Kate Winslet is pining after Rufus Sewell at a Christmas party. She's warned to stop this, but she gets him in the office and gives him a gift anyway and then they call him out to tell everyone he's just gotten engaged.<br/><br/>Kate is really sad.<br/><br/>Her friend tells her she's pathetic, but I thought the friend really said the script was pathetic.<br/><br/>I guess Nancy got bored with this story, too, so she takes both stories and wonders what would happen if these two women change places. I was wondering who cares.<br/><br/>Through some awful expository writing (ACTUAL writing!) these women decide to switch houses for a week. Or two weeks, or three weeks. The time-line is never quite clear. It felt like three years. But they leave the very next day. How one arranges this without knowing the other person might be a terrorist--so trusting!<br/><br/>They travel halfway round the world to someone else's house and, of course, people are surprised cause I guess they forgot to tell ANYONE they were doing this. It being Christmas and all, you just up and leave and tell no one.<br/><br/>Cameron is surprised by Jude Law who was surprised he was in the movie at all, but decides to gamely make a go of it. Later we find out he has children and is a widower, excuse me, a w-i-d-o-w-e-r, I guess they'd get an R rating if he didn't spell it. But it does not seem to matter he has a really nice house and is a book editor in London, cause all he seems to do is drink at a pub 40 minutes out of London and sleep over at his sister's where Cameron is staying.<br/><br/>Cameron is angry at all the men of the world, but when Jude Law comes knocking I guess you'd forget about all that. I know I would. But she tries to leave. The director must've reminded her she's under contract, cause even though she tries to leave a few more times they keep dragging her back.<br/><br/>Kate has the unfortunate experience of running into Jack Black, who tries to be un-annoying by being sweet and funny and composing music. He isn't. <br/><br/>Kate also decides to take Eli Wallach under her arm, even though she seems not to care at all what his name is. Eli apparently liked playing the old writer character he played on Studio 60, so he plays it again in this film. <br/><br/>Even though the place Kate is staying in has a library full of DVD's, this guy makes her go to a video store, so Jack can improvise a sketch and Dustin Hoffman can make a cameo appearance. <br/><br/>Eli keeps bemoaning the state of Hollywood these days and I was, too, watching this dreck. But that doesn't stop the Writer's Guild wanting to fête him at a ceremony in the Pasadena Playhouse--I guess the Writer's Guild Theatre didn't even want anything to do with this script.<br/><br/>Apparently Kate had time to decorate her house for the holidays before she took off, but Cameron didn't even put up one piece of tinsel, so when Jack Black suddenly exclaims it's Christmas Eve and they should make Christmas Fettucine to eat, while he composes music that was already written by John Williams, it's kind of jarring.<br/><br/>Apparently the very next day they have Christmas dinner in an overcrowded sushi restaurant, with Jews I guess, and then the very next day is Christmas again when Rufus Sewell appears in a heavy coat with a gift for Kate. Even though Nancy has told us it's hot and the Santa Ana winds are blowing--she says ANYTHING can happen, and in this movie that is apparently true--even if it doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>It's also apparent Rufus did this film for a free trip to L.A. When Kate realizes this, I was really glad he could get out of there and remove the coat.<br/><br/>Everything seems to work out all right, though. Cameron, who hates men, decides to stay in London with a womanizing widower and two annoying children and Kate and Jack Black join them all for a really festive New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the WGA has scheduled a tribute to Eli Wallach in the middle of the holiday season where only paid extras who smile lovingly at him show up.<br/><br/>Nancy seems to have no idea this movie was way too long for anyone's interest. Someone must've told Nancy for a romantic comedy it was low on the comedy, so she decided to edit faux trailer segments into it cause that's what Cameron does as a job in the film.<br/><br/>I hear tell that even Nora Ephron was running up and down the aisle after the screening yelling ""See? 'Bewitched' wasn't THAT bad.""<br/><br/>I have to agree!"

Particularly sad is her pathetic little effort to secure some sort of award from her friendly writers guild by creating a homage to oldtime Hollywood writers; it would have been more fun and attractive to viewers if instead of using a ""writer"" in her little subplot she had used an ""actor"", the audience would have found it more interesting, and there would have been more that could have been done plotwise.

The plot holes are large enough to drive a van through and the scenes are far too long, insulting the audience by repeating facts endlessly.

","It is hard to put in words how awful, manipulative and clunky this film is. We start off in the emotional maelstrom of the latter stages of a relationship. The way the film chooses to capture this is by showing Cameron Diaz clench her fists and do a little dance of anger in much the same way a 10 year old in her first stage play might do so while trying her best to pretend her parents aren't in the audience. We are then introduced to Kate Winslet who has her heart broken by a one-time lover in front of her work colleagues, we are then treated this movies version of comic timing - she wanders home past various London landmarks (to establish where we are if you haven't worked it out from the accents, and other scenes of travel before finally erupting in (sudden! Unexepected!) anguish at her beautifully ramshackle country home (the cottage from Babe re-kitted out with the latest in modern appliances). I think somebody at the back of the cinema may even have managed a laugh, though they could have been choking on their popcorn, hard to say for sure really. <br/><br/>It got worse though, I pictured the writer writing the movie thus: ""The Scene Where The Girl Gets Suspicious of The Boy Talking To Other Women On The Phone Even Though She Doesn't Want To"", she then probably skipped ahead a bit to write ""The Scene Where There Is A Perfectly Innocent Explanation For Talking to Other Women On The Phone"". Oh yes can we have some seasonal music as well (soundtracks are a profit centre). Every Scene has a an similarly obvious title/objective to it which is usually guessable in under 10 seconds. If you want to watch a similar chick flick watch Bridget Jones I on DVD, if you still have the urge watch the sequel, if you are still not happy go watch the first one again it'll be a lot less predictable than this effort."

","The movie the Holiday is about two women from different parts of the world that are having bad luck with men. Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. They switch houses for the Christmas holidays and agree to change back after the holidays are over. The only question the women have between them is are there any men in your town? Kate Winslet, is extraordinary in this film. As well as Jude Law. This is the best comedy of the season. Kate, shows that even in a low budget film she can stand her ground against a top rated cast.<br/><br/>Jack Black (who plays Kate's love interest) is very funny in this film. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law make a quite couple.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film is very well directed and I believe it is an excellent family film."

","I did debate about giving this film a 9 out of 10 rating. But then I thought, I really can't give it only nine as it was beyond fabulous! I went to see it with a friend yesterday (December the 8th) and we both came out the cinema grinning from ear to ear. <br/><br/>The plot was very well thought out, and the acting standard was superb. Being something of a thespian myself, I find myself watching films now and analysing the acting of the stars. I was not disappointed with, 'The Holiday'! Jude Law, originally, was not one of my favourite actors. I was initially a bit dubious about his acting talent. Having seen this film, I can with all honesty say, that I have been wrong about him! As well as being incredibly good looking, his character was very convincing. <br/><br/>I've been fans of Kate Winslet and Jack Black for a while so having them in it was a huge bonus! Final conclusion: a fabulous feel good film that will have you smiling just thinking about it (I smiled all the way through writing this review!)"

","About two minutes into the movie I was ready to leave, certain I knew where it was going and tired already of Carmen Diaz Two and one half hours later I sure wished I'd followed my instinct. Less than my money back I wanted the time wasted on this insipid stem-winder. It all seemed so promising - Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Ed Burns... I hoped they would tone down Diaz and the ever-awful Jack Black. Wrong. When Burns exited stage right before the first reel, I wished I'd gone with him. Bad story, obvious direction, formulaic all the way,The Holiday lacks humor, charm and wit. It is a story told better elsewhere and I urge you to go there instead."

","Probably the latter. Consider the Tara Road plot line: ""Two women -- one American, one Irish -- swap houses and alter the course of their lives. ""<br/><br/>Now consider the Holiday plot line: ""Two women troubled with guy-problems swap homes in each other's countries, where they each meet a local guy and fall in love."" (Exactly the same thing happens in Tara Road)<br/><br/>I cannot believe Maeve Binchy is not getting royalties for this. It is the most blatant case of plagiarism I have ever witnessed.

The performances were fine (with Diaz trailing behind the others), the direction was adequate and the cinematography was lovely. What this movie suffers from is bad writing.<br/><br/>It almost seems silly to complain about the predictability of a romantic comedy because the genre is usually pretty predictable as a whole. Boy meets girls, someone does something stupid or some unforeseeable tragedy threatens their relationship, love conquers all and they live happily ever after.<br/><br/>What makes or breaks a movie in this genre is HOW they go about it. In this case, the story was weak - in believability, romance and the comedy (there was only one good laugh in the whole movie). The set-ups were so transparent that there are no surprises. Everything happens exactly as expected...no twists.<br/><br/>I'd have been angry if I paid to see it.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a 2/10."

","Nancy Meyers writes knowingly facile scripts, and then attempts to 'cute' them up with show-bizzy chatter and characters who can be described completely by their occupations: Newspaper Writer, Movie Advertising Boss, Book Editor, Film Composer. Meyers plugs in the gaps with nostalgic soundtrack choices and clean, glossy locations. She's living in a storybook. Kate Winslet's opening narration--a deduction of modern romance for the masses--is supposed to ring amusingly true (at least for the females in the audience); but instead, this montage of hit-or-miss romantic snippets is so sterile and Hollywoodized, it looks as though it were created by committee, by a TV group designing a commercial. Comedy about two women, a British writer and a show business denizen of Los Angeles, who switch houses over the Christmas holiday has nary a single joke that resonates with truth. It's about as real as a cartoon, and some of the performances (Cameron Diaz's in particular) are indeed cartoonish. Diaz gave some wonderful performances earlier in her career, but she seems to have lost touch with humanity (she and Meyers are living in the same neighborhood of La-La-Land). Only Kate Winslet's warmth and intrinsic intelligence manages to shine through, but her lovely presence cannot camouflage the fact this is artificial goods: phony, slack, unmoving, witless. *1/2 from ****"

","One of the best romantic comedies in last few years. It's extremely well written and avoids becoming a cliché in most scenes. Acting is excellent for the most part, and characters well rounded and likable - that is except for Mr. Black who doesn't feel believable for a second. Casting him made a movie unnecessarily unbalanced. On one side you have sparkles flying sky high (Diaz and Law) and on the other side you get Winslet trying to make up for the poor choice of Black by developing chemistry with sweet old screenplay writer played Wallach. If I get this on DVD - I'll be sure to fast forward most of the parts with Black/Winslet."

All three displayed great comic timing.<br/><br/>Bonus points for casting Eli Wallach.<br/><br/>On a negative note - Cameron Diaz proves once again that her acting talents are fair at best.

"mcsheehey","2","6","13","1 May 2007"," A Holiday to Visit the Devil
","I had no real expectations for this film. I've seen more than enough romantic comedies to recognize that this one would be an over-the-top, sickly sweet film. However, nothing could have prepared me for the horror that awaited me in the form of this film.<br/><br/>Picture an enormous chocolate cake filled with rich raspberry filling. Now, picture yourself getting ready to take a nibble when BAM! The entire cake is stuffed into your mouth, leaving you to try and digest it as you feel yourself getting sick. Now, picture this lasting over two hours. you've just experienced ""The Holiday."" This film has so many problems and so little value that I hardly know where to begin. The basic story is as follows.<br/><br/>In California, we have Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz. She's a wretched and obnoxious woman who scares away her boyfriend at the beginning of the film when she finds that he cheated on her. At this point, we're supposed to sympathize with her. This is impossible. Cameron Diaz overplays it so much that you half-expect her to explode five minutes into her introduction. On the other side of the globe, we have Iris. she's a sweet British reporter who is trying to escape from a past relationship with Jasper, a nasty man who abuses his position mercilessly. When Iris finds that Jasper is engaged, she immediately goes home and finds herself switching lives with Amanda for a little while. Sounds corny? Well, it is.<br/><br/>The rest of the film goes on slowly, miserably, and with side-plots galore. Amanda meets Graham (Jude Law), and the bad acting done for both characters makes their scenes vomit-worthy. Iris, however, who is played by Kate Winslet, has a genuine goodness about her. If we spent more time with her character and less with Cmaeron's, this movie could have been better. But, alas, it does not.<br/><br/>The film goes on for entirely too long, and is ridiculously decorated with strange and improbable pieces of dialogue. it's an awful film that I would not recommend to anyone except the most romanticized teen girls."
"ColeTroyJulianFan","3","6","13","10 December 2006"," Way too predictable
","Once we had got passed the setting up of the ridiculous plot I figured it would get into full swing and be amazing - I was sadly mistaken. After waiting a half hour or so for the exchanging to take place it then slowed right down and took two hours for the ending we all knew was coming to finally come. Kate and Jude almost save it but unfortunately it is beyond redemption. The whole cinema knew Kate ended up with Jack and Jude ended up with Cameron, it was just a matter of waiting for them to realise it.<br/><br/>The funniest parts have been shown on the TV for the past month - Iris talking to the wrong person on the phone - and the parts you look forward to best, don't include the fab four.<br/><br/>The Eli Wallach scenes were some of the best, while Jude Law's children also added some bearable scenes, otherwise I wouldn't bother with this and just rent out Love Actually this Christmas."
"Superunknovvn","4","7","16","23 December 2006"," If this is what a Holiday is like, then I'd prefer to work all my life
","I should have known better. No, I did know better, but the Missus insisted that we go see this year's Christmas chick-flick called ""The Holiday"". What can I say? It's ""Love Actually"" all over again only worse. Every cliché, every little bit of kitsch you could possibly think of is here. It's a wonder Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant aren't in this.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly boring and not funny for a moment. Its cutesiness is the worst thing about it. Like Jude Law's character. Aww... he's a father of two kids. Aww... he's a single father, but he's not divorced, no, his wife died. Aww...she died two years ago, so it's okay for him to walk around drunk fcuking blonde strangers. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's what the movie is like. Like it or not.<br/><br/>What's even worse, though, is that there isn't just one boring storyline, no, there are TWO! ""The Holiday"" is an example of how parallel storytelling can go wrong. The only thing I could think about while almost falling asleep during Law and Diaz' incredibly dull romance was that there was still another dull romance to dissolve before I could finally leave and go home. As much as I like Kate Winslet and Jack Black in other movies they were just as bad as everything else here. And their storyline has even got a ""lovely"" old man in it, which made things even more horrific.<br/><br/>If you find yourself contemplating suicide while watching this movie, don't worry. It's not you who's too cynical, it's the movie that's too damn sweet. Oh, and in defense of my Missus it must be said that she hated the movie, too. Thank God. I might have had to think about breaking up otherwise."
"film_andy","1","7","16","7 December 2006"," You'll need a holiday after seeing this...
","This film was the equivalent of being handed a nicely wrapped gift, only to find a hideous jumper inside. The only good thing about this movie was I got to spend over two hours sitting down in a dark room.<br/><br/>The only person who didn't seem embarrassed to be in the film was Kate Winslet, who gave it her all - it's a pity her scenes were mostly schmaltz. Jack Black loses 'cool points' for turning up, and Jude Law takes his Michael Caine obsession one step closer (what was with those glasses???). As for Cameron Diaz... Winslet acted her off the screen.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is the director/writer, Nancy Meyers. Her script was jam-packed with every rom-com cliché in the book; it's attempts at humour had a whiff of desperation about it, and parts of the script didn't even make sense: Note: When the driver who drops Diaz off at the start of the film says ""I'll have to drop you hear, I can't drive any further, I can't turn the car around"" etc... Later, the film shows 2 scenes where a car is parked outside Diaz's cottage.<br/><br/>I've never seen a film with so many blatant plot-holes: Jude Law's children apparently have a mobile phone each - probably because he's never at home to look after them. The writing was incredibly lazy and just plain bad: I know these types of films are never supposed to be taken as 'reality', but this film took the entire cake and ate it.<br/><br/>As for the 'surprise cameo' in the video shop - WHY?????? The film desperately wants to be regarded as a 'future classic', but it was just so dull, not funny and contrived."
"cazent","8","3","5","7 November 2007"," Excellent Movie
","Many people have told me that they think the movie The Holiday is a terrible ""chick flick"". I happen to disagree with them. Each time I watch this movie it is just as pleasurable as the last. The Holiday is an excellent movie and will captivate your heart, jar you for a couple tears, and make you laugh all at the same time.<br/><br/>The Holiday is about two women, one living in Los Angeles and the other in London, who are fed up with their love lives, disgusted and disappointed with men, and looking to get away from home. Coincidentally, these two women meet up over the internet on a home exchange website and they decide to swap homes and cities for a couple weeks over Christmas. Each of these women lived in totally different lifestyles, but to them the switch was a refreshing change of scenery. Both of them left their homes over Christmas to get away from love gone terribly wrong, but on their vacations they run into friends and family of the person they swapped homes with and fall into love all over again. To their relief this love brings them happiness and enjoyment, not sorrow and disappointment.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it appeals precisely to my interests and personality. Instead of horror movies with frightening plots, I enjoy movies with an emotional storyline; movies that appeal to my heart and will bring out a more soft, kind, caring, and loving person in myself. The Holiday showed me the joy of love and how beautiful it is. However, I understand that most guys in our realistic world today do not enjoy ""chick flicks"" and love stories, or are afraid to admit it if they do. Guys that like movies such as The Holiday are thought of as ""softies"" or ""unmanly"", and at times made fun of for enjoying such a foolish pleasure. Despite this opinion towards guys like me, I still love watching this movie and will always regard it as one of my favorites.<br/><br/>Everyone that watches The Holiday will not be able help themselves from laughing, smiling, and crying through this incredible movie. The Holiday is a touching film; one that will take you by the heart, stir you up, and make you a better person inside. You will not be able to help but feel the happiness and excitement of love that is presented in this movie. Everyone longs to be loved by someone in their lives, and with true love comes a happiness that you cannot find anywhere else. The Holiday takes you down a road of frustrated love gone wrong, to a spectacular finish of true love in its fullest entirety. Human nature is based around love and the beauty, prosperity, and enjoyment that sprouts from it. This movie defines how incredible true love really is, and everyone will enjoy this feeling from watching The Holiday."

Jude Law does a wonderful take-off of Cary Grant, who this picture certainly was made for.<br/><br/>Two women- Hollywood's Cameron Diaz and England's Kate Winslet exchange their homes online for two weeks after experiencing major disappointments in their respective boyfriends. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to them. Both are literally swept off their feet in new endearing love affairs.<br/><br/>This film deals with the ability to be daring and make a change during times of adversity.<br/><br/>As Arthur Abbott, a retired screenwriter of Hollywood's golden years, Eli Wallach etched still another unforgettable character. He is just fabulous in the role as an elderly widower who with his Oscar and other accolades, refuses to be honored by his peers.<br/><br/>This is just a grand film and I certainly recommend it for viewing."

"swtweath2","10","3","5","25 August 2007"," Worth the investment...
","This past Christmas when I was home for my 72 hour visit to basically collect gifts and then fly home, my brother saw this movie without me. It shocked me, first of all, that he saw this because he would have never seen it with me and my movie buddy. It was of great significance, also, that he LIKED it.<br/><br/>So when it came out on DVD, I was literally there that Tuesday morning to pick it up. I came home and watched it and wasn't disappointed. Kate Winslet as Iris is such a unique character in film-land. Iris has been in love with the wrong guy for years and only realizes it after he becomes engaged to someone else. She agrees to switch homes for Christmas with Cameron Diaz as Amanda. By the way, I want to play the home switch game -- especially if I end up at in a posh LA house with a Blockbuster video store in the TV room. Although, honestly, I would have been just as happy in Iris's pad outside London in the idyllic countryside.<br/><br/>Although this Nancy Myers film weighs in at over 2 hours (like her other hit Something's Gotta Give), it flies by. I will admit, though, that there are definitely some areas to trim, but the movie is at its best spending time (albeit less than Amanda's screen time) with Iris in LA with her new friends Arthur (Eli Wallach), and Miles (a lovable Jack Black). Similarly to Something's Gotta Give, Meyers packs the movie with amazing landscapes that bring the film alive. It's another in a series of movies that makes me want to move to England.<br/><br/>There was no disappointment for me in this movie. In fact, like some great movies of 2006, the more times I watch it, the more I love it. If you don't take my word for it, take the fact that my tax attorney anti-chic-flick brother (who is perhaps THE toughest critic of all) enjoyed it."

"rondine","8","3","5","19 March 2007"," If you like romantic movies, with a movie subplot, you'll like this
","I realize that I have probably nothing new to say about this movie that already has a ton of reviews, but I liked it a lot and wanted to share why... in case you're thinking of renting it. <br/><br/>I saw it when it came out at the theater & I loved it. I pre-ordered the DVD & watched it for the first time since the theater today. I still love it. The main reason why is that it is both touching and funny. I am also a big movie fan- especially soundtracks and scores. (Speaking of which, it's about fricking time the Academy recognized Ennio Morricone this year... the man IS a freaking legend. As I write this I listen to his ""Untouchables"" soundtrack- simply amazing, he writes from the heart in the ""death theme"" and totally exalts and thrills you with the closing title theme... not to mention, yes, ""The Mission"" and ""Casualties of War"" and of course, all the Leone pictures! But it would've also been nice in the directors voice over if Ms. Meyers didn't mislead people by crediting Hans Zimmer with the Mission Impossible soundtrack... while he may have scored the supplemental music, as we all should know, it was Lalo Schiffrin who composed the now hugely famous theme.) But I digress... a lot, sorry. Back to this movie. I liked the references to old movies, the voice over from the trailers in Amanda's mind. All very cool movie references that appealed to the celluloid enthusiast in me.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around 5 people. And if you've read any other reviews, then you don't need me to tell you the plot. But I will tell you about the performances, in order of my preference. <br/><br/>Iris - Kate Winslet. She is totally and amazingly genuine. Funny, but when I saw her for the first time in Sense and Sensibility, I thought to myself, she seems like the kind of woman you'd immediately like and get on well with. She is the person you are really rooting for the most in this movie. She's a bit of a doormat because she's beaten herself into submission with the help of a not very attractive cad. Her monologue on the couch when she was supposed to be helping Miles is very profound and sincerely moving. Sometimes it's good to just let the camera & actor do their job, which is gratefully what Ms. Meyers did in this great scene. Miles - Jack Black. May he get MORE leading man roles after this. I truly found him irresistibly cute, fun and believable! He seemed like a real guy- not some unattainable Calvin Klein underwear model. He was perfect for his part- I can't imagine anyone else. Arthur - Eli Wallach. What a classy move to put him in this movie. He was also wonderfully believable as the old screenwriter who shows Kate's character that she can have gumption and a new life. She in turn shows him that ""it ain't over, 'til it's over."" Graham - Jude Law. He was very sincere and handsome. I thought his acting was wonderfully understated. He fit the bill perfectly. Amanda - Cameron Díaz. Well, she was the least believable- but that may have something to do with the writing and directing. In director's commentary, Ms. Meyer's mentions that she had a scene Carole Lombard was in when she directed the scene at the beginning when Amanda freaks after dumping her boyfriend. But it doesn't come off as genuine. Her histrionics and hysteria seem fake and forced. As the movie progresses and she acts less and less like a maniac, her performance, to me, gets better. <br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Every time I've watched it I laughed and cried. It is a movie that I know I will watch repeatedly. <br/><br/>Does it have a corny ending? Yes- but as Iris' character says, ""I like corny; I'm looking for corny in my life."" <br/><br/>Nothing wrong with that, eh? :)"

","Jack Black, Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law star in this brilliant comedy about true love and how you can find it in the simplest of places.<br/><br/>Here's the basics:Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet are both troubled with guy problems. Diaz lives in LA, and Winslet in England. The two meet in an online chat room and talk about ""home exchange"", living in each other's homes, driving one another's' cars, for two weeks.<br/><br/>As you guessed, they each meet a man while on vacation.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting anything much when I saw this movie. I mainly went to see it because I wanted to see if Jack Black could pull off a ""regular nice guy"" type part, and, in my opinion, Jack stole the show. This is Mr. Black's best performance that I've ever seen him do, just ahead of School of Rock.<br/><br/>Jude Law was funny and charming, and had good chemistry with Diaz.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz pulled it off as a workaholic, single women just looking for some fun. She wasn't bad to look at either.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet was fantastic as well, and had the second-best performance, under Jack Black, whom she had incredible chemistry with.<br/><br/>The supporting cast included a pretty great performance by Eli Wallach, as a former screenwriter who gets to know Kate Winslet's and Jack Black's characters very well.<br/><br/>The entire cast put on a believable performance, and fit into their characters very nicely.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie very much, and I think you will too.

Cameron Diaz and Jude Law are simply good at what they're doing, but I'd mention Jack Black (the Shallow Hall guy) and Kate Winslet too. The movie has a great pace, there are many funny lines and most of all, the perspective of a 'holiday' far from everyday life makes you think... and that's what good movies do: make you THINK. Back to the subject, I recommend this if you're alone, trying to get over someone, if you're with someone (best effect if you're looking together) or if you simply want to have a good time with some friends...

Cameron Diaz and Jude Law's pairing is believable and gives this film fun and spice. Cameron is as cute as ever in this role, and you find yourself hoping she finds what she is looking for. Nancy Meyers' casting of Eli Wallach as a old time Hollywood writer was touching. The scenery in England was beautifully filmed. All in all, this film was thoroughly enjoyable. It is bound to become one of those ""must-see"" Holiday films."
"schrusciel08","10","3","5","2 January 2007"," This movie is the best I have seen in years...if not ever!!!!
","""The Holiday"" is not your average 'chick flick'. It is so much more, so much deeper. This movie contains the most heart-wrenching moments any 'chick flick' has ever contained. Its writing is superb, casting even more superb. Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, and Kate Winslet are all phenomenal in this film. Jude Law's charismatic performance will make every girl in the audience blush, Cameron Diaz's natural grace on camera reminds you what real acting truly is. Jack Black's signature humor is used remarkably well in the script, and Kate Winslets raw emotion pours out on the screen. The four of them make this movie completely perfect. Yes, this movie does have a few predictable moments, including the ending, but it makes up for it with its remarkable script otherwise. GO SEE THIS MOVIE, THE BEST USE OF YOUR MONEY AT A THEATRE IN A LONG TIME!=)"
"RachelGannon","10","3","5","1 January 2007"," Great feel good comedy for everyone.
","I won't say anything about the movie specifics so that I don't give anything away. But I think that Jack Black was amazing, he was funny and serious and played the role beautifully. Both girls did a good job although Cameron's acting wasn't GREAT at first. I love Kate Winslet so I thought she was amazing as always. Now Jude Law......I hate HATE Jude Law, I think he is a pig, he is rude and he hates women. In all the movies he has been in he plays a player, and he is a player in real life. BUT! He was AMAZING! He played his character PERFECTLY and really sold the viewer on it. I totally saw him in a different light in this movie and loved his character. So all in all I LOVED this movie, I have seen it at the theater twice already and I would love to see it again. Not only is a ""girlie"" movie but it is very funny."

However, after security came and removed them, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. The Holiday is a love movie...and sometimes love movies are cliché. Not with The Holiday. The Holiday was just a very touching, funny, and heartwarming movie that made me happy to be in love. It is entertaining. The acting is solid, and I have to give it to Jack Black especially...he really proved himself. Jude Law is Jude Law...one of the finest actors of our time. The movie makes you appreciate life.

"rontaube","9","3","5","10 December 2006"," Very well written romantic comedy
","I expected a traditional romantic comedy here and I suspect many men will not even tune in to what's going on when their girlfriends/wives drag them to it but I loved this movie. The trailer was kind of misleading. It seemed as if the two women (Winslet/Diaz) were switching boyfriends but what they switched was houses. Diaz moves from California to England and Winslet from England to California. The movie has lots of nice little plot twists and it was a real joy to see Eli Wallach playing a retired screen writer that I suspect was based on Ernst Lehman. Elis friends get together with him one night to talk with Kate Winslet's character and we see Bill Macy from Maud and Shelly Berman who was one of my most favorite comics from the sixties. Jack Black has a nice roll as a digital musician who talks to Kate about movie scores. There is even a little scene in a movie store where Jack is talking about the score of the graduate and the star Dustin Hoffman does a cameo. There are a few movie cliché's here but all in all the movie is a winner and who could not love Jude Law's children and the ""napkin man"". I was thinking while watching this that Kate Wnslet should be doing more romantic comedies and has the range of another favorite of mine Emma Thompson. They were in Sense and Sensibilty together. Another movie I loved. So if you're a guy give it a chance if your a gal you can't miss here."
"bulletproofclod","8","3","5","8 December 2006"," Kate Winslet simply makes the movie!
","The writing is, at times, hokey and formulatic, but not a one of the leading stars are without their due talent, though Kate Winslet as Iris outshines the lot of them. She as an actress radiates just as her character does, and it is she and she alone who make the Los Angeles storyline the best out of the two. She is simply adorable, while Cameron Diaz is a bit too work-aholic commit-a- phobic for my taste. Her eventual romance is obvious the instant one lays eye on the object of her affection, while Iris goes through a bit more character development and has a bit more depth than the other leading lady. Jude Law is adorable, perhaps as a result as the fictional family resemblance? Jack Black is funnily awkward, as he is meant to be, making his persona flawed to perfection. This movie is quite a good way to spend a night with nothing better to do, and, in my humble opinion, as I am sure all reading can already assert from reading thus far, Kate Winslet sparkles like a diamond while the rest merely glint."

They draw you in with a bunch of big names that you have seen do good work and then you get nothing. Gimmicks, the whole thing was gimmicks. How many times can you watch Black use his goofy expressions. And then several shots of Law's pretty face with pitiful eyes. And last bus not lease pull out a couple of kids and some how this magically will fix a deep rooted emotional problems for Law's love interest.

"hellings","1","4","8","12 August 2010"," The writer needs to find a new line of work
","I am a romantic comedy fan, but I turned this one off in the middle. There are plenty of things to dislike about the movie (acting and direction come to mind), but there is only one villain here -- the writer. This is an unbelievable, trite, predictable piece, with phony dialog, unfunny obvious attempts at humor, and bland characters. If you are a prima donna who thinks the world should revolve around her, but doesn't, you might identify with the Cameron Diaz character, for whom everything works out effortlessly and undeservedly, like a pre-adolescent fantasy. But, in fact, there is no interesting character in the entire movie."
"aharmas","9","4","8","15 January 2007"," A very Likable Bunch
","Nancy Meyers can make them like they used to. This old fashioned comedy shows the talents of an interesting quartet of movie stars that do very well playing relatively normal people. Cameron Diaz continues to do well with light comedic parts, and Winslett, is of course, a fantastic actress who appears to be able to handle just about any genre. The revelations are Black and Law, who haven't really handled romantic with this much finesse. They're both charming and look like they've been doing this for a long time. There is something engaging about Black, and how he can portray an everyday man very well. Law who has tried this before, glows this time out.<br/><br/>The film is both touching and funny, and what makes it work is the good chemistry between each of the two pairs of leads. As a n added bonus, there's a great turn by Elli Wallach, as the representative of a generation that is not being honoured in Hollywood anymore, that of the writer with the insight. He charms his new friend (Winslett), and through her, we experience what most movies now lack, heart and the ability to connect through good and clever dialogue.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Holiday"" is not much more than a cute, romantic film, something that we'd like to see more of, a return to a time where everything works out at the end, with the necessary bumps of course."

My mother and I went to see it a few days ago, it was a very uplifting movie for us. We really felt like we could have been part of the cast! I highly recommend this movie; if your looking for a short time to escape what is happening in the present day this is perfect you forget you are sitting watching something someone else created, you feel like you are part of the cast, it is amazing.

","I loved the movie. It reminded me of the great Cary Grant movies! Jude Law and Kate Winslet were phenomenal! The only things I didn't like were the performances of Diaz and Black. They were mostly unbelievable; although, the chemistry between Law and Diaz were outstanding and Black is very funny. I think Sandra Bullock could have pulled a better performance than Diaz. I'm not sure who would have been a better choice for Black's part.<br/><br/>The cameo's were great and Eli Wallach, of The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly fame, was outstanding.

"DICK STEEL","8","4","8","14 December 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Holiday
","Trust me to look deep into a typical chick flick dealing with love and romance, and actually buying into it. The Holiday, starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black, carries itself through via the solid performance of its cast, predominantly eye-candy, save one charismatic Jack in a non-comedic, dramatic role.<br/><br/>Being character and issue driven, The Holiday has its characters all suffering from and being out of favour with Love, and from there, begin the story of their struggle and development. Stories of unrequited love, being taken for a ride, doubts about long distance relationships, commitment, and of course, trust. You'll probably feel for the four primary characters, because if you're someone who have even been in a relationship, then you're more than likely to identify with them, at one point or another as they move along the story, dealing with different aspects of love, but ultimately, being afraid of being hurt by Love.<br/><br/>I thought Cameron Diaz was back at her ditzy best, being someone unable to feel and connect emotionally, and being cheated upon by her boyfriend played by Edward Burns. Kate Winslet was very believable as someone suffering from unrequited love, and looked ultra vulnerable, pining for her supposed beau portrayed by Rufus Sewell (last seen in Tristan and Isolde). Jude Law doesn't do much except to turn on those charms when needed, while Jack Black was at his element when in the video store, with his character romancing Shannyn Sossamon, who more than faded away after her stint in A Knight's Tale opposite Heath Ledger.<br/><br/>Much of the movie managed to unravel itself with quite a number of little surprises, as the trailer did not give away too much besides the fact that two out-of-love girls perform a home exchange during the holiday season, and found more than they bargained for with new opportunities in love. These little surprise elements are like presents being unwrapped during Christmas - you guess what's coming, get strong hints, and finally, while suspecting what the gift is, you'll still be pleasantly surprised at the outcome. Be they plot devices, elements or even characters, there are plenty of moments to warm your heart. I guess ""cute"" never ran out of fashion, not in this genre.<br/><br/>What works is the pacing and editing. Running at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it will be rare if you find any moment a bit of a bore. While at the veneer there are tons of issues and problems about romance itself, and the trials and ghosts that each character had to exorcise, beneath the exterior are feel good, hopeful messages, those that you'd more or less expect a close friend to dispense, never mind if they sound cliché or obvious.<br/><br/>Date movie, Christmas movie, romance and feel good drama all rolled into one, The Holiday is very much a been there done that trip down memory lane for those experienced, while at the same time giving plenty of hope to those who haven't or are holding out for that special someone. But only if you buy into its message. Feel the love, people, and peace and goodwill toward all men."

","Oh how refreshing this movie was. Although it was lengthy, I did not realize, although it was cheezy, it made me smile, and although it was predictable, I wanted to thank God for it's predictability.<br/><br/>In a day and age where screen writers and directors force twisted endings and plot spirals into the last twenty minutes of a film, it was absolutely fantastic to see a movie end with what ever sap wants to see. A HAPPY ENDING! I mean, really, with movies like The Family Stone and The Break-Up on the list for romantic comedies within the last year, this was a great break from the sad, from the tragic. It was terrific to see people happy and triumphant at the end of a film.<br/><br/>The sub-plots were terrific and acted with perfection. The plot intricately intertwined within the lives of all five major characters and meaningful for anyone who has ever fallen in love.<br/><br/>Now if you love cute scenes, this movie has the cutest of them all. A scene where Cameron Diaz and Jude Law lay in a tent with two beautiful young ladies. For those that have seen it, you understand, and for those who haven't, i will not spoil. Just know that Mr. Napkinhead is the greatest alter ego of whom I've ever heard.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say it was fantastic to see Jude Law act. In real life, he is a cheating husband, and in nearly every movie he has played within the last four years he has in fact played, a cheating husband. This movie shows that he can be something else. Lovable in fact, and in my opinion, he and Jack Black are the headliners that made this movie, not Winslet and Diaz (no matter how brilliant they are and were). Law proved he was more than a pretty face and ushered a fantastic performance amidst great actors.<br/><br/>And that's really what this film was. Greatly acted. What a cast, Winslet, Diaz, Black, Law, and cameos from all over including my favorite, Dustin Hoffman...<br/><br/>When you assemble such a cast, you expect brilliance, and with a story this good, you get brilliance. If you're looking for a feel-good romance, this is it. And it's about time..."

The contrast between the wild American and quaint English lifestyles contributes a ton to this movie's charm. The trivia says this film was written specifically with actors Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black in mind. And they play it brilliantly! The four main characters are the perfect mix of fun (Black), sassy (Diaz), romantic (Winslet) and sexy (Law)! Although, it did not strike me as strongly as ""Love actually"", I'd definitely go see it again.

"rt0001","2","4","8","11 December 2006"," Every Cliché in the Book!
","All in all a very unoriginal and bland film. I struggled through this movie from beginning till end - it was predictable, slow and incredibly dull. Cameron Diaz is really at her worst, attempting to play the uptight snooty, career driven ""filmmaker"", Kate Winslet turns in a dreadful performance as the frumpy, unloved and needy journalist who suffers from unrequited love syndrome. The two swap homes (UK and US) and lifestyles in a Christmas attempt to find solace and emotional stability. Just as a breakdown here are all the dreadful character and plot points that just make this film a collection unoriginal ideas without a solid, emotional grounding: 1. Cameron Diaz plays a woman who cannot physically cry due to an emotional disconnection (guess what happens at the end... you guessed it, she cries) 2. Jude Law plays a would-be ""player"" who is actually a widower. All the would be phone calls from women who is seeing are actually from his ultra-cute daughters. 3. Kate Winslet finds love in a crotchety old man who is also alone and needs some form of confidence upliftment. 4. Winslet defeats the obsession she has with her ex and finally breaks away and moves on in an inspirational moment of awareness - truly predictable and boring. 5. Law breaks down his ultra smooth player tones to reveal his personal history and children and that he is just ""a real nice guy"". 6. Jack Black is miss cast as a film composer who has been messed around by an actress looking for a break... he eventually falls for Winslet in one the oddest, most unbelievable moments in the film. 7. The old man (who Winslet helps) is a screenwriter from the golden days of Hollywood. He is physically out of shape and struggles to move without a walker. Due to Winslets perseverance he becomes stronger and is able to walk up 5steps in order to receive an honorary award from the WGA. A terrible moment escalated to emotional manipulation due to an over the top score. 8. Diaz, as the hard nosed cow, falls in love with Law because of his kiddies and tragic history - despite her telling the audience and Law, over and over again that she wont fall in love. SURPRISE!! 9. At the end when Diaz and Law are happy and Winslet and Black are happy they are all celebrate new years together and dance around the living room.... they dance around the living room... they actually dance and skip and yell and shake and wiggle... <br/><br/>I hated this movie. I hate these clichés. I never want to see it again."

It was a long movie, but I did not get bored at all. I usually do not like long movies. I loved the story line and the acting was amazing. I have to say I do not favor Jack Black, but he did a great job in this movie, and Kate Winslet looked absolutely amazing. The perfect romantic comedy for the holiday season or just anytime. I would recommend this movie for anyone to see. The scenery was very pleasant also. I loved the cottage that Cameron Diaz stayed in, it makes you in the Christmas mood.

While that may be true, and it often is true of any movie genre, this movie has much to offer in the way of twists on the old story line. The actors shine in their roles, the scenery is a treat to behold and it has an ""old movie"" feel, which seems intentional. There is more to this movie than just the romance. I think there are some solid messages about our lives and how we live them. Of course, it depends on where you are in your own life what messages you will or won't hear.

I spent the first half hour waiting for the movie to get beyond very predictable ""Cameron"" and ""Kate"" stereotypical moments. Wondered why these actors ever said yes to this script. (Except that everyone is shot in the most Hollywood gorgeous manner - Jude Law and Cameron Diaz couldn't look more delectable.) Given nothing going on in the movie, just cut to Cameron or Jude looking fabulous. Just when I thought the film was a total waste, it did have some very interesting moments. However, you can hear the writing in spite of the fact that each actor is working very hard to make the script work.

The only conclusion I could arrive at was that the $20 million they make on every other film wasn't enough and they needed a little extra spending cash for Christmas. The writing was horrible, the acting...oh the acting... Cameron Diaz was embarrassing. She was over acting on top of over acting on top of over acting. I know comedic timing is extremely tough. That is why you cast accordingly. Jude Law? His good looks couldn't carry him this time. Acting was poor and his impediment of a drunk was cheap. And Kate Winslet?! Come on sister!

"Moviegod","10","5","11","8 December 2006"," An Extraordinarily Pleasurable Experience
","Here's a movie that could have gone two ways  it could have been a Hollywood let's-cash-in-promise-big-deliver-small chick flick, with mediocre writing and everything flat to the formula. Few so-called chick flicks in the past years have delivered a quality movie-going experience, so the fear of this being another one of those was prevalent.<br/><br/>Happily, the movie actually delivers! The movie is deftly written, both plot and dialogue-wise by Nancy Meyers (writer/director of ""Something's Gotta Give"" - the 2003 Diane Keaton/Jack Nicholson pic). It avoids clichés, putting a fresh, human, and quite a tender spin to the relationships; few of the relationships are simple, and there are little surprises everywhere along the road. The script also has nice nods to movies and leading ladies of the Hollywood Golden Era, and subtle visual and verbal homages to heroines of the past. Keep an eye out in the beginning of the pic, when Iris crosses the same bridge across the Thames as Bridget Jones did; delish little nod.<br/><br/>Nancy Meyers also directed, and her direction is deft. The superb actors are handled lightly; Meyers obviously could recognize their strengths and how to best feature and bring the actors to their top form. Kate Winslet, an actor whom I like more each time I see her, gives a very honest performance, acting-wise; no gimmicks, no cheap tricks; her scenes are wonderful because you don't see the gears. Eli Wallach, as an aged screenwriter, also has a multifaceted performance. Jude Law is surprisingly scrumptious, and Jack Black plays a nice-guy straight-man well.<br/><br/>(caveat: there are two scenes of actors doing the ""it's a Hollywood movie, so we have to have people dance when they're in a house alone""  a prevalent curse since ""Risky Business"").<br/><br/>The movie is an extraordinarily pleasurable experience. It deserves a solid A."

This is one of this movies that you think you are going to like but you end up liking it more than you originally thought! It has a really good turning point regarding one of the characters and I loved it! I like the way the movie shows us two worlds that seem to be totally different, such as London and LA, and how in the end they seem to be pretty much alike when it comes to personal relations. Kate Winslet makes a great performance, as well as Cameron Diaz, and Jack Black gives a new dimension to his career with a not so funny but more deep role instead. But the best performer is, once again, Jude Law, and his role is superb! Not only a Christmas film but a year long classic that leaves you with a good feeling. A must see for movie lovers!"
"otterman62","7","5","11","2 December 2006"," An enjoyable Rom Com
","We had a specific interest in this film as my wife and kids watched some of it being filmed in the village of Shere -ironically the bit they saw being filmed was not in the final film-although my teenage son was compensated by seeing Cameron Diaz in the flesh! We saw this yesterday at a special preview. I have to admit I enjoyed it more than I expected to. It's pleasant romantic comedy. I find it annoying when people ""talk down"" about films like this, what do you expect? if you want Shakespeare, go and see Shakespeare. This film is beautifully shot in some lovely locations - Surrey disguised with fake snow to look picture postcard perfect, and the Sun and blue skies of LA looking very appealing as we are in the depths of a British winter. The leads generally do a good job with their roles,there's a good subplot with Eli Wallach, where it's nice to see the older generation being treated with some respect, and there are some good laughs in the film. As with life in general you can always find fault if you want to and the minor issues that I felt the film had were 1. It's about 10 minutes too long, it could have done with tighter editing. 2. The script is a little patchy humour wise, there are some laugh out loud moments but also some opportunities missed. 3. Jude Law, it's nice to see a Brit actor getting a lead role where he isn't the villain, but he comes across as very smug, I have the feeling that if he were chocolate he would eat himself, also in this film he seems to be playing Hugh Grant - even down to a pair of dodgy glasses ( a la Grant in Four weddings) to show that he isn't just handsome but can look grown up as well. My wife says that I am merely jealous... Overall if you want a pleasant undemanding film then this will suit you nicely."

The emotional relationships on screen are refreshing, lively, and revealing for their depth of realism and delight. Except for Jack Black's usual character performance that is beginning to become almost stale (missing a great opportunity to play against type) and a rather typical ending, this movie is a solid credit to romance pictures in lifting the level of performance and true dialogue in this genre. A great movie for the holiday season. Cameron Diaz continues to perform well as an under-rated and overlooked actress along with her co-stars (Kate Winslet and Jude Law) all doing well (if only Jack Black could expand his range). The scene with children is a truly wonderful, quality family performance with tender dialogue and acting from the young ones. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","After watching this film in Russian I immediately bought it in English and I guess it was one of the best movie purchases ever. I really enjoyed this movie from the first minute. We see two women having enough of their guys and swapping houses. Amanda's appearance was funny, fast and you can firstly think she is a...whore or someone like this, but we find out she is good. But we understand she WANTED to meet someone special and kind, don't we? Well, wanted - take it! Someone said here that Graham does NOT match her... Oh, really? Then I'm a horse. Two different people with a hole in the heart always match each other. Chemistry between them works quite perfect, and I suppose the chemistry is the only thing that means when people meet each other. Dynamic of their relationship is too much high, yet it's actually not seemed to be bad. After all, we have only two and a half hours (which I honestly didn't noticed). Iris' appearance was less funny but I think SHE is the main character. Kind, cute, lively. She helps an old man not because she had to or she wanted something, but because she just wanted to help. She is openhearted and pure. She changes not only Arthur's life but she changed her own. And we love her, like what she say and like the way she broke with her ex. This little holiday helped Amanda and Iris to meet their true love and over think what is really important in life. I will definitely add this great movie to my list and Watch it on rainy days to bring some sun in my life. The main reason I bought this movie in English is that I wanted to listen to original voices and character's intonation and emotions. Like the whole film, they are grate.

","How could I see this movie so late !!<br/><br/>I am an ardent movie addict and after having watched most of the renowned, acclaimed, super-hits and all such movies from various countries, I find hard to find a good movie. <br/><br/>I do not know how I missed on this one ! "" The Holiday "" swept me off my feet literally. I have already a little crush on Kate Winslet and this movie yet again made me fell in love again with her. Not to miss the equally charming Diaz and Jude Law. Living in India, holiday rentals is an almost unheard concept for us. So the plot and the idea completely was new to me. More than a love story, this is about finding your inner-self. Its about finding happiness even when chips are down for you. I believe that though this movie hugely kinda runs into a fantasy and a dream world with all the best things happening around at all times. I am more of a close-to-reality movie fan, but no complaints this time, as this is one the most charming love stories that I have seen.<br/><br/>The script of this movie is awesome and equally well acted by all the characters. However, the best part for me in this movie is the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is a complete movie for me. 9/10."

","You could Think of this movie as Just another Comedy.. by seeing the likes of Jack Black and Cameroon Dias in the cast. But I got much more than i expected... With a very strong Love theme..a perfect Christmas Love story with all the emotions... Its got more than to its theme of holiday house exchange... Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is an independent woman who owns a company that produces movie trailers in Los Angeles. Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet)editor for The Daily Telegraph in London. Amanda discovers that her boyfriend Ethan Ebbers (Edward Burns) has cheated on her.. while Iris has been in love with Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell) for over three years, despite his unfaithful tendencies. When she finds out that he is engaged another women from the office.... so... they want to get away from their respective situations..... a getaway... so they get in touch through an internet listing by iris... n so they swap their houses... Jude Law is great as Iris' brother.. who gets along with Amanda... Meanwhile in LA, Iris is enjoying the stay at Amanda's house where she meets Ethan's friend Miles (Jack Black)...Later, she finds an old man, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) standing lost at the corner, and escorts him home. She learns that he was a script writer during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The two become fast friends.... with Miles joining Later..<br/><br/>A romantic comedy and mostly lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because they are more for the female viewer than the male viewer, but this movie offers a lot of humour, heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy...one of the better romantic comedies of recent years as well."

","I am astounded that this movie doesn't have at least nine stars, I mean really people are brutal! If you can't enjoy this movie then there's something wrong with you. Needless to say this is a wonderful film! I was a little apprehensive about the strange cast (I mean Kate Winslet and Jack Black!?) but I was totally wrong, the cast is PERFECT together! There really was chemistry among them and they made a wonderful group. In addition the movie had me laughing and crying the whole time! It's a good movie for Christmas, Valentine's Day and anytime you want a good RomCom. However, girlfriends beware! Your guy prob won't enjoy watching this movie with you as much as you do! With that said enjoy!"
"RitikaS","Null","2","3","17 October 2011"," The PERFECT way to celebrate the new year
","Ladies, listen up! What do you do when a boy that you really, really like breaks your heart? Cry? Stuff your face with chocolates? Stick a picture of your ex and throw darts on their picture? Well, not for Iris and Amanda. Both trying to get away from their everyday life, they go on holiday to forget about everything... especially men. But can they really run away from men, while on holiday?<br/><br/>Two women, who are quite unlucky in love, decide that they want to get away from their every day life. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is a workaholic who breaks up with her boyfriend because he cheats on her. Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is in love with a man, who will never love her back. Because he is engaged to someone else. So, what can they do? Both decided to swap houses, cars, etc and just get away from the hectic lives they are living. But as fate has it, Iris slowly falls for Miles (Jack Black), who is going through a heartbreak himself and it is the case of 'love at first sight', for Amanda, when she meets Graham (Jude Law). This romantic roller coaster is a world-wind adventure of finding the right person for you. And never giving up on love.<br/><br/>A feel-good romantic comedy for all women. And the best bit? Director, Nancy Meyers challenges the fact that romantic comedies are only for girls... boys can watch this film too as it doesn't have the classic conventions of a romantic comedy, which men will be relieved to know. The character of Iris has the best actress playing her. Kate Winslet's comedic timing is perfect, as is Cameron Diaz, who plays Amanda. In my opinion, this film has a very important message for all women out there- not to stop believing in love. Why should they? Just because one relationship fails? Meyers takes into deep consideration that women in our generation are so involved with their work, that they forget about love and tries to show women that there is nothing wrong with 'just looking'. Not forgetting the male leads, Jude Law and Jack Black portrays their characters, Graham and Miles wonderfully and depict the perfect partners for Iris and Amanda. I think that these two men represent the fact that it isn't all about the looks- it's the personalities that Iris and Amanda fall in love with. And I am sure that all women today, will agree with me. <br/><br/>I really recommend that all women (and men) watch this film, as you will laugh, cry and really feel for the characters. And people who haven't watched it yet... download it or buy it on DVD. I can guarantee you will not regret having it in your film library. I promise you."

Jack Black was actually a good romantic.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet didn't play a complicated role, but she was lovable and sweet. Jude Law is just like good wine, he just gets better with time.

","This is a really charming, not ordinary, very nice romantic comedy, ideal for a cold winter evening.<br/><br/>I have to say that there are only a few ""chick flicks"" that I have seen more than once and this is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>The actors are great and make all this plot really believable, there are many funny and touching moments and unlike another romantic comedies, there is no moment when I think: ""This could not happen in real life"". That's why I love this movie, it's not like ""they met, fell in love and lived happily ever after"", it also shows that love is not easy.<br/><br/>If you like this kind of movies, I can only recommend it!"

","I love this movie. LOVE IT. It's entertaining to watch, and though it's not exactly unpredictable, you still have those moments where you think, ""Ooh, what's gonna happen?"" The only things I found wrong with this movie are as follows: They got the timing messed up. When it's morning in America, it's nighttime in England. When in reality, England is 5 hours ahead of America. So unless Amanda (Cameron) woke up at 5, it makes no sense.<br/><br/>The movie IS a drag-on. Over 2 hours. If a few pointless scenes were cut (such as shortening the part where Amanda sees Grahm's kids), then this movie would be even better.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful with the exception of Cameron. At some points in the movie she just acts AWKWARD. Kate Winslet does spectacular, along with Eli Wallach, Jack Black, and Jude Law. Cameron did great too but seemed out of character."

","Absolutely adorable! Like any romantic comedy, it was anything but realistic. However, it just leaves you feeling happy, no matter what. And as Iris (Kate Winslet) said: ""anything could happen."" As for the cast, what an ensemble that is! How could anyone possibly miss a movie in which Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Rufus Sewell star?! They were all exceptionally funny and beautiful, especially the great Kate Winslet (this woman never ceases to dazzle me). Even Cameron Diaz (I've never been a fan myself) struck me as wackily cute. I think Nancy Meyers did a great job there. If you want to see this one, you'll have to drop down your defenses, stop comparing, and just let the good feeling flow in."

","Once in a while, a movie just jump out and hit you. This is an unexpected gem of a movie. Those of us who went through the blocks a few times, with scars and skid-marks on your heart and back, you will find this movie delightful.<br/><br/>I would say how much you will like the movie depends on how much you can relate to the characters. Each character has his/her own unique message and story to tell. And each story can be as improbable as an alien abduction if you have not had a similar experience in life; but if you had a taste of something similar, the message will grip you and won't let go.<br/><br/>Some may say the move is too long, some may say not enough; depending which of the situations hit it home for you. And this one really hit it home for me. By far, when Iris (Winslet) shares her understanding of the situation to Miles (Black), would be THE moment of the film.<br/><br/>From love lost, to new love, to betrayal, to (single) parenting... the film has a little bit of everything. If you can relate to just one of these little bits, you will enjoy it; if you can't, you will probably find it bland. For me, I find myself in each and every character. As a single parent who can't get over love lost, feeling the pain of betrayal, and longing for new love;... it is as if the movie was made for me."

Then came Starz and they're tendency to run movies over and over again, and finally I sat down and watched it. I mean, I REALLY watched it, and then I was absolutely blown away. Iris's character was so incredibly easy to relate to, especially when you've experienced what she's going through: being in love with someone who doesn't love you back.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the movie is when Arthur tells Iris that she needs to be the leading lady in her own story, but that's not the only point of inspiration in the story! <br/><br/>This movie is extremely motivating for women, and any woman trying to get over a man seriously needs to watch it. It's not necessarily about finding someone new, but learning how to live after the fact. Men might like it too, although it is definitely more directed towards women."

","In the romantic comedy, ""The Holiday"", two women substantially change their lives in order to attempt to get over their problems in their romantic relationships. While they have swapped living arrangements, they each meet love interests in their own respective hometowns. I relate to this movie because the concept of drastic change can sometimes be very appealing to me as a person. I've often wondered what it would be like if I completely changed my life in such a manner. One could say that I respect the guts and the moxie it takes to make such a choice with one's life. I feel that no matter what happens, I will always be able to pop this movie into the DVD player, and I will get that feeling of respect and feel-good happiness that I get from this movie."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","2","3","29 July 2009"," Funny... Cameron Diaz made the movie for me.
","Nancy Meyers releases a film every three years. In 2000, she directed the pretty funny What Women Want. In 2003, she directed Something's Got to give (Her best film to date). And in 2006, Nancy Meyers directed The Holiday. The Holiday is sweet, charming, funny, and romantic. The Holiday is about two women. Iris (Kate Winslet)is a journalist living in England. She still has feelings for her ex(Rufus Sewell)until she finds out that he's engaged.Amanda (Cameron Diaz)is a film trailer maker who breaks up with her boyfriend Ethan because he slept with his receptionist.THe two hate their lives so they meet over the internet and decide to switch homes for two weeks. Amanda goes to Surrey, England while Iris goes to L.A. Iris loves where she is. Amanda is used to being the rich person so she doesn't like it where she is. But everything changes when she meets Iris's brother Graham(Jude Law).Iris meets two men. One is an eighty year old movie producer. And the other is Miles, film composer. I think you can already tell what happens in the end. Cameron Diaz does a good job as Amanda. Iris's life and romance doesn't really seem real. Like I highly doubt that somebody like Kate Winslet would fall in love with Jack Black. I know she's upset but is she that desperate. The Holiday is a good romantic comedy, though the plot isn't exactly fresh. The Holiday is pretty funny and it's better than something like Twilight."
"KrisNAz","8","2","3","28 November 2008"," Very underrated Christmas romance with a comedic flair and great music
","I can't understand some of the negative reviews except they had to have been written by guys, who have no appreciation for this type of movie. I am not big fan of Cameron Diaz, but her character was quite likable and Kate Winslet is fabulous at everything. In the movie, these two ladies get hurt by the men they love, and decide to ""swap"" houses in December-Amanda (Cameron Diaz) goes to England to live in Iris's house and meets up with her brother, played by Jude Law. Iris (played by the great Kate Winslet) goes to L.A., where she meets Miles (Jack Black) and befriends the wise retired Hollywood guru Eli Wallach next door. The score by Hans Zimmer is wonderful, and the script was definitely written by a woman who has been hurt in the past, Nancy Meyers. I think this is her best work, wasn't crazy about other films she'd written. The beginning of this film is the best,, Kate Winslet narrates about love,, being in love, and being ""unloved"", and it is a great beginning. Yes the movie is a little saccharin and sticky sweet at times, but you can't help but feel some of the pain these women have felt. Only big flaw was the casting of Jack Black- I like him as an actor in general but he kind of played the fat kid and I didn't see the chemistry between him and Kate Winslet at all. Movie was a little long, but was good enough so that I've bought it on DVD and watched it a couple times since then. Great Christmas movie and some classic Christmas songs are played in it, except these are NOT on the soundtrack-still a great soundtrack though,, I love Hans Zimmer's scores used throughout the movie, ""Cry"" and ""Maestro."""

It has it's twists and turns and it's wonderful. This movie is like a movie text book. It tells you how it's made in the movies (literally) and then they do it in the movie or you realize it's just been done.<br/><br/>This is definitely a most creative way of delivering a story to the big screen, I mean watching this movie is like hearing your self commenting about it while you're watching it. So here you don't need to do it because as soon as you think it there it is actually being said in the movie. It's truly amazing and you'll understand what I'm saying when you see it for your self.<br/><br/>And I know I've said it several times before but I'll say it again  The acting is really good! I honestly didn't know that Cameron Diaz cold act a totally different role than her usual stereotype blonde characters, but she is so natural at this that it's amazing. I never liked her before and this movie made me change my opinion of her.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is up to her par as well, as for the male leads, all of them play their role with so much tact that it makes you wonder how many times did they shoot the scenes over and over till they got the feeling just perfect.<br/><br/>So it's two thumbs up for the writer/director, she knew exactly what to write and exactly how to get it on screen. Bravo!!! I must say it caught me completely by surprise. It really is a wonderful movie and it's definitely a must see!!!"

"Isaac5855","7","2","3","22 March 2008"," A Surprisingly Rich Romantic Comedy
","THE HOLIDAY was one of the biggest surprises I've had at the movies in years. This fresh and funny comedy stars Cameron Diaz as Amanda, the owner of a company that makes movie trailers, who has just dumped her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns)and decides she needs to get out of LA for awhile. She goes to a real estate website and chats with Iris (Kate Winslet), a lonely publishing employee who lives in England, who has just learned the man she's in love with is engaged. Amanda and Iris agree to exchange homes over the Christmas holiday. Iris arrives in LA and strikes up a friendship with Amanda's neighbor, a retired screenwriter (Eli Wallach) and Amanda's ex's best friend (Jack Black ). Amanda lands in London and finds herself in a whirlwind romance with Iris' bother (Jude Law), a sexy charmer with baggage. As silly and predictable as this film appears on the surface, it is just the opposite...cleverly written and performed with exuberance and sincerity. Diaz' performance is kind of all over the place and kind of hard to latch onto but Law has rarely been more appealing on screen and Jack Black shows solid leading man potential without losing that goofiness that we love about him, but it is the luminous performance of Kate Winslet that raises the bar on this one...Winslet's Iris is a delicious combination of vulnerability, sweetness, and silliness that makes this film well worth sitting through. Wallach is also a delight as the old gentleman brought out of his shell by Iris. A delight from start to finish."

","The Holiday = Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Kate Winslet, and Jude Law. A chocolatey and heartwarming romantic comedy, you will love it. I know I did.<br/><br/>One thing I found about this movie is that is it very realistic. The situations are something people would experience in everyday life, though I disagree with the house-exchange part. There isn't much of a chance that most people would go for house exchange in a day (unless they were either drunk, high, or just stupid) <br/><br/>Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is the owner of a big company in L.A., that produces and makes film trailers. Living in a great house, with a great career, and a great guy in her life, Amanda's life seems perfect. But not exactly. Iris (Kate Winslet) is an absent-minded, but lovable, young journalist, lives in a small but cosy cottage in Surrey, and finds out the man she has been so in love with for 3 years has no interest in her. After both Amanda and Iris' relationships crumble, they are left with a sheer sense of heartbreak and decide a Christmas holiday is vital. They meet over the internet and decide to go for a house exchange, swapping homes, cars and everything. In a flash, Iris is in L.A., and Amanda is in England. It doesn't take long before Amanda meets the dishy Graham (Jude Law), an attractive man with a charming smile and a slightly dark past, and Iris bumps into the jovial Miles (Jack Black), a gentle, music-lover with a cute smile. But...what happens now.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet was very likable in her role, and exuded a charm which endeared her to the audience very much. The gentle nature and innocent charm brought her to you. Cameron Diaz was also very likable, though not in the same way that Kate managed it, but again her character was a lot different than Kate Winslet's. But Miss Diaz certainly showed she has skill. I enjoyed her performance. Jack Black was cute and funny but he seemed a little off. I don't know if it is me, but I don't think rom-com is his genre. I prefer in the all out comedy scene. Jude Law impressed me, and the charming, suave performance I'm sure will get all women weak in their knees. I mean, good looks, a strangely sexy British accent, and a great performance with a soppy smile. He IS Graham Simpkin. Eli Wallach is lovely in the small role that he plays as the elderly Arthur.<br/><br/>One of the best things about The Holiday is that each character seems to have a great chemistry with one another. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law just flowed without stopping, it was very sweet. And Jack Black and Kate Winslet also seemed to have a connection, this made each relationship very real and likable.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable movie. Forget the haters, The Holiday rocks."

Iris starts out to help this poor old man, Arthur and discovers a wonderful person who teaches her much about life and herself. The interaction between these two made the whole story worth watching.

I won't say more as it's just too precious to put to words. <br/><br/>Regardless of some snit over the 'cuteness' and 'sugar-y' of this film, I'd say this...we need MORE of this kind of film to get this overall great feeling. <br/><br/>Nancy Meyers, you rock!"

","This is a surprisingly great and refreshing romantic comedy. It's not cheesy as so many others are, and it has a superb cast - no matter what anyone says about Cameron Diaz, she was excellent and likable in this film. SHe really portrayed exactly what her character AManda was about. Kate Winslet was great as well, but I found some of her performance (the excessive crying) a bit overdone. The male actors were divine, especially Jude Law. It was a stroke of genius to have made Graham into a widowed father of 2 instead of just another single guy. And the scene in the tent, with Graham, Amanda and the two girls, almost made me cry. The character of Arthur is also central to this film, he's almost like a grandfather giving all of us (not only Iris) advice. Overall this is a movie about love, but more than that, about letting go of the things that weigh you down and allowing yourself to open up to life, love and happiness once again."

A few well-chosen lines of dialog could have remedied this, but it simply wasn't there.

"johnnyboyz","7","2","3","9 August 2007"," Well written and well made romance film that although sometimes forces its humour, definitely holds out.
","Despite being another 'rom-com', I got the feeling The Holiday didn't need to go down such a route in order to prove itself. It's a typical, all star cast, character relations drama that relies on easy humour thanks mainly to the fact Jack Black is in it but also allows a group of four characters in two different countries to bond in a satisfactory and sometimes meaningful manner. <br/><br/>What The Holiday does to try and draw you in is that it sets up two women called Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) in two very different situations. One is just coming out of a relationship after their boyfriend Ethan (An unfortunately underused Edward Burns) had an affair with his secretary and the other is coming to terms with a long time love, who never quite returned the same feelings, that is getting married - one woman is American and the other is British; so this gives at least the ladies of the audience two people to latch onto and relate to; pick your situation that you might have found yourself in and let it enthral you. For me, I related to Iris more but for reasons more to do with the fact I found her to be far more tolerable than Amanda.<br/><br/>Regarding what I said in the opening paragraph, I feel the film didn't need to use some of the humour it did. I respect the fact that Amanda is working in the film trailer business but to have her life's situation narrated to her and more frustratingly; to us, on more than one occasion was tiresome and just stuck out in what was otherwise quite a charming and funny film. Twinned with this, most of the humour that revolved around Amanda wasn't that good and just felt gimmicky. These also include things like the whole 'trying to cry' scenario and the 'funny' online conversation she has with Iris, especially the way she gushes at the fact there are 'zilch' men in and around the area she lives yet contradicts herself a few hours into the visit. <br/><br/>Onto the men of the film and Jude Law's Graham and Jack Black's Miles provide the intended laughs and love interest. Needless to say; both do well as both are so different when compared to one another and of course since we know them as actors, both have done very different films in the past to one another. Graham's introduction comes first and basically consists of him stumbling into a male wet dream. He knocks on the door expecting to see his sister let him stay the night after some heavy drinking but instead finds a blonde American woman who asks him to bed within about five minutes. So there he is: in a remote English cottage with heavy snowfall outside and all around him whilst a girl he barely knows comes onto him  although a complete contradiction of what we thought Amanda's character was, it still acted as a humorous introduction to Graham's character and he handled the situation well.<br/><br/>What scrap of extreme credibility The Holiday does have comes in the form of Arthur; played by Eli Wallach, an old film writer from the classical Hollywood period. He not only acts as the anchor in terms of respectability but also manages to analyse the film as it happens. 'You're the star', he tells Iris regarding her lost love situation and I had to agree since Amanda was becoming too much of a cartoon. Each woman's story is cut back and forth to in a very pleasing and satisfying manner, not to mention well paced as certain events and twists become apparent. Iris' friendship with Arthur and Miles' own heartache as even they grow closer works well since we are lead to care for these people prior to the final third through good film-making. Even tiny things such as the scene involving Amanda, Graham and the 'other person at Graham's house' work well and are highly effective since it's near the end and we care.<br/><br/>Although not normally one to recommend nor commend films like this, I found The Holiday rather enjoyable even if it had a few things I didn't like but it's possible to ignore these things as other themes and conventions work with other character to create something much more memorable."
"pied","10","2","3","6 August 2007"," A Pleasant Surprise
","I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Although it is fluff, it is very good fluff. The acting by Diaz, Winslett, Law, Black, and Wallach is excellent. Each characterization is done more superbly than the next. The chemistry between the love interests is great.<br/><br/>I watched it on DVD and wished I had seen it in the theater. ""The Holiday"" left me feeling good with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>The subplot between Iris (Kate Winslett) and Arthur (90-year old Eli Wallach) was very sweet. Also for those who think Jack Black is little too much, don't worry. His character is warm and vulnerable, and I found him totally believable in his role.<br/><br/>What more can you ask of a romantic, escapist comedy?"
"triple8","8","2","3","3 June 2007"," definitely NOT your typical romantic comedy.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>One of my best friends saw this and hated it. Our tastes are similar so I went in thinking it wouldn't be my cup of tea. Well this is one where we differed radically because I absolutely adored it.<br/><br/>The Holiday definitely had some problems but by and large I found it to be an enamoring story and quite fun to watch. It was definitely much better then I expected.<br/><br/>The main pluses of the movie are it's characters who you get really invested in as the movie goes along, and the writing. I felt much of the dialog was very intelligent and well written, particularly the scene where Winslet's character has that monologue with Jack Black where she talks about unrequited love. As Hollywood as the movie is....and it's VERY Hollywood..the acting and writing are good enough to elevate it and the film kind of taps into a certain element, a bittersweet aspect that one really would not expect to find in a movie such as this. Very ""Bridget Jonesey"" but in a good way.<br/><br/>It also reminded me of ""Love Actually"". Although Love Actually is clearly a better movie there were some similarities. The characters are developed very well and a lot of the dialog, besides being intelligent, is surprisingly down to earth. The Diez and Law romance, even though there are some aspects that are completely unrealistic, is developed so slowly and naturally that it's breath of fresh air. The chemistry between them is also absolutely sizzling and they are the kind of screen couple where you kind of hope they get together off screen as well because there is just something very natural and real about their on screen romance.<br/><br/>Winselt and Balck's relationship is developed too but the romantic aspect feel a bit rushed. In reality, sadly, there's a good chance these characters would not have got together but instead gone back to their toxic relationships. There is a false note about their romance because it happens way to quick and both were simply to in love with other people to make their coming together look completely natural but by that time, I was so happy Winslet was over that jerk she was with, it was OK to rush it a little. And her and Black made a pretty good couple as well.<br/><br/>The main negative to The Holiday is that there is some cheesy scenes and dialog and it's all interspersed with the intelligent parts. Sometimes the audience gets cheese and intelligent writing in the same scene, in a matter of seconds. So it's somewhat difficult, at times, to take the serious things seriously and the non serious things non seriously. And yes it is predictable. (Did we not know Cameron's character would finally be able to cry as she said goodbye to Jude Law?) But really the movie is so much fun, one can try to overlook those aspects.<br/><br/>There is some very good comedy in the movie too. As far as performances, Winslet is the scene stealer-bar none. Jude law is...Jude law. A charismatic and fun Jude Law but still law. Jack Black is...Jack Black. A lovable Jack Black most definitely but still Jack Black. Cameron Diez is...Cameron Diez. A complex, moody and fragile Diez to be sure but still Diez. But Winslet is....something else again. This is not an Oscar Worthy film, as good as it is, but Winslet's performance is luminous. She is pure magic.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend the movie, except to people who absolutely can't stand romantic comedies. I'd give it an 8 and definitely see it again."
"DonFishies","7","2","3","27 May 2007"," Has its share of problems, but is great for a light laugh
","I am a sucker for romantic comedies. I have always enjoyed watching them, no matter how cliché-ridden or awful they are. So when The Holiday was announced, I was immediately intrigued. Kate Winslet and Jack Black in a romantic comedy? Cameron Diaz doing a comedy that looked mature, and not raunchy or animated? It spoke to me as something that could have been different. And while it partially was, it still was inherently just as clichéd as romantic comedies always have been.<br/><br/>Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) are alone for the holidays. Having just gotten over some devastating news regarding the men in their lives, they meet by chance on an online house swapping website. The two instantly bond, and decide to swap their homes, despite Amanda living in Los Angeles and Iris living outside of London. And despite going on vacations to stay away from love, they end up developing romantic relationships anyway.<br/><br/>Even without mentioning the Jude Law or Black in the synopsis, I am absolutely certain everyone can tell what is to come when they begin watching the movie. It is very much in tune with being a romantic comedy, and only vaguely pretends to not be at certain points. For some odd reason however, it runs over two hours. It easily could get chopped down a bit (leaving out a lot of the idiosyncratic tendencies of the two women), and would feel a bit tighter than it is (although I did enjoy the little trailer moments that show up from time to time).<br/><br/>The story, as ridiculous as the set-up sounds, is sweet and packs in a few really great character moments. Unfortunately, it also adds in a lot of subplots that seem a little random. The entire friendship between Iris and the elderly screenwriter Arthur (Eli Wallach) feels more like filler than anything else. Hell, it does not even make for the entire reason she and Black's character Miles meet in the first place. So as tender and poignant some of the moments between Iris and Arthur are, they feel a bit out of place for what is supposed to be the main focus of her plot line (as convoluted as it is).<br/><br/>But even with its problems, Winslet delivers a fine performance. Switching between being totally depressed and as happy as can be, she brings a certain authenticity to her role that is usually completely non-existent in female rom-com leads. Coming from a background of fairly dramatic roles, she truly blossoms as the haplessly confused Iris. The majority of genuine character moments are given by her, and the real likability of the film rests solely with her. I was really absorbed by her moments on screen, and I could only wish that she would make more movies like this (or was the main character in the story).<br/><br/>Sadly, the lead is Diaz, and she fares quite badly. Until her and Law's characters are developed beyond the limits of what the trailer shows, she is basically playing a caricature of herself. Not showing any depth or wanton desire to excel in any of these early moments, Diaz just kind of wanders around, seemingly acting as if she was living her day-to-day life. Now, I know I do not know Ms. Diaz personally, but from anything anyone has ever read, seen or heard about her, this would probably be a spot-on re-enactment. Could it be that this role was written so well and so close to Diaz that it is easy to see no difference between her and the character she is playing? Maybe. But if your likability starts off low, I cannot imagine that is the intended reaction.<br/><br/>When she finally does come out of her shell and begin to at least look like she is acting, she still does not hold a candle to Winslet. She just does not seem nearly as strong, and is overshadowed in every way by her. Yes, she does give a few intentional laughs and acts adequately, but when paired off against someone with such a more unique and eloquent thespian style, one can truly see how mismatched and ordinary her acting talent is. It is not that she is a bad actor, she just does not seem to have what it takes to overcome the pitfalls of a role like this. If she does not begin picking up soon, I can only imagine that this is going to be the standard film she will be acting in exclusively (like her Charlie's Angels pal Drew Barrymore).<br/><br/>The guys fare about the same. Law seems a bit confused for much of the film, not giving his usual intense and charismatic all for this character. Like Diaz, he does rise to the occasion a handful of times, but he just does not seem to be all there. He is the most enigmatic of all of the characters, and it shows in how loose and unconcerned his character is most of the time. Black on the other hand, delivers in spades. I was impressed with his astonishing range in King Kong, and again, he does not disappoint here. He clearly does not have to grasp as far, but his usual zaniness is curbed to a minimum, and it allows for him to really pull off a good performance. This is the stuff of a guy who does not just want to be known just as a bizarre joker.<br/><br/>Small turns from Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell come off as a bit forced (especially Sewell), but they add a bit of depth to the movie that is usually missing. Wallach, as random as his plot line is, does great for the limited role that he has.<br/><br/>It may not be a monumentally original achievement, but The Holiday is an enjoyable romantic comedy. It is better than most, and is great for a light laugh or two.<br/><br/>7/10."
"killerfan2000","10","2","3","22 April 2007"," An incredibly beautiful movie with many things that make it special
","When I first heard of The Holiday, I thought it was going to be an good movie, and it was much much better. When it's mainly an Drama, it has also elements of comedy. The story is about 2 girls, Amanda and Iris, which have a lot of problems in love and they enter desperately in a house exchange website to have a little bit of help in her lives. And then a lot of tings starts to happen, making Amanda's and Iris's lives better, in many aspects. The movie is filled with hope, love, and a lot of drama. But lets see, the acting is incredibly good, with such a great cast as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black and even Eli Wallach this movie has an incredibly depth script which will make you cry, laugh and hope that everything in your life has solution. The music is one of the top points of the movie, Hans Zimmer made an awesome soundtrack that's beautiful, charming and deep, also in the movie some songs appear which are also good, as Let Go by Frou Frou or The Killers Mr. Brightside. everything IN HERE MAKES AN BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. I've seen this film 30+ times, and each time I discover something, and every time I cry, laugh, it's an awesome film which deserved more. That's the reason I give it a 10 It of 10."
"funky_cherry86","10","2","3","13 April 2007"," A Fine Piece Of Romantic Candy
","The Holiday is one of those rare films that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy on a cold or rainy day, it has everything good acting, a fantastic cast and an all around good plot. The chemistry between Cameron Diaz & Jude Law was electric and utterly amazing, this has to be one of the best films of 2006.<br/><br/>What happens when two women who've never met , had serious men trouble and find themselves alone at Christmas? The question is answered in Nancy Meyer's latest film. In Surrey, England Iris Simpkins, (Winslet a beautiful yet dowdy journalist at the Telegraph is crushed when former fling and fellow employee Jasper (Sewell) gets engaged to the girl he cheated on her with. Across the world in Los Angeles Amanda Woods (Diaz the owner of a film trailer editing company throws out her latest partner Ethan (Burns) for having an affair with a receptionist. These two women meet online at a home exchange program and agree to switch homes for a period of two weeks. While in their new surroundings Amanda meets and is immediately attracted to Iris's older and charming brother Graham (Law).<br/><br/>Iris however still hurt by Jasper's news begins a friendship with Arthur Abbott (Wallach) a forgotten Hollywood screen writer and mends her heart when meeting Miles (Black) a film composer. The budding relationship between Amanda & Graham is a little complicated because he's a single father of two girls but Amanda likes the girls and her leaving soon makes it harder. When Miles' girlfriend Maggie (Sossamon) is seeing another man he realizes that the woman of his dreams has been right in front of him and slowly the sparks begin to fly.<br/><br/>This story about romantic complications and happy endings has been done before but it works well enough with the right amount of formula. For anyone who enjoys a type of romance I recommend the Holiday it's worth the money"
"klinkj","9","2","3","12 April 2007"," A movie I will watch again and again...
","Yes, you have to get past the unlikely circumstances surrounding the main plot element of switching houses, cars, etc.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a light-weight romantic comedy. And it can be corny.<br/><br/>But as Iris says to that darling little old man, ""I like corny. I'm looking for more corny in my life."" Simply put, I loved pretty much everything about this movie. It made me tear up, laugh and cheer (silently) as it went along.<br/><br/>The cottage in England couldn't have been more charming. Jude Law couldn't have been more appealing. And I appreciated being surprised when his character's ""secret"" was revealed. And I thought the mini movie ""previews"" in Amanda's head were pretty funny.<br/><br/>And as for the L.A. part of the story - I really, truly came to like Iris. Her kindness to others, knowing the names of the staff, even the mailman - let alone her friendship with the old man were wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>And I loved the references to old Hollywood, and to actresses ""with gumption"" as it was put. I think that watching all of those examples of strong women had a part, small or large, in Iris finally learning to stand up for herself.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie that I will watch again and again. Especially around Christmas-time!"
"melohre","8","2","3","3 April 2007"," The Holiday
","The Holiday is the perfect movie to watch after you just finish a relationship, because it gives hope to men and women that there is a special someone for them. The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves . Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going trough something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.<br/><br/>This movie I would recommend to anyone because of the way it explains how people can suffer from love but also cures. They director gives it a comedy twist which makes the movie very easy to watch and follow the stories and lets the audience wanting to know what is going to happen next. The cast is very good because it makes the audience that they are really going through love ache and that they get over it. I really like the movie and hope that other like it too."
"Robert_duder","9","2","3","3 April 2007"," Brilliantly funny, touching, all around beautifully made and fun to watch film
","Nancy Meyers has quickly gained my respect as a formidable director that really knows how to pull the heart strings and tap into the viewers emotions. She is brilliant. She has produced, written and directed some of the greatest sweet dramas of the last two decades. The Holiday is no exception to this rule. I waited a long to see it and after my girlfriend absolutely raved about it I sat down to watch it and was absolutely blown away. The Holiday is sweet, touching, funny, watchable, a great story with a small but effective cast. The Holiday and many other Meyers' films have been considered 'chick flicks' but even still The Holiday pleases on many levels with laugh out loud comedy, adorable romance, and dramatic flare that could bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a high profile strong, and very successful woman who has nothing but problems with the men in her life. I am not a huge Diaz fan although she can be very versatile and has had some good roles but in this film she nails it and is very watchable. Her story line is far more comedic than the rest of the film including the odd and yet perfectly made voice over-film trailer style narration to major turning points in her life (Amanda is a film trailer editor adding the irony to it.) They don't over use Diaz and make her the focus of attention simply because she is the biggest name in the film amidst some very talented actors. Kate Winslet is Iris, a woman who is also finding her life unbearable and desperately needs and wants a change from her simple country life where the man she had an affair with and fell in love with is now marrying the woman he left her for. Winslet is the perfect opposite to Diaz's character and they balance the film between each other's stories. While both suffering from guy problems, they are so different and have different life styles. They are both fun to watch and a commanding screen presence, and they are both brilliant in their respective roles. Enter Jude Law as Graham, Winslet's brother who bumps into Diaz after she switches homes and life with Winslet. Law is another actor I am not a big fan of. I think his ego is far bigger than his talent but that being said he does well in this compassionate, good guy role although at times his ego still is too inflated and I think someone less known might have done better. Still Law and Diaz have good chemistry and make a good couple. Jack Black in a total different turn plays Miles, a successful musician who has fallen in love with a beautiful actress and has his heart broken but has found a new friend in Winslet and their love blossoms together. Black still manages to be funny without being over the top and fits into the drama just fine. This might be his first real turn at proving he is versatile and can do other things. The four of them make two very different stories and very different romances...polar opposite stories that could stand on their own as it is. You're getting two romances for the price of one. Winslet and Black have this slowly growing friendship that turns to love and Law and Diaz have this whirlwind one night stand that turns into something more seemingly by destiny.<br/><br/>Although The Holiday was written and released as a Christmas film you really can watch it any time with anyone, it's that good at what it does. It can go from deep drama to slapstick comedy to dry humor in a single bound and you love every second of it. From England, to L.A. and from heart break to romance...it is quite simply brilliant. Anyone who loves a good romance must see this film because it is wonderfully written, beautifully directed and brilliantly performed and still has a very different feel to it. Also look for a very brief yet very funny cameo by Mr. Dustin Hoffman, and a hilarious phone scene involving Winslet and Diaz and the trouble with call waiting. Go see this one, you won't be disappointed!! 9/10"

","One half of this movie was dazzling. That's the Law-Diaz half. Luckily the movie focused on this pair. Diaz wasn't so interesting by herself but as soon as Jude Law showed up she and the movie sparkled with life. Their interactions were light but spot on and they show you what lust is all about.<br/><br/>Diaz's Amanda is a woman with confidence in everything except her emotional life. Diaz without Law appeared rather harsh, but with Law she was great. Jude Law is absolutely the star here, not least because he manages to show both Graham's own vulnerability but also highlights Diaz's. The film is full of little touches that seem implausible on paper but very genuine when on screen. For example, Amanda confesses to Graham her deepest insecurity within 20 minutes of seeing him, i.e. that she is lousy in bed. That sounds so implausible, right? Who would tell that to a stranger? But watch the movie and you'll see that is exactly what a woman like Amanda would do. This movie seems predictable, and in its overall plot it is. But the Law/Diaz interactions sparkle and crackle and pop -- this is on screen romance at its best.<br/><br/>I did not care at all for the Winslet/Black side. The Winslet story was a bore, especially the part with the old guy ranting about the movie industry. Winslet's acting is fine for the most part (she was especially effective being pathetic), but Iris was a drip and the scene of her getting over her old sleazebag flame feels contrived. I snoozed whenever the LA scene showed up. I wish the whole movie was on Law and Diaz then I would've like the whole movie."

I love that actress, especially since I saw her in Sense and Sensibility, another movie that I recommend. The story of The Holiday is charming, funny but also moving, and it is not something you have already seen. It has a special touch. Music is perfect, absolutely perfect.

After all the grim headline news, the Iraq war, and a series of dark films in 2006, THE HOLIDAY is a rich dessert to savor and enjoy. The audience at The Grove in Los Angeles did enjoy this film and left the theater feeling very warm inside.<br/><br/>The cast of Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and Carmen Diaz worked magic on the screen and the warmth of the Santa Ana winds added to the excitement of Kate's journey to Los Angeles. Adding Eli Wallach and his group of friends was brilliant and his own journey and friendship with Kate was terrific and so enjoyable and added the luster of Hollywood history and screen writing to the story. <br/><br/>I hadn't planned on taking this HOLIDAY, but I wanted to have a film to begin the year 2007 in an upbeat and romantic mood, and thus THE HOLIDAY provided that impetus to start the new year in a bright and sunny Los Angeles with thoughts of THE HOLIDAY story and characters in my mind.

","When I saw the previews for this movie I got so excited! I had to go see it so I went the day it came out with my best friend. The movie was everything I expected and more. I got so pumped for it because I think Cameron Diaz is one of the most interesting people I've heard of, she's so real so when I heard the plot of the story I expected it to be interesting. I was also really excited to see Jack Black in a boyfriend role just because he's always the guy that plays a pig and a jokester and to see him play a more flattering and romantic role I couldn't way!! I love movies that make me jealous of relationships because they feel real and believable. Both Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz AND Jude Law and Jack Black were 100% charming and you couldn't help but fall for them. I can't wait for this movie to come out so I can buy it right away!"

","Nice to see a movie that was funny and loved the ending. No one died and there was no violence. A pleasant change from so much of the rubbish that is out there. The acting was good, the scenery especially in England was gorgeous (shame that I know that lovely snow turns to mush and mud very quickly.) If you are looking to see a movie that is light with a story that rings true for many people, go and see it. If you are looking for something deep and meaningful, probably not the one. Great mix of actors and good music. The young actors had some wonderful lines - go see it and have a laugh. Might make you step out of your comfort zone and do something else for a change!!!"

","I thought that all the actors/actresses in this film did and outstanding job. I was most please with Jack Blacks character. It was hard to see him in this kind of a role, but he actually did a superb job and was fantastic. I recommend this movie to all women, but also to men because there are good laughs for you also! The story line was one that most can relate to. Myself included. Kate Winslet's character was very caring and kind. I found it hard to believe that people could be so careless with there own feelings while concentrating on other's. I love the connection that she forms with the older next door neighbor. They hit it off quite well. And although there is years between them they can relate and develop a lasting friendship. I think that this movie is a must see for all women and men!"

"Joseph-White","9","1","1","22 December 2019"," A Festive Classic
","Despite the Holiday not been an over the top traditional Christmas film, it is my favourite film to watch each festive season. A romantic comedy with four likeable leads combined with a charming plot, what can go wrong? The answer: Not Much! I have a few minor flaws with the film but that is primarily down to my personal preferences, I don't personally enjoy the story lines connected with Iris (Kate Winslet) as much as the others. Her relationship with Jasper Bloom for example seems very unusual and he is extremely unlikable, but i guess that may be the point. My main plot issue however is the relationship Iris has with Arthur which I don't find my self getting invested in.<br/><br/>On the other hand the relationship with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) is definitely the stand out of the film, seeing their relationship grow is both believable and engaging. Seeing Jack Black in a more serious role is also a nice change and his character is also very charming and likeable.<br/><br/>With a few small changes The Holiday could be a 10/10 but as it stands its still a very re-watchable and underrated Christmas film."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>Wow! I have put watching this movie off for far too long. What a wonderful film with inspired acting and a crowd pleasing story. I found ""The Holiday"" to be charming, heartwarming, and touching.<br/><br/>Two women who are both going through a break-up, decide to get away from it all for a couple of weeks and find each other on the internet and swap homes. One going to England to a small cottage and the other to a posh Los Angeles neighborhood and estate. While there, they both rediscover themselves, the will to go beyond their own personal comfort zones and reach out for something new and exciting. Oh yes, and they both also fall in love - real love.<br/><br/>I'm not going to write how improbable this is, or how it all just kind of neatly fell together for them ... etc. After watching this movie, who really cares? This is romantic fantasy, and light comedy. It touches on honest emotions we all have experienced at one time or another. It was such a fun movie to watch. You are taken away and you want to laugh and cheer, and in parts, cry. This is movie magic. It's why we go to movies - to drop the cares and concerns of our own worlds and lives and enjoy a couple of vicarious hours of entertaining film making. And this is very good film making. You really care for both main characters and want them to find love again.<br/><br/>I loved ""The Holiday"". I just watched it for the first time today and it has already become a very fast favorite. A high recommend, and I can't wait to see it again."

","Years after my mom got this movie on DVD as a present, we both finally just watched it right now.

They both experience breakups and are looking for a change of scenery, so to speak so they communicate on the internet and then go to temporarily live in each other's residences for a couple of weeks. I'll stop there and just say that they as well as Jude Law, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach make this quite charming and there are also some funny scenes that make this go down quite easy. There's also a glorious movie star cameo at a Blockbuster Video sequence. So on that note, I recommend The Holiday."

"brianjohnson-20043","7","1","1","29 December 2018"," Fine movie. Had potential to be better
","My family watches this film around the holidays every few years or so. For a Holdiay movie it's pretty good given that most holiday movies are awful.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is it's weakness. It gets to the fun part of the story way too late. A lot of the exposition material could have gone unexplained or been told in flashback after the two main characters had already exchanged their houses for the holidays. Which is really when the story becomes interesting.<br/><br/>Both of the leading laddies are likable and it's interesting to see how the strangers interact in their new lands and to see how all the likable characters end up together and friends in the end.<br/><br/>Women are likely to like this film more than men. But it's still a decent movie for guys if you can bear through a few cliche chick empowering moments and male character stereotypes. It's nice that both the women do have very different types of disfunctional love lives they're escaping. But like usual for chick flicks ""evil"" men are portrayed a bit too evil and the ""good"" men are a bit too good. The heartbroken women are a bit too perfect too to believe they would have such struggles getting a nice guy to like them.<br/><br/>Luckily the film has a few moments where they address these issues. And a few of the narrative elements very entertaining to make up for errors or nonsenxs. Particularly the friendships of Kate Winslet's character in LA and clips of Cameron Diaz mentally forming commercial to narrate her situations."
"nancyldraper","6","1","1","24 December 2018"," Too much hysterical hyperbole
","I remembered this as a better movie than I found it to be when I rewatched it. What may be my bias away from RomComs and towards RomDrams might have been the filter that lowered my rating. Romantic Comedies seem to root the comedy in hysterical hyperbole and the first 35 minutes of this movie is exactly that (I was not amused) but after those initial scenes there are some great moments of Romantic Drama (which I liked) that finds the core of it's comedy in people confronting the unexpected consequences of their life choices. Jude Law and Kate Winslet bring more rooted performances but I think the hyperbolic tone of the film was a directorial choice, so even they were pushed to the extremes. I also wondered if the roles were cast to highlight stereotypes of Yanks and Brits. Good acting smooths off the harsh angles of stereotypes by filling out the characters, which is what great performers do. Jack Black is always better than I expect him to be. Not a bad movie but more so a fair movie with nice moments. I give this film a 6.8 out of 10. {Holiday RomCom}"

Cameron Diaz - never realized what a truly mediocre actress she is until I saw her in this. But, still, the scenery is lovely and there is not one scene or line of dialogue that will overtax your mind."

The plot involves two very unlucky-in-love women, one in England and one in Los Angeles, who need to get away from their usual lives and exchange homes around Christmastime. Personal challenges and growth, and romance ensues. I've heard a good film described as one with ""three good scenes and no bad ones""; I look forward to every scene in this film, and every performance is good from the four leads (Jack Black is a great bit of unconventional casting the works) to all the supporting roles. Great settings, music, and dialogue. The world these characters inhabit is an affluent one (like in so many other films), though that works here, too. A thoroughly enjoyable experience only a Scrooge wouldn't like."

","This week I chose to watch The Holiday (2006). The logline goes ""Two women troubled with guy-problems swap homes in each other's countries, where they each meet a local guy and fall in love."" This movie made me feel sympathetic towards the main characters as they went through their respective issues. It made me think about the state of the world when it comes to relationships. The editing was good and was pretty seamless. This marks the best editors. As I watched through this movie I found the sound design to be very intentional. There was a heavy play of dialogue and music, and most of the rest of the sound effects were subtle and seemed distant in comparison. This directing choice to keep the dialogue and music as the auditory objects of focus played well to a dialogue centric movie. However, I did find in certain parts that the absence of sound effects in favor of music felt a little strange in some parts, like when the girls were first exploring the homes. I would have liked to hear more sound effects through those parts. Otherwise I thought it was great."

Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz, lives in a massive cottage in L.A. Iris, played by Kate Winslet, lives in an romantic, little house in Sunderland, 20 minutes from London.

"anaconda-40658","9","1","1","4 March 2016"," Holiday With This.
","The Holiday (2006): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, Eli Wallach: Feel-good romantic comedy about escaping emotional stress and embracing new challenges and successes. Cameron Diaz plays a Hollywood producer who just ended a bad relationship. Kate Winslet learns at an office Christmas party that the guy she always fancied is engaged. Crushed, both women decide to swap houses for the holiday. Directed by Nancy Meyers who made a film of similar nature called Something's Gotta Give where two opposites end up sharing space. Here she goes beyond typical clichés and creates two subplots that contain surprise developments such as the fact that Law has two special girls in his life. Diaz and Winslet are perfectly matched and play off the humour well. Jude Law plays Winslet's brother whom romances Diaz thus arising certain questions. Jack Black turns up and strikes up a friendship with Winslet and shares his love for music and movie scores. Eli Wallach makes an appearance as an aged Hollywood screenwriter whom Winslet befriends. While some elements are predictable, such as its turn out, it is still entertaining with many funny moments. It is easily one of Nancy Meyers's best films in a long line of romantic comedies. It stresses the need to get away from stress and seek new opportunities. Score: 9 / 10"
"StevePulaski","8","1","1","17 February 2016"," A smart, wry romantic comedy for a bit more demanding viewers
","Screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers continues to defy all romantic comedy conventions by doing a few things that are often missed by screenwriters of the genre. Instead of focusing on incredulous romances and meet-cutes, Meyers is quick to focus on the characters involved in these on-screen relationships, developing them by closely following their mannerisms before they become involved in the film's core romances. Secondly, she places emphasis on the dialog of the characters while they are in these relationships, rather than their actions, and even if circumstantial incredulity comes into play, you almost miss it because Meyers crafts such likable on-screen presences that it isn't so blatantly obvious that they are saying and doing things that are a bit too playful with narrative conveniences. Finally, the emphasis on conversation and character relationships helps Meyers naturally include humor and wittiness to a screenplay that would otherwise try too hard to be funny or relevant.<br/><br/>The end result is The Holiday, a very natural romantic comedy, with a quartet of strong performers and a story that takes its time to build over the course of two hours. Interestingly enough, most romantic comedies exhaust themselves past the one-hundred minute mark, but The Holiday defies convention by taking a liberal amount of time to illustrate two brewing romances on opposite sides of the world that all began because of adventurous feelings by two introverts.<br/><br/>The film opens by introducing two characters, Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet), a column editor for a newspaper in London and Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz), a movie trailer producer in Los Angeles. Iris has been in love with her coworker Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell) for over three years, despite him cheating on her when they were dating and that her love has gone unrequited. Iris winds up becoming more upset when she learns Jasper is engaged and she, well into her thirties, is still single. Amanda, however, has been a workaholic since the startup of her company, and the result has taken a toll on her live-in boyfriend (Edward Burns), who packs up and moves out after he reveals she has been cheating on her.<br/><br/>Both women are in need of a vacation, and upon discovering one another on a chat-room, they agree to a ""house swap,"" where Iris will go live in Amanda's spacious, Los Angeles mansion and Amanda will live in Iris' small London cottage over the course of the holiday season. During her stay in Los Angeles, Iris meets an elderly man named Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), who was once a screenwriter during the Golden Age of Hollywood, in addition to Miles (Jack Black), a charming employee of Amanda's who has an obsession with films scores. Meanwhile in London, after initially slugging away at wine and holiday snacks, a drunk Amanda winds up meeting Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) when he, also drunk, knocks on her door one night expecting Iris. The two commit to having a one-night stand, but when they realize their dynamic and chemistry is something neither of them can deny, the morning after becomes that much more complicated, especially when Graham allows Amanda to meet his kids.<br/><br/>The Holiday ostensibly sets itself up for immediate failure by focusing on two separate romances. That narrative structure is a constant problem with romance films because they struggle in trying to humanize and develop both relationships under a reasonable amount of time. For Meyers, time never seems to be a factor; she starts liberally, by revealing more about the characters through their mannerisms and their choices rather than by with whom they interact before inviting the love-interest into the picture. By including characters like Amanda's ex-boyfriend and Wallach's ex-screenwriter character, Meyers also shows that she has more on her mind than simply cranking out a dime-a-dozen love story. She wants to populate a film with characters that simultaneously mean something and fill a film with a great deal of entertainment value.<br/><br/>The result is a film that's breezily paced, but never fluffed, remarkably charming, but never saccharine, and humbly emotional, and never manipulative. This is largely thanks to Meyers' screen writing, but also thanks to the talented cast of performers, specifically Winslet and Black who are trying to break out of their own character archetypes throughout the entire film. Consider Winslet's character, who could easily be a faceless, mopey spinster. Instead, Winslet is a deeply sympathetic character because she's not dysfunctional nor is she a comical trainwreck. Consider the scene where Iris is beside herself, talking with Miles about the perils and the unrelenting sadness of unrequited love and it how strips not just a piece, but several pieces, from your ability to love, trust, and sympathize with people. It's a truly sad monologue that Meyers wisely doesn't choose to milk for tears, but rather, pure, unadulterated honesty.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Black gives a performance that is perhaps his most delightful mixed of controlled chaos yet. While he is more restrained and casual here, his zealous, roly-poly tendencies sneak in on various occasions, particularly the video store scene where he brilliant recites harmonies and melodies of film scores. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law serve as the more predictable couple, though that's not a bad thing, for they are the narrative anchor that keeps the film from taking off into another world. You're bound to have a preferred couple watching The Holiday, and for me, the insights and the consistent charm of both Winslet and Black's characters was an instant winner for me.<br/><br/>With all that in mind, The Holiday works as a very lovable piece of entertainment, and furthers Nancy Meyers' status as one of the smartest female directors working in the business today. Her careful craft when it comes to assembling a romantic comedy is shown with every character in the film, and rather than cluttering Holiday with useless caricatures or sticking to a basic love quartet, she surprises on multiple levels, effectively giving most audience members more than they expected."
"juneebuggy","9","1","1","29 January 2016"," Right movie, right time its a win for me
","The Holiday caught me in the right mood, right time and I loved it. Fully embracing my inner chick-flick I savoured the romance, the gorgeous scenery, the hugely entertaining supporting cast and even the wardrobe -Cameron Diaz wears some great coats here. Why I noticed this I'm not sure, I don't usually, it might have been the wine. Anyways the movie is also pretty funny, and while somewhat predictable I still found myself all caught up in the assorted story lines.<br/><br/>This is along the lines of 'Love Actually' or 'Brigitte Jones Diary', with an ensemble cast telling the story of an American (Cameron Diaz) and a Brit (Kate Winslet) who swap houses after their love lives go awry and they decide they need a change of scenery. Diaz finds herself in an idyllic British cottage but quite out of element in the snow and solitude and wants to leave almost immediately, until she meets and hooks up with the absolutely charming (yet mysterious) Jude Law. Law is gorgeous both in character and looks here, he's hard not to fall for.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Winslet is living it up in sunny LA where she hits it off with an elderly neighbour played by Eli Wallach -honestly this may have been my favourite storyline going. She also meets Jack Black who was a bit of a surprise in the romantic leading man role but he plays it straight for the most part and it works. The story focus more on Diaz and Law than Kate and Jack and yes it gets all wrapped up quick and tidy for the HEA, but its also totally enjoyable and even a bit magical if you can catch this in the right mood. 12/25"
"troyputland","7","1","1","4 January 2016"," Totally gushy, but a delight to watch.
","The Holiday is a romantic-comedy that's immensely gushy, with a thick layer of cheese. But that's OK, because it works. Yes it envisages a love that's almost circumstantially impossible. It's absurdness that's at least sweet and warm. Two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, decide to house-swap for two weeks over the Christmas period. One's in L.A., the other in Surrey (wow, what a comparison). There they meet their retrospective partners. The four main characters, including the charming Jack Black and Jude Law, are very well developed, making it easy to feel their emotions. Regardless of the outcome (and that's easy to grasp from the off), I want things to work out for them. If anything it was nice to see Jack Black in a completely different role to what he's comfortable with, which probably explains why he's so awkward throughout. The Holiday, as much as it's aimed at a certain gender type, can be for all if you just want it to be."

The story follows two gals trying to escape from the woes of love, and in doing so they discover one another via a website where people switch houses during vacation<br/><br/>So the two switches to escape from love, but of course, they get over their love ache and then a whole parallel following in love happens.

I am, however, a movie lover. And as such I could do nothing but twinge in my seat for the entirety of this film's 138 minute running time. Contrived plot. Cliché characters. Predictable scenes. No feeling for originality, chemistry, or realism. This movie was placed in theaters to drown lonely women in sugary fluff. So, if you are such a woman, and you have never before seen a film and care not for fancy film trappings such as screenplay, this film is for you. And only for you."
"dogtired","1","5","12","28 August 2007"," painfully stupid film
","It's not the crude stereotypes posing in the places of what should ideally be sympathetic characters, nor the boring, predictable clichés that get passed off as dialogue. It's not the flat, pale, one dimensional, off the peg performances, or even the blatantly sexist underlying assumption that every woman needs a man to be complete. It's just that it's really not funny. Not at all. Watching Jack Black and Kate Winslet ad libbing nonsense word lyrics to one of Black's character's musical compositions, one can't help but hope against hope that they both turn out to have some rare and incurable form of cancer that kills them both before the credits roll. Similarly with Cameron Diaz and Jude Law - although in their case I was hoping more for a car crash of some kind. To describe this movie as mediocre is to do it an injustice - it's actually offensive and deeply patronizing. Apart from that I thought it was great."
"zvi_w","1","5","12","22 December 2006"," self indulgent Hollywood tripe
","This is the worst film of the year. I shall have to watch Kevin Costner's The Postman again to suitably decide whether or not it is the worst film ever, but as a Hollywood custom made blockbuster, the title of worst film of the year shall sit uncomfortably enough with the charlatans who now run the big production houses. I don't even know where to start with this film. Basic cinematic errors in production, plot, acting, character continuity and general Vom factor are not hallmarks of a Hollywood propaganda machine that has sold us year on year with shallow but entertaining stories of love and affliction. Nowadays, if you want to write a fairytale, you have to make it animated. There was a time when black and white would do, but now viewers are too highly tuned to the stylistic forms of cinema for a fairytale to simply slip under the radar. Even if you come out with all guns blazing, an Oscar winner in Kate Winslett, a sex goddess in Cameron Diaz and a veritable prince charming in Jude Law, you're going to lose out if your story is basically a 12 year old girls fantasy with every twist more of an unravelling as the story ceases to portray life, even an idyllic one, and instead plunges further into farce and wishy-wash. To outline the story, two very different women, exemplified by some terrible stereotyping, decide to swap homes over the festive period in order to escape from the troubles that have engulfed their lives at home. Cameron Diaz plays a no-nonsense workaholic Los Angeles film advertising tsar while Kate Winslett's picturesque life culminates in a job as, wait for it, wedding correspondent for The Daily Telegraph and a quaint country cottage that looks like something out of Beatrix Potter's mind. I would like to go into the corniness of this but it is not possible, only because this sort of god awful sap is literally swathed over the entire film. Anyway, they do a sort of holiday swap and while away, Cameron Diaz falls for Kate Winslet's brother, played by Jude Law, and at the same time, over in LA, Kate Winslet falls for love fool Jack Black whilst helping an old screenwriter rediscover life. With just that it sounds like a charming little love tale but this film is so self indulgent that it cannot spare us any opportunity to make the story more ridiculous and more fantastical. If this film had been directed by Tim Burton it may have worked, but asking us to take this story straight up takes quite some cheek. Onto the Vom factor. A two minute monologue by Kate Winslett about what love is doesn't really get the eye juices flowing, instead you want to tell her to chill out and if she stopped doing things like that, maybe she wouldn't be having to give monologues on the meaning of love. Even Jack Black, a man I was counting on to salvage something out of this film chips in with maybe the cheesiest moment of the lot when he plays for Kate Winslet his musical (sappy music before you ask) interpretation of her. Who does that? Jack! Sort your life out mate! A poorly veiled sub-plot of the elderly screen-writer, so whimsically rescued from the brink by Kate Winslet, tells an astonishingly ironic tale of how Hollywood has become shallow and diluted and how he yearns for a return to classical film making. Is this some sort of a joke? If the woman who wrote this garbage doesn't see the irony in including a story like that in a film like this, then I think she needs to be sent back to the asylum before she hurts herself. Finally, the predictability, mixed in with some very odd plot-holes makes it a very linear 150 minutes viewing - that's right kids, 2 and a half hours for a chick-flick. After being introduced to all the characters in the first 15 minutes, anybody could have written this story, making the entire event a waste of bleeding time as you end up waiting for all the ridiculousness of it all to shut up and get to the bit you had anticipated about 5 scenes before the characters had. The plot holes didn't help, for example, Jude Law has two children who he is supposedly Dad of the Year for, but amazingly, he disappears getting drunk and staying out sleeping with Cameron Diaz for 2 days straight. Did no one else notice this when in production? I think I've made my point, nonetheless, I still want people to go see it, merely so people can see a clear example of the wrong way to make a blockbuster. If you enjoy it, you are almost certainly single and looking for that magical love that has thus far eluded youpathetic. Enjoy!"

"Paddy-49","1","4","9","17 November 2007"," A banal confection devoid of interest or merit
","This is a movie of such unremitting awfulness that the only reason for writing a review is to warn others not to waste more than two hours of their lives by watching it. A cast list which includes Jude Law, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet promises much more than this travesty even begins to deliver. Their performances are wooden  nothing they can do can rescue a dire script and confused direction. It wasn't a low budget film  stars of this fame don't come cheap and nor does location shooting in Los Angeles as well as England. But every cent of this budget was wasted on a film that has to rate as one of the greatest turkeys of all time.<br/><br/>There is one (just one) positive thing to say and that is that there is a delightful cameo by Eli Wallach as Arthur. An actor as experienced as him must have known that he was in a movie of no merit - but he had the presence of mind, and the presence, to act his far younger fellow actors off the set.<br/><br/>The roots of this farrago lie are the genre of Richard Curtis - but in case you wondered whether writer/director Nancy Meyers has one percent of Cutis's way with words or ability to create a plot then the answer is clearly no. There are Curtisesque moments but whereas the love affairs in his films (Four Weddings, Notting Hill and Love Actually) are improbable they mostly become believable. The love affairs in The Holiday are as synthetic as the ill chosen soundtrack and the humdrum locations. Kate Winslet is too old to do Bridget Jones and Cameron Diaz needs to learn to whimper and emote less if she is ever to be convincing. The best line in the film is when a little girl calls her a ""Barbie"".<br/><br/>When you think how all the money used up on ""The Holiday"" could have been more wisely spent on half a dozen art house films that might make you think - if not make you weep. This is Hollywood at its absolute worst  a banal confection devoid of interest or merit  in the good old days it wouldn't even be a decent B movie."
"soupastar","1","4","9","24 October 2007"," Richard Curtis has got nothing to worry about...
","This is really pretty bad. It's a blatant attempt to 'do' a Richard Curtis style romantic comedy. It has all of the twee-ness, all of the schmaltz, all of the 'Englishness' but none of the charm. And, quite importantly, there's no comedy!!! It's faintly amusing in a couple of places but that's all you get.<br/><br/>Jude Law comes across as a simpleton throughout the film with the most incredibly gormless smile plastered across his face. Jack Black is wasted in this. His character is simply making up the foursome. Kate Winslet does her best. Cameron throws herself into it also. But it's just a naff film. The scenes between the developing couples are cringe-making. People don't talk like that! It's so contrived - the awards ceremony for Eli Wallach made me want to vom! Also, we are meant to believe that the Kate Winslet character is a 'leading lady' with 'gumption' yet she lets her ex-boyfriend in London - who cheated on her by the way - continue to walk all over her! And when it is revealed that Jude Law's character is a widower with 2 delightful daughters - Jeez Louise: I was dry-heaving by that stage. Oh, by the way, Cary Grant was not from Surrey - he was from Bristol.<br/><br/>Really, I could pull apart every scene in this film (if not every line) with just how predictable / twee / contrived / boring / clichéd / unrealistic / vom-tastic it all is. But I won't. This is my warning to you. <br/><br/>If these words deter just 1 person from watching this film, then I will have failed miserably!"
"moviegirl1972","5","4","9","11 December 2006"," Disappointed
","This movie was nowhere near as good as I thought it would be. It really dragged on forever and at 135 minutes was way too long. It was great, however, to see Kate Winslet branch out into modern romantic comedies as opposed to the period piece stuff she usually does. She is really the standout in this movie and should do more of this type of role. Cameron Diaz is playing basically the same great, successful career girl character she always plays (""Something About Mary"", ""The Sweetest Thing"", ""Charlie's Angels"") . Jude Law and Jack Black serve their purpose in the traditional ""girlfriend"" role, as Diaz and Winslet are the leads. Loved Eli Wallach in a supporting role..."
"gabbymoron","1","4","9","9 December 2006"," I need a holiday from this crap!
","I've had more romantically comical poops than The Holiday.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Jack Black is NOT a romantic leading man. Whatever happened to the days when he'd act like a maniac, jumpin' around and setting stuff on fire? Where is the Jack Black who would give you a wedgie while eating ice cream cake? Or the Black who climbs up flag poles to urinate? Kate Winslet is no help as the air-breathing damsel. Where's Robert Hegyes when you need him?<br/><br/>And what about the writing? Can we get something with just a smidgen of originality, Nancy Meyers? I don't know, when I went and saw this movie I was hoping for the sort of comical romp reminiscent of The Crotch Chronicles. They could have livened this clunker up with Bull the bailiff from Night Court. What'choo talking' bout, Ivan French?<br/><br/>In any event, applaud Nancy Meyers for trying. She failed miserably at whatever she was trying to do. I gots the hives. Kudos to Rufus Sewell, who is great in the role of Jasper. They should cast him as Jim Varney in the Ernest biopic.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not recommend The Holiday."

We wouldn't miss a thing if they told same story in 10 minutes. Other half of movie is a bit better, but not much. <br/><br/>I love Cameron Diaz, but her acting in this movie... She had better roles.

"superduperspit","8","3","6","22 December 2006"," A real winter charmer!
","Unbelievably, The Holiday is the only great romantic comedy this year since The Last Holiday, which came out almost a year ago. I did not think one could top it, The Break-Up was not a technical romcom, though it was good. When I saw the trailer for The Holiday, then the poster, and then found out who wrote and directed this movie was the excellent Nancy Meyers, I just knew, never had any doubt, I was going to love this movie. The reviews did worry me and one of my most trusted critics, Richard Roeper did not enjoy it, but I do not always follow the critics so my expectations were still quite high. The cast also had me hooked, I love Kate Winslet, but having Jack Black in a romantic comedy looking prim and proper and not acting silly and wild, was very intriguing, I wanted just to know how he felt in this role. One of my favorite, very favorite movies ever is Something's Gotta Give, so you can see were my high expectations came from, I am a huge fan of Meyers because she writes and directs such great romantic comedies.<br/><br/>The Holiday did not let me down one bit. When I was reading or listening to some of the reviews for the movie, the negative ones in particular talked about how formulaic the movie is. While watching, I have to agree it is a formulaic movie, and some instances are not very original which did have me worried, because most movies that are formulaic can't overcome that and end up being stuck in a ""just another romcom, like the rest of them"" zone, or they were just okay movies, and I didn't want a just okay movie. Now to give it credit, the film is not all formulaic, but when it is, boy is it ever. Now you're asking yourself, if it is formulaic, why are you giving it such a great grade. It is because of the cast and the way in which the movie was presented, both are such great strengths in the movie. The acting is not anything Oscar worthy but it so full of life, love and joy that you cannot help but be won over by these wonderful characters.<br/><br/>This by far has to be my favorite role for Jack Black, or second favorite comparing to him in School of Rock. He is not his wacky self, or him being wild and spastic, which his hardcore fans may not love, so go see Tenacious D if you are looking for the typical Jack, but here we have a completely different person. He is relaxed, he is full of joy and heart and he is just cool. He also has never looked better in a movie, very put together and looks very nice besides the stunningly beautiful and extra talented Kate Winslet who is just so relaxed and effortless in her role, you just love her automatically. Cameron Diaz, I am not the biggest fan of her in real life, but she is very good in this movie, in the beginning she is really awkward and bad, but she grows on you through out and you get a hold of her character and you end up knowing her like a friend. Jude Law is the typical woman's man, and he just stands there and looks good but his story, which well if you've seen it then you know it is really quite a turn, and not so generic or clichéd and I really, really admired it because it got to me.<br/><br/>The movie is also really, really excellently shot in both the U.K and L.A. It shows both of them really well, and England looks like a dream during Christmas time, also the house they used or cottage which is Kate's is very nice, and cozy. That is why I loved this movie, two separate stories with their own similarities, but entirely different because of the characters, who bring these heartfelt stories to life. This is a very girlie romcom and I am surprised I liked it so much, for the reason that I am a guy and I am not into the mushy romcoms that often. Though I have to admit this gets to you, it makes you cheer, it makes you laugh aloud and it makes you cry, it just makes you feel damn happy at the end, it has such a great and cheerful ending. It is sappy and it is somewhat formulaic, but it works so incredibly well and I really cherished this movie. This is the movie of the holiday season along with The Pursuit of Happiness & Charlotte's Web. It will make your holiday I swear, you must run out and see it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Cheerful, sappy, funny, and extremely charming, the Holiday is a winter charmer.<br/><br/>Review by Jordan Appugliesi, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com"

The whole cast acted incredibly but I was there as a Jack Black fan.<br/><br/>The movie was indeed a great date movie. The premise for the movie, two very different people switching lives and falling in love in opposite worlds, made for an original and fun ride. Nothing about this film seemed forced or rushed and all of the characters seemed to have a very natural on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a funny, romantic, and original film.

Both Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet are enchanting, as are the characters they play. Jack Black adds a little comic release to the sometimes sad scenes, and does so with suave. I walked into the theatre hoping to see Black cracking a few jokes but never expected him to be so well suited for the part he was cast. There was excellent casting for the other actors in the movie including Shannyn Sossamon, Rufus Sewell, and Eli Wallach.

","Normally, holiday/ Christmas films are enough to make audience members puke. However, this film is a charming delight in the holiday season.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is absolutely adorable as the relate-able Iris, a victim of unrequited love, which she describes as the worst possible position in the game of love. After spending three years in love with a man who cheated on her, then continued to use her, she takes a vacation in Los Angeles to get away from the now engaged London native. She is an absolute sweetheart, genuine and flawed but with the most well-meaning heart. She befriends an elderly screenwriter, who is perhaps one of the best characters in the film. She also meets Jack Black, another person who is used to being used. Although Jack Black is fun as usual as film composer Miles, it is really Iris's journey that lights up the film. You will clap and scream with her as she begins to find her strength and dances in celebration.<br/><br/>On the other side, Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a wealthy business owner from Los Angeles who can't seem to commit to a relationship. After her live-in boyfriend cheats on her, she decides to take a break from men in Iris's little cottage near London. Of course, she cannot escape the other sex as she soon meets up with Iris's older brother, Graham (Jude Law). Although it seems there may be some substance to the relationship that forms between the two ""complicated"" characters, especially when Amanda find's out a sensitive secret of Graham's, their romance still comes off a bit shallow and uninteresting. You may root for their connection, but Amanda's character is bland and goes through little change besides returning to the world of carbs and chocolates. Jude Law is adorable, but his dream-character is a little too good looking, too sensitive and too honest to be true.<br/><br/>So half of the movie is absolutely wonderful. And if you are looking for something to light up your spirits like those dazzling lights on a Christmas tree, this is definitely the best film out there for you."

","Now, okay, I'm not a fan of the romcom, but THIS is one of the worst example of the genre. ""The Holiday"" has everything that I hate about the romcom: Irritating submissive female characters - check. One-dimensional male characters - check lack of script - check cutesy kids and/or animals: check to BOTH!!<br/><br/>The Holiday even manages to throw some Christmas schmaltz into it as well,leaving one feeling slightly nauseous. Cameron Diaz overacts in every scene, Jack Black tries hard to break out of his ""cute but funny guy"" shtick and Jude Law and Kate Winslet are left with one-dimensional characters that are hardly sympathetic.<br/><br/>The only character that stands out is Eli Wallach's. Really, I think Mr Wallach thought he was in another film entirely.<br/><br/>A complete waste of time and money."

","Definitely one of your better romantic comedies, which benefits greatly from a great cast and a transatlantic setting. Jack Black stops playing silly buxxxxs and plays sincere, and by jove, it works, it really clicks. Kate Winslet is excellent in character of one in love with love, and Ms Diaz is allowed to be goofy (her signature) but believable, very neat casting. While a movie is always about the people, in a film that shows the USA versus the UK, the set dressing plays an important part. The houses look 'right'. The space and the colours, the need for a pool, the magic of electricity, old versus new. Well thought out views. I, personally dislike Jude Law, too many guys like him in the UK. But he is credible and even likable here. The dialogue has a lot going for it."

Winslet is fantastic as the stereotypical English rose and Black adds his own wonderful brand of humour. In fact, we also get to see a far more tender and dramatic performance from Jack Black that was surprisingly impressive, although I still believe that comedy acting is where his fortune lies!

"CountZero313","1","4","11","14 July 2007"," Corny? No. Crap? Yes.
","This film is absolute drivel. Romantic comedy is a tough genre - we live in a very cynical age, decades after Betty Blue and an absolute eon since An Affair to Remember. These days, if people like each other, they get it on, and there are very few social, ethical or religious barriers to prevent it. Therefore, to make a romantic comedy work, a lot of filmmakers have turned to supernatural barriers - the time-slips of The Lake House and Groundhog Day, the curse/wish-fulfillment in Big, a fictional mental disability in 50 First Dates - to keep their romantic leads apart. When they stick to more prosaic story lines, the modern audience isn't convinced. Nancy Meyers seems to be aware of this and and two elements of this film reveal that. First of all, she has this self-reflexive habit of commenting on Hollywood conventions, Eli Wallach's exposition on the term 'meet cute' being the most glaring example. Secondly, she seems to be winking at the audience when she has Kate Winslet declare that ""Corny is good!"" Except that this film isn't corny, it's flat. How you can put Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in the same room and fail to create any chemistry at all is incomprehensible. Maybe they cancelled each other out, hot-plus-hot-equals-cold. Only Winslet's character achieves plausibility. Jake Black's comic potential is never exploited, and he looks embarrassed when he slaps high-fives with the pensioners, a scene that exhibits a gushing rush of sentimentality. Cameron Diaz's character is just two-dimensional, and Jude Law's character makes no sense at all - single fathers cannot go out on the pish and the pull as much as this guy, it just isn't feasible. All I got from this film was a new-found respect for Hugh Grant - the guy can take this kind of material and elevate it to something that touches you. The Holiday, however, is as crass, commercial and convincing as a dancing Santa lamp ( I have one, it's rubbish). Worth a look if you are interested in why romantic comedies so often fail, even with a stellar cast, but otherwise - avoid at all costs."

","What can you say about a big-name, big-budget romantic comedy, when the most romantic, in-synch, compatible duo is a brother-and-sister pair? And what can you say when two of Hollywood's most beautiful women portray losers-in-love who escape their unhappy situations by crossing the Atlantic Ocean and the North American land mass to each fall in love with a nebbish? (And take my word for it, when one of the male leads has a personality transplant in the middle of the film, he suddenly turns from a dashing cad into a nebbish, while, curiously, Kate Winslet's Iris becomes a mensch.) A rather formulaic comedy, with pretty girls and boys, stunningly-beautiful Hollywood mansions and quaint, snow-dusted English cottages, ""The Holiday"" recounts the story of two unhappy career women whose love-lives are in the ""loo,"" as we Americans believe the English might say, and therefore switch homes for two weeks, although the first 6 hours of the house swap seem to take days, and then time stands still for, oh, I don't know, about a month, not to give the four leads the opportunity for character development, but for the lovely Iris to adopt the grandfatherly walker-bound Eli Wallach, take a six-month crash course in physical therapy to cure him of his disability so he can throw away his walker (and his home-health-aide, whatever happened to her?) enabling him to walk to the stage at the tribute to his work -- and since he never responded to their repeated letters until Iris talked him into it, they must have taken about 9 more months to plan the tribute and fill the auditorium to SRO -- except, wait, save two seats down front for Iris and her new boo, Miles (Jack Black), a movie-trailer music editor.<br/><br/>Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a movie-trailer editor, falls madly in love with the lovely Jude Law  and by the way, they should forget about cloning sheep over there, and just clone Jude Law  while clearly, the man who haunts her dreams is not Law's dashing book editor (is everyone in this movie an editor? Doesn't anyone have a real job?), but Movie Trailer Announcer Guy, whose vocal appearances are Oscar-worthy vignettes, if indeed there was a category for ""Best Vocal Appearances in Vignettes."" After the longest holiday on record (16 months and 6 hours by my count) all ends happily ever after with a cheerfully creepy New Year's Eve party attended by all the interested parties (but no Rufus Sewell, or Ed Burns? Boo!) and two precious moppets who, although sisters, obviously do not belong to the same gene pool (although the older one looks suspiciously like Eli Wallach) and, as a famous writer once said, all's well that ends well.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel, a bloody thriller called, ""The Holiday Two: New Year's Day,"" where jilted lovers Rufus Sewell, Ed Burns, and that unemployed home health care aide, arrive to exact their revenge."

","Okay, this is a feelgood chick flick and it's enjoyable to watch but you forget it as you leave the foyer. But really they should pay researchers a decent salary so that they wouldn't come up with howlers like 'Cary Grant was born in Surrey'. 'How do you know'. 'He told me once'. Now this is a great way to delineate the Eli Wallach character economically BUT, Cary Grant was born in SURREY! No way, Jose; Cary Grant, nee Archibald Leach, was born in Bristol, more than one hundred miles from Surrey. Okay, most of the popcorn crowd who are the target audience for this movie won't care one way or the other even if they've ever HEARD of Cary Grant but it's a truism of creative writing that if you get the small details wrong you won't fare much better with the big ones. This is an error that's mind-boggling especially since the misinformation is put into the mouth of the ONE character who was around when Hollywood was a factory town, turning out product, yes, but largely Quality product, product in fact of the kind that THIS film aspires to but misses by about from here to Guatamala. What are the chances realistically that FOUR unattached people ALL with glamorous jobs, affluent, well-dressed and reasonably attractive AND (presumably) a wide circle of friends would have no Christmas plans that couldn't be broken on five minutes notice so much so that two of them can and do fly about 6,000 miles on a whim. Sloppiness is everywhere. Take the Jude Law character. He turns up on his sister's doorstep around midnight having spent the evening getting drunk in the local pub. Nothing wrong with that, it's even reasonably realistic EXCEPT: That within a half hour this character is revealed to be the widowed and very CARING father of two daughters around ten years old. True, it is explained that on the night in question they were staying with their grandparents but would a character like this REALLY drink himself senseless when he has a few hours off. Hardly. Still, there you go; the thing is that with this type of movie you're not supposed to ASK awkward questions like this, but why not? Surely it's just as easy to write a credible feelgood script as a sloppy one. Most of the principals turn in a competent job though Kate Winslett isn't quite able to convey the REAL anguish of being dumped. To do so she would need to EMPATHISE with the caring, blameless husband she herself dumped for a new lover who had more to offer in the way of both earning power and cachet. It'll probably perform well over the Christmas period but this time next year they'll be giving the DVD away with the Daily Telegraph no doubt as part of the deal for the outrageous product placement of having Winslett work there."

"parker67","10","2","4","13 September 2012"," ""The Holiday"" is for you romantics!!!
","Spoiler Review If you're looking for an entertaining and romantic film then ""The Holiday"" is for you. The previews for this film were an understatement and noticeably not revealing the plot before viewing, which was a good thing. This film did give an impression that it was the usually romantic comedy with a perfect ending however; there are some surprising scenes that make this particular movie more distinctive. With the use of parallel cuts that told both stories in separate locations but simultaneously the director delivered a perfect romantic comedy. Just as you could imagine ""The Holiday"" theme was about moving forward, taking chances and giving love another try.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly touched by Kate Winslet, a devoted and dedicated character by the name of Iris. Definitely her character love affair with Miles, play by Jack Black, was cheated on. There could have been more time to develop Iris and Miles story line. Although, he did portray his funny side and then flip back to seriousness on several different occasions. It was hard to accept Jack Black playing this romantic and serious character because I'm used to seeing him play a totally different type of character.<br/><br/>As you can guess the majority of the film focused on Cameron Diaz playing Amanda and Graham Simpkins (Jude Law) developing their love affair. There are a few scenes that could have been eliminated but overall there love affair was a little surprising. At first, it's the usually unbelievable attraction that was halted by what ""ifs"" and then the realization of oops I feel in love with you. After seeing this plot in every other film what makes this one more unique. You will have to trust me it's has a tricky situation that makes you realize this isn't just the ordinary romantic affair.<br/><br/>Amanda and Graham story reminds you of the movie ""No Strings Attached"" a relationship that purely starts off physical and develops into something deeper. The scene when Amanda first meets Graham and then immediately suggests having a one-night stand was bold. This was a similar situation in ""No Strings Attached"" since Emma (Natalie Portman) proposed having casual sex with Adam (Ashton Kutcher) that turned into a deeper love affair than anticipated.<br/><br/>The scenery of this movie was beautiful and cheerful. I smiled and laughed many times out loud as to be expected this movie was a romantic comedy. This movie is for those who want to escape reality because the like hood of many of us swapping out our houses and traveling to another county is not realistic at all. In fact, many of us dream about find Mr. Right but at what cost or chance would you take to find that true love."
"hhasti00","Null","2","4","22 July 2011"," Not A Holiday I'd Want To Take
","I usually find romantic comedies to be really cliché, unfunny, and have horrible acting.<br/><br/>With the exception of Kate Winslet, Eli Wallach, and maybe a couple of others, ""The Holiday"" is no different. The story follows two women switching homes in different countries for Christmas vacation, and when they leave, their lives are totally changed. Just like that. With no evidence of any real character development or changes (except on Winslet's end). Very realistic, Nancy Meyers.<br/><br/>As a person who has been playing the piano for over 10 years, it frustrated me that Jack Black's fingers were on the wrong keys when composing! It's like that epic fail of Freddie Highmore's ""conducting"" in ""August Rush"". Have some musical consistency, people!<br/><br/>Winslet as the pathetic, emotionally broken, but kind Iris Simpkins was nothing short of dead on. You find her so pathetic and so self-loathing that you do feel immensely sorry for her. Considering this was her first time in a romantic comedy, I applaud her for being able to contribute as much as she did. I found her to be quite charming once she got out of the depression. <br/><br/>I found the plot line to be very surface-y, and Meyers could have done so much more with Graham's life circumstances and Amanda's inner pain as well. Instead, it just barely scratches the surface and it leaves you thinking ""why the heck didn't you elaborate on this more?"" <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz as Amanda....let's just not relive too much of that. It was painfully similar acting to some of her other characters before (more like, in every romantic comedy she's ever been in) which isn't necessarily good acting. She is flat and over the top in the wrong places and there's no build up to those points either! Her chemistry with Jude Law is..eh. Not terrific, but not completely horrible either. They barely pass as a couple, for me. I also don't like that Cameron Diaz got more camera time than Kate Winslet--Kate Winslet is far better, and her character's story was much more interesting.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Jack Black have absolutely no romantic chemistry whatsoever! They can pass as really great friends, but that's about it. I know that some people found Jack Black dead in his role, but I actually found it refreshing that he was portraying someone a little more down-to-earth. I definitely feel that their story deserved more screen time, especially with the brilliant Eli Wallach's secondary character! So witty, direct, and delightful as Arthur Abbott. <br/><br/>There's only so much I can write since the maximum is 1,000 words, but in short, ""The Holiday"" is another one of your typical romantic comedies: bad writing and barely there acting."

","My toes have just about uncurled enough to free me to diss this over-sentimental piece of tosh. There's a fine art, I believe, in concocting a classic Christmas movie, but the best of them - ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""The Bishop's Wife"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"" etc, all manage it by being natural and unforced, showing real people in real situations, but their lives overtaken in one way or another by that unclassifiable Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>The so-called fare on show here is however so calculated and lacking in good humour (in every sense of the phrase) that what's left is an overwrought, overplayed, overdone piece of contrived hokum.<br/><br/>Quite how an ordinary member of the public is meant to relate to high-flying movie-trailer producer Cameron Diaz in her all mod cons dream house, replete with swimming pool and electric curtains, or publishing executive Jude Law as a grieving widower, Jack Black as a cuckolded movie soundtrack composer or even the most downbeat character, Kate Winslet as a lovelorn journalist but still somehow lives in a picturesque cottage in Surrey, is beyond me. And if the answer to that question is meant to be the persuasive talents of the actors on show, then that's another miss as far as I'm concerned. Diaz gets to wig out as per usual to a rock track (likewise Winslet) and how she can't cry anymore, Law gets to gush stuff and nonsense about his doting kids, Winslet builds up an unbelievable with a decrepit sardonic old Hollywood screenwriter and Black tags after a younger model playing him for a fool, in between composing saccharine music for the big screen. Cue Hans Zimmer's completely bland muzak, which seems to get turned on and up whenever A BIG SCENE arises.<br/><br/>Cringe-worthy scene follows cringe-worthy scene as all ends happily ever after with the final images of the happy couples partying down with as much phony conviction as they can muster.<br/><br/>Really, I could go on and on, but this is about as cynical and hokey as Hollywood gets in going after the big Christmas buck. There are a host of wonderful Christmas movies out there and not just the Golden Age classics I mentioned at the outset - Bill Murray's ""Scrooged"" for one. I haven't seen such a bad film in such a long time and can only recommend that if you decide to watch it, imbibe in a whole lot of Christmas spirits beforehand. Unfortunately, being teetotal, I had no such release and suffered accordingly!"

","There are some romantic comedies that I don't like, but The Holiday is an exception. I found it sweet and very entertaining at times. The four stars, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black are very talented actors, and their performances take centre stage here. Kate Winslet was lovely as Iris, but I was really delighted with Cameron Diaz as Amanda, especially when she is seen wearing stilettos in the snow. At my first viewing the whole cinema were like ""How does she do that?"" I also thought their exchange on the phone was hilarious too. As the men, I really liked Jack Black as Miles, a perfect blend of subtlety and spirit. Jude Law, an actor who isn't always my cup of tea, does very well indeed, as Diaz's new friend Graham. This tells the story of two women who swap homes and make lifelong friends, or something along the lines of that. My sister has this on DVD and absolutely loves it. I have only two quibbles with this movie, the script is a little weak and frothy at times, and there are some places where the story is underdeveloped. Still a beautiful-looking and hugely enjoyable film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

But these two women are very different. Cameron Diaz is a wealthy woman who lives in a big city, Los Angeles, and Kate Winslet is normal woman that lives in a cottage in a small village. Despite the many differences they do have something in common. They both have problems in their relations . During the holiday they try solve these rather important problems. There are a lot of well known actors and actresses such as: Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, They all play their parts very well, but Cameron Diaz and Jude Law are extraordinary . My favorite scene in the film is when the two ladies and Jude Law are together under the tent. The moment they're looking at the stars is magically The film also has an excellent storyline. It's very funny to see what happens to the two women when she leave to an ""other world"". The holiday is romantic film and I like this genre of film. This is the kind of film that lets you dream  You can relax and take advantage of the moment, hoping that someday, something this will happen to you too. The one thing I disliked was the music ! I don't think that it was the right music for the film, they should've chosen romantic music! All the rest is MAGICAL ! The atmosphere of this film is magic and fabulous, like a fairy-tale You are immediately projected in the story ! I would recommended this film because it is so magic but I think that this film better is for girls than for boys  Age is not an issue, I thing that each girl will find it great!

"jehaccess6","7","2","4","13 July 2008"," Two Romances For The Price Of One.
","I picked out the DVD in haste before the video rental store closed. My first choice in rentals firmly in hand, I hastily snagged a backup. Well, the first choice was a dud, but this film was actually quite pleasant. I usually get an insight to the female perspective on romance from female directors like Nancy Meyers, this one did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is covered countless times in these comments, so a rehash here is redundant. My reactions to the film are as follows: The plot got me to thinking about how much reality about Hollywood relationships reached the screen. Does everyone in Hollywood really carry on as in this film? When you think about the plot a bit, it starts to seem incestuous; a Hollywood film about Hollywood. There must be a whole lot of misery concealed behind that over-the-top architecture in Bel Air. Oh well, filming more than half the project in Hollywood reduces the expenses of location shooting significantly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Kate Winslett Iris character much better than the Cameron Diaz character Amanda. Iris had only had one real romance in her life, one sided to be sure. Amanda had wandered from man to man, never willing to commit herself wholly and eventually pushing away everyone she was supposed to get close to. No wonder the men found this unsatisfactory and started looking elsewhere for a better relationship. We see this pattern repeated in Amanda's relationship with the Jude Law character Graham.<br/><br/>Shallow Amanda meets drunk hunk Graham at her door late at night and immediately suggests they jump into bed together. From this unfortunate decision, somehow a more rational relationship is forged as Amanda fights off her worst fears and actually allows a man into her heart.<br/><br/>Iris is pleasantly shocked and delighted by her experiences in Los Angeles and dives into the experience with gusto. She is kind and thoughtful to everyone she meets, especially her 90 year old neighbor man. Iris' kindness extends to new acquaintance, the Jack Black character Miles. Iris lends support and comfort to Miles as his romantic relationship to an unfaithful girlfriend dissolves. Of course, you can see immediately that Iris and Miles are destined to fall in love.<br/><br/>Amanda is shocked and delighted to meet the two adorable little daughters of widower Graham. They take an immediate liking to Amanda and set about worming their way into her heart. It is the attraction to these children that gives Amanda the courage to take the terrifying step of actually allowing herself to fall in love.<br/><br/>The film closes with the two couples bonding around a Christmas tree in Graham's living room. Two women who just met are going to become much closer as sisters-in-law. The two girls are gaining a mother and an uncle. How the practical problems of carrying on the respective careers of the parties is left unresolved, but they will find a way.<br/><br/>One thing really bothered me in the film. Amanda is shown driving Iris' car in two scenes. Nowhere on the cottage property is any provision for parking the car. Iris seems to commute to and from work by train and walk home from the train stop in the nearby village. So where does Amanda get the car?<br/><br/>Of course this film is all fluff, but I never cared because all the major players carry it off so well. I watch this film often and I never fail to enjoy this visit to four people I have grown to care about."

","This movie definitely has gumption! There is just something about this movie that gets me every time. It just hits so close to home for me. For some reason I always seem to watch it when it's raining or when I'm feeling down or unwanted and confused about love. Everyone has had their share of broken hearts and this is a good movie to watch when you've got one. I have watched it many a times before. Somehow it always manages to leave me with a smile on my face with my hope in love restored once again. And Kate Winslet is so great in this film. Everything she says about love is so true. For example, I love in the beginning how she describes the different kinds of love there are, how easily love can fade or be lost or even unreturned. And I almost cry every time during the scene when she's explaining how broken a person's heart can be, but then she says too that eventually all that fades and you move on because you really do. It's just a great pick me up for when you're feeling blue and alone in the love department. The cast was also well chosen and fit the story line perfectly. Jude Law and Cameron Diaz were great together and I also thought that Jack Black did a nice job as well. Normally I don't really care for him and his type of humor but he really pulled his character off nicely. He had a subtle, yet caring and sweet kind of humor that added a great deal to the film. All in all, ""The Holiday"" is a great movie to put in whenever you want answers to all of the hard questions about love or when you just feel like ""vacating"" your life for a while.

","First of all I would like to say something to Nancy Meyers, allow me: your are the goddess of the comedy/romance genre, your movies has that very particular romantic feeling that makes me want to take of this earth and fly away to be with the characters of your movies.<br/><br/>The story of The Holiday looks like a fairy tale, love failures and home exchanging at the same time, it is a serendipity, then comes the unpredictable; the unseen love in the most unexpected sweetest way, imagine two lovers falling in love quickly and madly, but they are facing a separation, there is no need to scream and cry, all they need is a little bit of sense, reasonably they decided to meet soon or stay together for the sake of their newly born love, that is exactly what happened in the movie, and that is exactly what I loved about it.<br/><br/>About the acting a liked Kate Winslet, she was so beautiful and painfully funny, Jude was so handsome and Cameron was so sexy, but the surprise package was Jack Black, he proved me that he is a really good actor, and the presence of Eli Wallach; which I think was a brilliant idea; was a very refreshing thing, by the way he is still in a good shape.<br/><br/>Like I said it looks like a very impossible fairy tale, but still sweet like no other and funny as hell, really good stuff."
"elizabethcook924","6","2","4","1 October 2007"," Jack Black just can't pull of being a love interest
","Jack Black does have one very nice moment in The Holiday -- it is very early in the opening scenes when he's at his keyboard and glances up at the camera -- his hair is fluffy and he looks wistful and vulnerable and altogether adorable, and for a minute you believe he just might pull it off. But then comes the rest of the movie. No matter how hard he tries, he has absolutely no chemistry with Kate Winslet -- what's with all of those pecks on her face, anyway?? I found him to be totally unbelievable as a love interest for her. Too bad, because she really deserved one after dumping that daft twit she had pined after for three years... I think that Jack is much better being his loud, raunchy, uproarious self and leaving the loving to Jude Law."
"gtsuth69","10","2","4","8 June 2007"," Great feel good movie!
","I'm not into mooshy chick flicks, I find them predictable and so, so frustrating and very boring. But the Holiday was extremely different, it wasn't complicated or tedious, it was just a nice movie. I was in the middle of exams when I watched it and it was the perfect remedy for a bit of the old stress. The acting I thought was great, Kate Winslet did a perfect job of her character and Jude Law was surprisingly good as well, even Cameran Diaz was great (a bit of a shock as well) and Jack Black was once again a very satisfying character.<br/><br/>If you like movies like Love Actually, Notting Hill or My Best Friends Wedding then this is just for you.<br/><br/>Don't think about it too hard though and you will really enjoy it.<br/><br/>Extremely satisfying feel good movie of the year.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up."
"lasttimeisaw","6","2","4","5 April 2007"," The Holiday - Just a romantic dream
","When wrinkles are crawling on Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet's canthuses and Jude Law's hair is going to be like ""mediterranean sea"", it all proves that I'm not used to the Hollywood's romantic comedies anymore. Maybe because I'm reaching an age that can have some immunity to these cliché love story.<br/><br/>This movie has a dream cast, although I think Kate and Jack are not quite match, Kate is goddess but Jack is always a typical clown in despite of he is quite charming in this film. But anyway his part is not that big so I can endure it.<br/><br/>Still this is a typical Nancy Meyers's movie, I love ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""What Women Want"", but this one is not as good as these two. The sparkle between main roles are not that amazing, and the plot line is all Nancy's wishful thinking, maybe romantic but no resonance here. Just for a holiday reason.<br/><br/>Two women's exchange of their apartment, to taste different lifestyle and leave all the trouble behind. Great idea, I often dream about that. And meet some different persons there, have some fun, then turn back to the normal track, face the trouble and maybe it will not be trouble anymore.<br/><br/>Kate and Cameron are very suitable for their roles, and it's a new attempt for Kate because she has little experience in this genre, she did a decent job, a lovable ""Bridget Jones"", but far from excellent, she needs more practice. As for Cameron, she is on her way down now, losing her star-power day by day, the once highest-paid actress, does need a strong film to prove her ability, but not by this one. Her next project is Shrek 3 and no other new films. Quite an embarrassment for her.<br/><br/>Love the cameo of Dustin Hoffman and Lindsay Lohan + James Franco's imaginary movie trailer, interesting!"
"asana","8","2","4","18 March 2007"," Career Women and Love Exlored Well
","With ""The Holiday 2006"" I got several movies in one. The studio bosses during the 40s would have had the power to bring in a re-writer, but present-day writer/director Nancy Meyers, who has literally grossed billions world-wide, seems to have total control over her script. This comment should not imply that I found fault with the story-telling. <br/><br/>I found this story of tremendously successful media professionals, who's live choices and actions had deprived them of true love, not only worthwhile to watch, but it gave me an additional inside of how women think and how they react. I's wonderful to have a woman's perspective of men to tell a story of their desires, love and commitment. This kind of movie is as needed as a woman presidents. You must have discerned by now that I believe that men and women are two different sub-species and that it has been for too long only men's privilege to describe and formate the world in which we all live together.<br/><br/>""The Holiday,"" although it's very name is geared towards revenues, and there are a number of name-sake moviessometimes two in one yearmade for the Christmas business, it is one of the better romantic comedy dramas and is a pleasure to watch on the big screen as well as on the little ones in airplanes and as ""home entertainment."" It has inter-personal and emotional dimensions that sets it far above the average fair, such as, let's say, ""You, Me and Dupree.""<br/><br/>Nancy Meyers certainly created characters that I ""understand"" where they are coming from, because I have experienced and acted quite similarly in my life, and although I believe I have no love issues right now, my tear ducts got a workout. Interestingly, Amanda (Cameron Diaz) had been unable to cry since she was a teenager when her parents broke up, and she could not commit to the man she unexpectedly or subconsciously attracted until she actually cried during her ""holiday"" while wanting to use a getaway from the emotional shards of a marriage with a philandering husband. The script tells us that she was married to her work and that sex with her husband was not important to heruntil now.<br/><br/>Another story within this continent-hopping impulse is that of a wedding reporter with her unlikely own office at London's ""Daily Telegraph."" Iris (Kate Winslet) who had falling in love with a fellow reporter three years ago and allowed that he did not reciprocate and use her for his ego, but not for true love.<br/><br/>Both ladies were shown as needy to get away from their heartbreaks and somehow got the idea to search the Internet for a house-swapping site at the same time and found the ideal partner. Iris changed her cute and quaint lonely Surrey (about 40 min. south-west of London) country cottage a la Beatrix Potter; with a Bentwood, California, mansion with maid, gardener, Olympic-size pool, and whose set alone is said to have cost a million dollars. The cultural clichés could have been endlessly explored, but Nancy Meyers centering in a few plausible ones to move her character development along.<br/><br/>Yet another movie within this holiday story is that of a screen writer Arthur of successful 40s movies played by the great character actor Eli Wallach, now 91 years. Obviously, Mrs. Meyers shares the love of inspiring and well-written movie scripts, and which Iris is turned on to by Arthur to be view on Amanda's wide and flat-screen home movie center. This alone is a worthy movie within the movie, the kind of material that actually would make a great feature film.<br/><br/>While Iris and Amanda are now in totally different environments and coping with cultural differences, new men appear, and their carefulness, fears, self-consciousness and damaged pasts are wonderfully described and interwoven with nearly flawless storytelling. Both, the charming Cameron Diaz and makeup-less Kate Winslet create their characters with great care and detail. Graham (Jude Law), Iris' brother who stumbles into Amanda's life, is simply WYSIWYG-natural and endearing. Personally, I have always had a non-response to actor Jack Black (who is staged here to become Iris' new love interest), because he seems to have not found himself to give his characters individuality. No matter what Mr. Black does, it looks the same to me. And it is not a question of range, it might just be his face and physique, or the amount of brainless roles that he has played. In other words, he was miscast as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>Unlike some voices I have heard, I find both women's relative openness to holiday-quick, new affairs very plausible, even necessary, and the movie is deep enough to share some of the reasons for this. There is much character-revealing dialog offered, particularly Cameron and Jude are offered ample opportunities to make their audience understand where they are coming from, why they are acting the way they are, and where they can go... together.<br/><br/>If you want to lighten up your personal emotional baggage, set your life in perspective, here is movie that might just do that for you. Give it a try. I was enchanted by characters, acting and setting alike."
"EUyeshima","5","2","4","17 March 2007"," Three Out of Four Stars Charm in an Overlong, Formulaic Comedy That Gets It Right Half the Time
","After about 45 minutes of overdone laborious set-up, at least half of this overlong, dual-track 2006 romantic comedy takes flight, while the other half remains stubbornly contrived. More problems occur when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.<br/><br/>Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.<br/><br/>The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two story lines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.<br/><br/>Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like ""Spider-Man 3""."

","The casting director for the holiday must be very happy with themselves as 'the holiday' has a cast that has the widest demographic appeal. No matter your age or gender you'll find someone from the four main stars to watch. The smart move was adding Jack Black to the cast because it could have been written-off by the male population as a 'chick flick'.<br/><br/>For parts of the film you have to suspend some realities but aside from this the storyline is both interesting and not too sickly sweet.<br/><br/>'The holiday' is an unchallenging, easy-to-watch, romantic comedy and I would recommend to most people.

","""The Holiday"" is a typical chick flick. It has all the ingredients you need: a really charming story, two really good and matching on-screen couples, some really funny and witty dialogues and moments. I thought the Kate Winslet-Jack Black story was really engaging, but the Cameron Diaz-Jude Law story was great as well. I would never have guessed that he had two girls. As everybody else, even Amanda, I was convinced that he was a casanova, having one girl after another. That was really surprising.

The best thing I loved about this movie is the depth of plot. Each character has their own story. It focuses not on what they feel but why they feel this way, why they do the things they do.<br/><br/>Kate displays great acting in her role and makes you feel both depressed and amused at her character.

"vinny_007","9","2","4","20 January 2007"," A must see for those who know how unrequited love feels
","I have never posted a comment or review of a film before, but this was worthy of one. Firstly, from the outset, the detail of the plot revolving around the people within the media industry makes you wonder whether ironically the film will live up to these high standards. By all means it does, and the soundtrack is significantly good. Hans Zimmer's 'Maestro' and Imogen Heap's 'Let Go' are especially well-placed. As for the film itself, it is very well written and the tenderness and approach it takes when dealing with depressing issues is heart-warming and insightful. Jude Law's portrayal as Graham is amazingly well-acted, and his experienced suppression of detail both in terms of the film and his acting to suit the role makes him very personable and adds depth to his character. This is the general ambiance of the film; actors who are not trying to provide an Oscar nomination performance, but trying to portray roles that millions of us understand and can relate to. Nancy Meyers chose the right actors for her film- Kate Winslet is adorable as Iris, Diaz is 'comfortable' as Amanda (whilst the chemistry between her and Jude is great) and Jack Black as Miles the music composer adds the comic touch necessary to lighten the tone of the film. For those who know what losing someone feels like, or has ever experienced unrequited love, this is a must see. The dimensions of the film are such that it does not try to teach us a grand lesson; just provide us with a refreshing outlook as to how life can progress from the choices you make, and fate itself. It is a little 'idyllic' (as Diaz states at one point in the film about Winslet's cottage house), but is a film many of us will relate to- and make us not feel embarrassed about out feelings. For those who generally can't relate to the issues I have discussed or the film deals with, then it is worth watching simply to understand the perspective of others. I gave the film a '9' because it had many other great films to contend with in 2006, but it surely is top five for me."

I don't think I even blinked during this exalting 2 hours and 18 minutes of laughter, crying and screaming (oh yes, I was literally screaming).

"beyondthegalaxy","7","2","4","4 January 2007"," The Holiday
","A story that would probably never actually happen unless you lived a fairytale life, idealistic locations perfectly capturing the little country house in England and the mansion in L.A. complete with swimming pool, and an ending you could predict within the first twenty minutes...usually I would not have chosen to see this, however there are times when you want to watch something that is heart warming, makes you smile, shows Christmas as you imagine it to be (the miserable rain that now characterizes England replaced with the perfect crisp winter's day complete with snow), is too idyllic to be true, romantic, funny and easy to watch. This is exactly what ""The Holiday"" offers and is very successful in delivering.<br/><br/>The highlights for me of this film were being surprised by Jack Black playing a character completely unlike what I expected, when your preconceptions of him come from seeing Tenacious D and films like School of Rock and Shallow Hal to see him playing quite a sweet, calm yet funny character made a change, and you fell in love with his character almost as much as Jude Law's.<br/><br/>There's no need to go into details on this film as it is exactly what you expect. Four well known actors, a cheesy, clichéd story a predictable, unoriginal ending. If you're not into chick flicks then this probably isn't for you. However sometimes films like ""The Holiday"" are exactly what you want to watch, one of those films that makes you warm inside and go away smiling, perfect."

So many women have been in her position. In love with a jerk who you know is no good for you. <br/><br/>Nancy Meyer wrote this film with the actual actors in mind to play the characters.

The screenplay and direction alone deserve Oscar nominations. There's real feeling about the complexity of relationships here whilst at the same time it never falls into the trap of being too sentimental or overblown. Indeed it's also infused with a good dollop of humour. Will make you think seriously about your own relationship(s). Cameron Diaz is a revelation as is Kate Winslet and Jude Law. I also enjoyed very much the links to the film industry which had the effect of making the film slightly introspective and yet celebratory at the same time.

Jack Black was funny but not too over the top funny and that made the movie really good. It is a typical romantic comedy, cheesy at some points, predictable and some points but that is what makes a romantic comedy what it is. I loved the little quirks and habits they gave the characters it made them more real and easier to relate to.

","Great movie and really touching in parts! Kate Winslet and particularly Jude Law play their parts beautifully as you can really feel Kate's pain and Jude's struggles in parts. You know how you can watch someone do something so completely wrong to the point that you feel almost as awkward/embarrassed as they must feel? There are a few scenes where Kate plays her part so well that you're just like ""No! Stop! Go back! You're headed for a train wreck!"" and then you get that queasiness as you know she's headed for disaster. Jude Law's character is so well played that at one point my husband looked over at me and laughed ""I don't know about you, but he's charming the socks off me"" haha!<br/><br/>I did find it a bit hard to relate to Cameron Diaz and Jack Black's characters. Cameron Diaz plays the same tired part she always does - the spoiled, ditzy, ""every man wants me"" party girl type (can we say Charlie's Angels, Sweetest Thing, Something About Mary, In Her Shoes, My Best Friend's Wedding?), and although I love Jack Black, he really doesn't get the opportunity to do much with his character.

","The Holiday has many levels -- humor, character development, relationships, fun, and meaning. I enjoyed every minute of it. I think it is as good (or even better) as the classic romantic comedies such as ""You've Got Mail"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle."" It resonates on more than one level of entertainment for a romantic comedy-- it's fun, yet it has meaning and character development, a good story, well done. Kate Winslet's character was thoroughly likable. Her performance had warmth and personality-- a genuineness that engages the viewer and gives the film it's depth. Jack Black surprised me -- he matched Kate in being likable, genuine. And Jude Law nailed it on everything he was supposed to be-- he was sexy and more. I would have cast a different person in Cameron Diaz's role. Other than that-- great to watch. The Holiday delivers two romantic comedies wrapped into one."

","This is a wonderful ""feel good"" movie. It is from the same person who did ""Somethings Gotta Give"" which is one of my other favorites. This movie will appeal to all ages and can be seen as a family movie or with a date. Just delightful! I thought that Kate Winslet gave a very touching performance and Eli Wallach was wonderful. The homes that the girls stay in are both equally beautiful and really fun to explore with them as they check things out. Both Jack Black and Jude Law did a great job. Cameron Diaz was good as well, although I felt that her character lacked a bit of warmth, but overall, she was fine. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to leave a theaters feeling uplifted and inspired."

There are also simply marvelous phrases that truly show you that you are worth while. Excellent writing.

I have never been a huge fan of Jack Black or Cameron Diaz, but they both showed potential in this film. This is a truly fantastic tale of love finding you even when you were trying to get away from it. It was not completely unrealistic, it was tearjerking and just lovely.

Everyone did a great job! I especially liked Jack Blacks character. He was a lot of fun to watch. Cameron,Kate and Jude did a great job as well. I laughed and cried and could relate to the story as well. Movies are meant to be an escape from reality, my home away from home and I was ""transported"" as well as one person on this board put it. PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE and DON'T LISTEN to all of those people that hated it. I would compare it to ""Love Actually"" that came out a few years ago.

I'd much rather go to the movies to get a warm fuzzy feeling and maybe a little misty-eyed at points and get what my husband calls ""that silly grin"" on my face than to see a bunch of explosions or cars doing impossible things in heavy traffic. So far, I've loved all of Nancy Meyers' movies that I've seen. Thank God someone makes movies for the public and not just to please the critics. Seems like I never agree with them anyway. Some of the movies they LOVE (like ""Lost in Translation"" for one) were, I thought, a total waste of time and money -- while the movies I love and think I might by the DVD (for example ""Second-Hand Lions"") they hate. Maybe it's generational. Anyway, to all the people involved in ""The Holiday"" -- THANK YOU! Keep up the good work!"

In L.A. a promo expert named Amanda(Cameron Diaz) is having it just has bad when her live in boyfriend named Ethan(Edward Burns) has been cheating on her.

","The Holiday is an entertaining romantic comedy. It's about four affluent thirtysomethings who have been unlucky in love. The characters are charming and likable. It could have been made in the 1930s but the best comedies in those days had sharper dialog, better acting and a little more polish.<br/><br/>Iris (Kate Winslet) is a reporter working for a London newspaper. She is in love with a fellow journalist (Rufus Sewell) and has conducted and on-off relationship. When Jasper announces his engagement to someone else she realizes she has been used. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a successful, workaholic movie-trailer producer who lives in LA. She discovers that her live-in lover (Edward Burns) has been unfaithful and she promptly kicks him out of the house. Iris and Amanda, who have never met, decide they need a change of country and exchange homes over Christmas. <br/><br/>Iris moves into Amanda's luxurious mansion in LA as Amanda occupies Iris's tiny cottage in snowy England. Iris falls for Hollywood composer Miles (Jack Black). Amanda has a relationship with Iris's book editor brother Graham (Jude Law).

"whocanfind","7","2","4","8 December 2006"," Adorable Movie!!
","I'm a mom of two and I decided to get out of the house while my husband watched the kids and go and treat myself to a movie. Having never seen the preview for ""The Holiday"", I paid for my ticket, got some popcorn and sat down. The movie came on, I laughed, had my ""awwwwwwwww that's so sweet"" moments, kinda got teary, and empathized with Kate Winslets character so much that I wanted to throw something at her crush guy in the film. When the movie was over, I felt good. Money well spent on a delightful movie. Also, it must be said that Jude Law and Cameron Diaz are so beautiful on screen. I hope to see them do more movies together.<br/><br/>My only dislikes were some of the scenes felt over dramatized, and unreal (which I'm starting to think that it was purposeful), and the movie felt a bit long. But overall this is a great movie. Made me definitely want to plan a trip to London and stay in a cozy little house for two weeks. Well, almost."
"brad-kruse","7","2","4","8 December 2006"," Fun
","The Holiday has a good feeling about it. Based on the Christmas holidays, it isn't exactly about Christmas. The two girls have failed romances, Cameron gets a character with little moral substance, basically promiscuous. Kate on the other hand shows a bit more character.<br/><br/>Kate's relationship with Jack Black is greatly overshadowed by her 'love affair' with the fascinating older man next door (to her L.A. home exchange partner's house). Where Kate grows by reaching out to touch and enable the old man, Cameron discovers her impetuous 'I promise you'll never see me again' partner has children. And comes to terms with the fact that she never considered or made children a part of her life.<br/><br/>Jack Black has a problem part. His entanglement with Kate is low key, develops slowly, and it isn't clear why there is actually a connection other than the script wants to claim both girls find love. Played low key, this may be the best performance I have seen from Black. It is the part that seems almost after the fact and poorly thought out.<br/><br/>There are no great moments in this picture, no chase scenes (maybe Cameron running down the lane because the cab is too slow?). Kate and Jack both face selfish previous lovers, and the engaging old neighbor faces a fear of ridicule for growing old.<br/><br/>We do see a clear distinction between a remote English cottage and an L.A. mansion. And we learn there are wonderful people behind the hedge in both settings. I will be seeing this one again."

"blrnani","6","0","0","24 May 2020"," Not a great movie, BUT
","It delivers exactly what it promises, a film for the victims of unrequited love - and who, honestly, has never been there? the message is, get out of your rut and who knows, maybe, just maybe, you will find what you are looking for. Because many people move in circles that are just made for that sort of frustration, but there are many others where you can relate to people on a normal basis (remember Notting Hill?).
The process is set up quite quickly and evolves as one might expect, but what's wrong with that, especially in the sort of seasonal fare that is meant to make us feel cozy and snug?
It is perhaps a sad reflection of our times that the film has been criticised not only for what it is but also what it's not, revealing much determination to be cruel and vile.
Yes, it's predictable, which is the default position for this genre - and tell me how many films are not; Parasite wasn't as good as the moving Shoplifters, but won the Oscar for being full of surprises.
No, it's not 'clever', but it's quite intelligent enough. Leave 'clever' to the thriller genre where it's most appropriate.
This film gives one a warm, sympathetic feeling, and plenty of laughs along the way, many provided by Eli Wallach, in a superb performance that at 90 years of age had the director keep telling him to slow down. That along is worth the price of a ticket or DVD (yes, I'm old-fashioned that way :)"
"bthrock","3","0","0","13 May 2020"," Would be better with the sound off
","I'm serious. The sets are gorgeous, the cast is attractive, but the dialogue is maddening and the plot defies reality in ways that are brazen even for a rom-com. It is a given that everyone has unlimited amounts of money AND no time commitments. Kate Winslet has a relatively low-level newsroom job, yet she can impulsively get leave time covering both Christmas and New Year's, with no advance notice. She commutes from a spot so distant that there seem to be no two-story buildings within 10 miles. And she manages to get back and forth even though route involves a mile-long stretch of road that is deemed impassable by someone who drives cars for a living.<br/><br/>The most insulting offense accompanies the scene setting up the home exchange. There are numerous shots of people typing text onto computers or reading text on phones - text like ""vacation ideas"" or ""is tomorrow too soon?"" And while the screen is showing us nothing but this text, the director chooses to help us by having both characters be the kind of person who pronounces every word out loud as she types or reads it. Viewing with the sound off preserves almost all the enjoyable aspects of the movie while eliminating many of the eye-rolling components."

","The film ""The Holiday"" 2006. Romantic comedy. And although the original name of the picture is translated as ""Holiday"", I am even grateful to the Russian distributors for changing the name, since ""Vacation by exchange"" more accurately reveals the essence of the picture. You know, after my illness, I come across, if not excellent, then at least average pictures, which I am extremely happy about. Maybe that's why I've become overly sentimental in recent months (although not, I have always been that way!), Or maybe the thing is different who knows. In any case, I would like to devote this review to the disgusting weather that has raged in recent weeks in the central zone of Russia, but I won't, because now the sun is shining outside the window, announcing the world about the descent of the Holy Fire in the holy city of Jerusalem ... Wow, where did I go, humbly apologize, because you wanted to read the review, and here I load you with lyrics. However, be patient a little more. History - the first time I looked at this picture, when she arrived at our Soyuz store along with the next delivery, was I thinking of watching the whole shift or not? Is it worth it? As a result, I looked, but the picture did not cause strong enthusiasm then, it was two thousand and thirteenth year, the eve of Catholic Christmas. Now I decided to review and decide for myself completely - was I the first time mistaken or not? Was my conclusion too hasty? Revised - and the picture is still good, though I noticed some flaws that slipped away for the first time. And here is my brief opinion - two love stories, old as the world. And now we turn on the regime of picky and cynical cattle, which will find fault with every pillar, describing both the pros and cons of this romantic comedy. The preface is over. Let's start!
So, the pros:
1. Atmosphere - here my memories let me down, because it seemed to me that there is a strong Christmas atmosphere, but there's not so much of it here, damn it, even in the film ""Real Love"", ""Serendipity"" or the recent ""Last Christmas"" of this atmosphere is much more. Here she hangs out somewhere in the background, reminding herself only occasionally. Strong is getting closer to the end. But it is precisely the romantic atmosphere that is strong here, with this, I think, no one will argue. The whole environment works for her: scenery, music, love itself is in the air, love is completely saturated with love, love rules everything here!
2. The story told - two girls who are unlucky in love decided to exchange houses in order to unwind from their worries and get out of the usual environment. One rich affiliate advertiser from Los Angeles goes to a remote English village, and an English journalist goes to a luxurious and spacious home in Los Angeles, where they have to spend unforgettable two weeks that will change their life forever. At first, the main characters (yes, there are two lines) didn't like me much, but gradually I didn't care what was happening on the screen. It was interesting to watch both lines, because both girls were literally in a different world, it was rather funny to watch their reaction. If my heart did not belong to the romantic comedy ""Last Christmas"", then the laurels of the best representative of this genre would be occupied precisely by ""Vacation in exchange"". What to do - love stories are not universal, only your feelings decide here. It is impossible to objectively evaluate. The local love line turned out to be excellent, I don't argue with that, but it didn't catch me as much as ""Last Christmas"". For the excellent story told, praise Nancy Myers, who was not only the director, but also the screenwriter of this picture!
3. Music - for which the great and terrible Hans Zimmer himself was responsible. He wrote great music, which creates the right mood in the soul of the viewer and pacifies that, at least, it happened to me. Romantic chords on the background of rapidly changing frames do not allow the viewer to break away from the screen for a second. The picture also sounds famous melodies and songs. Even George Michael's ""Last Christmas"" song sounds in the background at the beginning of the picture, which thrilled me since I listen to it for the third month in a row, thanks to the same picture ""Christmas for Two"". I think it's not even special music lovers who recognize many famous compositions that sound here. I respect Hans, respect!
So cons:
1. Voiceover - I know that it sounds funny and adds humor, but when you start to realize it, you understand how it is not needed here. All the most important things we get on the screen through dialogue, acting and so on. Even the most stupid person will guess the emotions of the heroes.
2. Humor - I won't conceal, when I watched, I wanted to sincerely neighing from embarrassing situations, funny behavior and other things, but instead I only managed to smile throughout the whole picture and laugh once. Maybe I wanted too much from the picture, but a slight disappointment remained.
And yet, I forgot to mention that this picture attracted me to the present also with the famous cast, to which we are now moving on.
A little about the main characters:
1. Iris performed by Kate Winslet is an English journalist, unrequitedly in love with her colleague, after shocking news, exchanged houses with a girl in misfortune, and ended up in the world of Hollywood, where the movie rules everything. The sentimental heroine of the beautiful Kate at first did not cause me any feelings, but the acting and well-written dialogues made me change my mind. Kate is smart!
2. Miles performed by Jack Black - a colleague of Amanda (Cameron Diaz), recording music for the movie. An avid movie fan (well, just like me) and just a cute and charming guy with a good heart. Always glad to see old Jack on the big screen!
3. Amanda performed by Cameron Diaz - an advertiser from Los Angeles, who is also unlucky in love. A little freaking, a little tear, which made me laugh at one act. Here Cameron is forced to scold a little - it's too painful for her to replay here, too much. Sometimes I wanted to close my face from what is happening on the screen. And I understand that this is due to the context, but it remains a Spanish shame anyway. And the rest - well done Cameron!
4. Graham performed by Judah Law - Amanda's neighbor in the village, the cutest and most charming hero and my favorite in this picture. The handsome Jude here is still so young and so sentimental, well, and his hero is certainly not as simple as it seems at first glance, and the scenario turn with him was not bad, you can't argue with that. Jude! You're doing fine!
And there is no vulgarity, even bed scenes were avoided - which is a rarity for this genre. My respect!
Forgive my sentimentality, but the picture is to blame. She is to blame! Only she! Honestly! She made me write all this!
As a result, we have an excellent romantic comedy about the search for true love with an excellent story, wonderful music, an excellent romantic atmosphere, with unpretentious humor and famous cast, and of course their excellent game!"

","What can you say about a movie where an adorable little girl looks Cameron Diaz up and down and says very gravely, in a posh English accent, ""You look like one of my Barbies."" In my opinion this is Nancy Meyers's best piece of work. She gets terrific performances from all four romantic leads, the two little girls, and Eli Wallach as a Jewish fairy godmother. Diaz and Law seem like they should obviously fall into bed together. You have to suspend a bit of disbelief at the Winslett-Black couple, but Meyers does a superb job of bringing Winslett plausibly down to Black's level, both in the writing of the character and in physical appearance. Everybody who belongs together gets together, after overcoming obstacles that are entirely within themselves. And, as usual in a Nancy Meyers movie, the interiors are gorgeous."
"erearchetek","10","0","0","24 February 2020"," This goes next to 'The Princess Bride' on my shelf. This is a CLASSIC.
","Feelgood movies that aren't painfully saccharine are extremely rare. This film gets it exactly right.<br/><br/>It is almost jarring in its innocence. One can't help but fall in love with every single person on the screen, including and especially the 80+ year old Hollywood veteran character.<br/><br/>Everything and everyone in this movie moves like music. I don't think this is accidental as a lot of the movie deals with film composing and scoring, and the score here is gorgeous. It is definitely overblown, but it's done intentionally to make you really swell up in those moments.<br/><br/>I could ramble about this movie for hours. It makes me cry multiple times each viewing and I grow fonder of it every time.<br/><br/>This is a film I will share with my kids someday."
"geoffreyspears","10","0","0","26 January 2020"," Great breakup/loss-coping movie that's aging very gracefully
","I'd watched this film several times over the years - usually around Christmas - and always enjoyed it. Nancy Meyers usually makes amusing, nicely-written and well-directed, character-driven films with contemporary adult dialog and this one is certainly no exception. The stories of the two couples move smoothly in parallel with one another in this tightly written and well-acted movie and when combined with the very likable and relatable cast of characters, you easily find yourself quickly invested in and rooting for all of the protagonists.<br/><br/>But, it wasn't until this past week when I lost my best friend of the past 12 years that I learned how nice this film is as a coping tool. I was looking for a diversion to keep my mind off an unpleasant reality and since movies have always offered us that sort of escape, a movie playing in the background of my day seemed like the best solution. This one immediately came to mind since Christmas was only a month ago and the story lines are all about loss and, more importantly recovery - but with a lighter, comedic touch. The music and score are also really enjoyable since the blend of classic Christmas songs and Hans Zimmer's original instrumentals perfectly compliment the mood and promote the flow and transitions of the films many enjoyable scenes.<br/><br/>I've had the movie playing on a continuous loop in my living room while I've attempted to work and keep my mind from turning to darker thoughts in the study. I've often moved into the other room when my favorite scenes are about to be shown and nearly as often found myself staying far longer than intended. It's probably looped more than two dozen times by now (it's actually playing right now) and I have to admit being surprised that I've not become tired of the repetition. It's a rare film that is part 2006-modern rom-com and part homage to early Hollywood romantic comedies staring actors like Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. It manages to be smart and adult without being heavy-handed as it approaches the themes of relationship endings and new beginnings. The target audience seems to be people around the same ages as the main characters (mostly mid 30's), but it also manages to appeal to younger audiences as well even though it doesn't resort to raunchy, risque or crude jokes or sight gags like rom-coms from directors like Judd Apatow and so many others like him in the genre today.<br/><br/>The year after this film was released, I watched it with my friend when she and I were a couple - I never imagined I'd be watching/listening to it as a way to keep my spirits up while slowly grieving her loss, but it has honestly been a welcome and effective diversion. The playful romantic banter, onscreen chemistry and genuinely fun soundtrack and score combine with quite a few pleasant past associations with the film to help me feel less alone and sad.<br/><br/>If this film can help ease the mind of someone who's just lost their best friend, imagine how entertaining it would be if the most pressing matter on your mind is what movie to watch to entertain yourself after dinner."

","The Holiday is kind of one of the best films I've ever watched. Of course the film is kind of a drama, and seems to be some sort of boring film, but if you carefully watch it, you'll find it's not entirely boring. The plot is so simple and normal or ordinary, but it's totally fun Movie. I really love it because it makes you happy because of it's happy ending.<br/><br/>I must admit that exchanging house, cars, everything is kind of crazy and I've never seen it in the real world. But just because it's rare, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It might exist in somewhere in this world, but it seems to me that that kind of actions is a bit weird and crazy if you're rich.<br/><br/>It has the spirit of Christmas, so, I'd say it's the best to watch in on Christmas day. Although it's kind of drama, but maybe the casts and crews are great, the film turned out to be highly enjoyable and it's kind of fun. To be honest, I feel really happy when I watched it.<br/><br/>To summarise, this film is very good to enjoy. I admit that I didn't have that much hope for this one, but after watching it, I realised that I was totally wrong. This film is a great film. Jude Law's performance really amazed me. He is one of the best actors of all time. Because this film is very good, I totally enjoyed and hence, it was totally worth watching."

","For a movie is the expression in your face at the end. I was smiling. Widely. I spent a couple of hours enjoying a nice story, good scenario and excellent acting. I feel obliged to underline the extreme pleasure I sensed seen Eli Wallach. I met him first as Tuco in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, having seen all his films, since. He was the cherry on the cake, in this movie, as usual! He is playing for the big guy, upstairs, since 2014!!!"

"bluehatproductions-1","5","3","9","2 December 2006"," Not enough of a good thing
","The Holiday is a love story, as it turns out, about 'tinseltown' as Eli Wallach's character fondly remembers it. Yet another movie made for those in the industry...not to say that's necessarily a bad thing. But holiday season rom-com it isn't. While it is, at times enjoyable, it wastes most of its 2-plus hour run time.<br/><br/>Definitely less inspired than Myers's last two efforts, the Jude/Cameron story line is contrived and saccharine. The dog upstages both actors. Not that the actors weren't trying (kudos to Mr. Napkinhead)...the dialogue and plot feel like Lifetime Movie material. Though the Trailer bit was a fun idea, but the timing was often poor. And that awkward soundtrack edit during one of their romps. Awful.<br/><br/>Jack's role is very underplayed (I knew you had restraint in ya, Jack), making it marvelous, however the final edit hardly gives him the screen time to warrant the marketing of his match with Kate. She spends the majority of her shots with Eli Wallach or the shadow of Rufus Sewell, who the entire time exudes a pompous detachment, perhaps loathing that Jack Black got the lead, while he plays the 'bad' guy.<br/><br/>Kate's talent is hardly required for the role, but she does her best to flesh out the thin role, lighting up the little moments that make it worth 8 bucks. Still, the script mostly calls for her to just act weepy- not much for an Oscar worthy actress to dig her heels into. The moments that pair her with Jack are by far the highlight of this muddled long film. (Eli's aged screenwriter is, I'm sure, the real inspiration for the film. Myers's little pat on the back to herself. And her love of the word 'gumption'.) In all there are a handful of good -if not great- moments, but they are way too few and far between. If fact, I could probably edit the film down to a 10 second clip of Kate & Jack reacting to the idea that may this time, love won't be unrequited.<br/><br/>They needn't worry. They are the thing to love about this film."
"vick79-556-121134","1","2","5","27 November 2016"," Painful
","Kate Winslet deserves much much better than Jack Black! He is fat, not remotely handsome, and boring. Kate is beautiful, funny, smart, talented, and shining on the screen. She shouldn't have played the second woman. The girlfriend. She is a leading lady. The movie is boring too, not funny, not smart, not entertaining. Not even related to Christmas, just shot at Christmas time. Judd Law is too good for Cameron Diaz too... Maybe, if Kate and Judd, and Jack and Cameron would make a couple, that would be better. Horrible, fake. Just got the feedback I need 10 lines when I actually wrote 11 lines. Not sure whats the issue IMDb... So added this text hopefully will accept."

Is does not matter when you watch this movie. Whether it is in the winter, or summer. This is a great movie to watch with your love ones.<br/><br/>Can somebody tell me a movie with house switches? Never heard of, so I think this 'lovestory' is one of a kind.<br/><br/>I have watched this movie more than 20 times for sure. Oh and I'm glad I did not forget the music. Because it is.. just.. Hans Zimmer. Perfect match!"
"jennymcdhill","10","2","5","20 October 2012"," Meaning, Music & Magic.
","I do not regularly write film reviews; I have probably not written a film review in years. This isn't because I haven't watch any good films. I have watched many classics over the last few years. This one in particular though is calling to me to write something about it. <br/><br/>In the past when I have written a film review or two, I don't think I was able to appreciate films in their proper way. Perhaps I hadn't cemented my values in my head back then.. Now, I know where I stand when I watch a film. I do not let anyone else's opinion of a film affect my enjoyment or lack-there-of and therefore my reception is not clouded. With this better appreciation, I now reflect and think that the old film reviews I may have written.. they may not have deserved the sentiment I wrote of. This film, however, this one without a doubt I will never look back on with less-than-true appreciation.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film has a soundtrack with, in my opinion, the most superior instrumental tracks. These transport you right into 'The Holiday'. Hans Zimmer deserves the many accolades he is regularly bestowed with. The music is crafted with care and plays like a thoughtful, whimsical, deep and real treat for those who listen and watch.<br/><br/>For me, it is the combination of the music and some superb scripting which can really hit someone, that makes this film the masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>-Arthur Abbott: ""I counted. Nine movies are opening today. I remember when nine movies would open in a month. Now a picture has to make a killing the first weekend or they're dead.This is supposed to be conducive to great work?"" ~Iris Simpkins: ""Arthur, have you always been this feisty?"" -Arthur Abbott: ""Well, I may have slowed down a little, but yes. You've gotta fight the fight, kid."" <br/><br/>Iris reflecting to Miles (on Jasper having been unfaithful): ""I understand feeling as small and as insignificant as humanly possible. How it can actually ache in places that you didn't know you had inside you.It doesn't matter how many new haircuts you get... or gyms you join... or how many glasses of chardonnay you drink with girlfriends. You still go to bed every night going over every detail.. and wonder what you did wrong or how you could have misunderstood. And how in the hell, for that brief moment... you could think that you were that happy? And sometimes you can even convince yourself that he'll see the light and show up at your door. And after all that...however long ""all that"" may be...you'll go somewhere new. And you'll meet people who make you feel worthwhile again. And little pieces of your soul will finally come back. And all that fuzzy stuff...those years of your life that you wasted... ..that will eventually begin to fade...""<br/><br/>-Arthur Abbott: ""Iris, in the movies we have leading ladies and we have the best friend.You, I can tell, are a leading lady. But for some reason, you're behaving like the best friend."" ~Iris: ""You're so right.You're supposed to be the leading lady of your own life, for God's sake."" <br/><br/>The scripting works so well because the characters are incredibly relatable. Iris Simpkins & Miles are particularly good examples I believe as through watching them, we explore misgivings and insecurity as they love those who aren't treating them right. They are such genuine people who can be obsessive and flawed whilst inspirational and very decent.<br/><br/>I do not have a particular attachment to Jack Black at all. I do not have disdain for his acting either. What I have watched is usually neither here nor there (Probably closer to indifference than like in most films..). This film however, this portrayal of composer, Miles... Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>The raw emotion of Kate Winslet as she plays cheated-on Iris Simpkins: This also stands out to me.<br/><br/>Arthur Abbott is also a stand-out character. Possibly my favourite- without even being one of the title-four.. He comes across as a true veteran actor who plays a key role in the film, and reminds us of the classy old characters that Hollywood presented us with in the times of Casablanca & Rear Window. He just exudes wisdom and goodness.<br/><br/>Overall, I review this meaningful film as one which distills hope and intellect, wit & frustration, sadness and sophistication. All to a soundtrack of beauty. With both magnificent meaning and marvellous music delivered to an audience... The result is magic.<br/><br/>Watch it, one and all. Men and women."
"mkkoch","3","2","5","13 December 2008"," Where was the director during the shooting of this film?
","I never winced at dialog so many times during a film in my life. ""The weather is officially crazy"" uttered to Kate's character by Jack Black's on leaving the Chanukkah party... eeeeeeew. C'mon - who talks like that? Those poor actors. And the mistakes in continuity, the sloppy editing - yikes! in one of the shots outside the restaurant Cameron and Jude's images are reversed; the mirror image makes them appear to be two different actors if only for a brief moment. <br/><br/>Four nice looking and interesting leads and attractive settings made me optimistic about The Holiday. But the cheesy, wince-worthy dialog, mistakes and loose direction spoiled it."

This movie deserves 5.5 stars and not its exaggerated 6.9 stars.<br/><br/>I knew this was a chick movie but I have watched this kind of movies before like the ones starring Cameron Diaz and I liked them; besides I like the work of Jack Black, but he plays a totally different character in here of what we are accustomed. ""The Holiday"" would have been much better if it had only focused in the relationship between the characters played by Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.<br/><br/>I think this movie is too long, this was not make to be a great movie, just an entertaining romantic comedy SO WHY THIS MOVIE HAS TO LAST 138 MINUTES , ""the holiday"" SHOULD HAVE LASTED 100 MINUTES AT THE MOST. <br/><br/>I know this movie has a good message, good characters and some good moments , but like I said before IT LAST TOO LONG."
"jehan21","1","2","5","14 March 2008"," For those who like their movies tasteless . . . .
","A picture paints a thousand words. And if I were to use pictures to describe this movie they would be too hideous for public viewing. And yet, so is this movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows the developments of two unimaginative clichés, Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) who are having problems with men. Amanda finds her partner is having an affair and has a tantrum that borders on a violent, neurotic episode and decides to get away. Iris, finds that the man she as been in love with is finally getting married to someone else and becomes very upset. She too decides to leave. The former lives in the US, the latter lives in England. After a fairly unlikely agreement reached online, they decide to swap houses for a while to stay away from the vicious influence of men. Never does the film seem to care about the fact that they bring about their own problems and no quantity of men could change that; but that may be a matter for one's own interpretation.<br/><br/>After this change of location, they begin to meet local men and the whole cliché becomes even more sickly sweet. Amanda meets Iris's brother, Graham (Jude Law), who arrives drunk late at night and still manages to be inordinately charming in a rather contrived, Hugh Grant kind of fashion. Iris meets Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) a retired director whose conversations are about the good old days of Hollywood movies. This seems ironic as this movie is as unashamedly dull and clichéd as they come. She eventually meets Miles (Jack Black) with whom the eventual romantic bond is formed. His performance is so tame and boring that you wonder what drugs they were feeding him.<br/><br/>In the end they all have to, to some degree, confront their inner demons and sort out their relationship issues in the most trite manner possible. The main problem with the film is that it is so excruciatingly oversentimental. These characters seem to have nothing better to do than wallow in self-pity for the papercuts that love dealt them.<br/><br/>The mushy centre is badly concealed by a mushy exterior. Clichés with a heaped tablespoon of banality."
"oguzkaram","9","2","5","26 December 2006"," On Holiday for an inner journey
","What you get from a movie depends on your moods; it is like music in a way. If you feel like ready for a journey into your own soul, ""Holiday"" is just fine to embark on. Good even for those finding it difficult to shed a single tear. Not only is it a romantic comedy, but also a drama that contains the former. A couple of weeks' cross-section in life that conveys messages to anyone from 7- to 77+ (no wonder such a wide range of audience rating), and from floor to ceiling! Smooth passages from one side of the plot to the other (and funny interferences), well-balanced characters in each one's context. Great acting from Diaz, Winslet and Law to Wallach, to the girlfriend of the not-to-be flight companion, and to Amanda's (Diaz) gardener, whose unconsidered silent wisdom (?) made the plot possible. Full credit goes to another silent, yet natural contribution by Mr. Dustin Hoffman himself. Intrigued? Know not more than two ladies (by Diaz and Winslet), e-swapping houses for a holiday, in mutual attempts to recover from heartbreaks... and ""just watch it"" (please read last three words in uppercase)."
"houndtang75","8","2","5","15 December 2006"," Cheesy, corny, predictable.....but I liked it!
","'The Holiday' has a script that must have practically written itself, there's absolutely nothing new here, and it is reminiscent of quite a few other films, particularly 'Love Actually'. However, it is most entertaining and surely that in itself is an achievement these days - it's the kind of film that could have been made in the 1940s. The cast is impeccably typecast, Cameron Diaz is looking a little haggard but Kate Winslet is luminous. There's also a sweet supporting turn from the spritely nonagenarian Eli Wallach (who will forever be Tuco in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'). Jude Law plays the part he almost always plays - incredibly handsome, really nice bloke - and Jack Black plays the part he almost always plays - cheeky but cuddly bloke. A nice film."
"fromlondonwithlove","6","2","5","14 December 2006"," Nice enough if you can suspend disbelief
","This was your average heartwarming Christmas rom com, written by an American, mostly set in a ridiculously unrealistic England, where it never snows in Surrey over Christmas (trust me, I live there) and no small ads writer for The Telegraph could afford a chocolate box cottage in Surrey, let alone a brand new mini...and two girls under six both have their own mobile phones, but, if you can push all of that to the back of your mind, you'll enjoy this well enough.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Jack Black actually surprised me by working as a couple. That was my main stumbling block before I saw the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by their convincing chemistry. Jude Law played his charming, womanising self, as usual, but this time he managed to do it with a heart, especially in his scenes with his adorable daughters. And, the relationship between Kate's character and the man playing Arthur was wonderful; their friendship provided the most heartwarming moments in the whole film, which is rather ironic, seeing as theirs was the only non romantic coupling.<br/><br/>The main parts that let the film down, however, were Cameron Diaz's painful, embarrassing over acting (the first scene, especially, is cringe-worthy) and making Jude Law's character a widower. A widower who never mentions his wife? Who doesn't mind playing the field even though his wife hasn't even been dead for two years? No pictures of his wife in his house? I felt making him a widower was completely unnecessary, because the plot didn't do anything with it; there could have been some genuinely moving scenes if that aspect of Jude Law's character had been explored, but it was glossed over, and that hit a bum note with me. He may as well just have been divorced.<br/><br/>This film is a nice, gentle, Christmassy film that will entertain you well enough and, if you're like me, make you shed a few tears despite the predictability. We all know they're going to get together in the end, that's no surprise. But, pathetic woman as I am, it still gets me every time. If only Cameron Diaz's role had been played by a more competent actress, then this film would probably have been a lot better. I wouldn't watch it again, but for a pleasant diversion on a weekday night, it served its purpose."

","Nancy Meyers tells a story with depth and warmth. I felt like I was on this adventure with these two women who chose to swap homes. The character development and acting of the four principles was spot on as expected. However, I must mention the acting of the two little girls as they stood out as charming and real. But of most recognition would be the tender side story about screen writer Arthur Abbott, played so endearingly by Eli Wallach. Something about Nany Meyer's writing that truly touches upon the strength, yet tenderness of the heart. The scenery is beautiful, the direction is superb, and the music supervision is great. This is truly a holiday treat for the entire family to attend. Heartwarming. A holiday gift to yourself."

Although the practicality of things working out so well and so fast in this film are unlikely in the real world, we accept it and move on to enjoy the story.<br/><br/>It is surprising and uplifting that the story contains more than just Kate-Jack and Cameron-Jude pairs. There is more to the cast and how they interact with each other which brings much more to the plot and the overall enjoyability of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie had me laughing constantly, crying occasionally, and feeling great all the way through.

","I watched ""The Holiday"" mostly because I am interested to know what Nancy Meyers wants to say in this new movie. I was impressed by her previous ""something's gotta give"". To be honest, this new movie doesn't super it, yet with my favorite young actors, it is totally worth watching.<br/><br/>Basically you can know everything about the movie by the trailer, yet the message from the writer was finally delivered by winslet, in my opinion. Cameron is lovely in the movie as usual, yet I love her ""in her shoes"" better. Jude is fine, but I didn't see anywhere that he can stand out. He just did well, but didn't surprise me. Jack black did much better than that I expected. What can I say? I don't like someone like him to appear in a romantic movie, yet I think it is him that makes this movie lovely, also Eli Wallach, he was great too.<br/><br/>But Nancy Meyers didn't solve the problem when romance meets the reality. I was expecting that she could develop more in the meaning of life and love, yet this one doesn't help at all. It's a fairy tale that you can't see its back coz it's such a fragile dream.<br/><br/>But anyway, if you want to just have a romantic dream, want to relax, or you always fall in love with wrong persons, go to watch this movie.

Lots of totally cringe-worthy scenes such as Diaz and Winslet's separate air-guitar scenes. The film TRIES to explore some deeper themes but by merely skimming the surface and expecting us to feel for the characters but this was not the case for me. I don't believe I am so cynical and jaded as to not be able to watch a good romantic escapist film such others that Diaz has put her name to in the past but this just took the cake for schmaltz.

","The Holiday, was a waste of two and a half hours and £8. The stories reminded me of many other genuinely funny rom coms. I thought I was watching Bridget Jones to start, then I recognised a bit of Notting Hill and ended with possibly Love, Actually. The writer has embarked on an interesting but entirely predictable story and poorly concocted romantic scenarios in a way that has little or no punch and looks like a debut screenplay.The director coaxed their extremely talented leading cast into a ""do your best with the script we have"", who did do their best i'm sure, but I've never seen a cast look uncomfortable, even in character, with what they are asked to perform. It was embarrassing to watch them , almost cringe worthy. I fully realise I was there to see a romantic comedy, romantic it was, to the point of being sickly, but a comedy it was not. Seeing the jokes come and go, me and the rest of the packed theatre were quiet through most of these ""funny moments"".

","THE HOLIDAY clocks in at 138 minutes and is as free of laughter or even giggles as it is free of non-cardboard characters. The author obviously has no real-life experiences to draw from, nor real-life friends to model her characters after. This movie is strictly Bad Creative Writing #101, with characters and situations drawn from awful magazine stories or plucked from thin air. Since nothing touches our sense of reality, nothing is there to involve the viewer, to make us laugh, cry, or care.<br/><br/>I like all of the 4 major players in this picture, I liked the scenery, and I liked the positive values portrayed. I wonder why the script included exactly one ""F"" word -- to no particular purpose except to provoke the Strong Language rating.<br/><br/>This picture wasn't a comedy. Comedies are funny.

","Contains Spoilers! I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Each of the four main leads I have enjoyed watching for years. And the previews looked amazing. But when you get right down to it, it's total schlock. The characters are cardboard, the story lines are filled with clichés, and the ending is predictable. There are more plot holes and NO WAY!!! moments in this film than Carter has liver pills.<br/><br/>We have Iris (Kate Winslet), a sweet English girl in love with a cad who has cheated on her with a co-worker of theirs, and then gotten engaged to said co-worker. Jasper (Rufus Sewell), the novelist object of Iris's affection is handsome, charming, and suave. He's also a two timing snake who can't bear to lose Iris despite the fact that he's engaged to another woman. When she hears of his engagement, Iris engages in a Sylvia Plath moment, when ba-bing! she gets an instant message from a newly single (and also cheated on) California businesswoman named Amanda who happens to find Iris's English country cottage on a homeswap website. Talk about being saved by the instant message! It seems Amanda has been in a bad relationship for a while, and finally ends it, and she wants to just chuck her life in Cali for a while and be all by her lonesome in another country to forget about her troubles. Her only prerequisite to swapping houses is that there are no men in the town that she is going to spend the Xmas holiday in.<br/><br/>Much to her surprise, it seems there is at least one man in that town-Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) who shows up on Iris's (now Amanda's) doorstep drunk as a skunk after a night of drinking at the pub. Naturally, he has to spend the night, and Amanda sees it as an opportunity to have meaningless sex with a stranger because she is sure she will never see him again. Isn't that what Eli Wallach's character Arthur would call ""meeting cute""? Law is great at playing the aloof commitment-phobe cads, and it seems like Graham is one of those. But alas he is not. He's on the fence about getting involved with Amanda because his life is complicated by Olivia and Sophie-his daughters. It turns out he is a widower with two cute as pie lasses and he's worried about turning their lives upside down by introducing a mommy figure into their lives. So, instead, he embarks on a relationship with a woman who has a full and complete life (sans Mr. Right) about 5,000 miles away from him. They try to hash out a way to see each other and maintain a long-distance relationship with him in London and her in LA, but she projects what the breakup would be like because she's a)turned cynical by the breakup of her parents and therefore unable to cry b)rebounding from a relationship that ended only the day before she slept with Graham and c)she's a realist who doesn't want to give up her life just to be with a man. Then he drops the bomb on her and tells her he loves her. She's stunned and can't say it back. It's okay though, because it's a romance and we know that all a woman's problems are solved by a sexy, handsome, and successful man who sews and buys his daughters tutus declaring his love in a British accent.<br/><br/>For her part, Iris is content to try and get over her broken heart by befriending Arthur, an elderly former screenwriter (Eli Wallach) and Miles (Jack Black), a film composer who she meets because he works with Ethan (Edward Burns), Amanda's ex-boyfriend. The homeswap happened so fast that Miles didn't know that a cute single girl would be living in the house. He is clearly attracted to Iris-even stopping to take something off her eyelash during a sudden Santa Ana wind-in front of his actress girlfriend, no less. He's involved with Maggie, but he only has eyes for Iris. Which is why when Maggie cheats on him, he has no problem hopping over to Iris, who is magically cured of her love for Jasper after he flies out to see her but is still engaged.<br/><br/>Despite the formulaic plot lines and sometimes nauseating dialogue they had to work with, the acting was good. Black and Winslet are delightful together. Law and Diaz have a ton of chemistry, which is why you root for them to stay together, at least for New Year's Eve. But did it have to take so long? The movie seemed like it would never end. But it did, and it left me disappointed. I give it 4 out of 10 stars."

","This one is known in Germany as ""Die Liebe kennt keine Ferien"" (Love does not know holidays) which even within the glorious tradition of mal-translations of German cinema is a true highlight. Now, Holiday is what is called a Romantic Comedy which basically means there are 2 people a boy and a girl that fall in love and marry at the end (well, they ""stay"" which each other these days). And in between, if it is any good, some funny things are said and done and we all feel happy. There is not too much wit in it because if there is it is called a screwball comedy and they do not make them any more. Here there are four instead of two. Two woman, who had suffered enough from the male of the species decide to swap houses. Cameron comes to a lovely English cottage and Kate to incredible L.A. This is really done exceptionally well. How they react to their new domicile. Of course a synonym for romantic comedy is predictability. And it does not come as a surprise that both fall in love with the leading men. Which of course, is nice and right. But when you think of it it is sort of sad. Cameron has all this wonderful books with her. And instead of reading them and enjoying a couple of quiet days she has to fall for Jude Law. Anyway. The story is very silly but lovely enough. And if Hugh Grant had played the part of Jude I probably would have really enjoyed it. Law is not really bad but who can care for a man who claims to be drunk and thus has to sleep at his sister's house when it is plain from his behavior that he could not have had more than half a pint? Kate is also okay the subplot with the old writer guy touching. Black totally unbelievable. But Cameron is just brilliant. She saves the movie. And why? Because she looks like Senta Berger (with just a touch of Meg Ryan). I never noticed before. Very nice."

","If you are not a romantic comedy person you will not like this film. It is corny and campy in all the right ways! There are a few plot twists that are not especially predictable, as well as some that are quite formulaic. It has a great cast, although I must say that Cameron Diaz is not the best actress. At times her style is over the top and just plain ridiculous. I think Sandra Bullock would have been better suited for the role of Amanda, despite the age difference between her and Jude Law, it really would not have been at all noticeable. I loved Eli Wallach as Arthur! His scenes with Kate Winslet are great. Jude Law, Jack Black, and Rufus Sewell are all terrific in their roles as the men in Amanda and Iris' lives. Ed Burns has a very small role in the film as Amanda's ex, but he is good for his part. I highly recommend this film to anybody who is trying to find a mindless feel-good flick to pass the time."

This movie is an amusing display of how unpredictably stupid and untrustworthy that men can be, and how a movie director will pass all the lines of sappiness to remind us of the magic of Christmas, and that anything can happen within two special weeks. The characters look and act like they belong out of commercials advertising fun vacations for happy families, but the movie does manage to tackle some real-life stuff that a lot of us struggle with, right before providing happy endings for all! Oh, how I would love to live in a rom-com..."

","I had strong recommendations on this movie from 2 friends, one of whom has totally opposite taste from me in everything, and the other of whom has the nearest taste in movies to me of anybody I have ever known. And I do tend to enjoy rom coms so I thought I would definitely like this. Have never liked Diaz but I love Kate Winslet, and Rufus Sewell was in it so that was the clincher.<br/><br/>There was one laugh-out-loud scene, but if you're going to see this flick and haven't watched the trailer yet, don't. It gives it away plus it's funnier in the movie. There is also a cute line by Jack Black as the unlikely romantic co-lead (and I'm not talking about that scene in the bar – ugh).<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to think this is a good movie to see during the holidays, and they watch it every year along with the actual Christmas movies, saying it's warm and family-themed, but I don't see it. I don't even remember it being very holiday-oriented.<br/><br/>It all just seemed too unlikely -- other than simply because ALL FOUR OF THEM were on the rebound -- that these people would fall in love with each other so quickly and easily.<br/><br/>What was so great about the Amanda character that someone would fall in love with her? She slept with him right away which is supposed to be a relationship killer. (Incidentally Diaz looked revoltingly skinny in the bathtub scene, as though her arms were badly Photoshopped thinner.) She seemed mostly pretty shallow. It is telling that she doesn't even seem to realize her neighbor is this old film legend, and it is never even mentioned in her phone calls with Iris. And in the end she was not really giving up anything to be with this man – he seemed to be pretty well off himself.<br/><br/>What was the point of making everyone so rich? Particularly Amanda -- obviously it was so important that the filmmakers spent a million just on the set of her house interior alone. It really made her seem like she didn't have too many problems! Or that even if she did, you could hardly feel sorry for her. At any rate, you could not identify with her.<br/><br/>Even the less fortunate Iris had an incredible quaint country cottage. A ""fairytale English cottage"" like that would probably be out of reach of most ordinary people.<br/><br/>Jude Law did not seem natural playing a sweet guy. I got the sense he had a disdain for the role (as well he should have).<br/><br/>James Franco and Lindsay Lohan are 8 years apart in age, yet he plays her father. That's just for a silly subplot, so I guess it doesn't bother me so much.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie that seemed believable and real was the story of the unhealthy relationship between Iris and her coworker. Though even that seemed far-fetched when he intended to continue it even as a newlywed.<br/><br/>I'm really trying hard to figure out why so many people like it, however I just don't think I can bring myself to watch it all again.<br/><br/>No screen magic going on here."

","I can understand why someone would like this film, but for me it is the antithesis of good. I would rather watch Battlefield Earth. Never have I ever seen a movie that made me want to murder myself (yes, I've seen Requiem for a Dream). <br/><br/>I can't stand these characters. What is Jack Black doing in this film? I think it's great that he's not typecast; however, his character is awkward and creepy. He has an underlying energy that just doesn't work with the material. Maybe if he were a serial killer, then this character would be believable. I didn't expect anything good from Cameron Diaz and my expectations were met. The End. Kate Winslet being in this film upsets me because I like and respect her as an actress. The only thing I remember about her character is that she is dorky or antisocial  or something like that. I guess she did a good job, but in the end it doesn't really matter. All of these characters are whiny and self-centered. Overall, I don't care about their problems because they're not presented as real problems. <br/><br/>I hate that this movie references other movies to validate itself. Maybe it didn't happen that often, but did enough to annoy me. It didn't even accomplish this in clever funny ways; they simply say ""(Insert name of film) is good."" Well then why am I watching this film? I think I'll watch the good movie. <br/><br/>For me, this film didn't properly handle the material it presents. The two main characters switch houses and both fall in love with men they otherwise would never meet because of the extreme distance. I didn't feel that there were any consequences for these people. Of course it's a comedy and I don't expect everything to be depressing, but I would have liked to have seen more a bit more conflict. I've been in this situation before; Skype sex is not all it's cracked up to be. <br/><br/>Don't take me too seriously. I have talked to many people who have enjoyed this film and there is a good chance that you will too. It's not going to change your life, but at least it's uplifting. For whatever reason, this movie managed to push all of my bad buttons."

Once in their new locations the two women find love and finally learn how to start living life.<br/><br/>I must say that the film overall is really quite good, but only small portions are great and some are just flat-out boring. I think this problem arose in the fact that the story essentially follows two completely different story lines, and one story line is really fun and entertaining, and the other is a lot weaker and is very unforgettable. Throughout majority of the film I found myself enjoying Kate Winslet's side of the film more than Cameron Diaz's side, and it all really came down to their separate story lines. Kate Winslet's story of befriending an old screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood and finding a love interest in Jack Black was more entertaining. Now don't get me wrong, the other story line has some good things about it, in particular Jude Law being Cameron Diaz's love interest, and Jude Law's children in the film are fairly cute and funny, but this story line ended up being very cheesy to me and a little too melodramatic as well. Overall the story was very hit-and-miss for me, but overall the film is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film is well written and well directed by Nancy Meyers, and the acting is really good, in particular Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach (who plays the old screenwriter). All of the other production values are good as well, it was definitely a well made film, if only it could have fixed its few problems within the story and maybe found a way to of beefed up the weaker side of the story the film would have been even more enjoyable, but because of that it is really only a decent film that is fun to watch every now and then.<br/><br/>A good 8 out of 10!"

Though, I think Kate and Jude surprisingly gave me some giggles and smiles whenever they appear on the screen so they succeeded in doing comedy which is something new for them.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" is more like two movies rolled into one.

The movie is conventional and unoriginal, yes, but it's the attitude and the characters we truly fall for on the screen, and Ms. Meyers seems to know a good full lot on how relationships work and the type of people who would relate, not to mention the kind of actors who would portray them. And, thank the heavens, there is no overly melodramatic scenes in this movie at all. None. What you see is what you get, and it's a decent romantic film that can cater to couples around the Christmas holiday.<br/><br/>What makes these couples strong in this film isn't just learning to overcome themselves, but their environment helps them do it. Scene-steelers like Graham's kids and Arthur, I find, created the glue to making the film stick together. Let them have the scenes we say, because the rest of the movie involves finding love and discovering that friendship that creates that relationship we all look for in the first place.

","""The Holiday""  B- How can a film that highlights so many great films of the past then sell out all its potential? Because it's one of a plethora of this millennium's romantic comedies, where in Contemporary Movie Land there's always the non-surprising happy ending. In my opinion however, that's a crying (no pun intended) shame.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" tells two separate stories. Two single women, one in England (Kate Winslet) and the other in Los Angeles (Cameron Diaz) decide to swap homes for two weeks in order to heal themselves from their respective recent heartbreaks over the Christmas fortnight. On her first night in her new cottage, Diaz meets the drunken brother of her hostess (Jude Law). Big guess as to what follows. Although Diaz and Law are competent, this entire plot line was contrite, lacking originality and written flatly. Both actors have done better work elsewhere.<br/><br/>The interesting story here is Kate's. While driving around in LA, she meets her neighbor (Eli Wallach) pushing his walker, obviously lost. Being the ever-helpful Brit, Kate takes him home, only to discover that he's actually an Oscar-winning writer. The two develop a friendship, and Wallach entertains her with stories of early Hollywood. Winslet soon meets Jack Black, a movie scorer, and the two chastely hit it off. Winslet and Black team up to assist (and at times, push) Wallach into accepting a Writers' Guild honor.<br/><br/>This film is filled with artsy, educated people (Black and Diaz are in the film business; Winslet and Law are the bookish set). Sometimes the dialogue is spot-on and unpredictable. At times, I found the film quite charming and entertaining. Unfortunately by the last 10 minutes of the film, the big red Christmas bow becomes apparent.<br/><br/>The director and writer of the film is Nancy Meyers, who seems to have developed a chick-flick niche. In addition to this film, her credits also include ""Something's Gotta Give"", both ""Father of the Bride"" films and the completely forgotten ""I Love Trouble"". Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, given the credits of the cast and of Meyers.<br/><br/>As they say in ""Casablanca"", ""We'll always have Paris"" (or England, in this case). But sometimes the woman alone on the plane is just better."
"oneloveall","6","1","2","5 March 2007"," Professional and assured romedy made a few bad choices..
","Semi-excellent emulation of a modern romantic comedy at times but still takes huge leaps away from the intuitive joy that makes up the majority of this crowd pleaser. As one of Hollywood's few female mainstream forces, Nancy Meyers immediately reiterates why she is an intelligent enough writer and director to justify many clichés her feel-good material thrives off of. Nothing here is trying to reinvent the wheel, or reinvent the corny, sappy contrived nature of these films for that matter, but Meyers and her acting entourage get enough mileage out of the mediocre script by the sheer amount of warmth emitted from chief cast members. Heck, even the overcooked score still manages to evoke emotion where one would feel manipulation in less apt hands.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the cute and intimate performances that provide this popcorn muncher's adorable heart also serve to backfire on the film's small but significant redeeming qualities of emotional substance. For the most part the surprisingly engaging performances overwhelm a majority of fluff provided throughout the predictable outing, with an appreciated amount of detail paid to so many effective nuances, equal parts comedic and dramatic, during the interlocked romantic stories. The women sure do steal the show here though, I guess they all knew who would be watching it. Kate Winslet continues her emotional dominance, unparalleled even when in cinema's most trite of circumstances. Her attempts at more overt humor may pale in comparison to the heart-sweltering realism her dramatic chops bring to even the dullest of lines, but remains enjoyable enough. Surprisingly, Cameron Diaz gives one of her best performances to date, helping to justify her overrated stature with substantial proof of a masterful caricature, complete with an array of subtlety to boot. It is her powerful chemistry between an appropriate Jude Law that will keep the chicks coming back to this flick, sustaining the somewhat corny affair with an inspired Hollywood love affair.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the backfiring part. Unfortunately the movie only works half as effectively as it wanted to due to the terrible casting, or acting of Jack Black. I really admire the guy but he obviously has quite a ways to go before conquering the romantic genre, even if it is comedy-based, in which his character resembles an infinitely dorkier version of himself (the only person Black has really mastered playing). Black shines when he is involved with a project near and dear to his offbeat heart, but here he feels awkwardly out of place, and in a very unintentional way. In effect nearly half of the movie's dramatic heft is severed by his inane take, even worse canceling out some of Winslet's moving work (thank goodness for Rufus Sewell adding some romantic dimension to her story), a character misread that seriously undermined the integrity of this light but tight direction."

","There's no big surprises to set apart this romantic comedy in its essence; all of our characters sharing the same ups and downs we've seen before over dozens of movies. But thats not why women and men (reluctant or otherwise)in their droves turn out to see this genre. What's needed are characters with depth and natural charm you find yourself caring about, their well natured but problematic lives willing us on to root for their happiness. With an uncomplicated but softly charming script and amiable performances from Kate Winslet and Jack Black in particular, this film certainly delivers. Black plays Winslet's new laid back L.A friend perfectly; his lovable humour not commanding centre stage as in his other performances, a welcome change to see in this obviously versatile actor. Another side to Jude Law's character also reveals itself to be more human than the Alfie one might have assumed earlier on. It's a very human story, wanting someone you cant have, not knowing who or what you really want, then finding it when you least expect it. Its a story you may have heard before, but one well worth listening to again in The Holiday. Its likable, warm spirited characters that come together in believable circumstances provide an engaging and enjoyable 2 hours. As romantic comedies go, this one is definitely worth your time. Not because it'll blow you away, but because it'll draw you in to the lives and loves of these characters with each other, an experience not hugely disagreeable. I would give this film a solid 7.5 out of 10."
"bg11215","7","1","2","9 January 2007"," Touching but room for improvement
","I had some time to kill and figured, what the heck, I'll see this to help keep up on what's selling in Hollywood. I was pleasantly surprised on one hand, but there is definitely room for improvement with a little bit of work. This is a perfect example of a story that would have benefited greatly by some scrutiny and revision by professional writers. I could identify with parts of each of the two main characters, played by Kate Winslett and Cameron Diaz. Especially Amanda (maybe because the story focused heavily on her and not so much on the other), how she has an affair (okay one night stand) and wants to make it something serious/permanent. Anyone who's ever been in that situation with someone either in or from a foreign country could probably identify. But I thought parts of the story were weak and some of the direction amateurish. With a little work, it could have really been a very good, much stronger work. But still worth seeing, especially compared to much of the junk that's out there. The pickings are slim."
"jazz-14","7","1","2","1 January 2007"," Rough Start, got better
","I felt Camereron Diaz's character was far too cardboard for words. She starts out as a cold career woman and pretty much stays that way for at least half the movie. Kate Winslet is also handed a cutout for a character, but it isn't nearly as well defined. Hers is more of a cypher, a woman that wanted to do more, but didn't. I gotta hand the acting award to Winslet, she took her role and made her a likable person, with subtlety and depth. I never got to like Diaz in this. At best she warmed up into an ""ordinary"" emotionally developed person.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole film revolves around the inside life of writers and of film-making. So as they were dropping terms like ""meet cute"", all I could think of was that they had just done a ""meet cute"" by describing it. Overall, it was a too self-conscious and formulaic rom-com. The elements were showing throughout. However, in the end, the romance does shine through and I liked it. Jude Law in particular exercises a thin role into something worth seeing."
"wassermiteis-registratio","7","1","2","31 December 2006"," Predictable but Thoroughly Enjoyable
","I disagree with reviews that trash the movie ... Yes, the first ten minutes have you wondering if you stumbled into a mash-up from Bridget Jones, from the snowy village, to the publishing house Christmas party. But... I grew to love it anyway, and I'd buy it, and thought it was more interesting than Notting Hill, which I liked. <br/><br/>For the record, Jude Law and Cameron Diaz had _excellent_ chemistry. I never quite ""got"" the Jude Law obsession, but I do now! I wonder if that's part of the reason more screen time is devoted to their relationship - because it's just so much darn fun to watch them interact?<br/><br/>Also, I'm afraid to admit Iris and Amanda's characters are dead-on, from Cameron's constant ""over-thinking"" every issue and talking _way_ too much during intimate moments, to Kate's inability to move on, even when she's being so obviously manipulated. Ladies - take note how annoying it is to see in someone else, then try to curb yourself. Ditto Graham's fear of losing his single-guy self, and Miles willingness to cling to an obviously-wrong woman b/c he thinks she's out of his league and he won't do better. <br/><br/>Yes, too little time spent on the Jack Black/Kate Winslet pairing contributes to a flaw in the believability of their ultimate relationship - BUT, it was a huge relief to not have that thread unwind as obviously as I anticipated, instead enjoying the lovely friendship that develops with Iris and Arthur in a wonderfully spontaneous way. Too often we dismiss older people as 'batty', and I was happy to see someone over 60 represented as still flirty and funny without being a 'father figure' caricature.<br/><br/>Jack Black in 5 years (after more experience and some challenging roles) would be the right person to cast, but I could't think of a better 'everyman' today, so I like him in that role. <br/><br/>Yes, it's cliché, yes, plot-predictability-factor is 9.5 - but there are a few twists that make this a new telling of an old story, and I'm always a sucker for that Dickensian version of an English Christmas this movie plays very well to, right down to the smoking chimneys."

","When I visited the MultiPlex, the choice was between ""The Good Shephard"" and ""The Holiday"". I went w/my wife, I let her chose since the last few times I picked, she snoozed.<br/><br/>Anyhow, ""The Holiday"" was clearly a cut above the ordinary romantic comedy fare. First, Cameron Diaz was simply luminous. Obviously, I've seen her many times before but for some reason, for the first time (at least to me) she appeared to be truly beautiful. But the real surprise was the natural performance of Jude Law. At first, I thought he was simply a reprise of his prior roles. But then, all of the sudden, he started to hit some disarmingly true notes, like when we are introduced to his children and then when he admits that he has fallen for Diaz.<br/><br/>The other out of the ordinary aspect was the Eli Wallach character. While he may at first blush appear to be out of his element, he brings in an unexpected storyline about the ""old"" Hollywood and connects with Kate Winslet character in a very touching way.<br/><br/>I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that Ms. Winslet turns in another fine performance but I guess at this point, that is to be expected and therefore, sometimes overlooked.<br/><br/>All in all, a pleasant surprise which I rate a 7 and I am an extremely harsh rater, almost never doling out a 10 or even a 9."
"fwomp","7","1","2","27 December 2006"," Predictable But Still A Good RomCom
","Romantic comedies abound in cinema. Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, French Kiss, Bridget Jones' Diary, and The Whole Nine Yards are just a few of the more recent ones in this genre. THE HOLIDAY certainly falls headlong into this category, but does so with the addition of it taking place around the Christmas season. Writer/director/producer Nancy Meyers is very familiar in the RomCom arena. Her repertoire contains such gems as Private Benjamin and Father of the Bride (we'll forgivingly overlook the Father of the Bride II debacle for the moment).<br/><br/>What The Holiday has going for it is some good dialogue and even better acting. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black round out the prime roles. The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz, In Her Shoes) as she ejects her live-in boyfriend from her home. She's an intense young woman who's the CEO of her own upstart company that makes movie trailers. Her lifestyle is getting the better of her and she decides she needs a holiday.<br/><br/>Iris (Kate Winslet, Finding Neverland) is in love with one of her close working colleagues and decides she needs a mental health getaway from the constrained English countryside. But what to do. Ah! House swap! Iris and Amanda fly across the Atlantic and take over each other's residences. Iris lands in L.A. to find a beautifully manicured house with every possible accouterment, while Amanda drags herself up the snow-laden driveway to a cramped but quaint English cottage. Initially Amanda hates what she finds. The quiet life doesn't suit her. But then she runs into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law, Closer) and a one-night stand turns into something Amanda never thought possible. Iris, in L.A., struggles with falling out of love with her ex-beau who is soon to be married but won't stop bothering her (he calls, sends emails, etc.). But Iris develops a unique friendship with Miles (Jack Black), a sound mixer for films, and she sees in him the same failings her own relationships have.<br/><br/>Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable. The handsome Jude Law will make young viewers swoon and the sexy Cameron Diaz will appeal to men who still have an inkling of testosterone flowing through their veins.<br/><br/>Jack Black has toned down his hyperactivity and settled into a fine role (although some may miss his outlandish behaviors of ol'). His ""breast graze"" lines are funny and poignant, making us love him for his calmly delivered antics this time.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet sheds her Titanic persona and goes back to what she knows: being a regular English actress. Her simple demeanor was quite well pulled off for someone who tends to have a more haughty acting history, showing that she can ugly down a bit and act in ways we may have forgotten.<br/><br/>All-in-all this is a pretty predictable romantic comedy but the script is so strong and the acting so well done that it deserves plenty of accolades."
"wowryan17","2","2","7","20 March 2007"," This Movie was a Huge Letdown
","From the start I didn't like it. I guess I'm not the Cameron Diaz fan. She is annoying as hell and something that MAJORLY bothered me, she has an ""e-soph-a-JUS"" attack. It bothered me SO BAD. I quote ""I'm having an esophaJus attack"" pronounced JJJJJJUS. That made me realize how god damned retarded she is and from there on I hated her, and the producer/director/cast/crew for not catching that mistake, and especially Cameron Diaz for being a stupid blonde that doesn't know common anatomy. Bottom line, BORING AND IT SUCKED. Jude Law and Jack Black looked weird and acted strangely. Surprisingly Kate Winslet was the highlight of the movie. Predictable, typical, poor acting, do NOT see this movie."
"Karin5859","6","2","7","3 January 2007"," Missed opportunity
","I love romantic comedies, and I don't think that the fact that this type of movie is considered light and shallow is an excuse to lower any standard of good film writing. The film is well shot, it's the writing that's the problem. In my opinion this movie has been rushed (probably to get in the cinemas for Christmas, or the money simply ran out) Though it's not as bad as Tara Road (which isn't worth watching) it's certainly not very good either. Only watch it if you're really more than willing to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Some telltale signs:<br/><br/>In one of the last scenes part of the microphone can be seen (sloppy!) If the people who made this movie took some time to check their work they would have noticed themselves.<br/><br/>The writer wanted to create a confusion (Jude Law must appear a ladies man to Cameron Diaz, while in fact he isn't. The writer does this by having him being called on his mobile by two 'women' and Cameron sees their names on his mobile. Later on we discover these two women are in fact his daughters of say 7 and 4. Though I'm prepared to believe that a 7 year old has a mobile and actually uses it to call it's parent, a 4-year old will not have/use one. (I have children. I know) With a little more effort the writer could have come up with another caller equally harmless (a co-worker, or whatever).<br/><br/>When Cameron for the first time gets driven to her house in the UK, the driver says he can't drive all the way up the road to her house because he won't be able to turn the car once he gets there. But when you see the road in front of the house you know he must be a really lousy driver because there's enough room to make a turn. But even worse, near the end of the movie there is a scene where Cameron wants to leave. She's picked up by the car (I presume the driver drove up to her house in reverse) and when they are driving down to the main road again she wants to return to the house. She makes the driver stop and decides to run back to the house rather than have the car reverse. There is no explanation why she wants to run back (and not drive back). A perfect explanation would be that the car can't turn so she has to get out if she wants to be quick, but strangely enough (after all we were prepped by the first remark of the driver) that's not what we're told, instead we're to believe that her running back is a spontaneous action. If the writer had more time he could have left out the remark of the driver that he couldn't turn at the house. This suggest that the first scene was already shot when they altered the later scene making the remark of the driver a loose end. Again sloppy.<br/><br/>I think Jack Black is a surprising and a very good choice. Well casted! Such a shame that he gets such a small role. If as a movie maker you risk choosing for Jack Black and then you don't cash in on it makes the choice halfheartedly. If Jack Black gets another role in a RomCom I 'll certainly go and see it. I think he's perfect for this type of movie (or could be if the writer gave him a bigger role)"
"elnopal","2","2","7","2 January 2007"," Not the Holiday I would consider for two cents worth.
","There were a few interesting scenes and all of them had the actor Eli Wallach. But Eli Wallach was not in the movie enough to save it.<br/><br/>The main characters were mismatched and poorly developed. Dialogue was obtrusive, wordy and interrupted. For example, what could have made for great kissing scenes with Jude Law and Cameron Diaz, were turned into psycho babble and self-fulfilling prophecy, were I wanted to yell at the movie screen to tell Cameron Diaz's character to ""shut the hell up"". Jack Black was slightly comic, and I felt bad for Kate Winslet having to take on such a shallow meaningless character. I shed a few tears of joy when the credits came flying up and I could politely leave the dark theater and the dark recesses of my tortured mind after watching such a pitiful excuse for screen time."

","Given that this was not Nancy Meyers's first movie to have written, directed, and produced I was hoping for something a little more appealing. I thought the goofy French soundtrack of Something's Gotta Give was just part of the Bohemian fabric. I now know that this is simply Meyers's style where mature adults run around acting like rabbits.<br/><br/>Meyers starts with Kate Winslet pining away in her hopelessly quaint and romantic London cottage for a former/current, now-engaged-to-someone-else lover. Cameron Diaz on the other hand kicks her lover out of her LA mansion because he was humping his secretary. The magic to resolve their guy problems is swapping houses for the Christmas holidays.<br/><br/>What follows is not much different although I was surprised they didn't swap lovers as well. A mere six hours in London and Diaz is copulating with the widowed Jude Law, who despite his vulnerable state can't keep his pants on even in his sister's house. Winslet pines away in LA, but we know she will eventually copulate with Jack Black.<br/><br/>Such an vapid plot leads one to conclude that Meyer's solution to infidelity, which everyone seems to suffer from with the exception of Law, is finding someone else to hump, even if you have to travel half way across the globe."
"saarvardi","6","2","8","6 December 2006"," The Holiday 2006 - A Brief Review
","Well, anyone can tell you what this film is about (2 30+ year old women - one in US, one in UK - swap houses for two weeks and find love in their respective new vacancy), so here are some fun facts about the film you won't find so easily:<br/><br/>1. The movie is not only a romantic comedy, but also a movie about making movies. Be prepared for many inside Hollywood jokes, including surprise cameos by Lindsay Lohan, Dustin Hoffman and others. 2. It' the only movie you'll ever find who shows you (brief) images of the DVD covers of classics such as Gone With the Wind and Jaws, and then show you a library who has the horrific Gigli in it. 3. Watch out for that boom mike that comes in the most inadequate scenes. 4. Two much product placement: I wonder how much Google, Universal Studios, that damn Blueberry palm computer and others put into this thing.<br/><br/>The Holiday's negative points (IMO):<br/><br/>1. Lack of editing: the film has at least 30 minutes that could have been easily removed whilst keeping the plot intact. Some of the scenes take way too much screen time (the film clocks at over 2 hours - way above average for a romantic comedy). 2. Lack of Jack Black: the guy is supposedly one of the main characters but hardly has any screen time, and becomes an important player in the plot only towards the end. 3. Lack of credibility: when you have Jude Law and Cameron Diaz together with two little girls in one scene, and the girls ""steal"" the show from the stars, you know something is wrong. Black and Winslet, on the other hand, were more exciting on screen for me. Black actually shines more than ever in his rather small part, and is cute as a button. 4. Lack of continuinity: the UK and the US plot don't always mush together like the director might have intended originally, and seem like two entirely different films occasionally. <br/><br/>Most of all, remember: this is supposed to be light Christmas fluff, so handle it with the right thing in mind. If you ignore all the negaive points I mentioned and simply enjoy the film, you'll be having a blast."

It is a film that is not offending anyone, at least as far as I know. It is a film with no violence unless you class Jack Black as beating on his film score writing piano keyboard as violence. It has two love interests in the film although the one between Jack Black and Kate Winslet seems a little too platonic, although Jude Law and Cameron Diaz get it on.<br/><br/>The film is well scripted from start to finish and I think the only reason the film doesn't get high marks on IMDb is because people who voted from UK are probably not too fond of the US part and people who voted from the US may not prefer the UK part. It is hard to please everybody but the soundtrack is superb and the comedic value throughout is also superb. It is definitely a feel good movie and for me at the end of the film I feel good. It has some ups and downs but overall it reminds me that we all have flaws and we have to overcome them to get the benefit of the human condition.

","The Holiday is a romantic comedy film written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. It stars Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as two lovelorn women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who temporarily exchange homes to escape heartbreak during the holiday season. Jude Law and Jack Black co-star, with Eli Wallach, Shannyn Sossamon, Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell playing key supporting roles.<br/><br/>After each suffers her fair share of romantic disappointments, Englishwoman Iris and L.A. woman Amanda meet on-line at a website devoted to helping people exchange houses for vacations. Each agrees to spend the Christmas holiday at the other's home. While each suffers from a minor case of culture shock, both women also end up becoming involved with a man. Iris makes the acquaintance of an upbeat every man played by Jack Black, while Amanda spends time with a handsome Brit played by Jude Law. Both women must decide what to do with these new relationships as their pre-arranged house switch is scheduled to last less than two weeks.<br/><br/>The film lacks any surprises and eventually overstays its welcome while sweet and somewhat touching.The characters pace and putter around in the story like animals building their nests, and by the time they finally settle down with their mates, we have a grudging affection for them.Also,the writing is clever enough and the performances warm and engaging enough to make this a far better-than-average."

","I love Kate Winslet, I like Cameron Diaz and Jack Black and I don't mind Jude Law, so I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately the female leads both give the worst, most self conscious performances of their careers. Blame Nancy Meyers the writer for a twee, contrived script and Nancy Meyers the director for pointing the camera at her stars and telling them to ""act cute and adorable"". If you like Richard Curtis but find his work too gritty and realistic, this is the movie for you. For the rest of us, it's an interminable embarrassment. One star for Jack Black, who at least tries to give a performance while everyone else is winking at the audience. Meyers wrote ""Private Benjamin"" and ""It's Complicated"" so she's obviously talented but she stunk the joint out with this one."
"jpschapira","6","1","3","28 December 2008"," There's always next time...
","A long time ago, writer/director Nacy Meyers did a glorious romantic comedy, ""What women want"". It was funny, it was romantic and it had its main actors in completely unexpected roles. With time she was apparently captivated by nice sceneries, and left the city to show her characters in wider places, living longer, almost ending love stories. This led into ""Something's gotta give"", a film full of repeated moments in which actors still shone bright. <br/><br/>With ""The Holiday"", Meyers' finest attributes (the direction of actors and her writing, that is) are still in top form; the problem is that in every other aspect she's trying something more ambitious than her previous efforts. This film presents us four main characters that live two major love stories (that include, we might say, other two) in two different places in the world. It's not what I would have prescribed for someone like Meyers.<br/><br/>Although ""The Holiday"" is better than her previous piece, some things are almost embarrassing and show us a writer that might be running out of ideas. To do a whole sequence with the old joke of 'driving on the wrong side', the typical American problem when in England; to give Jack Black a role completely different from what he's done and finally asking him to do his classic act (singing and dancing like a fool, but like nobody can); introducing a plot line involving an old writer and comparisons between the modern Hollywood and what it used to beIt's not that the words characters speak seem off, it's the presence of all of this things that make us doubt the director's originality.<br/><br/>About the words, well, it isn't too different from what we've seen from Meyers before or what we get in the typical contemporary film of the genre. As in every script, there are things that shouldn't be spoken by the characters, silences that should be respected, musical montages that are unnecessary (this is more related to direction). <br/><br/>To her favor, Meyer hasn't followed the typical developments of the love relationships and has been able to introduce a couple of unexpected funny and dramatic situations; and while there's an important lever of corniness that some characters admit to be looking for, expressions are never too far-fetched to be doubted. <br/><br/>It's understandable that Meyers does a balance. After all, ""The Holiday"" is for every kind of audience possible, and it has to contain an obligatory familiarity. For this Meyers takes the wisest decisions related to acting. The four main characters are kind of familiar, and it looks as if the roles had been written for the actors who play them. Kate Winslet (is it possible to be that good of an actor?) plays the depressing Iris, who's in love with someone who doesn't love her backShe's the one who gives the movie's initial speech, about relationship.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz plays Amanda, an also depressing woman who worries too much about herself and is on the movie trailer making industry. Amanda and Iris are the one who take the holiday of the title and meet Graham and Miles, respectively. Graham is played by a subtle and calm Jude Law who abuses of his oldest winning trick: the smile. Meanwhile, Black delivers a confusing performance that doesn't decide between the serious and the ridicule and that finally rests in his typical act, as I said. <br/><br/>""The Holiday"" does no harm, but it still could have been a better ride. With fewer characters and a more centered love story, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Anyway, maybe next time, right?<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's scoreNo words for that magic."

I should add that it's not a bad movie as you can believe reading some of the critics, succeeding to raise above the usual kitsch level of the films in the genre.<br/><br/>The two main protagonists of the story are a Californian trailer producer (Cameron Diaz) and a British journalist (Kate WInslet) who on holidays eve are abandoned by their years long love interests who happened both to be absolute jerks and in order to run from depression and solitude enter a home swap, exchanging residences for the period of the holidays. In a very convenient manner a few screen minutes after landing at each others home salvation knocks at their doors incarnated by the comic super-genius Jack Black and by British beau-of-the-day Jude Law. What follows is what you suspect it follows but surprisingly the parallel story develop in quite a cursive manner, dialogs are most of them funny, though they do not avoid completely being too wordy, and the four acting stars seem to have a good time. A special mention is to be made to the character of the old Hollywood script-writer, aced with emotion and nostalgia by Eli Wallach in a deep reverence to the good old American movies industry.<br/><br/>Good entertainment for Christmas, wedding anniversaries and maybe in other occasions too."

It was a connection I'd not made before, but it was immediate obvious once heard. But perhaps Diaz's occasionally gleefully spastic performance was due to the director's pushing her in the Lombard direction.<br/><br/>The cast was outstanding but under-utilized with a ""so close but not quite"" script and average direction. Everything seemed to move towards a resolution or breakthrough but then stop short for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>Overall, absolutely average -- fluff for a brainless day.

I got this movie without knowing that he is in it, and I swear that when I saw his name in the opening credits I thought: I hope he's just as much as a supporting-supporting actor can be. Yeah... almost.<br/><br/>He's one of those current actors being cast in the movies not because he's actually GOOD, but he's funny enough to cover some holes on the plot and to make Americans laugh a lot with those annoying joking faces when there's nothing to be said or when the movie is getting a lot dramatic or sleepy. I'm sure he's one of those Jerry Lewis fans that really makes hard to be so funny as Mike Myers, and I just hate that.<br/><br/>I think that this movie flaws with some things. First it suffers for so much characters and relationship happenings, I think that it was a lot talk about 3 broken relationships that resolves into 2 new ones because that's a lot for a movie. So, when a story starts getting interesting with Iris and Mr. Abbott, we are cut in the middle to see what is happening with Amanda and Graham, and when these last ones' story is getting interesting, we are cut back to Amanda that needs to answer the door, and guess who is it? ""Annoying"" Miles, of course! Another thing that is quite annoying (and this time it's not Jack Black) is the fact that Amanda's story is more interesting than Iris's, or that's what writer and director Nancy Meyers tries to make us believe when we check the fact that more than a half of the movie is about Amanda dyslexic and embarrassing moments. That's sad because Kate Winslet is a lot secondary in it and she does her part a way lot better.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong but one more time I loved this movie and I LOVE all the cast (except Jack Black), I just think that it could be a lot better without these wrong steps and turns.

Cameron's relationship with Kate's brother was what the movie mostly focused on. I didn't like it because Cameron's relationship with him was moving too quickly. Kate's seemed more slow and pleasant. Just plain fun. I also liked Jack Black in this movie. I don't dislike him but I don't find him funny. Don't know why he makes comedies. He should stick to this nice serious guy role. It fits him more. He was more fun in this movie because he didn't try so hard like in his other movies. The little girls were really nice, and they made their parts shine. Movie was a 7 because it entertained me the first time I saw it.It was boring second time around. But, still 7 because the 1st time matters more."

","A romantic comedy with an creative slant, involving two women who have recently broken off nightmare relationships, and want to get away from it all as far away from it all as they can get. One lives in England, the other in California, and they agree to swap houses for their respective vacations over the internet. It's a cute idea, and for the most part, it works. Since the women have both sworn off men for a while, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to guess the first thing that happens when each arrives at the other's home. The story line in England was the better scripted of the two, perhaps because the California story is burdened with some Hollyweird entertainment industry stereotypes.<br/><br/>The story was apparently written with these very actors in mind, but oddly enough, the casting turns out to be the film's biggest liability. Jack Black was in mind for this role? Somebody was out of their mind to use a guy who has only succeeded in cartoonish simpleton roles in the past. He's clearly out of place here, and even looks uncomfortable, managing only a goofy grin all the time. Cameron Diaz is a weak link too: she's always pulling her hair, making (outdated) Valley girl shrieking noises, or whining. These quirks are not original or amusing; they're just distracting.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Kate Winslett is the film's greatest strength, approaching her role with the lighthearted breeziness that is intended. Her character is easy to love, and some of the banter with veteran actor Eli Wallach as her curmudgeonly neighbor is a fun and interesting highlight.<br/><br/>In summary, a romantic comedy that has moments, but is marred somewhat by questionable casting. Good enough for a Saturday afternoon rental."

","Title: The Holiday, Directed by Nancy Meyers, Written by Nancy Meyers, Exec. Produced by Suzanne McNeill Farwell, Produced by Bruce A. Block, Nancy Meyers <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 <br/><br/>The Holiday is a fluffy movie but it drags on for a long time. Kate Winslet is always likable as Iris, who is fed up with an affair that is going nowhere she is having in England.<br/><br/>She decides to swap houses with Amanda, a high power movie editor in Los Angeles. Cameron Diaz is Amanda and she plays the same cute blonde girl. Amanda has no time with men and is emotionally incapable of feeling anything! Sure enough, they experience culture shock in England and Los Angeles, respectively. It's very fun watching Diaz driving in the snow and pigging out. It's even more fun seeing Winslet digging out the expansive, luxurious LA mansion! Like any romantic comedy, they meet a love interest. Amanda meets Graham (a suave Jude Law), who you think is a lady's man, and Iris meets Miles (a more serious but still fun Jack Black).<br/><br/>What makes The Holiday work is how realistically they portray these relationships. They are each on vacation so does it mean they'll stay together? Some people say true love has no boundaries. The movie poses this question, which makes it miles ahead of the standard, gooey-yuks romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Also, there is a subplot involving Hollywood and writers. It felt a little out of place and seemed to be there for the writer to show how we should appreciate legendary script writers.<br/><br/>All in all, The Holiday is good fun and has some intelligence. But it is quite long and has unnecessary subplots. It's the type of movie that is worth watching on a cold Christmas day eating Christmas fettuccine."

","The Holday is the perfect cure for your winter blues. <br/><br/>A lively fun film that does precisely what it says on the packet - it brings out the Christmas romantic in all of us. My wife and I cried and laughed and knew it would all work out - of course.<br/><br/>Grown-up enough to make you feel awake, and romantic enough to make you cry, laugh, and sigh, it is about nice people who have nice lives even when they are all finding it hard to find love. We particularly liked Eli Wallach - simply wonderful.<br/><br/>If you imagine curling up with a glass of wine, a blazing fire, and a film; then the film you want to complete that picture is The Holiday. Pure Hollywood - and pure as the driven snow. England and Los Angeles never looked so perfect, and yet inside the package there are enough surprises and little touches that it never becomes too saccharine.<br/><br/>The Christmas spirit suits well - and it is neatly and expertly directed by Nancy Myers. Yes, it wears its heart on its sleeve all the time, but it didn't make us cringe. <br/><br/>Too perfect? Of course it is, and proud of it - if you are in the mood for a feel-good romance, with enough heartache to make it bitter-sweet followed by the clean resolution then this is your slice of movie magic. <br/><br/>For out and out holiday cheer The Holiday is a winning and heady mix."

","Holiday is the definition of ""chick flick."" It has everything it needs for chick flick material  attractive male and female leads, drama, humor and a believable happy ending. Two females unlucky in love decide to do a 2 week vacation home exchange. Amanda who lives in a posh estate in L.A. trades houses with Iris who lives in a quaint cottage in England. Both these ladies meet men they were not expecting and discover truths about themselves uncovering qualities they did not know they had. The movie chronicles the journey of these women's self-discovery and it was often humorous and at times heart breaking.<br/><br/>This movie worked with the excellent acting, especially Kate Winslet who plays Iris. I would not have enjoyed the movie as much if she was not in it. I should have known I would have been moved; there was a reason Titanic was a huge hit and she was part of why that movie was a success. Her heartbreak was very convincing. I also enjoyed Jack Black's brand of comedy. The singing of the movie scores in the movie rental store is my favorite scene. Jude Law also does an amazing, convincing job of Graham, the widower who falls in love and gets his heart broken to the point of him crying. The Graham crying scene is also one of my favorites.<br/><br/>The background theme of this love story was very interesting as well. The fact that all characters were involved in the entertainment industry was uncommon and I liked it. The movie trailers of Amanda's life were amusing and Arthur, the screen writer's journey, was also a pleasant subplot.<br/><br/>Although the pacing of this movie could be slow, I highly recommend this movie to all those people needing that fuzzy warm feeling during the holiday season."

","Under unfortunate circumstances, I was forced to watch this garbage on a bus trip to Florida. May I say that this is possibly the worst conceived movie I have seen since Alone in the Dark, and I don't say that a lot. <br/><br/>Where to start? The all-star cast, including Jude Law, Kate Winslet, the wonderful Jack Black in a not-so-wonderful role, and Cameron Diaz just did not seem to spark any magic. The Jude Law-Cameron Diaz storyline pretty much dominated the movie, Jack Black barely has enough screen time to make his character enjoyable, and a miscast Eli Wallach seemed out of place. Cameron Diaz showed me that her acting chops are pretty much nonexistent, and some of the scenes went on for way too long. I was hoping that one of the characters would die in some sort of misfortunate accident in which I would've rejoiced. Alas, it did not happen. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is complete garbage. The movie itself is over two hours long. Way too long for a chick flick like this. It felt like the movie dragged on and on and on.

Kate thought ""Cameron's in it, so it may be a hit""; Jude thought ""Cameron's in it, so it can't be bad""; Cameron thought: ""Jude and Kate are in it and have British accents, so it may do for me what Notting Hill did for Julia"". But obviously they did not read the script, especially the notes ""to be ham-acted"". Cameron ham-acted the first scene so brilliantly I am surprised she was ever offered another acting job (in fact, she was just given the speaking role in various Shreks afterwards). Kate managed to act through the first scene but then stuck to her safe laugh of wonderment throughout the rest of the film (but what else could she do when presented with the psycho-look lover to replace the manipulative lover?). Jude slimed through the role asleep in preparation for his destruction of ""Sleuth"". This sort of British-movie-for-Christmas should now be declared officially dead.

","Didn't like it. Not one little bit. Way too coy, cloying, cute, sweet and predictable. The whole thing was slightly annoying and queasy. The American Girl character was awful. The British guy character was a sap and self consciously a nice man. Kate's part was OK and so was the part of the American Guy, but neither of them were particularly exciting or memorable characters. There were lots of things wrong with the script.<br/><br/>It was also badly researched. I'll give you an example. There was a scene when the American Girl character is in the UK and is watching a trailer that she made for an action film. (The American Girl character's job is as a film trailer maker.) Voice-over Man is giving it some welly and ends with the very deep and gruff proclamation, ""Christmas Day"", which I suppose was when the film is supposed to be coming out. No. Wrong. In the UK the cinemas are closed on Christmas Day. As far as I am aware this has always been the case. e.g. No films open here on Christmas Day. Family films often open on Boxing Day, but not on Christmas Day. Somebody should have picked up on that.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" wasn't very good, for all of the reasons I mention above. I had hoped that Jack Black might give the American Guy character a bit of oomph, but sadly not. He seemed to be acting on tranquilisers. They should have let Jack Black play Jack Black. Jack Black is very good at playing Jack Black. Nice Dustin Hoffman joke, though."

","I should have heeded the warning of the video store clerk when she looked at my choice of ""The Holiday"" and exclaimed ""It's terrible! I fell asleep!"" It is a romantic comedy with no romance and no comedy. The two couples--Cameron Diaz/Jude Law & Kate Winslett/Jack Black have zero chemistry and their relationships feel false and forced at all times.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story focused on Cameron Diaz--to be honest, I was not that familiar with her work as an actress so had no expectations of her, however, I was expecting she would have some acting ability. Her performance in this movie was absolutely diabolical. There wasn't one 'real' moment in any scene she was in.<br/><br/>Kate Winslett is a marvelous actress and did the best she could with the material she was given. The only relationship in this movie that worked on any level was the one between Kate Winslett and Eli Wallach.

","This film was an embarrassment. It featured two great actors (Winslet and Wallach) and one promising actor (Black) and two box office poison actors (Law and Diaz). Unfortunately for Winslet, Wallach, and Black, this film was doomed because of the terrible script. The movie mainly focuses on Cameron Diaz's story, one that we've heard a hundred times. We're supposed to connect to her because she's American, but no one cares about the American fish-out-of-water story anymore. Diane Lane took that story to new heights in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" but Diaz just ruins it in this film. If Kate Winslet's story were possibly longer or more focused upon, this film could have been better by leaps and bounds. Her story was extraordinarily cute but unfortunately when we see five minutes of her we see twenty minutes of Cameron Diaz.<br/><br/>The movie is also too long. Two hours of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law have no chemistry. Kate Winslet and Jack Black have a bit of chemistry but it's really Eli Wallach who has the best chemistry with Winslet. Their story wasn't very strong, but it was fun watching them together because you can tell that they actually work hard on their performances. This movie is incredibly boring. You'll find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons. MST3k to this movie, it helps.<br/><br/>The one redeeming scene in the movie is with a cameo from Dustin Hoffman. It was the only thing I was happy about in this movie. That's all... a cameo. That was the only good thing about this film.<br/><br/>If you want to see this movie, that's fine. Rent it.

","""The Holiday"" is a contrived romantic comedy from from writer/director Nancy Meyers marked by an inability to resist an excessive gratification of whims that leaves a cloying and puffy feeling afterwards. And while the cast boasts of Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black in the leads, the film oddly lacks enough charm to be either truly romantic or funny.<br/><br/>Amanda (Diaz) is a movie advertiser from Hollywood while Iris (Winslet) is a journalist from Surrey, England. Both are reeling from post-breakup aches so they find each other online and do a house swap for the holidays. It ultimately sets the stage for Amanda to meet Iris' brother Graham (Law), while Iris herself befriends a screenwriter Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) and film composer Miles (Black) during her healing process.<br/><br/>Running for a little over two hours, the film does feel too long. Which wouldn't matter if it justified its length with content. Here, the plot is devoid of surprises and the dichotomy of the film makes for an uneven experience.<br/><br/>The arc on Diaz and Law is uncomfortably gooey and borderline absurd, which while benefits from a more dynamic progression of the story, suffers from failure to evoke sympathy of the character's plights (why of course I forgot, she can't cry!) and gawky editing.<br/><br/>It's a stark contrast to the warm and tender feeling of Iris' half of the narrative. But Winslet and Black are mismatched. Even if a straitjacketed Black has a more subdued acting here, he comes off as bland and the chemistry between him and Winslet is nonexistent to the point that it's easier to root for her and Arthur. Pity, too, that Meyers seem more interested in Amanda and Graham as they are given more screen time that the events in LA are reduced to mere fillers.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" is apparently a two-in-one romantic comedy which could have worked better had Meyers focused on a single storyline rather than jumping across the Atlantic Ocean every now and then. As it is, this one feels drawn out, with only a few good moments scattered somewhere in between, and may be even less enjoyable for the estrogen-challenged."

And why does he return to her after wards ? Just to get rebuked by her ? It's an odd couple, Winslet and Black ! In fact, I thought, she is thinking seriously of getting married to Wallach ! Wouldn't that have been more stunning, and extra-ordinary ? Any way, Diaz has sincerely tried to give some spontaneous performance. but the character seems confused, as if trying to convince herself all the while, yes, this is what I want, or may be , I don't want ? Jude Law, I remember him from The Aviator, playing Errol Flyn, a lady killer, with his handsome looks, he simply doesn't have to do much in this role, yet he gives some good performance, as the single father of two daughters, and trying to act a bit restrained with Amanda, later giving it up. His explanation for not disclosing him having two daughters, doesn't seem very plausible, though. It's more for Amanda to get disturbed, and a slight shock to the viewers. If this movie is supposed to be a comedy too, it hardly induces any laughters. Though it's a unique idea to sweep houses, seems to be quite impractical, and far-fetched. The script writer could have come out with some real struggling points, when both the women are in an absolutely different surroundings, but it appears more like a cake-walk, highly unrealistic ! Well, then, is this movie for kids ? no, because sex is involved. With some skillful editing, especially cutting down on that unnecessary Blah-blah of Amanda, and funnier situations, the film could have been much more likable ! All the four are together finally, a clichéd scene, much too hard to digest, when in today's world, every thing isn't so smooth sailing. It seems more a personality disorder of the two leading ladies, rather than any serious problems that they are facing in their lives ! An attempt at producing a harmless movie is appreciated, but turns out to be quite insipid, as it doesn't ring any bell, or give any message as such. remains only at a superficial level.

"tomhbrand","4","1","4","13 January 2007"," A promising but disappointing holiday movie
","Nancy Meyers' The Holiday should be a nice little holiday movies. It should be the kind of movies you go to see with you boy/girlfriend for a quiet evening out or watch on DVD on a cold winter Sunday afternoon. It has a cute ensemble cast, a happy if predictable storyline and no ambitions to be anything more than it should be. But in execution it's just that there are too many irritating flaws to be able to enjoy it properly.<br/><br/>For the sake of brevity I will skip voicing my opinions of the film' traditional US movies ideal of what England is like in winter; like the idea that we always have snow at Christmas, Winslet's Iris has a highflying job in the city, but then goes home everyday to her rural cottage in the country, and security guards at Heathrow never, ever refer to people as ""M'um"" when going through your luggage! But the main problem in this film is that unfortunately Meyers has the strange belief that Cameron Diaz is the star of this film, and therefore should be carrying it at all times. From the get-go she is given the lions share of the screen time, trying so desperately to be funny and force out the laughs that it get embarrassing. She's trying so hard to look like a natural comedian that it reminds me far too much of other times she's tried so hard to be funny, such as The Sweetest Thing and the Charlie's Angels films. (Just typing the names I get sharp pains in my very soul.) What also doesn't help is how unsympathetic her character comes across to us; the highly successful film editor who owns her own company, has a huge house in LA. Oh no! Her life is so bad, I really feel for her. Even as she dumps her boyfriend for cheating on her at the start of the film we are clearly shown that it's her fault for refusing open up to anyone that has destroyed her relationships (leading to some very hackneyed character development involving her being unable to cry, therefore connect emotionally with people, since her parents divorced.) And this is a real shame as the other half of the film, with Winglets and Black's Iris and Miles, along with Eli Wallach's wonderful Billy Wilder-esqe screenwriter Arthur, works so well. These two 'secondary' characters are genuinely nice people, suck in bad relationships but needing to grow to escape them. Kate Winslet in particular creates a wonderfully sweet woman, unable to fall out of love with a colleague who uses her and desperate to find something new. She and Black just seem so much more relaxed and at ease with each other, with Black in sweet, chubby loser mode rather than 'Jack Black' mode, and they act Diaz and Jude Law off the screen whenever they come on.<br/><br/>I think Wallach's Arthur Abbott has a lot to do with this, as most of Iris and Miles story focuses around him and the influence they have on each other, whereas with Amanda and Graham it's all about them, even when the cute children are introduced they are just one more thing to bring the two of them closer.<br/><br/>To be fair it does get better if you stick with it. About half way through it settles into the story, Diaz seems to stop desperately trying to be funny, and Law is given something to do other than play up to his own media stereotype, and they amazingly actually start acting and their story starts gaining the heart it has been lacking at the start. But by this point the plot is so painfully obvious it's too late to save the film.<br/><br/>The Holiday does have it's good points, but they're almost all when Winslet is on screen. You leave the cinema with the feeling that if Meyers could have managed to write the story just involving Iris and Miles and left Amanda and Graham out completely she would have had a very nice Christmas movie. As it is, it comes across as a sub-par star vehicle/chick flick."

Cameron Diaz is not bad, but has her obvious limitations which anyway is nothing to Jude Law's, who doesn't function in these kind of comedies. Eli Wallach is of course great, not just because he's over 90.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be the perfect first-date-movie. Maybe the daters should skip it and go to a restaurant instead.

But the slipshod plotting (how come the car can't drive up to the the cute little cottage at the beginning, and yet can at the film's end?), the all-too-worthy agony aunt-style philosophising, and too many clangers (Cary Grant's from Surrey, eh?) which evidently only got through due to the whole thing being all too firmly under the control of Nancy Meyers (no room for actors to improve some of their appalling lines, or for someone to point out glaring inconsistencies in the story line): all of these things are too glaringly obvious for comfort.<br/><br/>So I'm less than sure, now, that the film is really much of an improvement on such popular yet brainless romantic comedies like 'Notting Hill' (or indeed most of those embarrassments by Richard Curtis): at least Curtis's productions are quite openly about wish fulfilment, ungrateful though his roles for the American actresses are. And I can no longer see why I thought the characterisation in ""Holiday"" was particularly ""sharp"" - it now seems pretty much a mixture of generic and wishful thinking (the Jude Law character, for instance).<br/><br/>Overall, too, this is a seriously poor showing of some fine actors: Jude Law's endless mugging is ghastly to see after such films as 'The Talented Mr Ripley' where he gives a sensational performance. The lack of sufficient chemistry between him and Cameron Diaz (or was it just their trying to get through that awful script?) finally destroys even the latter's performance. And Kate Winslet, at her best in off-beat and feisty roles, is here given the ungrateful task of being a rather worthy, conventional English lass - quite a weepy one at that. So in all, OK if you have just short of 2 hours 20 minutes to waste - but definitely not something to add to your collection."

","My experience could not be better, from the beginning to my left sat an eight year old girl, who would scrutinize and giggle at every romantic scene and during some of the kiss scenes, shout loudly ""Your supposed to kiss with your eyes closed"" directed I believe at Jude Law himself. The dialog in this movie --- I am still baffled if it was supposed to be this awful to make people laugh, or was it a huge fiasco due to the intoxication of the script editor. Cameron's acting was dreadful, the whole first half was appalling only did Kate Winslet tried to save this movie along with Eli (Arthur Abbot) towards the end. Jude gave us a mediocre performance, but I understand that you could not really do anything with this ""Surprisingly Good ChickFlick"".

","The Holiday should be a better movie. It spends the first useless hour setting up what viewers already know is going to happen -- bla bla Kate and Cameron switch houses and learn wonderful life lessons by changing their environments etc etc--but the set up to get to the payoff is completely boring and almost intolerable at times--I found myself wondering how someone could have actually let all this slip in the editing process--the 15 minutes of Cameron Diaz arguing with Edward Burns about his infidelity was complete agony; all your standard dialog about the woman wronged and the ""cute"" little fits she throws...ENOUGH! The scenes with Cameron and Jude Law were great. He was charming and they made a good pair. If the movie had been completely about them it would have been twice as interesting, since they had good chemistry and I cared about seeing them end up together. However, the movie goes off in 20 different directions, including profiling aging Hollywood screenwriters, trying to include every metaphor possible about the Santa Ana winds, women and their endless hang-ups, the magic of the catharsis, conversations increasingly more awkward, yadda yadda yadda. This was grueling to sit through. And I really wanted it to be great. I kind of felt like all those awesome actors should have known better...it was hokey and surface scraping everywhere."

","Let me say this as a precursor for this semi-review; This is the first movie I have ever walked out of. That being said I would also like to say I have sat through some bad movies before i.e. The Grudge...ugh.<br/><br/>The movies premise is as original as the movie gets, and even that falls a little short. Amanda (Cameron Diaz), an American movie star living on the famous Sunset Blvd., has had a recent painful breakup with her ex and in order to try and get away from the idea of being alone on Christmas she does an exchange program with a quirky, British girl named Iris (Kate Winslet). While staying at each others respective houses, they meet and eventually fall for two complete strangers in classic chick-flick fashion.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it lacks momentum, and in a chick-flick you need a lot of momentum to keep people going. This is it's fatal downfall. After an hour of being in the theater there had been little to no plot progression. No problem introduced, no relationships progressed. This is the furthest I got in this movie before I walked out.<br/><br/>Acting was mediocre at best, with little chemistry between either of the protagonists (I use that word lightly). I expected more from Jude Law and Cameron Diaz, but sadly they were not up to par. Sadly, Jack Black and Kate Winslet seem more like a side show than they do part of the story.<br/><br/>I give it a 3 out of 10."

At a normal budget of, say, 20 or 30 million, it would have made quite a bit.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play two depressed, lovelorn women who switch homes for the Christmas holiday, Diaz leaving her Los Angeles mansion for a small fairy-tale like English house and Winslet trading the English chill for a big LA lifestyle. Diaz and her live-in boyfriend have just split, and Winslet is escaping from her great love, her boss, who just announced his engagement. Both are in for surprises.<br/><br/>""The Holiday"" has a lot of warmth, likable characters, and it's a lovely Christmas movie. That's about it. There's no real pacing. Winslet is by far the more interesting actress, and she's teamed up with Jack Black, as a potential love interest and Eli Wallach, as her Oscar-winning screen writing neighbor, for the L.A. adventure - and the L.A. segments are better than the British.<br/><br/>Diaz meets Winslet's brother, played by handsome Jude Law, and it turns out he has a secret that we don't learn until later in the film. At one point she reminds him that she's leaving in nine days. I don't know. If Jude Law were after me, I doubt I'd be going anywhere in nine days.<br/><br/>For me this film was mildly entertaining.

The movie picks up a bit after 24 minutes into it, but dear lord, how can a man endure such a vapidly worthless woman moaning about ""I never get to read books, I just end up reading magazine reviews""? Sheesh, if she wanted to read a book, READ A BOOK THEN! Stop whining like some moron. God I despise ""Learned Helplessness"" as much as wanton ignorance. I admit that it was brave to start the movie with a character that the viewers just want to see die horribly and never redeems herself (pretty much identical in should-be-dead like the worthless real-life character of Eminem).<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's character is charming and a viewer can sympathize with her completely. I am now 33 minutes into the movie and Cameron Diaz's infantile character has yet again failed to die horribly in a car crash. That is a real shame. The various ""Movie Bumper"" clips in the office, then the airplane, then on the television in the cottage home, are all annoying as well as repelling.<br/><br/>At the moment, the only saving grace of this load of agonizingly repulsive movie centering on the agonizingly repulsive Cameron Diaz's shallow character are the set pieces and the low-contrast photography. I remained eagerly patient for the moment in which Cameron Diaz's character would be horribly disfigured just to give even the slightest level of introspection, humility, or grace as that character worked past the agony to become a tolerable human being. Sadly, it appears that she does not. I would have cut as much of Cameron Diaz's role out of this movie as possible and focused entirely on Kate Winslet's character. I honestly did not care one way or the other about either actress before seeing this movie. I dearly pray that Cameron Diaz is not as repulsive a human being as she plays in this movie.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 5 (no impression at all --- leaving me not caring in the slightest about the movie before or after), but Cameron Diaz's role was such a huge negative impact that it would be painful to rewatch and submit myself to enduring the twittering pointless idiocy of Cameron Diaz playing a character with less dignity than a 3-year-old child in a 30-year-old's body.

I can understand that, but what I can't understand is why any normal moviegoer would be interested in sitting through 90 minutes of a movie dealing with that subject.<br/><br/>I must also point out that it was a bit unnecessary (and lame) to see Cameron Diaz talking out loud when she's surfing the internet. Not to mention that Cameron Diaz has a very goofy and annoying laugh. I liked her a lot better when she was in THE MASK. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet wasn't too bad though. Her story was a little interesting. I think the movie might have done better in theaters if it had eliminated all of Diaz and Law's scenes.

He was acting and far subtler than normal. The old guy rocked and had the most impressive physiotherapy routine I have ever seen.<br/><br/>My friend summed this up nicely - no one could believe that this could happen which for me is the key to a good plot / acting.

Old timer Eli Wallach gives an enjoyable appearance.<br/><br/>Oddly, the love stories are not what make this film good. There are some good lines. And a sub-plot that needs further exploration.<br/><br/>The leading characters are entangled with bad boy/girl relationships, which threatened to sink their current meaningful and real relationships.

Same for Kate Winslet--she comes across as so smart and intense that even when she dances around in her pajamas, it seems out of character. And definitely not funny. Jack Black was seriously miscast as Kate's romantic interest even though he comes across as his usual snarky, sarcastic, smirking self.

","I have given 9 stars to this film, because it is one of my favorite movies. A film at which one can have a look again, because it has a certain charm by the election of the actors. Even if I am not a fan of Jack Black, I like his role in this movie very much. He plays it very authentically and non of his excessive funny films. Kate Winslet is a magnificent actress and I think, every woman can find herself somewhere in her figure she embodies. She embodies the normal"" woman who simply would like to be loved. And this often turns out more difficult than one thinks. Cameron Diaz embodies the successful woman who looks not very sincere on the first glance, but with the time appears, why she is like that. And this makes her so endearingly at the end. Jude Law embodies the Sunny boy in this film in contrast to Jack Black. But you also gets to know other sides of him. He tries to be strong, even if he's not. But for some reasons he has to be strong. The charm of the film is supported by the beautiful music which Hans Zimmer has added. It fits perfectly to it and supports the loveliness of the film and does not overload the film as in other big Hollywood productions. On the contrary, one would like to hear more from it. In itself the story of the film is nothing new and also nothing special, but for me it is something special due to the choice of the actors and roles which they embody. It is one of the rare movies I can watch over and over again. All these things do him one of my favorite films."

","The Cast is a success, Kate Winslet as Iris with an unsuccessful love life, she never finds to be loved enough, the way she deserves. You must admit that her scenes while crying are performed so good like no other actress can do it today. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law are an attractive couple, Laws performance as a single father is worth a praise. Jack Black, although similar to his previous roles, is an actor who I loved to watch. The movie is a great story of male and female relationships in different life stages. ""The Holiday"" is a movie that will make you laugh; you might even feel a little better after watching it. His greatest asset is that it aspires to entertainment."

","Fearing the dreadfulness of bitter-stupid sappiness and troubled women who are impossible to care about, we finally get a romantic comedy that appears as one of those types of films, but delivers natural comedy and has some heartfelt touches to it. ""The Holiday"" scared off viewers because of its ingredients: two unhappy woman due to their relationship problems swipe houses to cope with their failures. Cameron Diaz plays a rich L.A. woman who enters partially- rural London where Kate Winslet can't win the guy she loves. Winslet enters the big city of L.A., and guess what! Both women fall in love with a guy. Jude Law and Jack Black are perfect supporting males to operate on non-stereotypical relationships that cause us to root for a good outcome. Nancy Meyers constantly throws sweet laughs at you without having to be raunchy or ridiculous. There are hardly any moments in ""The Holiday"" that feel recycled or redundant. Each time we get a new situation, it's gentle and sweet and not pathetically audacious like most romantic comedies get. The wit behind Meyers' writing calls for big laughs and a big heart. The entire cast is terrific and have fun with their roles, playing four entirely different people who all share one thing in common: a desire for love and human connection. It just goes to show that people all over the world suffer from love related issues. No matter how much we deny it, we all crave love is what Meyers proves. By placing just enough sappiness to remind us we're still watching a romantic comedy, ""The Holiday"" is an uplifting treat for all."
"coopski1@aol.com","4","0","1","14 December 2014"," The score ruins this movie for me
","Oddly, the Zimmer score for this was completely tone-deaf. I'm a Zimmer fan but his score for this was awful and distracting. Soaring, overwrought, orchestral, and completely wrong for this movie. What's funny is ... a couple of the main characters are movie/movie preview score composers. The score is irritating and distracting and belongs more appropriately in a drama or movie with a lot more gravitas. It occurred to me that perhaps when Nancy Meyers told Zimmer that there was a kind of ""magic"" or spiritual theme with the Santa Ana winds making ""anything possible"", that perhaps he scored it thinking that really was the main theme of the movie. The whole Santa Ana winds ""magic"" thing was unnecessary to the story, a non-starter theme, but it seems that the score is trying to force that into the movie."

","I've got this in my DVD collection and it's a film I've come to again and again, especially around Christmas time. If you're looking for a warm-hearted romantic comedy type movie to see, then this is for you. I love to watch Kate Winslet in everything and anything she does, in this film she portrays the love-lorn Iris who is besotted by her co-worker Jasper Bloom, who treats her like dirt and is aggravatingly blind to his many faults. She switches houses, her beautiful little fire logged cottage in Surrey for Cameron Diaz' stunning contemporary house in the States. I wasn't really a fan of either Diaz or Jude Law, but I quite admired them both in this, they had a sort of chemistry, and their story was funny at times. I just adored his two little British accented girls- they were absolutely gorgeous! Little scenes as in his ""home made"" tent, ""Mr Napkin Head"", her life as ""trailer"" flashbacks, the friendship that develops between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's character will definitely touch your heart. The English scenes are also amazing and a big plus when I watch these sorts of films."
"jimjo1216","Null","0","1","19 December 2013"," A ""chick flick"" for sure, with some cool movie references
","As a guy, I found THE HOLIDAY (2006) to be a little too girly, which is understandable since the film was written and directed by a woman and primarily deals with two women trying to sort out their personal troubles. It's not my cup of tea and I get that. Still, I'd say the movie's pretty good for what it is. If you're looking for a romantic ""chick flick"" to watch around Christmastime, you've found it.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet, an English journalist, and Cameron Diaz, a Hollywood movie trailer editor, decide to swap houses for two weeks during the Christmas holiday. Winslet needs to get over an unrequited love and Diaz needs time alone after a breakup. Winslet is like a kid in a candy store in sunny Los Angeles, while Diaz takes more time adjusting to the quiet country life in snowy Surrey, England.<br/><br/>The most sympathetic character for me was Kate Winslet, who gives a winning performance. She plays the comedy well in her early ""sad sack"" scenes and later becomes a beacon of positivity and joy. Cameron Diaz is Cameron Diaz, I'm just not really a fan. I liked the gimmick where Diaz sees/hears her life as if it were one of her movie trailers. Jude Law is pretty good as Winslet's brother, who meets Diaz unexpectedly in Surrey. Jack Black dials it down a bit as the lovable nice guy Winslet meets in America.<br/><br/>What I will say is that I love old black and white films. I caught THE HOLIDAY on Turner Classic Movies, of all places, and enjoyed the various shout-outs to classic Hollywood. Eli Wallach plays Cameron Diaz's Hollywood neighbor, an ancient screenwriter who befriends Kate Winslet during her stay in L.A. He reminisces about the old days and gives Winslet a list of classic films to check out. We never see the list, but it seems to contain some great screwball comedies including HIS GIRL_FRIDAY (1940) and THE LADY EVE (1941), as well as some Irene Dunne movies (perhaps THEODORA GOES WILD (1936) or my favorite THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937)).<br/><br/>It's great to see Eli Wallach (BABY DOLL (1956), THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966)) still doing stuff. He looks about a hundred years old in THE HOLIDAY, but was really only around ninety. His character's connection with Old Hollywood was a pleasant surprise for me and is probably part of the reason this recent film made it onto TCM's schedule.<br/><br/>Jack Black plays a score composer and there's a cool scene in a Blockbuster store where he singles out various films with memorable music scores (CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DRIVING MISS DAISY, GONE WITH THE WIND, JAWS, THE GRADUATE, etc.). As a movie buff I always appreciate nods to the classics and hope they expose modern viewers to some oldies but goodies."

","First of all, the opinions on here are so wildly divergent you will wonder if we all saw the same film. I put it down to expectations. If you're looking for the next Lawrence of Arabia, you will be pretty disappointed. <br/><br/>The film is about an English writer for a newspaper, Iris who is trying to finish off an unhealthy affair with her toxic co-worker and Amanda, an American owner of a movie trailer production company who recently ended another unhappy relationship due to boyfriend infidelities. It's a few weeks to Christmas and they both want to escape across the pond. Iris swaps her cozy, Surrey cottage (exactly what all Americans think everyone outside of London lives in) for Amanda's Bel Aire mansion (what everyone outside of LA thinks Calfornians live in). From here, their stories are told independently without much intermingling (save one phone call).<br/><br/>Iris travels to America, is suitably overwhelmed with the mansion she is staying in and and meets up with Amanda's co-worker, Miles (Jack Black), a movie score composer. Their friendship begins along with a friendship with Amanda's neighbor, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) a writer from the golden age of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet (Iris) was a gem in this and I am not always a fan (see Hideous Kinky). I could really feel for her character, feel her pain and understand her story arc. Jack Black is really out of his element here which is a crying shame because he did brilliantly and I would love to see him as a normal, romantic lead again sometime. I really loved his character and the way he brought him to life on film. Eli Wallach made me wish I was Iris and could spend evenings in his company listening to him tell me about his life. (on a side note, I would definitely watch a film based just on the Arthur Abbott character)<br/><br/>Amanda travels to England to stay in a tiny cottage in the English Countryside. She is, of course, completely out of her element (ie driving on the wrong side of the road, tiny bathtub, farm animals, etc). She meets Iris' brother, Graham (Jude Law), who I believe is an editor of some kind. They connect rather quickly due to some alcoholic influence, and Graham seems to be another guy with secrets that she can't trust. Cameron Diaz has never been my favorite actress but I can usually put the mild distaste out of my mouth long enough to enjoy the movie (see Knight and Day) but she was just dreadful in this...at least at the beginning. I can't tell if she forgot how to act, or if she was directed to overact scene as if she were in a high school play. Either way, I usually fast forward right through her scenes. Jude Law is an actor I don't have much knowledge of but I though he did a fine performance. Outside of Sherlock Holmes and AI, I don't think I've seen any of his other films (how is that possible?). Any defects in his character were written that way, not acted poorly.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a lighthearted Christmas rom-com. It's the perfect film for an afternoon in front of the Christmas tree with a cup of hot cocoa."

Amanda has just found out her live in boyfriend is cheating on her with his assistant and decides to kick him out. Both find themselves feeling alone right before Christmas in need of an escape.

Amanda soon finds herself in a complicated situation with Iris brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris meets a 90 year old man and Miles (Jack Black) who both help her find confidence in herself. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is feeling alive and finding happiness in unexpected places. Both Iris and Amanda have been living their life in slow motion and the movie shows how they grow into their own as it progresses. Iris finds that LA is just what she needed and Amanda finds something truly amazing in England bringing a change in herself that she did not know was possible any longer. Iris finds the truth in herself and the ability to move past her previous complications through her interaction with her neighbor. Amanda finds that maybe she is not as distant a person as she had previously thought and has the ability to become something more to both herself and someone else. <br/><br/>The movie is similar too It's Complicated another Nancy Meyers movie with Meryl Streep. Both movies have a character that has been scorned by love previously and is trying to move on with their lives and find joy in to begin life again. It is important in both movies that the characters be recognized in the beginning for the past that has led them to where they are moving towards for the duration of the film. <br/><br/>The movie has a great use of both lighting and sound. It finds a way to introduce the lighting when Amanda is first in Iris home by herself by using the darkness and shadows to reflect the true feeling of being alone. The lighting is also showcased when Iris is in Amanda homes for the first time and a huge ray of light is brought in as if here she may find the hope that has been lost. The sound is terrific in playing music that fits the mood of the film. The high and low points have a mix of music that is both recognizable and meaningful during the moments of climax for the film. <br/><br/>The movie may have had lags in trying to move towards the ending of the film, but all in all the idea that making sure we are living our lives and finding joy were made dominant.

","Cameron Diaz plays Amanda, workaholic owner of a movie trailer production company. Amanda lives in a huge, beautiful home in Los Angeles. Kate Winslet plays Iris, newspaper society column writer. Iris lives in a quaint old cottage in Surrey, outside of London. Both Amanda and Iris experience romantic disappointments just in time for Christmas. Alone and depressed at home is no way to spend the holiday season. Through a home swap website the two women find each other and find their solution. They will swap homes for two weeks. In that tried and true romantic comedy formula it will prove to be two weeks that will change their lives.<br/><br/>Initially it appears Iris has gotten much the better of the deal. She revels in the luxuries of Amanda's swanky digs. Meanwhile Amanda is well and truly out of her element in the small cottage in the English countryside. On day one she plans to fly back home on day two. But then there's a knock on the door in the middle of the night, Iris' inebriated brother Graham looking for a place to sleep. Hey, you don't suppose Amanda and Graham might fall for one another do you? As I said, tried and true romantic comedy formula. Back in Los Angeles things are going well for Iris. She meets some interesting people, most notably Arthur, an old man with quite a life story. He was a writer during the Golden Age of Hollywood and he and Iris strike up an unusual and thoroughly charming friendship.<br/><br/>The film meanders quite a bit, bouncing back and forth between Amanda and Iris. It does drag at times, at 136 minutes long the film is probably a half hour or so too long for its own good. It's rather predictable, sticking to its formula though it does manage to spring a good surprise or two. For much of its running time the film is much more focused on Amanda and Diaz than on Iris and Winslet. Which is a shame because Iris is a much more likable, embraceable character than Amanda. Plus, it's nice to see Winslet in a lighthearted romantic comedy, just having fun. We know she's a great actress, here she gets a chance to just be funny and enjoy herself and she does very well with the opportunity. Not that Diaz is bad, she does well with her part as well and eventually some of Amanda's rough edges do wear down allowing that character's story to become more enjoyable. The pairing of Diaz and Jude Law, playing Graham, works well. Law is perfect playing a cad, albeit a charming cad. And just when you think you've got his character pegged his story goes to some surprising, interesting places. Meanwhile the pairing between Winslet and Eli Wallach, playing Arthur, is tremendous. Two magnificent performers bringing the best out of one another. Of course to fit the formula we need a romantic interest for Winslet's character so enter Jack Black. Jack Black? Certainly not the conventional choice for a romantic leading man but it works. Yes, even Jack Black is charming in this movie. The Holiday is no work of great, classic cinema. It's just a routine romantic comedy and for its genre it's better than most. It's got wit, laughs, charm and very good performances. Yes, it's predictable and formulaic.

But I suspect it won't ever make anyone's list of top 50 movies for the holidays, even though it's got the exact right title for making that list.<br/><br/>One reason to watch this film is Eli Wallach, who is a real treat.

","Every girl knows what it is like to go through relationship problems. The film The Holiday is an epic example of precisely that. This film is about two women from very different backgrounds whom which end up going through similar relationship troubles simultaneously. Both are intrigued with the typical idea of ""running away"" from their problems in order to regroup and catch a break. The two women end up switching homes which are located in different countries, and end up meeting local guys they fall head over heels in love with despite their better efforts not to. The main characters include Cameron Diaz (Amanda Woods), Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins), Jude Law (Graham), and Jack Black (Miles). The film was released in 2006, and directed by Nancy Meyers.<br/><br/>A film's theme is important. A theme is the central concern around which literary work or film is structured, its unifying focus. Basically, the film The Holiday has a common theme seen in a lot of so-called ""chick-flicks"" the usual love debacle. The film focuses on the idea that instead of giving up on love, sometimes you have to look in different places and branch out. The film helps communicate the life experience of broken hearts and falling in love. Both Iris and Amanda experienced a broken heart that left them hopeless and almost ruined. Also alike, both Iris and Amanda ended up falling in love again ironically with men of different qualities of their ex-boyfriends. Graham, who ends up with Amanda and Miles, who ends up with Iris. This film can be closely related to other ""chick-flicks"" such as Valentine's Day. The film Valentine's Day also displays a number of women who struggle with men and love, and ends up showing the viewer that things do not always end up so bad.<br/><br/>Many filming techniques were used throughout the film. One of the best used techniques was the use of lighting during the filming scenes in Iris's cottage. When Amanda first arrived to the cottage she was unsure of it. Coming from a large, bright lighted, rigid mansion the dim cottage was unfamiliar. However, as Amanda continued her stay at Iris's cottage, the coziness grew upon her. Another technique used throughout the film was the ability to create an emotional atmosphere. The director utilized the setting of various scenes to create deep emotion felt by the broken hearted girls. Overall, the thematic elements of The Holiday truly portrayed the truest form of a love story displayed through film and acting."

The plot is as full & satisfactory as it can be for this kind of movie, the characters are nicely reflected, and the film brings you a smile, brightening your mood in one way or another. One of the main problems with this genre is trying to add funny bits and ending up in a ridiculous scenario, but thankfully, this does not happen in The Holiday - there's no exaggeration regarding the comedy aspect. There's also a bonus in this film, the character, ""Arthur Abbott"", played by Eli Wallach, who pretty much steals the show. I loved his parts and Kate Winslet surely did not disappoint, either.

","""The Holiday"", is by far one of the best love films of the new millennium. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) was a successful business woman from Los Angeles, California who lacked the ability to express her emotions. She decides to try something new and take a vacation after the breakup with her unfaithful boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns). While in search of the best get-a-way, Amanda stumbles across Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) from London, England. Iris finds out that her ex-boyfriend Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell) of whom she is still in love with tends to marry someone else. After a series of instant messaging the two ladies decide to exchange lives for two weeks. Amanda not accustomed to the atmosphere of England begins to question her decisions and prepare to travel back home. That is until she meets Graham (Judd Law), Iris's older and handsome brother. Life for Iris was going great in the sunny state of California. She happens to meet a gentleman and well respected Hollywood script writer by the name of Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach). Iris took a special interest in Arthur and they both became a necessity for each other's well-being. Miles (Jack Black) is a music composer who is head over hills in love with Maggie (Shannyn Sossamon). Maggie is an actress who does not reciprocate the same feelings that Miles has. Meanwhile, he finds himself falling for Iris and his way of thinking becomes more apparent after he spotted Maggie on a date with another man.<br/><br/>The theme of ""The Holiday"" is how you have to break out of your comfort zone to see what else life has to offer; otherwise you could be limiting yourself and other resources. We get to comfortable and complacent in situations while not realizing that there could be better opportunities for happiness. Amanda and Iris had no idea that taking this huge risk would allow them to fill the void that they were missing. Iris finally had the strength to stand up to Jasper after experiencing the joy that Arthur and Miles provided. Amanda found herself shedding tears while leaving England after her two week vacation. This was the point when she realized how much Graham changed her life. ""The Cider House Rules"", demonstrates the same concept. Homer, the orphan from St. Clouds, had never been away from the home besides failed adoptions as a child. He comes to the conclusion that he wants to see the world and partake in everyday normal activities. Homer gathered the courage to leave the orphanage so he could have something to compare life to. Amanda and Iris both discovered the value of love and happiness in places they had never been. <br/><br/>The camera's angle focused a lot of Amanda's facial expressions. For instance, the scene where she and Graham share one of their intimate moments cast off a surprised and shocked look. Amanda did not expect for Graham to pour his heart out and say the things he said. Therefore, her non verbal communication caused him to become defensive. She attempted to play it off by providing him with a kiss. Amanda's hard shelled feelings would not allow her to open up and step out her comfort zone. Then the camera goes black and switches to the next scene. The lighting created a beautiful picturesque idea of California while England was snowy and cold. Both ladies had to become adjusted to the time change in order to appreciate the house exchange. Once Iris discovered she was able to block out the piercing sunny light her life was great. Amanda and Iris were grateful for the sun and the snow after they came to find that their environments were just a small part of their happiness."

","It's a chick flick. I don't like romantic comedies in general. However, this movie has a kind of deepness for its own genre and well-acting, writing and directing. Not cheesy nor silly.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is great in her role as always. Jude is as well. Even Diaz is acting very well. And watching Eli Wallach in the good-old fashioned film writer role especially is enjoyable.

","Don't let the sleepy title and strange pairing of Kate Winslet and Jack Black put you off, this movie is one sweet surprise! In a genre filled with sub standard offerings, these days, it is just hard to find quality romantic comedies. <br/><br/>Nancy Meyers skillfully gels her cast together to a helium light Story line and sets the right pacing and tone for this movie. It would be intriguing to see her instead do some serious drama stuff. <br/><br/>The script seems tailor made for Jude law and everyone knows that romantic comedy is Cameron Diaz's forte. You do worry for the spontaneously combustible Jack Black but gladfully he keeps to within the required boundaries and even add some good diversity here.<br/><br/>There are hidden gems in the sub plot and Elli Wallach, Miffy Englefield together with Emma Pritchard all shine adding warmth to this charming movie."

","Amanda Woods is an LA woman in the movie business with a big mansion and everything going for her until she recently discovered that her boyfriend had been cheating on her behind her back. Across the pond we meet an English journalist Iris Simpkins- a woman who feels she just can't get away from a particular man that enjoys having affairs with her on and off. Recently he becomes engaged to another woman, crushing Iris's heart when he still constantly messes with her after the announcement. Out of heartbreak the two woman meet through a vacation home exchange website and agree to switch places for a few weeks, having a bit of culture shock as Amanda had never experienced the simple life and Iris the riches. Expecting to be on vacation in solitude Amanda meets a Iris's brother and an affair begins, sprouting something bigger than they expected. Iris soon meets a movie composer and a veteran from the golden age of cinema. She befriends the old man and invites the composer with her during each visit as their relationship grows into a deep friendship. As both women's heartbreak starts to mend, the dread of going back starts to sink in as new love heals the injuries of heartbreak's past, changing their lives forever...<br/><br/>For a chick flick I must say, despite several clichés in the genre, it is certainly a set of heartwarming stories for the Christmas season. If you ever had the chance to view the trailer and the film both, you'll see that both are completely different. The Holiday will throw your emotions off guard in several scenes. Cameron Diaz's portrayal of Amanda is a double-edge sword of her usual mediocre, whiny, hollow characters throughout her career. Yes, she is quite annoying and typical in this film but actually works for her character when it comes to her development. Despite my disliking for her character I found her scene where she makes a surprise visit to Jude Law's character's home, discovering that he's more than just some random guy to have sex with- but a single father of two daughters with many other insecurities. It's a great scene of vulnerability for the characters on this part of the story and my personal favorite of the film. Kate Winslet's role as Iris is far more interesting though. As damaged goods from an on-and-off affair with a man, it's a far more vulnerable though clichéd performance and yet much more relatable to the target audience. A sweet young girl in a strange town, managing to come across an old man clearly in need. She is unable to resist and helps him out, discovering at his home that he spent the majority of his life as a writing in the golden age of the movie business. She also befriends a music composer of movie soundtracks that joins her in visits with the old man. This part of the story is honestly more interesting and heartfelt. It's not quite romance just yet. It's more of a portrayal of a budding relationship. Jack Black plays the love-interest for Iris. Not the greatest looking guy in the movie but he certainly has a lot of charm (and somehow able to hold some form of class for Jack Black standards, though there is a signature ""Scrubaly-doodaly-doo"" scene present, though surprisingly fitting). Overall the film makes a pleasant surprise of a chick flick that clearly has it's flaws here and there but the film itself knows it as well. It's a simple, entertaining, heartwarming movie that's best watched with a loved one (significant other, mother, grandmother). Come for the unexpected warmth, stay for the tear-jerking moments, leave for the harsh whine of Diaz. Something that could've been a really great modern classic but not quite there yet."

","This movies starts out with two women living in two different parts of the country and living totally different lifestyles but facing similar issues with relationships. Cameron Diaz plays Amanda Woods in the story and Kate Winslet plays Iris Simpkins. While Amanda lives in LA in a huge home, Iris lives in a small home setting in the middle of the country in England. The theme of the film is present from the beginning with the two women dealing with failed relationships and facing Christmas alone.<br/><br/>Amanda and Iris decide they need a change of scenery and find each other online and end up swapping homes for a few weeks. Both of them, with the idea they will go somewhere that no men can be found. At first when they arrive at each other's home Iris is amazingly surprised how huge the house is and seems very excited. But Amanda arrives at a simple styled home out the country, where she has to walk a good distances to the home. Her driver could not even drive down the road to the cottage due to snow. While this started off relaxing holiday they both become lonely.<br/><br/>Iris's brother Graham played by Jude Law stops by her home not realizing Amanda was there and sparks start to fly. In the meantime Iris meets a film producer Myles played by Jack Black and forms her own relationship as well. The story plays on the development of these to relationships which eventually find them all together in Iris's home celebrating the New Year.<br/><br/>They camera men did a great job with the film, a one example was the way they used a wide angle shot. This shot really accented the length of the road Amanda was walking to the cottage to make you understand the distance. Another example was the lighting as it shows when the girls are instant messaging each other the room. The room is very dark around them and the light appears to focus on the two girls. This really draws your attention to the message they are typing versus other items in the room.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a lot of the movie Love Actually which also focuses on finding love in unexpected places. Overall I think this was a good romantic comedy and was surprisingly delightful. I think the actors all did a great job portraying their characters and bringing forth a believable performance. This was a good chick flick that I would recommend to anyone."

","I loved this film. It brings the feel of Christmas, romance, courage and friendship to a new level. The story is about two women switching houses and ultimately finding what they needed and wanted in their lives. Yes, cliché- but the film itself still has plenty of substance and originality with a romantic comedy storyline.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet just shines in this film and her character is just so easy to relate to. Cameron Diaz who plays 'Amanda' presented herself well in this film also. Very good acting in this film, especially with the rest of the cast- (Jude Law, Eli Wallach, Jack Black..) Bottom line: I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves chick flicks, Christmas movies, or just in the mood for a feel good film. This movie will always remain in my winter classics and the reason it being is how lighthearted and great it makes you feel for the characters from beginning to end."

","When watching this movie one can only be impressed with Cameron Diaz. This is her movie; her wonderful performance makes this movie work. Although the story is mostly Hollywood fluff and is about as substantive as a cloud in the sky, Ms. Diaz brings life to what would otherwise be a implausible facsimile of an actual story. The always beautiful Kate Winslet is wonderful too but in this movie she definitely plays second fiddle to Ms. Diaz's lead. As for the story itself, it has so many holes in it that there is not enough room to discuss them all. Suffice it to say, this movie is character, not story, driven. The male leads, Jude Law and Jack Black, are to be commended for subordinating themselves to the ladies; after all, this is a movie about two women who do something daring and in the process change their lives. But regardless of what one may think of the story, Cameron Diaz's presence will, for you, make watching this movie an entertaining experience."

","The holiday is a good movie, great cast, but gives no credit to the fact that it completely follows the entire idea of the fantastic novel Tara Road by Maeve Binchy. Both involve two women with struggling relationships escaping their lives in other countries in each others homes. the story lines are extremely similar, including their relationship problems, how they went about switching homes, and their changes to themselves and their lives in the time of their visit to another country. Although a great idea, should give credit to the author who wrote the novel in 1999.And the book is much better anyway! would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this movie."

","From the beginning, this movie had me -- Kate Winslet is adorable as Iris -- the love-forlorn, hopeless romantic! Her side of the movie wins hands down! For many reasons -- the fabulous Eli Wallach, who plays her new California neighbor and Jack Black, who shines as her new love interest.<br/><br/>I usually would side with any part of a movie that has Jude Law, but the sleazy relationship start-up with Cameron Diaz is out of character (no pun intended) for both of them! Diaz' character Amanda is about as over-the-top, over-acted and unbelievable as they come. I've seen this movie dozens of times and still can't believe somebody exists on this planet that is such a needy, dumb ass as Amanda, who can be as successful as the writers have created her to be. What were these writers thinking? Fairy tales? Pathetic! <br/><br/>Back to the good part of the movie -- Ms. Winslet is a joy to watch -- she brings realism to a character that is sorrowfully tangled in the worst of relationships -- unrequited love! Her character is a brilliant writer who makes every effort to move forward while trying to forget the selfish man that has stolen the last three years of her life, played brilliantly by the handsome Rufus Sewell.<br/><br/>The connection between the two stories, via house-swapping is believable, but the story as a whole is lopsided. The story of Iris is rather fulfilling, but the story of Amanda has so many holes -- the only blessing is the reference to the ""Three Musketeers"", which is thin at best, but sweet.<br/><br/>Great holiday, romantic movie for people to watch... but I'm not sure it will stand the test of time in comparison to The Bishop's Wife! I will continue to watch The Holiday though -- no matter what the season! I loved it! :D"

","Superficial, manipulative Hollywood junk written by the same computer program most of these are only with the ""dialogue lines length parameter"" set to double of normal as characters are basically thinking and occasionally even reading out loud, which is just an incredibly stupid thing to do. The characters can be entirely described by their professions - script writer, producer, film composer and so on - making me wonder if Nancy Meyers ever took a step out of Beverly Hills. Starring seduced Jude Law, castrated Jack Black, Cameron Diaz on ecstasy and die-trying Kate Winslet, all just frustratingly overplaying their roles which still don't feature any real human characteristics and thereby look like cut-outs from an Elle magazine. Basically everyone is acting as inflatable romantic-robots, always barbarically bashing out the perfect line that ""every woman would want to hear"" at that point. I wonder if the generation growing up on these things will reflect some of it in their private lives.<br/><br/>If you want real feelings, turn to Wes Anderson or Sam Mendes."

","From director Nancy Meyers (The Parent Trap, What Women Want), I knew the four big stars of the film, and knew it was a Christmassy film, so naturally I thought I'd give it a chance. Basically in London, England, newspaper writer Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) has found out the man she had a big crush on, Jasper Bloom (A Knight's Tale's Rufus Sewell) is marrying another woman and doesn't care about her at all. In Los Angeles, America, movie trailer maker Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) has broken up with her unfaithful boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and wants to forget him, and is unable to physically cry. Looking at a house exchange website, Amanda comes across Iris's house, and they agree to swap houses for two weeks, during the Christmas holiday, so Iris gets Amanda's luxury mansion, and Amanda gets Iris's adequate cottage in Surrey. In Surrey, Amanda quickly meets, sleeps with and falls in love with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law), while in L.A. Iris meets her famous next door neighbour, legendary screen writer, 90-year-old Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), and film composer Miles Dumont (Jack Black). Amanda has trouble adjusting to the small changes living with Graham, learning he has children from his deceased wife, while Iris is enjoying getting to know about the life of Arthur, and hanging out a little with Miles. There is the point when Amanda leaves thinking she is making the right decision, but when she finally physically cries (and movie trailer narrator Hal Douglas welcomes her back) she knows it isn't, and goes back to Graham. Iris also has Jasper coming to the house, and Miles having his girlfriend asking him back, but she manages to get an honour for Arthur, announces she does not love Jasper anymore, and after ending it with his girlfriend, Miles asks Iris for a date. Also starring Nicholas Downs as Peter, Miffy Englefield as Sophie, Sarah Parish as Hannah and A Knight's Tale's Shannyn Sossamon as Maggie, with appearances from James Franco, Lindsay Lohan and Dustin Hoffman. Diaz and Law make a pretty good couple, but Winslet and Black only have chemistry as friends and are hardly seen looking like their going to fall in love at all, a slightly disappointing romantic comedy, but worth a look I guess. Okay!"
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","1","15 January 2010"," Lightweight but Enjoyable
","""The Holiday"" is a romantic comedy which features two romances rather than the more usual one. (Mind you, ""Love Actually"" is a rom-com which tells the stories of numerous different romances). The two main characters are Amanda Woods, an American editor of movie trailers and Iris Simpkins, a British journalist working for The Daily Telegraph. (Spot the product placement!) Both have recently suffered romantic disappointments. Iris is suffering from unrequited love for a colleague while Amanda has discovered that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Looking for an escape, Iris goes to a home swap website, and exchanges homes for the Christmas holidays with Amanda, whom she has never met. This being a romantic comedy, of course, both women have to fall in love, Amanda with Iris' handsome brother Graham and Iris with a musician named Miles.<br/><br/>Apart from the double love stories the main theme of the film is cultural differences between more traditional Britain and more laid-back America, with both women coming to appreciate the good points of each other's country. These differences are emphasised by a difference in look between a wintry, snowbound Surrey, where Iris lives in a quaint rural cottage and a sunny Los Angeles where Amanda has an ultra-modern luxury home. This was presumably the point of setting the American scenes in southern California, one of the few parts of the USA to remain warm and sunny even in December; had Amanda lived in, say, New England the visual contrast between the two settings would have been lessened.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties with a ""double rom-com"" like this one is that there is not always sufficient space to tell both stories in detail. Here the ""English"" Amanda-Graham romance is developed in greater depth than the ""American"" Iris-Miles one. The English story involves much more character development and tells the normal rom-com story of how the obstacles to the love of the two characters are overcome. In this case the main obstacle is that Graham initially seems to Amanda (and the audience) to be a charming but selfish womaniser; it is only later that she discovers the truth about him, namely that he is in reality a widower looking for a stepmother for his two young daughters. The story of Iris and Miles, by comparison, seems a mere makeweight. Indeed, much of the American story involves Iris' friendship with the elderly screenwriter Arthur who seems to have known all the great names from the Golden Age of Hollywood.<br/><br/>This was Kate Winslet's last film before she went on to make the ultra-serious ""The Reader"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" in 2008, so I was glad to see that she can also act in something lighter. I was also pleasantly surprised by Cameron Diaz, who made Amanda an attractive heroine. In the past I have normally associated Cameron with rubbish like ""The Sweetest Thing"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" and have regarded her as being out of her depth when attempting something more serious like ""Gangs of New York"". ""The Holiday"", however, is one of her better performances. The generally reliable Jude Law was also good as Graham, and there is also a nice cameo from the veteran Eli Wallach (aged 91 at the time) as Arthur. The one actor I did not like much was Jack Black as Miles. Black seems most at home in zany comedies; rom-coms are not really his forte.<br/><br/>One of the main pleasures for me was recognising places I know, as I used to live in Guildford, close to Godalming and Shere where the scenes in England were filmed. Overall, ""The Holiday"" is a lightweight film, but a pleasant and enjoyable one. It makes a more welcome addition to the ever-growing corpus of Christmas films than much of the sentimental slush we have to endure year after year. 7/10"

","Let me say right away that I do not like the Hollywood view of England we always seem to get - snowy winters, cosy cottages, unspoilt countryside, everybody working in media and driving Range Rovers etc. I also do not like the way they re-write well-known historical facts: you should spot the glaring mistake.<br/><br/>But as a story it definitely works. The beginning is dire, but fortunately the film changes direction quite swiftly. Although at times there appear to be two opposing forces dragging this movie in different directions, it actually manages to overcome this. We basically have a core of five good actors - well, four very good actors and Jude Law - who tell a compelling story in a watchable and mostly likable manner. Those on the fringes are thankfully restricted to a few short scenes, as they add very little in terms of the story or the acting.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of romance and soppy chick-flicks, and ordinarily I'd say anything over 2.5 hours is excessive, but I actually could have watched another 2.5 hours of this. It manages to balance perfectly the two emerging and distinctly different love affairs (+ a bonus, heartwarming friendship) so that it's almost like watching two movies at once. Its not going to appeal to everyone, but if you appreciate a good story well told, can forgive the bizarre inaccuracies and the weak-ish ending, then you are in for a treat."

","I was encouraged to see this film on TV last night because of the vast array of talent on offer. Sadly the lead performances are overacted and the girls clearly are not comfortable in the things the director has made them do (Diaz dancing in the cottage, Jude Law only just comes out unscathed). This would have been passable except that the plot is tedious. Oddly enough what really made it unbelievable is that when Winslet returns home from work early on she manages to leave late from work, still get a train to Surrey, get from the station to a country road and then walk miles down it. All apparently within 40 mins of London, more like 2 1/2 hours. <br/><br/>Having lived in the city for years this is too stupid and it shows that the film was so busy trying to be sweet and idyllic that it forget to make any sense. This is picky I know but follow that up with the English driver refusing to drive the car down the snowy lane. WHAT!

","Spoilers <br/><br/>Without the soundtrack the movie would have bombed. It is not very funny, and pretty unrealistic. At certain points the plot is downright silly and totally fairy tale oriented. But the music is another story. It makes you want to believe in the fairy tale ending that is on the screen. Let's face it, if you wanted a fairy tale ending, how do people achieve a real fairy tale ending? By believing in it! <br/><br/>The music inspires us to want to believe, and by the ending, we get caught up and do believe in this fantasy. The characters as well, want to believe they can be happy and go after the fairy tale ending, and in the end by believing they are happy, the become very happy. (I know this is pretty complex). This movie has the same ""belief suspension"" as Flashdance and Rocky II. However, if you can suspend reality for a couple hours, it is worth viewing. And really, when you think about it, maybe it isn't that unrealistic that people with heartbreak can get past the things that kept holding them back and eventually find true love. <br/><br/>The story is of two women who are unlucky at love. One lives in California and the other in England. They swap houses, temporarily. In their new settings, they find new love. For one character, (Played by Kate Winslet) her old flame comes after her. He wants to continue to ""string her along"". If he is successful, this will cause her to dump her new boyfriend (played by Jack Black), who is also being retrieved/pursued by his old unfaithful flame. After much thought, Kate's character finally comes to her senses and dumps the man who's been stringing her along, (telling him repeatedly ""GET OUT!"" and ""I have a life to live; and you're not going be in it."" and finally kicking him out the door and slamming hard it in his face). At that point the very inspirational music builds to a crescendo climax. She runs gleefully to escort an elderly man (played by Eli Wallach) to an award ceremony, her new love comes along after dumping his old unfaithful flame and they set up for a New Year's celebration in England. <br/><br/>The other woman Amanda Woods is played by Cameren Diaz has a male announcer's voice narrating her life as she dumps her old unfaithful boyfriend and continues a life of not trusting men. Because of not trusting men, she refuses to get real close. She follows a path of dumping the good ones and is continuing along that path with her new love played by Jude Law.<br/><br/>When leaving him to go back to California, she rides in a cab and it drives out the winding road away from his house. She then cries for the first time in years, and has an epiphany that is coupled with the male narrators voice saying ""Amanda Woods, Welcome Back"" that is also coupled with another inspirational song that causes her to turn the cab around and race back to her new love. The cab does not move fast enough and she gets out and runs accompanied by the most beautiful crescendo climax in the music. She tells her new love she wants to stay and have a New Years with him in England. The movie winds up a scene of the New Years party and the two newly formed couples dancing and having a good time and forgetting any heartache."

The England part of the storyline is almost sickeningly sweet with Jude Law's two adorable girls. Clearly the film's creators want to tug at our heart strings. Unfortunately, the whole thing's too overtly manipulative to be enjoyable. Still watchable though.<br/><br/>Overall 5/10"

","I like Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law. I went to see this with my America girlfriend and a good mate in Los Angeles and it certainly made me feel homesick. And also a little sick on the schmaltz. The film worked really well although there were some parts where I felt it was dragging along, Eli Wallach and the kids in the tent, and it got very saccharine sweet in those parts too. But they are just small points. Jude Law came across as very human indeed and so did Jack Black. One of the best parts is that I know both L.A and the villages of Shere, Gomshall and Godalming, where the English scenes were filmed. And because of the film, I took my lady friend from Texas to the pub in Shere where Cameron waited for Jude by the open fire - and it is truly is beautiful at Christmas time. Schmaltz or no schmaltz, it's a lovely film to watch curled up by your own fire in the midst of winter."

","Don't jump to the ceiling yet, don't get up into the sky. That's not the film of the next century, nor decade. That's not even the comedy of the present decade. It is just a decent comedy, romantic, sentimental and happy to the highest uppermost acme of what we can conceive as a happy ending. In fact the structure is Shakespearian to the very detail in every scene. ""As You like It"" is the model and here we are even nearly modest, shy about the happy ending. Shakespeare managed to have four marriages at the end of his play, and he will do it again at the end of his ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Here we have only two couples who find their happy ending in England, because frankly such a thing cannot happen in Los Angeles the country of fake make-believe. The real stuff can only happen in the depth of Surrey, with a cow in the back garden and a tent in the girl's bedroom. But it is funny and at the same time it is slightly ironically critical of what Hollywood has become in its superficial illusionary virtual reality based on special effects and canned sentiments and roles, when it is not preserved music that comes out of the brain of an elevator, even if the British may call that a lift that can lift your fat, flesh and bones but will never lift, not to speak of elevating, your artistic and musical senses. And to prove his point, the director, though I should say directress to be accurate even if that is not politically correct and I cannot use a word like directing person that has not yet succeeded to escalator-ize itself up to the tip of my tongue, has a cameo of an aging Dustin Hoffman appearing in the aisles of a DVD store in the background of ""The Graduate"" where he was a juicy short student looking for the way to lose his maidenhead or should I say bachelor-head between the legs of a ripe woman. Maybe Hollywood might be becoming in the coming decade realistic and more human, closer to real life, probably under the influence of the competition that is already simmering in India, in China, in Asia in general, and in Europe of course, though Europe is still bogged up in the mud of the tradition of cultural protectionism which is nothing but the impotence in front of the challenge that comes from outside. A funny film and a question at the end: how in hell are they going to fly a cow from London's Heathrow Airport to Los Angeles International Airport? I guess Air France will volunteer since they are the European specialist of the air-lift of all kinds of cattle in between two strikes when the passengers are treated by the striking personnel as samples of the valueless cattle that deserves nothing but being sent to the local slaughterhouse to get out of the way of their resistance to change and restructuring, just before the company is bought up by Air China or Aeroflot, now Russian millionaires are buying newspapers in France, and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","By one scene this film was ruined for me.<br/><br/>Within one day of ending a bad relationship, the character Amanda Woods travels a quarter of the world away from her problem. She's staying in an isolated house in a land unfamiliar to her. It's night. A vulgar drunk, a stranger, pounds on her front door. And what does she do? She opens the door to him. Not Smart. He staggers into the house, then the bathroom, where he urinates the alcohol out of his system. Based upon this first impression she decides she has to have him. They share a drink. He invites himself to stay in the house for the night. She agrees. They move to a couch and begin kissing. She reasons away her self-respect by justifying lust with a stranger. Eight and a half minutes (!) after meeting this man she leads him to the bedroom.<br/><br/>This is what they offer women as an example to follow in romance? This is supposed to be our dream? And at Christmas no less. This scene is human degradation wrapped in a pretty package. With all films it is necessary for the viewer to suspend disbelief. But to suspend your morals, discernment, or basic common sense? No. That is too much to ask. I won't give over my understanding of the difference between what is right and what is wrong to lend dignity to an objectionable idea that's been manipulated to appear beautiful.<br/><br/>With this scene set early as the foundation of the ""love"" story I couldn't enjoy the remainder of the film. The film was too tainted for any later tenderness to redeem it in my eyes."

","I watched most of this late one Saturday night when nothing else was on. I love Kate Winslet and was very disappointed in her choice to do this very stupid movie. The story was unoriginal and the characters uninspiring. Diaz plays her normal drunk, dimwitted and slightly slutty character. Jude Law was unattractive (hard to do) as a ""nice"" widower with 2 young daughters. Jack Black was an unfunny fat guy that somehow attracts Kate Winslet's character. Overall the movie was a pitiful attempt at drawing viewers into these characters lives. Diaz is always the same but can be good in certain movies (in Her Shoes). Law is not sexy in this part and Winslet and Black;s characters seem to be too tired to look for anyone better."
"Eaglegrafix","3","0","1","19 January 2008"," The Holiday Spoils itself without any help here.
","Don't worry about the mild spoilers here, the movie spoils itself very soon after the title sequence.<br/><br/>Even romantic comedies need a story with some kind of anticipation or suspense. Even mediocre romantic comedies have twists in the story and lead the view down one path before springing an unsuspected element on them. But truly awfully bad romantic comedies do not need any of that because you can discover in the first 5 minutes of the film what the final scene will be. You know who will end up with whom and you will know why. You just have to watch how they move from development of character to the final and very obvious conclusion.<br/><br/>The Holiday is just that kind of movie. So if you love romantic comedies and love to predict without any chance of being wrong, this is the movie you should see. But it is not a good movie, just an overly sweet story where four good actors made some quick easy money and walked away without looking back.<br/><br/>Ms. Diaz is as charming as ever but did not fit this role or do it justice in the slightest. Nothing about her performance convinced me she was who she was playing or could actually even be that person. Ms. Winslet was a bit more charming and convincing but only when she was in her scenes with Eli Wallach - the only character in the whole film that brought anything to the role or made me even care about the film. I was more interested to see if Arthur Abbott (Wallach) was going to make the big event honoring him or not.<br/><br/>Using Jude Law was a waste of great talent on a role that was so tangled I could care less about his character. And Jack Black is...well Jack Black. Sometimes charming, sometimes childish and sometimes acting as if his character was in a different movie.<br/><br/>So after three of the four main characters had been introduced and the story began to develop, I knew Miles (Black) and Iris (Winslet) would be together in the end and they had not even met in the movie yet. And when Graham (Law) stumbled drunk into the cottage where Amanda (Diaz) was staying, I knew the knot had been all but tied.<br/><br/>But when the limo driver would not drive down the lane to drop Diaz off at the cottage when she arrived (because he would not be able to turn around ""down the lane""), and we see her dragging two large suitcases through the snow for several hundred meters, I knew that the director/writer were more skilled at contrivance than at either directing or writing. I was proved right when the same limo driver somehow shows up at the cottage to pick Amanda up near the end of the movie. And somewhere on the lane from the cottage, when Amanda demands he go back, he turns around with no difficulty. Not good enough, Amanda, in what is a mix of hot flash and panic attack acting runs ahead of the limo across fields and through gates she never closes to return to her love in the cottage. That was the comedy part I laughed at finally. I'm still looking for the romantic part.<br/><br/>But writers and directors have to start somewhere so I give this pair a 3 and do not blame good actors for being a movie that is not worth the time or money to even rent it."

The premise of two broken-hearted women (why not men?) getting over a relationship and amazingly both having a house available at exactly the same time to do a house swap is incredulous and suspends and defies belief. Oh yes, and then they find love!(Bless!) From then on,it's all downhill (with me so far?)I rate Cameron Diaz as a fine comic actress, Jude's a cracker as haunted man, Jack rocks and Kate, well what can you say about Kate?

","I made the 'mistake' of telling a girl at college i thought Cameron Diaz was good in 'Theres Something About Mary', so predictably the next day i was entrusted with some Diaz films, 'In Her Shoes' and 'The Holiday'.<br/><br/>To be honest i wasn't exactly thrilled at the prospect of watching these. Having read the blurbs i could tell they were going to be a bit different to 'Theres Something About Mary' and the inclusion of Jude Law added to the feeling of trepidation. After two weeks i could put it off no more and cleared my schedule for what i thought would be a two hour bore-a-thon.<br/><br/>Out of the two i had borrowed i went for The Holiday first, simply due to Jack Black being amongst the cast list.<br/><br/>Anyway, i will admit, it wasn't that bad. The story was quite good. True, it was clichÃ©d, unrealistic (things never slot into place like that) and generally a glorified chick flick pretending to have a 'deeper meaning' but it worked.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet played the 'pathetic doormat' role extremely well.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz was her usual self. Playing the 'not your usual type of girl' role as well as always (has she ever had a different role?). However, i nearly had to turn off during her rendition of 'Mr Brightside'.<br/><br/>Jude Law finally succeeded in playing a ladies man without making me want to vomit. I saw brief flashes of a genuine guy in his character, not the usual sickeningly flawless god type figure.<br/><br/>Jack Black was wasted here. He's a comedy actor and the character didn't play enough to his strengths, i was thinking the role would be more suited to an Elijah Wood type actor, somebody who we don't expect comedy from, only to be let down when it isn't delivered.<br/><br/>Overall: It surprised me in the fact it wasn't dreadful - 6/10"

They have two things in common, hard work & undeserving men. <br/><br/>The idea is fantastic. The cast is great. Kate Winslet is wonderful as the frumpy new Brigit Jones. Cameron Diaz is perfect as the glamorous movie girl from LA and Jude law is a warming handsome country bumpkin.<br/><br/>This is where it all goes wrong. <br/><br/>Bland dialogue. Bland story. And Jack Black as Kate Winslet's love interest? No comment. <br/><br/>One would be sitting in front of the screen thinking ""just please end"". <br/><br/>The budding relationship between Amanda (Diaz) and Graham (Law) falls short in terms of romance. They meet, they have sex a few times and suddenly are ""in love"". There is no real passion or tenderness and their relationship leaves the audience feeling somewhat dissatisfied. Diaz and Law just completely lack chemistry. <br/><br/>The whole story of Iris is uninteresting, it's such a shame since Kate Winslet is a great actress. There is no real character development, she starts off as a doormat and despite her brief rage towards Jasper (her clinging ex) she still is a doormat in the end. <br/><br/>There are no emotional dynamics.

","I don't consider myself being a macho male, but chick flicks like The Holiday do drive me to the edge of being very annoyed and agitated. Men just weren't born for sugary romance stories, with a sappy Christmas atmosphere. The characters are annoyingly psycho-analyzing each other and themselves all the time - this movie must be written by a female, no man tells openly about his fear for relationships like Jude Law does at one point- and every character flaw is brought upon us as being cute and adorable. And don't forget the extremely adorable twin sisters, the cuddly dog and the nice old man. But I must be fair, I did enjoy this movie to some degree. It's always a treat to see beautiful actors as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law interact with each other. Jack Black kinda ticked me off. The guy is hilarious, but in this movie he just didn't fit in. Overall, it is a decent RomCom, one that deserves its place amongst Love Actually and Pretty Woman. I'd favor a more darker approach to the subject of love, but I can also understand why a lot of people like this. Everyone has the right to their taste, don't they? :)"

Jack Black and Kate Winslet had great chemistry together, and it's a shame that he wasn't in the movie longer. I enjoyed the cameo of Dustin Hoffman in the video store when he's trying to rent movies and overhears Jack Black humming Mrs. Robinson and quips ""I can't go anywhere anymore"" I would have rated the movie lower, but I enjoyed Eli Wallach as the retired screenwriter.

"jk_larson","6","0","2","29 October 2007"," Great cast, disappointingly draggy
","This movie could have been so much better. THe problem is the script is DRAGGGY -- it plays like a Harlequin romance on video -- and the direction seems a bit ham-fisted. Astonishing to me that Nancy Myers, whose work I usually adore (BABY BOOM, WHAT WOMEN WANT, SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE), directed and wrote. Too much multi-tasking? <br/><br/>For the first time that I've noticed it, Myers seems to be telescoping everything for the viewer. ""Do you get it -- she's a hysterical woman down on love -- do you get it?"" Give the viewer some credit, and things will move along at a brisker clip.<br/><br/>Perhaps interweaving three story lines was a bit too much -- a Driving-Miss-Daisy-meets-Baby-Boom-Meets-Something's-Gotta-Give. Two of the stories would have been challenging enough. It goes on for 138 minutes? They could have cut 20 and had a nice film.<br/><br/>The musical score is meant to be light and cozy, and it is as gorgeous as a mug of hot cider, but a shorter film would have given it the sparkle it deserved.<br/><br/>I truly like all these actors -- Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black, all fairly charming but a bit underserved here. Nice to see Black in a romantic lead -- still quirky, but more attractive than just his usual jokester appeal. This is how I'm guessing he might be in real life -- away from the frat pack, anyway! In a way, Cameron Diaz fared the best of the four as a neurotic Hollywood maven out of her element -- nice to see her get some challenge and something not too over the top, although there was that too. <br/><br/>Winslet, usually inspiring and inspired, could have benefited with a more controlled direction and not so much hysterics -- I was okay with her screech when she realizes she's dumped Bloom, but the delighted fits upon seeing her new holiday digs were a bit annoying. Again, we get it, she's excitable -- one screech would do it. <br/><br/>Check out Dustin Hoffman's cameo at just the right moment. DOn't blink or you'll miss it.<br/><br/>Two things stretched the bounds of credibility to the max -- a gala organized for Wallach in three days, and Diaz running up the snowy lane in what appeared to be heels. And pausing for Chariots of High Heels dramatic effect. Telescoping, again...<br/><br/>Nice to see Law as a daddy and a crier at that -- not the usual for him. His on-screen daughters? Fabulous, angels both, and yes the tent scene is completely winsome.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like romantic comedy, you should see it. It certainly gives the actors involved a fresh opportunity to show a different side of themselves."

It worked with Something's Gotta Give, but The Holiday it did not. This movie dragged on longer a C-Span debate.<br/><br/>I know Meyers tries to make some sort of moral point about love in her films but I don't know what the point of this film was.<br/><br/>I found myself not laughing much while watching this, instead trying to figure out some of the terminology used during the Hannika scenes. Sorry but I don't know these words and don't find them funny.<br/><br/>There are highlights here. Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet are adorable. Jude Law was very sweet in this film, showing a nice side to him.<br/><br/>As for Jack Black - well I don't know what to say. Here's a guy getting beautiful women and I just don't buy it. I find his 1 liners not to be so funny.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about Diaz and Winslet switching homes for Christmas. Diaz, a focused over-worked business owner travels to the UK to spend her Christmas away from all men. Instead, within 1 day of being there she meets Jude Law. They are a convincing together.<br/><br/>Winslet travels to Diaz's home in LA CA. She is very charming with her English accent. She struggles at times to make a connection with Jack Black, and this is where I feel Nancy Meyers really tried to hard to make them connect. I was not, and still am not convinced that these 2 would even be interested in each other.<br/><br/>There is a character in the film played by Shelley Berman. I'm not sure why this character is in the film. He seems to be obsessed with new Hollywood and stuck in the past. I'm not saying he played his role badly, but instead played a bad role. I usually find old men in films to be easy to connect with - instead I was bored to death.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film one of the last scenes is Winslet taking Berman to an award show honoring him. This scene is totally unnecessary and I'm just not sure what the thought process was here with this.<br/><br/>This is not a love story movie, not a really heart felt movie.<br/><br/>I think the film would have been much more of a success if this was about Diaz and Law falling in love. Their story does have a connection and you can feel it.<br/><br/>This film is about 2:10mins too long.<br/><br/>I give it a thumbs down."

How did the Kate Winslet character get passed the locked gate AND into the house? The taxi driver couldn't take the Cammeron Diaz character to the cottage because of the heavy snow. Fine. Just a scene later, Diaz is in a car (where did that come from), driving through the snow. She's from the US, never driven in the UK where they drive on the opposite side of the road with the snow yet, but she does it just fine. Who takes care of Jude Laws little girls when he's out so much? A supposedly good Dad, but why so much drinking and showing up at the cottage smashed? What about the dog? Did Winslet just leave her dog there with no care? Who would leave a dog alone for so long? How did she know the Diaz would show up and even if she liked or was allergic to dogs? All these are important issues what were never even addressed. Despite all these holes, most of the film was enjoyable except for Diaz manic performance. Was she on drugs when she made this? Everything she did and said was so hyper. Kind of spoiled her character. Slow down girl. Ms. Myers should have been aware of the dreadful performance. All the others faired well, especially Jack Black. Of course every one knows from the onset of meeting each character how this movie will turn out...and that's OK. A ""feel"" good movie which would have been a feel ""great"" movie if it were not for these implausible situations and Diaz over the top performance. Also, her character shows not a bit of shame by having sex with someone she has met five minutes earlier. Not nice, although the blame for that goes to MS Myers screenplay..For shame."

Unfortunately it's the same old Christmas story of sad breakups (with the cheater boyfriend or the bad guy, always loved but never correct), and new loves found where less you expect it. All mixed up with clichè and traditional locations (the snow in the country and the little cottage, Britain, or the sunny palm drives and the big luxury villas, California).

But not enough... like in ""Nothing's Hill""... It's romantic... but not enough for drama! And there is not enough of those cute-stupid-smile-scenes for romantic-comedy! Actors are great except Jack Black.... somehow...he didn't ""blend in"" the movie for me... maybe cause I got used to watch him as some jackass... Movie is too long of such a simple story... 2 hours of ""maybe - maybe not"".... Anyway... nothing special... I've expected much more from this movie!"

","I'm not much for romantic comedies. In any case, put Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst, and I'll want to watch it. The plot seems a little too simple for me, and one of those romantic comedies, that are out there, but characters were so cute, and you can't help but cheer on both women, I warmed up more to Kate Winslet's character. A good movie to enjoy if you want a relaxed night in, and a movie that will make you feel warm, and is good to watch. However, I'll still categorize it as for a romantic comedy more for women, and can't imagine a guy watching it. But one of the more interesting romantic comedies, and the characters, espiecially Kirsten Dunst, is not like typical character at a romantic comedy, it was a nice change to still see. The ending was great."
"rafael_spa","7","0","1","20 April 2007"," Fall in love with Kate Winslet
","First off, let me tell you. I hate romantic comedies! From the bottom of my heart, they make me sick. But not this one. All because of Kate Winslet...<br/><br/>If this movie was all about Kate, maybe it could have earned an 8 or even 9 rating, because she's so lovely and beautiful and helpless... I couldn't resist her, and couldn't help to care about her, even incurring in the ridiculous talk to the screen moments... Even though she would deserve a much more handsome pair, Jack Black ended up being a good match for her.<br/><br/>Jack's character, in cold analysis, is one of the best features of the movie, as he is unlikely cast. The thing I hate the most in this kind of movie is that everything is predictable, so an unexpected cast is a breath of fresh air in the style, specially if you're tired of the Ben Affleck/Hugh Grant standard.<br/><br/>In the other hand, Cameron Diaz is sooo silly. All her self featured scenes in the movie are just comedy, with no romance in it. Luckily, Jude Law and those lovely little kids of his keep her form drowning the effort for sure. Nevetheless, if the film was all about them both, I have to state that I'd never have reached the end of it.<br/><br/>And that's very much everything there is to say about it... The whole work is set in a way tho make Kate's and Cameron's stars shine, without any deeper artistic ambition. And Kate delivers, Cameron, well, she tries...<br/><br/>The right company may improve the fruition of this. At least, it worked for me...<br/><br/>So, if you like romantic comedy, watch it and enjoy. If you like Kate Winslet, give it a try. But if you don't like neither of them, do like Tom Cruise in Minority Report: Ruuuuuuun!!!!!!!"
"RNMorton","6","0","1","18 April 2007"," Decent chick flick has its moments
","Winslet plays the Bridget Jones character, Diaz the Diane Lane part in story of two jilted women trading houses for the Christmas vacation. Kate finds some rewarding relationships in LA, including Black, while Diaz gets involved with Winslet's brother Law in Merry Old. I'm not buying Winslet's deal with Black, it doesn't feel right. Her friendship with Wallach is much more interesting but gets short shrift as the movie develops. Winslet's character also overdoes the victim stuff enough to turn off any regular guy, the girls might enjoy it. Diaz and Law have an interesting fling at first but there's way too many starts and stops. This worked okay for an hour or so but had no place interesting to go after that."
"siderite","6","0","3","14 April 2007"," A bit of everything, mostly bad
","The ending was better than the start, so I rate it just below average. The thing is that some parts were nice, others brilliant, while most of it was boring and unbelievable.<br/><br/>To start with the beginning, two women who don't know each other decide to swap houses without even meeting each other. Is that even possible? Anyway, they both have complicated love lives they want to escape from, one being British, the other American. Now here is a great opportunity for humour, but there was little or none of that.<br/><br/>To continue, the stories of both women are completely separate. It's like there are two movies into one (which partly explains why they made this film 130 minutes long!). The situations in both movies are partly interesting, partly cliché, but most of the script is boring or completely unbelievable. It's very hard to relate to any of the characters.<br/><br/>To end it, I think that Eli Wallach and Dustin Hoffman made this film. Yes, Dustin Hoffman plays in this one with a role he couldn't have failed, since it involved one cameo line. It's not like the other actors did not play well, it's just that the script was awful in some places and the embarrassment of trying to place themselves into a bad role was obvious. Frank Black in a romantic role? At least we didn't have him belly dance in his underwear in this one.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it is a shallow film. It brushed past so many interesting themes like Anglo-American interaction, old movies, movie soundtracks, movie trailers (yes, it seems most movie professions were present in this one!), the golden age of movies... All that remained was two confused couples spending New Year's Eve together. Can one destroy a (potential) romantic movie more with something more than make it also a Christmas movie?<br/><br/>So, my suggestion (strangely it makes me sad to say it) is to avoid this film. Great potential, horrendous delivery!"

No, she'll never be on the level of Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, but she was fairly solid.<br/><br/>Jude Law was also very enjoyable and I got a kick out the scenes with his kids.

","What happens when two heartbroken women swap their lives (or most of it) for a holiday season? It would predictably be almost like flowing with the course of other's life and to revel in the little or large pleasures the life of another person would bring. To that extent 'Holiday' is full of rather predictable outcomes with Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet both eventually finding some love and some solace for their broken hearts. That the final outcome of their foreign ventures has been left to the audience's imagination helps the viewer focus on the 'Holiday' aspect of the experience and not look beyond.<br/><br/>'Holiday' succeeds is in making the audience feel good with a Christmas time story of finding love away from home - and in the process may be finding another home. The script's unwillingness to explore possibilities that would have been - if the writer and director were willing to explore outcomes less predictable - means that the movie ends up being a typical Hollywood feel good comedy. But then trying outcomes less predictable would be depriving 'Holiday' of its essence of being a light love comedy. In all, it is a good movie for a weekend relaxation but not the one that would excite a critic's mind."

As far as Christmas movies go, this has flown right to the top of my list of favorites, but I would still watch it in any other season.

","Being virtually the only 'romantic comedy' playing at the moment, I didn't go into the theater with high hopes, just a wishful thought for a light-hearted escape. I got exactly what I was expecting and a tad bit more. The premise was cute, the script was better than average and it was beautifully filmed. The ending was predictable, but what romantic comedy isn't and after all, that's pretty much why we go to see them. My only problem with the film was Cameron Diaz. She got better as the film progressed, but paired next to high caliber actors like Jude Law and Kate Winslet, her overacting was more apparent than ever. She would truly benefit from a good coach who could reign her in and give her a greater emotional range without having to resort to histrionics. Ms. Winslet is able to show more emotion without moving a muscle than Ms. Diaz is waving her arms around, stamping her feet and screaming. But her talents aside, I really did enjoy the film. It was sweet and just what was needed amidst the bigger holiday films and Oscar hopefuls."

There are only some few movies, at least for me, that reach the level of this one. The Holiday is the one of best options to watch in any occasion, and be sure that won't make you drowsy or bored.

","This is a nice piece of romantic fluff and if you're in the mood for a romantic comedy this one does nicely. I realised what I was in for and was therefor in the right frame of mind and enjoyed this very much. Entertainment, pure and simple! <br/><br/>Jude Law's timing is immaculate and he's very sympathetic. I'm a bloke, but can really understand what the girls see in him. Almost too good looking for his own good. :) Kate Winslet is wonderful as usual and I completely fall for her in every film she does. She seems to have no limits when it comes to genré. This being released so close in time to Little Children just shows her amazing range. She's immensely talented and stunning to look at. Seeing her on Letterman and the like leads me to believe that she's also a very sympathetic person. Jack Black is.....well, Jack Black. No real stretch for him. He's his usual self, but a tad less manic. Eli Wallach is marvelous! Very genuine.<br/><br/>The thing that is a complete mystery to me is this Cameron Diaz thingy??? <br/><br/>I just don't get it! <br/><br/>It's been so long since I've seen her in anything that I was hoping she'd retired. You only have to mention her and most blokes go all goggle-eyed. To reiterate....<br/><br/>I just don't get it!! <br/><br/>I see very little talent and no charisma what so ever. In my opinion she's not even particularly pretty really. Tall, gangly and not that much to look at all. My opinion, of course. I also realise that it's not a popular opinion, but............<br/><br/>I just don't get it!!!<br/><br/>I'd have loved to have seen someone else in the roll. Jennifer Garner for example. Talented and beautiful. Slides easily between comedy and drama. I've also noticed with her when she's on the talk shows that she's extremely intelligent and very funny. Totally unpretentious. <br/><br/>I'm not going to put any spoilers in here. This is a romantic comedy and a good one at that. Not the best I've seen, but far from the worst.<br/><br/>If that's what you're in the mood for you can't go wrong with this one.<br/><br/>Sorry people. I JUST DON'T GET IT!!!!"

OK, let the critics and the wise men tell their story, but sometimes if you see something with your own eyes you can see the difference. We don't always want hidden messages or a revolutionary cinematography to appreciate a movie. Sometimes it is great just because it is simple and direct and funny... That's what I loved about the movie, it is fresh, it has character and witty lines and the cast is something you will adore! By the end of the film I found myself so identical to Kate Winslet's Iris and that is to remember. I also asked myself ""Is Jude Law so handsome?""

","A perfect release during Christmas and New Year season especially when the backdrop and period shown in the movie coincides with Christmas and New Year. I saw this movie because it was a new release, and the show timing matched the time available for me to see another movie immediately after Perfume.<br/><br/>I should compliment the Director - Nancy Meyer who evidently has spent quite a bit of time on the script and churning out dialogues that are precisely written.<br/><br/>The story is about two girls who have been cheated by their lovers and want to get over the depression feeling and get far away from men of their lives - swap houses (one in UK and the other in USA) for 2 weeks through an internet exchange houses website. The two girls are Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet  both look gorgeous. The character of Cameron Diaz has more depth in personality but does not come out fully during the movies  but at times Cameron brings them out. Kate Winslet is a beauty to watch  she has a perfectly beautiful face. It is needless to say that the two girls come across two men and fall in love with them, while trying to forget their past affair. The story unfolds slowly and at times you feel are a better editing would have made this movie more enjoyable. The Director tries to show some  but there are no big hic-ups during the journey of these two girls and as audience you already know the ending, and that is why you loose the charm  or the last punch in the end.<br/><br/>It is a simple, straight forward love story  a time pass, at times clichéd too.

Jack Black plays a serious role for once, but still cant shake his joker personality. Cameron Diaz plays a down trodden depressed woman who recently split with her cheating ex.<br/><br/>Its a Win-Win!<br/><br/>The story is simple, Two women from opposite sides of the world find themselves with love problems.<br/><br/>The first woman, (Kate Winslet) is obsessed with a pig of a man, who constantly uses her because he 'needs' her (yeah, to edit his book..) She needs to get over her feelings for him when she finds out this man she had been in love with for many years, who is seemingly one of her best friends has recently gotten engaged and forgot to tell her.<br/><br/>The other Woman (Cameron Diaz) is cold and unemotional. She ""drives her boyfriend to another woman"" by being too busy with her work to have sex with him! How dare she! She owns a Film Studio designed specifically for making movie trailers for Block Busting movies. When her long term boyfriend is caught with his pants down, and due to her sorted past, she finds herself unable to even shed a tear. Desperately needing a vacation, she heads to the internet.<br/><br/>Either way, both women find themselves searching for somewhere to go for the holidays.

It's cute, period. It's not smart, it's not sassy, it's not stylish in any way. It doesn't try to be any more than it is. It doesn't make too much of an effort at believability or realistic plot turns, and if you watch this, you're better off just letting the plot holes slide without too much analysis.<br/><br/>And it certainly doesn't try to answer any of the big questions it could potentially open up, specifically, about long-distance relationships and whether they could ever work. The ending is unsatisfying for precisely this reason. We never really learn anything about life, love or the nature of relationships. It's a fuzzy, feel-good ending complete with singing and dancing, but no real answers.<br/><br/>Enjoyable... as long as you shut your brain off. And will be forgotten by spring. 5/10."

","If you like movies that are predictable, cliché-ridden and rely on an all star cast to be a success, then The Holiday will interest you.<br/><br/>The Holiday stars Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Kate Winslet and Jude Law. One can only wonder what these Hollywood stars were thinking when they agreed to be in this romantic farce. Nancy Meyers did write the film with all these actors in mind but it doesn't mean that they had to go ahead and make fools of themselves by starring in this.<br/><br/>The Holiday is about two women. Amanda lives in LA. She has a big house and owns a movie advertising company. Her life falls apart when she finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Fed up with her life, Amanda finds a home exchange website and decides to swap homes with a woman named Iris who lives in London. Iris' life also happens to be falling apart when the man that she is in love with gets engaged and doesn't tell her.<br/><br/>When the two women switch lives, they meet men who they fall for and a roller-coaster of every romantic comedy cliché ensues.<br/><br/>Men should stay as far away as possible from this film even if it does star Cameron Diaz, and women should steer clear too. Who wants to go see a movie about two women who mope around all day complaining about how terrible their lives are when there are people out there who are far worse off then they are? I suppose Nancy Meyers needed Jack Black for the comedy element but he was seriously out of place in this rubbish.<br/><br/>The film is overly long too. It is just over two hours.<br/><br/>Rather watch something else, seriously, there's far better than this mess."
"ferguson-6","5","0","2","24 December 2006"," Lacking Gumption
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers has always written her stories from purely a female perspective and because of this, she has had a very successful box office career in film (""Something's Gotta Give"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""Baby Boom"" ""Private Benjamin""). What is always lacking in her stories is any type of balance between the genders. ""The Holiday"" lags behind even the other films listed because here we are not even shown women with ""gumption"" (an ongoing gag in the film).<br/><br/>The formula here is two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, who are both successful professionals, but a mess in their personal lives. Perfect strangers, they agree to a two week house switch (L.A. and England) to escape their own lives. Yada, Yada, Yada, they find themselves and the love of their lives. Who would have guessed? Meyers basically castrates the Jude Law character (Diaz' love interest). He is as close to a woman as any non-trans-gendered man can get. Then for some unknown reason she casts physical comedian Jack Black as Winslet's dream boat. Then she evidently directed him to ""act like Jack Black on valium"". He tries to be funny, but mostly he just looks like a lame Jack Black impersonator. Not much to say about Cameron Diaz other than she is just plain awful here. There has to be more to acting than flashing your blue eyes and flipping your silky blonde hair. Her scenes with Jude Law are excruciating to watch for any self-respecting MAN ... and should be the same way for any woman.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in this years' ""Little Children"". It showed she is as good as any actress working today. That makes her part in this even more painful; however, I will say her scenes with Eli Wallach are what keep the film from being a total flop. Winslet has this aura of goodness and she comes across very sincere. The great Eli Wallach has a sparkle in his eye and steals every scene he is in. What a pleasure to watch a true pro at his best.<br/><br/>Having just seen Almodovar's ""Volver"", it provided a terrific contrast between filmmakers who write about women. Almodovar has true insight into strong women and insecure women, while Meyers just writes about women as if they are characters in romance novels. Evidently that is the difference between art and box office power."

The movie was inspired by love and it truly succeeded in putting that message forward but i don't think the movie entertained the audience. Cameron Diaz was charming in her role but she didn't connect with the script contrary to her co-star Oscar nominee Kate Winslet who manage to deliver.

","I watched this film reluctantly after my friends recommended it, but I wasn't expecting much. By the end, I was crying. And not because it was truly awful, but because it was touching and was well portrayed by the actors chosen. At first, I was a little hesitant about Cameron's character, and thought that she would ruin the movie, but very quickly, all the characters began to grow on me. Initially, this film starts with four people leading separate lives and throughout the film, connections start to be made. The two women in the film swap lives, trying to escape from their dismal love lives. They go on a 2 week ""holiday"", hoping to avoid from any male contact. One travels from Surrey to L.A, and visa versa. However, love soon comes knocking on their doors... I believe that they picked the actors quite well, and if you enjoy watching Jude Law (who looked very pleasing to the eye in this film), Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Kate Winslet, then this film might well be for you. This is a very typical rom com with ups and downs, dilemmas and tear-jerking moments, but of course it has a happy ending."

The second half made me smile a couple of times, but I was still angry about the insult to my intelligence that was the first half.

","I like Nancy Meyers, I really do. For the past 20 years, if you wanted to see a happy movie that didn't make you think to hard but didn't absolutely insult your intelligence, Nancy Meyer screenplays have been fairly reliable pics.<br/><br/>Something's Gotta Give was so good on so many levels. The Holiday was so bad, for just as many reasons.<br/><br/>Start with the casting. Meyer's wordy dialogue is best handled by smart women, and Cameron Diaz can't lend it the weight it needs. And Kate Winslet, who can throw herself into terrific, passionate characters, is a wispy, emotional wuss. By the time she grows a backbone, you're not sure she deserves it. Jude Law is a paper-thin idea with a past that lands firmly in the melodrama ""awww"" zone.<br/><br/>Credit Jack Black for being the only interesting and somewhat believable person in the movie. Miles the Musician isn't the typical Jack Black character - the manic energy is more contained and transformed into a kinetic confidence. He's the most grounded of the principle characters, which is why his puppy-dog devotion to Maggie the Actress doesn't ring true. The Black/Winslet pairing is probably one of the most interesting duos of the year.<br/><br/>Everyone runs this-side of a sappy romance novel, mainly because the script revokes everyone's right to breathe. Something's Gotta Give showed Meyers' talent for great monologues. The Holiday beats us over the head with long strings of monologues, some that are straight exposition. And everyone is very in touch with his/ her emotions, and articulate when it comes to expressing them.<br/><br/>There's also the flirtation with the multiple storyline concept that Hollywood's obsessed with at the moment. The trick with them is that they have to work both independently and separately, and neither the Law/Diaz nor the Black/Winslet lines are strong enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>In the end, the plot meanders without tension and we spend a lot of time watching people sitting and talking as though they're just back from their therapist's office."

It was annoying enough the first six times, causing the audience to grumble, but after that there was out loud laughter and hooting, unfortunately sometimes erupting at the most inopportune moments - like when poor Jude Law was in tears. How did this get past the preview audiences, let alone the film editor? WAS there a film editor? Was the mike man a bit of a tippler? Were they both hitting the hooch? If this is how it's being shown nationally, then yes, YOU MUST GO because it is something theater goers don't see anymore - not since Mack Sennett, and I don't think he ever did it in one film 17 TIMES (minimum - we were laughing so hard we lost count.) Any film student would have an 'F' for this project, and possibly be reprimanded for smoking on the project.

Amanda comes across Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law in a rare comedic outing), while Iris finds herself spending time with film composer Miles (an oddly-cast Jack Black).<br/><br/>What I liked about the parallel stories was their asymmetry: one involves lots of sex (although one bed scene sees the bra staying firmly on), while the other involves none; one includes a friendship with an octogenarian who has lost contact with much of the world, while the other features two (overly) cute little girls. Among these support roles, there is a wonderful performance from 91 year old Eli Wallach (""The Magnificent Seven"" and 150 other screen appearances) who portrays a long-retired screenwriter who introduces Iris and Miles to the films of Hollywood's golden age.<br/><br/>In fact, it is clear that Meyers loves watching movies as well as making them because the dialogue is studded with references and allusions to various films whether it is the feisty performances of Barbara Stanwyck or the exotic soundtrack for ""The Mission"" or Dustin Hoffman's role in ""The Graduate"".
