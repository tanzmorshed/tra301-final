"MR_Heraclius","9","46","50","23 February 2020"," Johnny Depp's greatest movie!!
","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is one of the best musical films ever made and probably the last truly excellent Tim Burton effort in directing. It's a romantic and enthralling vision of the dark perspective about life and death for the poor people controled by the privileged, cruel and envious society. It finds a inspired Johnny Depp in probably his best performance of this century. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall compelte this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented one assembled in a musical!"

","As it happens more often than not, greatness is relegated to some obscure angle. In a year of brilliant opuses by the Cohen Brothers and PT Anderson, this Tim Burton film shines as the best from every angle. It's not just that Burton creates another superb, dark universe with Dante Ferretti's complicity or that Johnnt Deep breaks new ground, or that Helena Bonham Carter surprises us with a complex, marvelous realistic parody. The film touches visually a very private cord. Ed Wood managed that but Tim Burton with ""Sweeny Todd"" elevates it to the purest form of art. He will be punished for that, as Ed Wood was in its day. Disappointing grosses in a world that worship grosses will make it appear as a sort of a failure. My advise to you is run to see it wherever you can find it. Try to see it in a big screen with great sound. You will fly and dream and be taken away by the masterful hands of Tim Burton and the glorious faces of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter."
"malleyvoice","10","185","237","1 March 2008"," Gloriously Dark
","Tim Burton has gone beyond himself and anything he has ever done. ""Sweeney Todd"" is stunningly beautiful. Dark? yes, bloody? sure! but then we're in Victorian London where everything is what it appears to be no matter how turgid. The meeting of Mr Todd and Mrs Lovett is so scrumptiously conceived that I'm sure will be one of those film moments that are used whenever ""great film moments"" are compiled. Johnny Depp will never cease to amaze me. He is not just the beautiful boy with soulful eyes, but a great actor. How extraordinary that two talents like Burton and Depp should meet at the perfect moment in time. How lucky for us! Mrs Lovett is played by another extraordinary actor: Helena Bonham Carter. She is spectacular! Sacha Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman and in particular Timothy Spall add to the perfection of this film. Dante Ferreti, the production designer and Coleen Attwood, the costume designer, deserve all the kudos they are getting and will get. Glorious!"
"katiemeyer1979","10","104","130","2 March 2008"," Johnny and Tim forever
","What an extraordinary treat this bloody dirty tale of vengeance and gore is. The exquisite way Tim Burton presents it to us makes it so. Stephen Sondheim's stage masterpiece becomes a film masterpiece of unequaled stature. Everything about it reeks of genius of magic. Once again, Johnny Depp fills, Burton's macabre universe with overwhelming humanity. He can slash as many throats as he wants if we look into Johnny's eyes we see the struggle, the human winning in despair. I know I'm not making too much sense but I just want to urge you, if you love cinema, to rush and see it as God intended, on a big screen and Dolby surround sound."
"roquedog504","10","405","557","13 December 2007"," A refreshing and brilliant film
","Contrary to the many comments I have read and heard about the film thus far, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. After what some could term a ""dry spell"" for Tim Burton, it is such a breath of fresh air to see this new offering, Sweeney Todd. The movie showed Tim returning to his roots of the dark, the sinister, and the macabre. All were blended together in the setting he is so very well-known for, the dark streets of London.<br/><br/>In addition, I thought the fact that he maintained the musical aspect of the film/play worked in the movie's favor. I know Johnny Depp has said that he can't sing, but he sang rather well if you ask me. Keeping the cockney accent, whether singing or not, it made the film that much better. While I was surprised to see Danny Elfman not included in this movie, I believe the music was performed and carried out beautifully, nonetheless. Indeed, the accents can at times make it hard to discern what is being said, but that's not always a bad thing, considering the circumstances. Were they to all of a sudden not speak or sing with their cockney tones, it may provide a problem with consistency. Overall, I loved the movie and have no complaints. A very refreshing return to the realms and themes that Tim Burton is so very amazing at capturing. Top notch!"
"ShellyA227","9","380","536","5 December 2007"," Dark Humor Done Right
","Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way. There are no screaming teenagers running from a lunatic; instead we get a somewhat British blend of satire, slapstick and just ""wrong"" humor. Although I'm not much of a Johnny Depp fan, I enjoyed his performance as well as Helena Bonham Carter's. Even the portrayal of the common clients was stunning.<br/><br/>Despite being generally familiar with the story, I fell into some traps expecting specific twists, yet something different (and better) being delivered. This is a model of how to do dark humor that filmmakers should and probably will follow. It is most refreshing. Don't read the story and don't read any spoilers until you've seen it."
"Boris_Day","9","285","399","17 December 2007"," Tim Burton's most dramatically satisfying film so far.
","I approached Sweeney Todd with trepidation, having been underwhelmed with most of Tim Burton's recent output and every screen musical of the last decade. The biggest problem I have with Burton's films is that his screenplays rarely manage to pull their disparate elements into a satisfying whole. Here, despite adapting the material to his own sensibilities and shortening the play by an hour, he adheres closely to Sondheim's book, resulting in the most dramatically satisfying film Burton has ever made. <br/><br/>I liked the adaptation of the off-off Broadway Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but have been left underwhelmed by all the recent big budget film musicals, so I'm glad to say that Sweeney Todd, wipes the floor with every major screen musical of the last decade, including the likable if over extended Hairspary. Most surprising is how shockingly gruesome the the film becomes in the second half. This must be the most blood drenched film since Shogun Assassin, with arteries spurting blood like like fountains as throats are cut, with the violence escalating towards the end leading towards a climax that is exhilarating, heartbreaking and satisfyingly bleak.<br/><br/>Unlike the dreary dirges Danny Elfman supplied for Burton's stop frame musicals, Sondheim's score is a joy to listen to from beginning to end, its dark romanticism sometimes reminding me of Bernhard Herrmann, perfectly fitting what is both a musical and a horror film in equal measures.<br/><br/>Depp and Bonham Carter are both excellent and it's down to their performances that I never quite lost sympathy with them in their descent into madness, blood lust and cannibalism.<br/><br/>Musical haters may not be converted as 75% percent of the dialogue is sung, but this completely dispatches any notion of cloying sentimentally the genre is often associated with."
"ArrestedDevelopee","8","183","252","21 December 2007"," Tim Burton Claims Sweeney As His Own!
","As a fan of the original stage version of this grimly Gothic tale, going into Sweeney Todd was bittersweet in my hopes and expectations. However, I'm pleased to announce that I did find Burton's latest effort impressive and intentional. Fans of the original won't be disappointed with a top-notch cast and the wonderfully dark overtures that haunt every minute of Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton, one of the masters of ambiance, sets his atmosphere in the grisly streets of a depressed London and his artistry punctures through every scene of screen time. I would have to clarify that, while Johnny Depp is a skilled actor, fans of the original will find it hard to believe that Depp has the ability to transform into the George Hearn ""Sweeny"" we've come to know. This is in fact true and recognized by Burton. In this respect, the character of Depp is not played as the same manner as the deep-voiced, towering Todd from the musical adaptation. Depp's is more of a less boisterous and thoughtful one. The vocal performances are great but have a different approach and feel to them. It was a refreshing adaptation and I feel a triumph on the part of Burton for making a stage-to-screen experience that captures you from it's bloody introduction."
"DramaQueenKate","10","65","85","17 December 2007"," Burton and Sondheim: a match made in heaven
","Yes, this is about a barber who kills people. Yes, this is a musical.<br/><br/>I have been excited about this movie since last December, when I first heard about it. Having been a Burton fan since my four year old self was quoting ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and a Sondheim fan since middle school, I had faith that Tim Burton was the perfect director for Sondheim's masterpiece. So you can imagine how lucky I felt to be able to see a screening of this.<br/><br/>This movie is all I could ever hope it would be.<br/><br/>I walked in the theater with my best positive outlook. I had shed my mournful tears over the cut songs (the Ballads, Kiss Me) and wanted to be as optimistic as possible, and I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance in this is one of his best by far. He stole every scene he was in. He has toned down Sweeney for the screen, so those used to George Hearn or Len Cariou may have to get used to, but I think the important thing to remember is that this is a movie, not a stage show.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter gives a great performance as Mrs. Lovett. Though she is different from Angela Lansbury, her portrayal still works marvelously, and she and Johnny make a great pair.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is all amazing. Alan Rickman could make ""High School Musical"" entertaining. He is so deliciously evil in this movie, and you can tell his sidekick, Timothy Spall's Beadle Bamford, is having a great time with his sniveling character. Sacha Baron Cohen is, of course hilarious as Pirelli. The three young supporting actors (and unknowns), Jamie Campbell Bower, Ed Sanders, and Jayne Wisener, are all perfect in their roles. I hope to be seeing them in more films to come. Another unknown to Hollywood but acclaimed London stage veteran, Laura Michelle Kelly, is chillingly creepy as the beggar woman (and gives a naive sympathy as Sweeney's wife, Lucy, in the flashbacks.<br/><br/>Now, for the blood. There's a lot of it. A whole lot. Just a warning. However, the blood is so immense that at times it is, as Richard Roeper said, almost Python-esquire. I think audience are supposed to laugh as fountains of blood gush out of Sweeney's unlucky costumers. It is also brutal the way they land on their head on the way down to the bakehouse.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an amazing film even if you have never heard of Stephen Sondheim (though you really should, but that's not the point.) I can't think of a better way that theater lovers' beloved Sweeney Todd could have been brought to the screen than in Tim Burton's own unique mind, and I know that I could not be more content with this film."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","63","85","27 December 2007"," The best musical in years!
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the year's most talked about films, it's getting big Oscar buzz and of course, what could be better than Tim Burton taking on this dark musical? With Johnny Depp starring along with beautiful Helena Bonham Carter by his side, this movie just screams terrific. My mom and I saw the movie today and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street lived beyond to my expectations. Tim Burton hasn't exactly released a classic lately that would be remembered for all time, but Sweeny Todd is sure to make it's way into one of the most memorable films of 2007. Johnny Depp and Helena both have incredible voices, they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together, it's like these roles were made for them. Along with an equally strong cast as Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen who were also incredible, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a new memorable musical for years to come.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd has come to London on a mission, a mission for revenge! His wife was taken by the evil judge for his own pleasure's with her and Sweeney's daughter. Now Sweeney's daughter is grown and is being held by Judge Turpin and he has been informed by his lover, Mrs. Lovett that his wife has died. ""At last my arm is complete!"" Sweeney says as he raises his faithful razor and wishes to kill the vermin of the world as well. Mrs. Lovett comes up with the clever idea to create a tasty meat pie of the victims and makes quite the popular business. But Sweeney is determined to find his daughter who is being wooed by his young friend, Anthony, and kill the judge who has taken everything from him.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was so beautifully shot. The reason why I love Tim Burton so much is because he knows how colors and contrasts work in a film. He knew how dark Mrs. Lovetts and Sweeney Todd are, in a picnic scene where everything is supposed to be bright, Sweeney and Lovetts are the only dark figures in the lovely setting. The music is triumphant, the songs were so memorable and almost hypnotic, I felt like was in a real Broadway audience. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the best films of the year, I guarantee it, this was a terrific musical that was a bloody good time! Tim Burton is back and he's better than ever with Johnny.<br/><br/>10/10"
"metalbot-1","9","298","443","11 December 2007"," Awesome, dark and funny. Classic Tim Burton stuff.
","Good dark fun.<br/><br/>I knew nothing of this movie except Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had something to do with it, and that, as the executive director put it, there was ""lots of blood"". I don't think of myself as liking musicals, although I should probably reconsider now.<br/><br/>I had a moment of dread when the movie started and there was a mention of Sacha Baron Cohen being in it. However his performance was in fact quite good. While his acting has a few things in common with his over-the-top Borat character, it somehow fits rather well within the movie.<br/><br/>Some elements of the plot are rather predictable, in a Greek tragedy sort of way, but it doesn't really detract from the movie. We get to enjoy the downward spiral even though we know its shape.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was awesome, filled with damned and hopeless characters that still made you laugh at every turn."
"AnneOBrienRice","10","256","385","20 December 2007"," A Conventicle of Geniuses Came Together Here
","And this conventicle has brought us a glistening and irresistible nightmare. There are delicious Dickensian overtones throughout, and the look of the film itself is poetically potent. The entire mix is shockingly seductive with an unforgettable ending. Burton's humor is part and parcel of his sheer brilliance, as always, and, as always, the great Johnny Depp is intense and positively unforgettable. All performances are electric, the pace and length are perfect, and the film draws us deeper and deeper with every moment into its stunning blend of the grotesque and the undeniably beautiful. Analysing the power of a film like this is no simple matter. The whole is dazzlingly disturbing. You don't want to miss a second of it, even though the film is merciless to us and to its protagonists. It sings, it glows, it enchants, it horrifies. I want to see it again. And again. It's a brutal and shattering masterpiece."
"jdesando","Null","151","238","14 December 2007"," Burton does better than anyone else . . .
","""At last, my arm is complete again."" Sweeney Todd as he admires one of his efficient razors after a long absence.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is ""grand,"" but I'm confident it's in the best Grand Guignol tradition of sensational stage horror given its name from that little theater in early 20th century Paris that specialized in sensationally ghoulish productions. I am also sure that no one in film is better able to play the titular butcher than the shape-shifting, ever-naughty Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The opening song ""No Place Like London"" hints to Anglophiles like me that it won't be my usual tour of West End theaters, rather a seedy, dangerous place where Mac the Knife would be more at home. Throughout the musical, Steven Sondheim's lyrics expressively revel in the amoral, throat-slicing world that Sweeney and his adoring meatpie lady, Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), wallow in as he prepares to take revenge on the equally amoral Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who dispatched Todd to prison early on to get his beautiful young wife. Hence Sweeney's revenge inclination.<br/><br/>Sweeney's lyric best expresses the wildly murderous world, hardly the usual province of musicals: ""Alright! You, Sir?/No one's in the chair come on, come on/Sweeney's waiting/I want you bleeders./You sir! Too sir?/Welcome to the grave./I will have vengeance./I will have salvation . . . ."" Yes, it's Sleepy-Hollow, Corpse-Bride Tim Burton's movie with blood spouting like red paint from a pressure gun contrasting the somber, almost black and white underside of London. When one of the children bites into a pie with a finger in it (shades of our contemporary law suits!), the audience doesn't even gasp, given the omnipresence of bloody bodies.<br/><br/>There is no more interesting musical this year, even considering the enchanting Once. In the end, it is unsettling, unsavory, and unusual. Burton does better than anyone else in juxtaposing horror with innocence."
"ReadingFilm","10","5","5","8 April 2019"," Polarities. Art as a lifeline. Where was his best director nom?
","Just five minutes in I felt a melancholy for how great it is making me sad it would finish. Its bipolarity shows both ends are 'us'. Losing your soul in aging, such works of theater are society's lifeline to feel. It's strange because of how American audiences are so puritan and usually despise theatricality, self-awareness or romanticism; it's as if the musical gives permission to partake.<br/><br/>See how the shave is presenting dignity for 'appearance', being the cleaned face of the societal machine; even there's a rival barber, it's a 'cut-throat' industry to make people nice to service the rotting. The rot is hoisted up by the broken; so the craziness of this is how Todd integrates as a twisted functional. It even rewards him with a checklist of fulfillment, but he could not embrace it. ""The ghosts don't leave. They never leave.""<br/><br/>This is because he is not real but a stand-in for Dante's London. See how he always creeps up, appears, or looks in the mirror as if surprised he even exists. The film brings this point home showing him as a stuffed figurine behind the window from afar, or as a mannequin in Lovett's fantasy. He is a symbol, a hero redeemer of this demonic ritual; an outgrowth of the dregs where the demon humanity run free for mischief. I like how early on the camera dances through the streets like an imp making sure every rat is still in its place, ""I'm home!""<br/><br/>Those powerful gushings of blood show as feeling. We trade allowing this for the civility of living. The mad women ripping the asylum keeper apart, who kept a collection of crazies. There are hints of many different Sweeneys across this, difference being ours redeems, making his evil woke. This is the only Batman you're going to get here. Gotham wept.<br/><br/>Depp; when ever do you get a vehicle for this sort of one dimensional purity of rage? The face as performance landscape. A complete reversal in Edward Scissorhands. ""My arm is complete,"" in both films. Both are these glam rock figures. There, goth within suburbia, here, musical theater within goth. Art as always is the great symbol; the hair cutting versus the shaving as creative and destructive tools for shaping the universe; Burton's paintbrushes.<br/><br/>It's about the torture of certain kinds of men who seek control, and can't bear life not offering that, so seek it at all costs in other ways outside their failing. Its tragedy shows how fate is very much in favor of those with purpose; you realize if only Todd sought industry rather than murder he would rule Judge Turpin politically not violently, and with ease."
"thomaskluiver","10","5","5","26 January 2014"," This movie is amazing
","When I saw this film for the first time, I was immediately blown away. I had never heard of the bloody story of Sweeney Todd, which is an amazing story about revenge. Honestly: this story is so great almost anyone could make an awesome movie from it. But Tim Burton has exceeded all expectations, if you ask me. The atmosphere of this film is just superb, it's all black and white and RED and beautiful.. the music and cast are perfect. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are all great (and they can sing too!) The songs will probably be stuck in your head for weeks (most notably ""My Friends"", ""Pretty Women"" and ""No Place Like London""). This is, in my opinion, certainly the best musical that's out there.. probably one of the best films I've ever seen. And you're going to want to watch (and sing along with) it again and again."
"steve-bailey-1","10","116","189","16 December 2007"," Shave and a haircut -- two slits!
","I came to ""Sweeney Todd"" with a clean slate, as it were. I'd never seen any of the previous stage or screen versions, and I'm generally adverse to the archly ironic style of Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim.<br/><br/>All of that said, I was thoroughly delighted by director Tim Burton's version of the story. As with Burton's best work, it's movie-making at its Grand Guignol finest.<br/><br/>For those even more ignorant of the story than I am, Johnny Depp plays the title role, or should I say evolves into it. Initially, his character is named Benjamin Barker, and he's a happily married father in Victorian London.<br/><br/>But an evil judge named Turpin (Alan Rickman at his oil-slick smoothest) lusts after Barker's wife. So he wrongly sentences Barker to prison, seduces and poisoningly induces Barker's wife, and takes Barker's baby daughter as his ""charge,"" to await the day when she is old enough to marry him.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Barker escapes from prison, returns to London, and adopts the persona of barber Sweeney Todd. At first, he intends only upon avenging Turpin. But he soon discovers he has an other-barberly way with a razor. And as it happens, Todd's landlady (Helena Bonham Carter), an unsuccessful baker, could use some fresh ingredients to sell her pies.<br/><br/>Oh, and this is a musical, too -- albeit the bloodiest musical ever, with shot after shot of Todd severing the necks of bourgeois customers whom he feels have it coming.<br/><br/>So why do I heartily recommend such a gruesome holiday offering? For one thing, the script (by John Logan, an avid ""Todd"" buff) and Burton's elegant direction take the story its bare bones, with vivid characterization and crisp plotting and timing.<br/><br/>Of course, the actors contribute much as well. And every last one of them -- including Sacha Baron Cohen, whose ""Borat"" business turned me off -- sing and act wonderfully, taking some of the sting off the movie's black-comedy ickiness.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, again, takes major chances and scores. The feyness of Burton/Depp collaborations such as ""Ed Wood"" and ""Willie Wonka"" is gone. In its place is Todd's grisly dark confidence and rationality of his murdering ways -- the ultimate depiction of the maxim ""Be careful what you wish for."" Its dark themes aside, ""Sweeney Todd"" is the latest entry in an apparent renaissance of the movie musical -- and justifiably so.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd"" is rated R for numerous scenes of violence and murder, and themes of cannibalism."
"motta80-2","9","72","115","7 December 2007"," Got me onside, surprisingly good
","I am generally not a fan of musicals. I don't like the artifice of singing dialogue moments. I have no problem with singing in a movie but this grates on me. Take Dreamgirls for instance. For the most part i was fine with it, good songs, performed as performances with a narrative structure surrounding them. However once of twice it had songs in place of dialogue where characters were discussing things amongst themselves or some such thing and i just got annoyed. And yes i dislike all the classics like West Side Story for this very reason.<br/><br/>For about the first 20-30 minutes of Sweeney Todd I was having the same problem. This makes no bones about it being a musical. It's not Rex Harrison speak-sing, it's not staged songs in the middle of clumps of dialogue, it's pretty much all singing. Everything. Every sentiment, every emotion, every plan, every aside. Yet after about 20 minutes or so i got used to it and went with it and then just appreciated the wonderful dark humour and sheer entertainment quality of it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is great in the lead but he is complimented across the entire cast with Alan Rickman on fabulously villainous mode; Timothy Spall wonderfully revolting an Beadle Bamford - Rickman's henchman; and Helena Bonham Carter hilariously off-centre with all the best lines. It also has a star making turn from a brilliant child actor, Edward Sanders. Much better than the now ubiquitous Freddie Highmore (who got his big break with Depp in Finding Neverland before rejoining him (with Burton) in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory) he seems destined to have a great career potentially.<br/><br/>The film's greatest achievement however is how Burton has translated it to screen. This is a purely film musical. It never feels stagey. Unlike recent films like The Producers, Dreamgirls, Chicago which felt largely like they'd stuck a camera in a theatre and just filmed the show here Burton is brave enough to create a cinematic musical using all the tricks of his craft. That is never feels like it belongs anywhere but on a cinema screen is a huge testament to Burton's skill in the translation and I hope the Academy is intelligent enough to recognise this come the Oscars next year.<br/><br/>The dark humour is great, the look is stunning, Depp is gloriously unhinged while remaining believable. Even if, like me, you don't generally like this type of musical i think you'll get swept up in Sweeney Todd and enjoy it. Bravo Mr Burton."
"asda-man","10","7","8","2 December 2012"," The greatest film ever made?
","It's difficult to tell you what my favourite film is because I have so many that I admire and they're all quite different. Depending on my mood I might tell you that Black Swan is my favourite film, or that Kill Bill is, but mostly I'll tell you that Sweeney Todd is. I've lost count the amount of times I've seen Sweeney Todd and I can't tell you how much I was addicted to it when I first saw it. I'd be singing all the songs, always watching the film, quoting from it. Thankfully, I'm not quite so obsessed with it now, but it will always be in my heart.<br/><br/>Now, I hate musicals. I thought I'd start off by telling you that because you might read that it's a musical and be instantly struck off. I find that songs drag the film down, slowing the pace and being just unnecessary! They're also unnecessarily cheery like in The Sound of Music or Dancin' in the Rain. Sweeney Todd is a completely different type of beast. Have you ever heard a song about cannibalism before? About vengeance and murder? I have and they're incredible! There's not one song out of place in Sweeney Todd and it's pure lyrical genius from Stephen Soundheim. They're also undeniably catchy and memorable, unlike Singin' in the Rain's songs for example. Some huge numbers really capture the scope of the film, whilst the smaller ones bring it down to a personal and more human level. You seriously do not need to worry if you hate musicals!<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd opens with the greatest title sequence in history. It completely captures the mood of the film and lets you know that this is Tim Burton's work! Like all great films it the look of the film is utterly breath taking. Blacks are blacker than black and colour rarely shines through. It's completely moody and stylistic, capturing the tone of the film perfectly and casting a beautifully melancholic atmosphere over the film. The incredible sets are heart-stopping to look at at times and it never fails to give me chills when Sweeney picks up his razor, holds it to the huge window and says, ""At last my arm is complete again!""<br/><br/>But this isn't Avatar! It isn't all visual and no brain. Sweeney Todd's story is absolutely masterful. Like all the best story's, it's about revenge, revenge on the evil judge who locked him up and stole his wife and child. Not many films can easily achieve making you sympathise with a serial killer, but here you can. He's a tragic character who you can't help but feel sorry for and want to see him get his revenge. It also thrives off of its wonderful characters played impeccably by everyone. Of course johnny Depp steals the show with his power house performance and surprisingly strong voice. Helena Bonham Carter adds a well-needed female touch and humour to the role, Alan Rickman is perfect menacing as the judge, Timothy Spall does his mincing incredibly well as the BEadle and Sacha baron Cohen shows that he really can act as the wonderfully extravagant Pirelli!<br/><br/>Tim's directing is also as perfect as everything else in the film. Some breathtaking camera shots really propel the film into a league of its own. Equally the costumes are beautiful and highly memorable. The whole film is likely one you're never forget and never forgive yourself for not going to see! It all builds up to an incredible finale that tugs hard at your heart strings and has you gasping in shock. It's one of the best endings I've ever seen and leaves a very large print on you.<br/><br/>With an incredible score bellowing throughout, Sweeney Todd is one of those rare films that are just perfect! If there was any justice in the world Sweeney Todd should've won best picture, best director, best screenplay, best music, best actor, best actress, best cinematography, best costumes, best set design etc. at the Oscars! It's a cinematic masterpiece which is spectacular to look at and to listen to. Pick this up on blu-ray and at last your arm will be complete again!"

","This movie stunned me so much that I could hardly move from my seat when it was over. The dark cinematography is brilliant and works so well to enhance the story. Johnny Depp has given us so many amazing performances in the past and you can put this one up there at the top of the list. I have to admit that in the past I have loathed Tim Burton offerings but he redeems himself in my opinion with a feast for the eyes and ears that is a triumph. I approached the movie with trepidation because actors put in singing roles seldom work, but not this time. The singing was not only terrific, it was mesmerizing. I have to warn you this movie is for movie fans that love music (Broadway, classical or opera) and have a cast iron stomach. I heard they used 70 gallons of fake blood filming it and I believe them. All I can say is you can see the bloody scenes coming a mile off so you have plenty of time to avert your eyes."

"Cinemadharma","3","59","102","24 January 2008"," Burton slits Sondheim's throat.
","Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd"" explores moral dualism -- the belief of the coexistence or conflict between the ""benevolent"" and the ""malignant"", such as a conflict between good and evil. Sondheim expresses this in many ways, chief among them is his extensive use of counterpoint. Counterpoint is ""the relationship between two or more voices that are independent in contour and rhythm, and interdependent in harmony"". The term comes from the Latin 'punctus contra punctum' or ""note against note"". Counterpoint is often used in musicals, especially in songs that try to compare or contrast two or more characters' views. As written and originally conceived and staged, the musical counterpoint in ""Sweeney Todd"" mirrors not only the difference of views between the characters, but the conflict of views within each character.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's film ""Sweeney Todd"" fails because it has eliminated the emotional and psychological counterpoint, and with it any and all depth of character. Instead of ""note against note"", Burton offers ""one note only"".<br/><br/>One of the key elements to what makes the musical so powerful and dynamic is the counterpoint between and within Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett. On the outside, Sweeney is dark, brooding, vengeful and single mindedly violent. On the inside, he is a wronged man, in complete and spectacular anguish over the loss of his daughter and the death of his young bride. This dual conflict of morality is illustrated during Sweeney's powerful ""Epiphany"" when he sings ""I will have vengeance... I will have salvation!"" His underlying basic human goodness is the reason we care about Sweeney and what makes him a tragic character.<br/><br/>Mrs. Lovett is his mirror opposite. On the outside, (originally embodied by Angela Lansbury) Mrs. Lovett is bright, quirky, colorful and upbeat. She reminds you of your sweet ol' grandma. Hiding away on the inside however, is the real demon of Fleet Street - she lies and manipulates Sweeney into committing bloody murder, then comes up with the ghastly idea of baking the dead bodies into meat pies.<br/><br/>Burton's Sweeney is nothing but vengeful, his Mrs Lovett is as dark, brooding and humorless as Sweeney, his Judge Turpin shows no conscience (due to the cutting of Turpin's one musical number in which he expresses his personal morality battle), his Toby is a cute and clever Oliver-esquire street urchin, rather than the original 'mentally-challenged' Toby who is smarter than he appears. This theme is everywhere in the Sondheim musical - Sweeney Todd is really Benjamin Barker, Adolfo Pirelli is actually a Brit masquerading as the Italian UberBarber who disguises pee and ink as hair tonic, Anthony rescues Joanna from an insane asylum by disguising himself as a wigmaker, Joanna is then disguised as a male sailor, dead bodies are disguised as meat pies... it goes on and on... and in the end, the Tim Burton film is disguised as the Stephen Sondheim musical, but is ultimately revealed to be the empty, shallow film it is."

","Tim Burton's adaptation of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's stage musical is less transposition than re-imagining; fraught with both heavy expectations and risky subject matter (murder, revenge, cannibalism, poverty---we're not talking ""Mamma Mia"" here), this cinematic offering had every reason to turn out a failure, or at least a massive letdown. Does the film fulfill the dark promise of its theatrical parent? Gloriously, the answer's yes.<br/><br/>The film's CG-heavy title sequence doesn't portend well (the glossy, too-perfect video-rendered look of the title imagery are a poor match for the grim subject matter), but once the story kicks in, Burton and company more than prove themselves worthy of Sondheim's masterwork. The film's opening shots of Sweeney Todd's arrival in London, are some of the more striking images Burton has created, the grimy details of the nineteenth-century British capital painted in every grimy soot-covered stroke on screen. This is, gladly, as far from a prettified or fairy-tail view of Victorian London as we're likely to get, right up there with the grungy neo-noir views of Victorian life of ""From Hell"", ""The Prestige"" or G.W. Pabst's ""Threepenny Opera"". In this world the gaslights illuminate a world one step away from Hell, the industrial fog of soot hiding monsters around every street corner, so no wonder Sweeney Todd seems right at home upon his arrival. The design team of Dante Ferreti (sets) and Colleen Atwood (costumes) plunge us into a discomforting, claustrophobic 19th-century London void of romance, the horrible beauty of an intricate landscape of harsh dirty concrete and cruel grey skies. <br/><br/>The most contentious area of speculation, the vocal performances of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter in the leads, are answered with mixed results. Depp's singing is steady and passionate, displaying an admirable willingness to put his voice front-and-center in Sondheim's unforgiving and challenging compositions which lay the singer bare to the needs of the narrative and the audience's perception of the central character. Sweeney's almost Brechtian connection to the spectator's view of the action in on display when he's the only character who gets solitary moments during which he seems in direct communication with the audience with this thoughts and feelings. Burton and Depp beautifully communicate this in the ""Epiphany"" number by opening the action into the street and choreographing Sweeney's action amongst the denizens of London who don't see him; psychologically the only ones aware of Sweeney's encroaching madness are the audience and Sweeney himself. It's a joyous celebration of deliberate homicidal determination, when all doubt falls away and Sweeney knows his place in this dismal world. Depp;s vocal stylings are spot-on, his only failure in the few moments when he's reaching for the end note on a search-and-destroy mission. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter's work is more problematic, as she doesn't possess the voice to pull off the material in its original form and the film's vocal arrangements barely give her any more margin for error. Her performance in the end does work for two reasons: first, she won't make anyone forget Angela Lansbury and she really doesn't try, working exclusively within the range of her own voice. Second, she imbues Mrs.Lovett with a sharp wit and cynical worldliness which goes a long, long way in leavening the show's dark ambiance. Bonham-Carter's reputation as a Merchant-Ivory ""corset queen"" is partially deserved, but she doesn't get near enough credit for how funny she can be (her asides in ""Wings of the Dove"" and ""Welcome to Baghdad"" show a sharp, distinct comic intelligence). Her willingness to lampoon her persona in costume pictures translates beautifully to the morally derelict, slovenly but calculating Mrs.Lovett, who as the (slightly) more mentally present half of the murderous equation anchors the story and reminds the viewer of the giddier joys of such a gruesome and dismal tale. For a moment, you actually believe that Lovett considers Sweeney and Tobias her ""family"" and there's a glimpse of the twisted romantic underneath the blood- soaked veneer of the cannibalistic pie-maker.<br/><br/>The real surprise here is Tim Burton, who confirms his ability as one of the most able and vibrant visual stylists in contemporary film. Burton's uneven output highlights the fact that he's a brilliant showman but unsure as a storyteller; his films are beautifully crafted but many of them drag by the second act, bogged down in visual histrionics and setpieces which dazzle the eye but stagnate the storyline (""Sleepy Hollow"" being only one example of this; shoehorned into a protracted story line the film became draggy and tiring after the second act). Partnered with a stripped-down, lean screenplay by John Logan, Burton finds a perfect framework for his paintbrush, his visual extravagances disciplined by a demandingly sparse and clear-headed narrative. Referencing all manner of ghoulish artistic, theatrical and cinematic traditions including Grand Guinol, Hammer Horror, Mario Bava, and Edward Gory, Burton's every stroke keeps this horror show running efficiently. You can feel his sideshow-worthy glee at the chance to bring this story to the screen and this time his talents are completely attuned to the needs of Sondheim's horror show. If there is a false step here, it's that the film's pacing is too frenetic, lurching from one narrative point to the next almost as though Burton was concerned that the viewer's interest would wander for even a second. As it is the show's edited morsels (the show's numbers have been clipped to ten for the film) have barely a chance to digest in the viewer's mind before zipping to the next installment and the film's ending is more than abrupt. <br/><br/>In most respects it's a triumph, as Burton raises the film from the long shadow of the stage show and makes the story his own. It's as tasty a cinematic pie as any filmmakers could have made out of the fearsome, poisoned stew of the story of the Demon Barber."
"Smuckers","1","135","256","24 December 2007"," A Bloody Mess
","I love ""Sweeney Todd"" the Broadway show. But what a relentless, grim, slog this movie is.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Johnny Depp looks like Cruella De Ville, and sings like David Bowie. He is completely miscast. An overrated actor if there ever was one. Helena Bohnam Carter fares slightly better, but can barely carry a tune. Both look too young for their roles.<br/><br/>Many scenes contain whispered or otherwise unintelligible dialogue. Other scenes are terribly under lit.<br/><br/>The movie has no tempo, no shape. The pacing is leaden. The staging is pedestrian, even during the musical numbers. You keep waiting for them to take off, but they just plod along to their lead footed conclusion.<br/><br/>By stripping out half the score, Burton has taken away the context, the irony, and the dark humor of the Broadway show. What we are left with is a docu-psycho-drama...with music! In the Broadway show, Sweeney gets up off the floor at the end and admonishes the audience to ""attend"" his tale. In the movie, there is no such relief. All we are left with is a perverse, depressing, bloody pieta...fade to black.<br/><br/>Oh, and the blood---! It's horrific, and no amount of apologizing or explaining on behalf of the production team can excuse it. This is beyond ""over-the-top,"" it's gratuitous, even pornographic. Only for the very strongest of stomachs.<br/><br/>The audience I saw the movie with greeted the credits in absolute silence. Then we all glumly shuffled out of the theater, feeling like we needed a shower.<br/><br/>Who is this movie for? People who like musicals will hate the blood. People who like slasher flicks will hate the music. People who like Sondheim will hate the reduced score and the inadequate singing voices. And the teeny boppers who like Johnny Depp will be traumatized for life.<br/><br/>It's a movie for nobody. Stay away. Rent the DVD of the Broadway show."

","Bearing in mind what Tim Burton films are like, I was still disappointed with the end result of the film adaptation of SWEENEY TODD. Most of the problems lie in the fact that Burton makes an already dark and gory tale even darker and gorier. This is precedence over plot and character detail, even cutting songs from the original show that greatly helped these areas.<br/><br/>In discussing the film with my fellow moviegoer, we agreed that the movie does suffer from having ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" excluded from this version. By including any passerby that the camera zooms by (which in this day of CGI, such editing was inevitable) or lingers on, Burton could have easily made this work, too - what a shame. Some cuts and changes, do better the story, such as the toning down of Johanna by making her less freaky a person and less shrieky a singer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately every plus like the aforementioned instance, is met with more than one minus, such as the way the character of the homeless woman in brought into the movie. By introducing her so late into the story (also by cutting an earlier song of hers), we wonder, why bother at all? She becomes a tacked-on subplot, an afterthought of the screenplay. It's no wonder Johnny Depp looks to feel almost nothing for her at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I am also on the ilk that thinks principle characters should not be shown gruesomely dying in the picture frame, unless it serves a clear purpose (e.g. Janet Leigh in PSYCHO). If not, then it only becomes pure exploitation (and hopefully I've given enough hints as to which character I'm speaking of without totally giving it away). This only becomes more apparent as you watch certain characters die and ask, ""how come they got an explicit death scene and not this character?"" What is the point, indeed...<br/><br/>The movie also highlights contrivances in the story itself: how, out of all the people in London, could this homeless woman have encountered all the characters in the story on separate occasions? It's because she's there merely to keep the storytelling wheels turning, and when the story is slimmed down to a stage presence, it seems to make more sense. Likewise, the absence of police, who appear at the end of the play, but not the film. With townspeople disappearing left and right, how could they not have intervened sooner? The movie leaves us with these questions of logic, which, even for a musical, should have been addressed.<br/><br/>As for the principles, they all do an okay job. If any criticism is to be made about the restraint in their singing and acting, the finger should be pointed at how the film was directed. Burton seems to think that he can counterbalance each person by giving them an overly cartoony exterior (Sweeney's Bride-Of-Frankenstein hair) and a very, very subtle interior; subtle to the point of shallow character depth and a communication barely audible (and God only knows how many lines I missed because the actors spoke so quietly). The play seems to have worked successfully with these values reversed - underplayed, but period costumes with bombastic personalities.<br/><br/>Timothy Spall -- whom I hold in high regard, but know he accepts bad scripts sometimes -- is sadly reduced to nothing more than a sniveling rat, complete with bulging eyes and gnarly teeth. I pictured Beadle the way he's seen on stage and thought Spall would fit in so seamlessly. Here his craft is wasted on a one-dimensional, stereotypical villain - another sad, shame of the movie.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him kind of role, is almost totally pointless in being cast. So long as the film had a big name like Depp to draw audiences, any person could have been cast in the role of Pirelli. Most of his songs and lines are reduced to nothing, coupled with an accent that is too difficult to understand. Visually, the mustache bit worked quite well on the stage in revealing his con-artistry, which is not used in the film. Burton only wants to make it known that Borat was cast in his film and wears a ludicrously funny wig before he might be bumped off.<br/><br/>Kudos are to be given to Edward Sanders, the child who was rightfully chosen to play Toby. It's nice to finally have someone who is close to the age of the character because, judging from the stage version, I seemed to have it in my head that Toby was just supposed to be a dwarf. His confident singing voice and charismatic involvement makes an impact over the course of the picture.<br/><br/>It seems that the movie seems is solely impressionable to people because it is opera-like in its music and jarring in its horror - ""the perfect horror musical."" These extremes are only due to the fact that the music has been slimmed down to just under two hours and the dark comedy is stripped to be just, well, dark. You could really just watch the opening credits and know everything about everything that follows. You could just stop watching altogether, and not have to ask yourself questions like, ""why is Sweeney on a boat with that guy?"" To anyone who knows the story, you'd know Sweeney was a prisoner, but that seems to have been rushed in the movie if you don't pay close attention.<br/><br/>Another question to be asked is, ""when is Burton going to NOT use Depp to be some glaring freak in his movies?"" Hopefully the same day Burton decides that making every movie to be a moving Edward Gory illustration has placed him in a rut. SWEENEY is not a complete waste of time, but it is not half of what it could have been, and Burton most definitely needs a change of scenery."

","Tim Burton missed the point of this one. I'm sorry. He just doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Yes, this film is Sweeney Todd through Tim Burton's eyes, that is one thing for sure.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's direction is just way, way too heavy. This material is very dark. It doesn't need the heavy, dark hand of Burton to make it any darker.<br/><br/>I was not a fanatic of the musical before seeing the film. In fact I had only seen one version of the musical before, the most recent Broadway production directed by Jonathan Doyle, with the incomparable Michael Cerveris as Sweeney. So I am not a traditionalist, and I am certainly open to new interpretations. If they are good.<br/><br/>This interpretation simply wasn't. It's not only the fact that Burton changed around major plot points (like how three of the major characters are killed). It's not only Helena Bonham Carter's wooden acting skills (except for when she is screaming as she's burned to death). Burned to death? Wait, that's not in the script. Oh, it is now! And I could be wrong but I don't believe for a second that she is the one singing her role.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by Johnny Depp's singing, although it took some getting used to. I thought it would be awful, and it wasn't. But his acting, which I usually love, was simply awful. Academy Award? Please. Stop kidding around. Maybe I just had a hard time seeing past all the teased up 80s style hair on his head, but a few eyebrow raises, forehead crinkles and blank stares are not my idea of Oscar-worthy acting.<br/><br/>But speaking of jokes, where were they? This script is supposed to be damn funny. Many funny bits sprinkled throughout, from the Worst Pies in London through the silly interludes in Pretty Women to the hilarious double meanings in By the Sea, A Little Priest (I'm sorry, why were they looking out the window in this scene instead of interacting with each other over the pies? I must have missed this. Oh, that's right, they didn't interact in the WHOLE FILM - except for that one part when Sweeney tells her to get out, loved that).<br/><br/>But apparently Tim Burton missed the humor. Not only the humor, but he seemed to have missed the entire point of the whole song A Little Priest (not to mind the whole point of Sweeney's story).<br/><br/>He also took out any sexual references, including a whole song, and made the whole thing very unsexy. I have read reviews saying Carter was very sexy in this, but I didn't see that at all. Yeah, her very shallow cleavage shows through most of the movie, except in one scene during By the Sea when she inexplicably seems to have no breasts or nipples at all, but that doesn't make for sexy.<br/><br/>The only giggle in the entire theater came from me when Sacha Baron Cohen (a breath of fresh air, IMHO) came out in that ridiculous blue body suit reminiscent of the late Evel Knievel.<br/><br/>By making Toby an actual little boy rather than an adolescent or adult who might not be all quite there, Burton took away a lot of the meaning of this part of the script as well, and took away some of the humor from Pirelli's Miracle Elixir as well as one of the most beautiful songs of all, Not While I'm Around.<br/><br/>Oh and don't get me started on the music. Horrible, awful. Taking Sondheim's masterpiece and making it almost unrecognizable. There were three tempos of music in the film: very slow, extremely slow, and super fast. Really it's only two tempos (very slow and super fast) but I'm trying to give a little more credit than is deserved. In parts the usually gorgeous score tended to drag on and on and on and in other parts it was so rapid it was like someone suddenly just turned up the metronome and no one realized it. Almost like little robot people just got their engines revved up.<br/><br/>Yes, robotic. That's how I would describe almost all of the acting. Alan Rickman was good as usual. Sacha Baron Cohen gave some needed spice to the movie. I usually love Johnny Depp and can rarely find fault with him, but this older, not wiser, version of Edward Scissorhands just did not sit very well with me. I usually hate Bonham Carter and she did not disappoint in this regard. Why was she cast in the film again? Oh, right. She's Tim Burton's wife. I almost forgot.<br/><br/>Jamie Campbell Bower was okay as Anthony, seemed a little young for the role and his facial expressions were odd at times, but he held his own. And Jayne Wisener had the best singing voice in the cast (besides Rickman's, which was quite good as well), her acting wasn't bad either.<br/><br/>Timothy Spall was at times bearable, at times awful as Beadle. Does everything have to be visual with you, Burton? Is everyone ugly evil and everyone evil ugly and all is black and white? Seems that way.<br/><br/>The visuals were sometimes interesting, but mostly again very very heavy handed, and unnecessarily so. I didn't see anything interesting or original about them. They were also at times completely implausible. For example, there is no physical way the chute for the bodies could go directly to the basement fro the barber shop. Thet would have to pass through Mrs. Lovett's bakery. This is stupid and unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you're sick of reading my review, then you get a small sense of how I felt at the end of the movie. Except you didn't pay hard earned money to read this, lucky you. I should have left in the first 5 minutes of the film when I had the impulse."

","I suppose in many ways I should've found out more about this movie, rather than just thinking it looked good on the trailer and going to see it. Still, that's the way it went, so here goes the review.<br/><br/>First thing I noted, just from the opening credits, was the Burtonesque style. This had me immediately concerned as I'm not a huge fan of his work. Why not? Well, I do find his work is very much style over substance. His films look good, but I've never been over enamoured with anything else. Burton films are like Windows Vista; looks good but ultimately you want to leave it alone. Okay, so I've paid good money, I'll sit it out and hope it's more Beetlejuice than Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>Second thing I noted was that it was a musical. This surprised me. Not being the sort to frequent stage shows, I hadn't realised that there was a stage musical to base it on. Ah. Still, it might work, this sort of thing has been done before. I'll give it a chance.<br/><br/>Well, it didn't work. It was very typically Burton style over substance, yet again. London looked gloriously slummy and very definitely suited the mood, in much the same way the Michael Keaton ""Batman"" recreated Gotham as a dark place. I didn't like that film, either, for much the same style over substance reason. After a few minutes of admiring how the mood has been captured, you're bored and want the film to entertain.<br/><br/>But there was worse to come.<br/><br/>For a start, Johnny Depp's cockney accent drifted into Jack Sparrow. Every time it happened - and it did so a lot - it grated on me, purely because Captain Jack is not a macabre character, and hearing that voice detracted from that required for Benjamin Barker's unstable mental state. I wanted someone who would be full of malice and ill-will generated by gross injustice, and I ended up seeing a hapless pirate with delusions of grandeur. Not good.<br/><br/>Then there was Helena Bonham-Carter, playing the role of a slightly unhinged woman with mad hair and poor complexion. Ooh, what a surprise! I'm sure the point was that there was supposed to be a chemistry between Sweeney and Mrs Lovett, but there was nothing. Nothing at all. I know there's supposed to be a degree of unrequited love on Mrs Lovett's part, but in this she was moping round him like a lovesick teenager, getting nothing back.<br/><br/>If this is based on the musical, then I don't want to see it. It seemed as though the songs were purely ""sung dialogue"" rather than actual music scores. In many cases, the songs didn't even seem to fit. Perhaps there should be more to them, maybe there is in the stage show, but on screen it was awful. And we can't even blame the medium either, as Grease transferred to the silver screen very well.<br/><br/>Then there was the gore. Talk about obvious! After the first couple of slashings, it was very tiresome and unnecessary. Burton really could do with taking lessons from Tarantino on how to do gory violence; we all know the scene from Reservoir Dogs, where Mr. Blond cuts the ear off the police officer whilst dancing to ""Stuck in the middle with you"". We never see the act, just hear the screams, which makes it all the more sickening. The mind can do more justice to implied violence than the camera ever can with visuals.<br/><br/>The film was too long, too. How much of it was entirely necessary, I wonder? There was one massive plot diversion which was just a complete waste of time. Making an audience invest in a substantial subplot and not follow it through to a reasonable conclusion is extremely irritating.<br/><br/>And to cap it all, the cherry on the icing on the excrement cake, Alan Rickman wasn't even as good as he usually is as an arch villain. Granted, it's a change not to see him overact, but in this case the role positively demanded it.<br/><br/>It gets a half star from me purely because there were a couple of lines which made me chuckle and because Timothy Spall played a good weaselly character. I score it a 1 as that's as low as I can go."

","Sweeney Todd is an old story that is not based on a real 19th century murderer--despite some recent rumors that this legend is true. Though the original story has changed a bit over the years, the basic elements remain. A man is wrongly convicted and returns years later to exact revenge--slicing the throats of the wicked (and sometimes innocent) and then having the bodies disposed of in meat pies sold to the unsuspecting public! <br/><br/>The movie is based on the Sondheim musical. Over the years, there have been other non-musical versions of the fabled story of Sweeney Todd, but Stephen Sondheim has truly popularized this grisly tale of revenge and madness. However, if you are used to the Rogers and Hammerstein or Lerner and Loewe style of musicals, be prepared for a wildly different sort of musical. This isn't just because of the very, very dark subject matter but also the style of singing. Unlike these other famous musical teams, SWEENEY TODD does not offer songs that you will quickly find yourself humming or will hear on an elevator. That's because this production isn't a traditional musical with catchy lyrics, but where the dialog is sung to music--somewhat like the wonderful UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG (wow, aside from this, you can't find two films more unalike). And since the emphasis is on dialog that is sung, the style may take a lot of getting used to. Plus, you probably WON'T find yourself tapping your feet and humming to the amazingly fast-paced and somewhat maniacal music. About the only really traditional style song is the lovely ""Joanna"".<br/><br/>This style singing does take some getting used to, though this film adaptation of the musical is much more approachable to the casual viewer. That's because in the play, many of the songs are sung in a crazy and cacophonous manner--with many singers across the stage singing DIFFERENT parts that generally DON'T harmonize well with each other. This strange and sometimes painful style was done to emphasize Sweeney's madness and I understood the symbolism--I just didn't particularly like it and I was thrilled that these twisted chorusers were absent from the film. Instead, the music was sung by either individuals or in duets (which were ALSO often sung very separately but with much less cacophony than an entire chorus). My daughter, quite the purist and lover of theater told me she missed this aspect of the film--she WANTED the insane chorus. As for me and the average audience member, I am sure this change by Tim Burton is a welcome one. The bottom line is that the stage style was just too annoying and headache-evoking.<br/><br/>While I am talking about the songs, I must point out that despite originally feeling very skeptical about casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads (after all, they're NOT known for their singing ability), they and the rest of the cast did quite well. I am sure that the modern ability to make practically ANYONE a singing sensation (such as Hillary Duff or Ashlee Simpson) was employed, but it did work. Now this isn't to say that they or the rest of the cast have gorgeous and melodious voices--they don't. But, for this style of film, it worked perfectly. Had they been cast in a remake of THE SOUND OF MUSIC or some other more traditional musical, it probably wouldn't have worked. Oddly, despite their being more than competent in the roles, I have heard some snipes about them and I can assure you they DID do well and were well cast.<br/><br/>Now as for the rest of the film, I must STRONGLY urge caution, as this is one of the most violent films I have ever seen. Sure, some films show many more deaths but the closeup shots of throats being slit and profuse torrents of blood is NOT for the squeamish nor is the sight of seeing the corpses splat onto the floor below as they are dropped through the trap door. I noticed several in the theater covering their eyes during the murder scenes--including my daughter. It's not for the faint-hearted and really is up close and brutal in how it depicts the killings. It worked--the murders looked very vivid and real--perhaps too real. With a little more left to the imagination with the killings, I really think the film might have worked a tad better for the average viewer. I have a very high tolerance for this stuff (probably partly due to my being a human biology minor in college), but most will cringe at all the carnage.<br/><br/>Now as for the aesthetics of the film. As you probably would expect, director Burton did his usual marvelous job. The dankness and awfulness of a Dickensian England is vivid and convincing. The plethora of roaches and rats also heightened this awful realism as did the terrible dental work of the actors. Unlike many films set in this era that featured actors with lovely capped teeth, the actors here abounded with crooked teeth! What I particularly liked about the film and what really jumped out at me was the cinematography--how almost everything was done in sepia and gray tones. There were a few exceptions but these were wonderful and were designed as the occasional and shocking contrast (such as the blueness of Pirelli's clothes or the intensity of the blood). Additionally, the fantasy sequence was extremely colorful and this made it one of the most striking and funny scenes in the film--quite appropriate to the mood.<br/><br/>So overall, apart from the intensity of the violence, this was a great film and a nice improvement over the Sondheim stage production due to its wickedly dark humor and style."

","In watching this movie I couldn't help think that how fundamentally different I must be to a large percentage of the world if I can be so bored and disappointed by such a movie that so many people seem to enjoy.<br/><br/>I enjoy all types of music, as long as there is a good tune and harmony, or at least something interesting happening with it. The music in this reminded me of what I could produce in 5 minutes if someone told me to think of some tunes for a musical. There is nothing here that will be sung at any point in the future - nothing that brings goosebumps to your skin with its musical ingenuity or complexity.<br/><br/>The music aside, what a gruesome, yet wholly boring story! Isn't the point of a movie to get the audience interested in the story and actually care about what is going on? Why would we care about a cannibalistic couple, and why would we want Sweeney to succeed in finding his daughter again when he so mercilessly kills strangers and eats them? The movie is truly a case of 100% style (even that is boring after the first 5 minutes) and 0% substance.<br/><br/>And the casting... it was like a ""who's who"" of recent mainstream movies such as the Harry Potter series (just one more movie to add to their lists), along with a Mrs. Burton (I'm sure that audition was tough) and some pirate who was apparently attempting a cockney accent. Even the teenaged boy and girl were not suitably good-looking enough and lacked any sort of screen presence.<br/><br/>In summary, do not see. Save your money and purchase some true art or decent music."
"theatrefreak4276","3","31","59","23 December 2007"," My review of the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd. (From a long time Sweeney Fan Part)
","They took out ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". This is my first complaint about the movie adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, directed by Tim Burton. Secondly, pretty boy Johnny Depp could not sing bass so they raised the key, talking away from the true majesty that comes with the deep, dark voice of Sweeney. Helena Bonham Carter, Who played Mrs. Lovette was no Angela Lansberry, by any means; and furthermore, to add to the insult of the tragedy that is this movie, they took out half of the funniest puns in ""Have a Little Priest""!<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a Dark COMEDY; however in this adaptation, they took out most of the comedy. Mrs. Lovette's first song, which starts off saying, ""Wait! What's your rush? What's your hurry? You gave me such a fright, thought you was a ghost..."" was by far one of the greatest disappointments yet in this film. While Johnny's silent performance in this song was commendable, the execution of the song was not, by any means, as comical as it was intended to be in the play form. The actress lacked enthusiasm, charisma, and cleverness! <br/><br/>To anyone who knows the musical Sweeney Todd, it is an indisputable fact that Mrs. Lovette is the comical relief of the show. She is the fun light hearted, yet twisted, entertaining character. She is the heart of Sweeney Todd. Without her in the show, Sweeney would just be to dark, and depressing. The performance, or the lack there of, by Helena Bonham Carter was just that, to dark and far to depressing. Instead of creating comical relief in the gloom of Sweeney's tragedy, she added to the miserable tone. Mrs. Lovette should be the meddling, gossiping, slightly insane, yet somehow lovable character that we all know and adore, even though it is well understood that she has several screws loose. She is the Ying to Sweeney's Yang.<br/><br/>As far as Tobias goes, he was probably one of the best performers there. Though I may have a few quarrels with some of his facial expressions during the performance of his songs ""God that's Good"" and ""Mr. Pirelli's Miracle Elixir,"" his overall innocence (in appearance) and charm made up for any issues that come from being a young actor.<br/><br/>For once, I have finally seen the love story between Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) done correctly, even if they took out the song ""Kiss Me."" There was an innocence in Antony's love for Johanna that had been severely lacking in many stage adaptations I have seen.<br/><br/>While the love story may have been done well, the sub plot of Antony and Johanna was under played. Not to mention, the fact that by taking out the song ""Kiss me"" it eliminated some of the empathy felt for Johanna. The song describes how she would rather die than marry her adoptive father Judge Turpin.<br/><br/>Speaking of Judge Turpin. The casting of Alan Rickman was a splendid choice. Rickman Commanded any scene he was in and stole the show. His understanding of the character and execution of the role was astounding. Rickman is a truly amazing actor. He does not just play the role he owns it and becomes it. I could not have casted the role better my self. He was remarkable.<br/><br/>The beggar woman was completely PG rated down. In the play she is a beggar, but also a prostitute. In the first scene with the sailer, she solicits her self to him in a very crude manner and Anthony tells her to get lost; however, in the movie, there was no such reference.<br/><br/>I have a bone to pick with director Tim Burton. While the set and technical aspects of Sweeney Todd where amazing, some of the choices he made still baffle me. The elimination of the choirs was one of the biggest mistakes he could have possibly made. The creation of a narrative choirs helped explain what we may have missed in the songs, and also, shed light onto the ""hard times"" mentioned so often by Sweeney and Mrs. Lovette. London, England at this time in history was not all spic and span. Times were indeed hard, and the poor were many. Though, Tim Burton kept the music of the choirs in the movie, by eliminating the choirs' presence, he took away any explanation that was needed for the audience to have closer at the end of the movie. Not to mention the effect it had on songs such as: ""God That's Good.""<br/><br/>Another choice that was painful to me as a lover of Sweeney Todd, was the fact that Sweeney built his own chair. By talking away the anxiousness of Sweeney awaiting his chair, it made the fact that he had listened to Mrs. Lovette and waited, a bit less obvious; not to mention the fact that it hurt the song ""God that's Good."" In the play Sweeney Todd, the song, ""God that's Good"" is the opening of Act II. The beginning and end of an Act are supposed to be the most moving and stimulating songs of a musical performance. The choices Tim Burton made in ""Have a Little Priest"" and ""God that's Good"" made it so the audience was left hanging, and not in a a good way. To all Sweeney lovers, the quote ""How 'bout royal marine... With or without his privates?..... With is extra."" was taken out, along with other puns which made the rip roar laughter of this song vanish.<br/><br/>For the entire Review, go to http://www.myspace.com/theatrefreak4276 and look at the bog entitled ""My Review on Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"""
"rebecca-turner-2","8","28","53","14 December 2007"," Burton does it again...wonderful!
","I went into this film very nervous. As a huge fan of Sondheim and the stage show, I wasn't sure that the film would measure up. I was pleasantly surprised. While it certainly does not surpass the stage show by any means, I think that Burton and his cast paid wonderful homage to Sondheim's genius. I almost wish that Depp and Bonham Carter had stronger voices though. However, having never sung before, both of them did wonderfully. I had zero respect for Sascha Baron Cohen before seeing this film, but he was a delight. Alan Rickman was fabulous, as always, and the new faces in the cast are ones I hope to see again. Visually, the film was stunning. A bit gory for my tastes, but the story certainly calls for it. The colors were fantastic, and the contrasts Burton made were eye-popping. Musically, it could have been a lot worse. They cut the opening number, which is one of my favorites, and seriously shortened A Little Priest, which is my all-time favorite song, but the cast really stepped up to the plate with the music, and they did a wonderful job. Helena Bonham Carter is no Angela Lansbury (the original Mrs. Lovett), but she was great. Not a film I could see frequently, just because of all the gore, but I loved it."
"bgrot","6","17","30","26 December 2007"," A fine musical... ruined.
","The duet of Tim Burton & Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to behold. Unfortunately, this time the creepy fairy tale for adults has gone too far with superfluous gore, blood, and neck-slashing. Wonderful cinematography, spectacular costumes and strong acting in the first part of the movie are eclipsed by the fountains of blood in the second half. The gore is hardly necessary, as it doesn't add anything to the movie, but it seriously detracts. More than once, we found ourselves turning our heads away from close-up shots of necks slit open by a razor, and with each time we were less inclined to look back at the screen. It's sad to see an old master like Burton caving in to what appears to be the norm in Hollywood with respect to graphic violence and high body count."

","In the Victorian London, the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) is married with the gorgeous Lucy and they have a lovely child, Johanna. The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) that falsely accuses the barber of a crime that he had not committed and abuses of Lucy later. After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. Sweeney Todd meets the widow Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and owner of a meat pie shop that tells him that Lucy committed suicide with arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself as tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those that made him suffer and lose his beloved family.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a dark an d bloody tale of revenge in a London with a corrupt aristocracy. Tim Burton uses his favorite actor and friend Johnny Depp together with his wife Helen Bonham Carter in a stylish musical, disclosing a series of murders committed by a deranged man blinded by the need of revenge after being separated from his family by an evil judge. The plot point in the end, when Sweeney discovers the identity of the beggar, gives the necessary element for a perfect conclusion. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Sweeney Todd: O Barbeiro Demoníaco da Rua Fleet"" (""Sweeney Todd: The Demoniac Barber of Fleet Street"")"
"oregongrl88","10","11","18","22 December 2007"," Mr. Burton, I bow to you.
","I first saw ""Sweeney Todd"" about five years ago when I rented the Angela Lansbury Broadway movie, after that I was hooked on Sweeney. So naturally when I found out that Tim Burton would be at the helm of a film version of the beloved musical I was ex tactic, now my favorite director would be directing my favorite musical. Then I found out about the cast. My favorite actors would be in the title roles. It seemed so perfect, then I remembered, this was a musical. Could they pull off the daunting signing ranges that Sondhiem so brilliantly penned? Yes, yes they could.<br/><br/>I saw the midnight showing and when the film started I was left completely breathless. The cinematic scope of the film was awesome in every sense of the term. Depp and Bonham Carter were a perfect match for their roles. Regardless of the fact that many people have been commenting on Carter's wispy voice and how it isn't ""Lovettish"" I beg to disagree. The character of Mrs. Lovett (like any other character in the history of theater and film) can be interpreted in any way. Most people were comparing Carter's interpretation of Mrs. Lovett with that of Angela Lansbury's; they are completely different people! This time Lovett is an Innocent soul, and not in the pure sense. She is innocent due to lack of education and of illiteracy, she wants so much to be a motherly figure and a lover that she is this naive woman, until of course the subject of business and monetary funds come into play.<br/><br/>You cannot go into this film and automatically compare it to the stage version. It is a film, plain and simple. Burton puts his signature on the film while it still remains the Sondheim classic that we know. Sondhiem wrote Sweeney's music not as enhancing songs to strengthen the plot (like most musicals do) but he wrote it to tell the plot. It is the closest thing you can get before you cross the line into the land of Opera. And the wonderful thing about this film adaptation is that Burton kept that sense about him, the music was telling the story. So everything added up with the song at hand, making the movie flow like it was an elaborate two hour waltz. The beat of the movements, the turn of the camera and the angles that it captured, the speech of the actors and the voices that came out of everyone of them was amazing. This film is amazing. So Mr. Burton, my heartfelt thanks to you. Finally I have a favorite movie."

","I saw it the other night, but um...I came away from it feeling quite disturbed. I thought the sets and costumes were great, and it started out very well...but then quickly plunged into depravity and just pure evil. I couldn't figure out why anyone would make a musical about a character who killed his clients so violently by slitting their throats, having them tip backwards into a trapdoor, land with a crunch onto the flagstones in the room below...and then be made into meat pies to be sold for human consumption. And then, to burst into song about it.<br/><br/>I mean, hello? We're supposed to find that entertaining? What's wrong with our world that we're fed this morbific junk?<br/><br/>I did a little research and found out that it was somewhat based on a true story, which is even more sickening -<br/><br/>""There is little romantic or even melodramatic about the life and times of Sweeney Todd. He was an amoral, bitter man who lusted for money and was not averse to killing to get it.""<br/><br/>Basically, he killed his clients, robbed them, and then they were made into pies. Wow. Why do people make these violent murderers famous, as though they are some great hero? And a musical about it, no less?<br/><br/>I think Johnny Depp is a remarkable actor, an incredible talent...but I thought this film was nauseating."
"Low Man","4","16","29","5 January 2008"," Ummmmmmm...well OK
","OK...so I've spent a fair amount of time in pit orchestras, and I had to check this out. When one makes one's living in a pit orchestra, one often ends up despising any musical one plays. Night after night of endless repetition of the same story with the same music eventually inflates every flaw in the wretched sing-spiel to the level of Chinese water torture. That is, in most cases.<br/><br/>You see, Sweeney Todd is one of 6 musicals that I'll play anytime. (If you care, the others are Fiddler on the Roof, Into the Woods, West Side Story, Cabaret, and Street Scene...only one of which has a good movie made from it.) The almost operatic intensity of the music and story is compelling, and after having been in the pit for Sweeney Todd...well, I don't really know how many times I've done it, but it exceeds 100...I still like it a lot. If you hated this film, give the 2001 live concert performance with the San Francisco Symphony a look before you write it off. It is nothing short of great. It's short on stage effects and other theatrical devices, but the performance is, nevertheless, staggering.<br/><br/>This film, though. Well, I did not hate it. My previous experience with the musical may have something to do with that. It may be that I am allowing my love for the original material to color my thoughts on this film. It certainly has problems.<br/><br/>Most of the dark humor has been sucked out of it, particularly in the number ""Try a Little Priest"". I'm so used to it being played with an hysterical mood, that the Gothic nihilism with which this film executes it does nothing to break the mood of what is, let's face it, a very disturbing story.<br/><br/>There are also some cuts I didn't much care for, although I may not have cared for any at all to tell the truth. The musical runs a good 3 hours, and unless you're doing a Tolkien story or something, most movie studios don't want to do that. Still...the musical flows so beautifully in its uncut form. A superb musical sequence involving a gorgeous counterpoint of themes and action between one scene with Anthony & Johanna talking excitedly about eloping and another where the Judge & the Beadle discuss a barber on Fleet Street is reduced to just part of the Judge & Beadle scene. Its absence mars a later number as well. I missed it keenly and played my DVD of the above mentioned 2001 performance as soon as I got home.<br/><br/>OK...a few words about casting, and I'll shut up. From a musical standpoint, Depp is really wrong for this role. Throughout I kept thinking ""Edward Scissorshands"". His voice is simply not up to the singing part the role demands. The rant song, as I always think of it, loses a lot because of it. When I first heard he was playing the title role I remember thinking they must have gotten a stunt voice for him, but they didn't. The movie suffers for it. Carter does OK. Again I think it suffers for an abandonment of the maniacal in favor of goth sensibilities, but that could be a personal problem. The big surprise for me was Rickman, who, though not great, rose to the role of the judge very nicely. As for everyone else...adequate...I guess.<br/><br/>So...as I said. I didn't hate it. It could have been far better."

","The biggest error, other than horrible casting, is that no one appears to have directed this mess. It's just talking heads for scenes and scenes, and all the songs are either gone or underplayed to the point of boredom--it's like Tim Burton is a pouting child who's sitting in a corner saying, ""fine, I'll give you songs for your musical, but I don't have to like it--there, there's your song--you happy now?"" He clearly isn't interested in making a musical, and that's part of the problem. I think like most of the stuff he remakes, he just ran into this show, and knew one thing: the sellout goth kids would go see it, making tons of dough for him and his fake-out, ""look-at-me, I'm-so-artistically-weird,"" ilk. I mean, I love Sweeney Todd (the musical), and I was bored in this movie. That really shouldn't happen when people are being slaughtered by a barber. That should be holding your interest if it's done right.<br/><br/>Let's just accept the fact that Burton is going to massacre Alice In Wonderland when he gets his hands on it next year. He needs to give up remakes and adaptations altogether, because his track record with them since 1999 is one good (sleepy hollow) to three bad, and this one is even worse than his abysmal Planet of the Apes. Depp is a good actor, and all due respect to the man who played in Gilbert Grape and other fine roles. But this is completely beyond him. He's about as scary as a paper clip. I wouldn't trust him to have the dexterity to manslaughter a munchkin that needed hip replacement. He's that ineffectual. But the real Turkey Award goes to Helena Bonham Carter, whose Mrs. Lovett is so lifeless, it almost makes you unaware of the other howling error in casting her: she can't sing worth a bird's hat. She's really awful, seriously.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SWEENEY TODD IN SOME FORM OR OTHER!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but this must be said, and I don't want to spoil the story (although clearly that wasn't a prerogative of Burton's) for anyone, so only read this part if you're familiar with the whole story already.<br/><br/>The reason this got 1.5 stars (rather than .5 stars) is because of one thing: it's really gratifying to see Helena Bonham Carter burning. Really, really gratifying. She should be burned alive in everything she's in from now on."

What makes a musical a musical? Good music.<br/><br/>What does Sweeney Todd have? The worst music I've ever heard in a musical. Besides the singing in this movie, which was embarrassing to hear. The music was completely atrocious. Couple that with a plot that tries it's hardest to be depressing and morbid but fails miserably. Throw in a bunch of obviously fake blood and by a bunch I mean a lot of fake blood. And you get Sweeney Todd!"
"L. Lion","3","19","36","26 January 2008"," The rut
","Tim Burton is stuck in a rut. His film Sweeney Todd  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street looks like Willie Wonka, which looked like Sleepy Hollow, which borrowed much from Ed Wood and the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. When he goes outside of his oeuvre of desaturated colors and Gothic pallor his films are usually awful  Planet of the Apes, anyone? So is there any reason that I shouldn't have been bored with his dreadful Sweeney Todd? I have already seen this movie several times in its different Burton/Depp incarnations, and it isn't getting better with age. I loved Vincent, his first animated short. I enjoyed Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. I thought Ed Wood was his most complete film. But since then Burton has been in a rut, and I don't want to be in there with him anymore.<br/><br/>Burton is, at best, a creator of atmosphere. His ability to stage stories has declined, and he has never been much as a provider of action. Sweeney Todd's story is surprisingly weak  a demented barber, unjustly transported, returns to London to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. His ally is an equally demented chef (Helena Bonham Carter) who will make use of the bodies of those he slays to make meat pies. So the story is basically the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a musical told from the point of view of Ed Gein. Most of Todd's victims had absolutely nothing to do with the injustice enacted upon him or work into his plans for vengeance. The bloodbath might have been more lighthearted had Burton and Depp not worked so assiduously to develop Todd's burning internal rage at the judge, but not the society as a whole. As it is, it makes me wonder why Todd is expending such effort to slaughter innocent men. Not that I felt any emotional reaction one way or the other.<br/><br/>One of the largest problems with the film is the aching pace at which the plot moves. There are, at best, six main players to the storyline  how it takes more than two hours for these somewhat somnambulant performers to finally come together is something I witnessed but cannot justify. Depp glowers and simmers as the angry Todd, and his singing voice is the best of the leads, but the performance, like his Willie Wonka, lacks heart. Alan Rickman is the evil judge that Todd desires to wreak his vengeance upon, and their interactions are perfunctory and without fireworks. The only time the film actually moves is when Todd faces down an imperious Italian barber with a secret, played by Borat's Sacha Baron Cohen. But then Cohen is dead, and we are back into the swill of 19th century London.<br/><br/>The music is also a problem. I am certain with trained Broadway singing stars that it had its moments on stage, but in the film it is simply flat, exasperatingly expository, and every time the characters break into song the film loses any momentum it had.<br/><br/>All of Burton's films have the same atmospheric quality, and it is very well evoked here, but I found this film to be a boring disappointment. Tim, climb out of your rut."
"Quinoa1984","10","12","21","25 December 2007"," about the juiciest, bloodiest good/sad musical time you'll have this year
","With Sweeney Todd, one of the most notorious (and acclaimed) stories to come out of 19th century London England, and later as a much more acclaimed musical from Stephen Soundheim, Tim Burton crafts a masterpiece of the macabre, a work full of harsh, visceral drama, a sinister look to the picture which only once or twice takes an escape to brighter (more elusive) pastures, and even pitch-black humor, the kind that isn't fit for the gallows but a slice of a razor to a horrible demise at the meat-grinder. It's also a sad film, a deep sorrow that pulses in nearly every frame that Johnny Depp occupies as Benjamin Barker-turned-Sweeney Todd which pervades the wretched vengeance that he seeks following his inexcusable detachment from his wife and daughter via Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Burton here, more than ever I might wager, deals with punishment and evil, as well as what it means to be an anti-hero (if one could call a ""Demon Barber"" as such), and as well what a real cold-blooded villain is.<br/><br/>The latter might be considered, more-so than Mr. T, in the form of Mrs. Lovett, who runs the place below where Mr. Barker used to run his barbershop, featuring the ""Worst Meat-Pies in London."" Following a savage, quick death of a character, she comes up with the idea to hide the body, and thus also continue a lucrative profit- take the bodies that Todd slices open whilst getting their shave, and grinding them into meat pies for a whole new cult of a crowd, who end up flocking to for such bloody-good (some pun intended) culinary delights. Meantime there's a subplot involving the Judge, Todd's long lost daughter Joanna, and a young man who has fallen in love with her- and her with him- from behind the prison of her betrothed. And there's also a child, Toby (talented young Ed Sanders), who becomes quasi-orphaned and starts to work at the meat-pie establishment. Innocence, of course, is something so fragile it can break in an instant.<br/><br/>Almost 80% of the film, I should mention, is sung by the actors. And while not in a kind of complete and utter show-stopping manner that is more common for Broadway, they take the completely superb songs, devilish, pondering, contemplating, scheming, and full of longing (there's much more in the lyrics than one would expect) and make them their own. It's a given the young Joanna and Anthony get the conventional song of young, forbidden love, but aside from that Soundheim breaks open the vein, so to speak, of the melodrama inherent in a horror story like the one here. There's even a bleak streak of humor to the proceedings, be it an extended song that distracts Pirelli (perfect comic timing by Sascha Baron Cohen as an Italian with a secret), or the juxtaposition of Todd's various killings and a touching tune, or just Mrs. Lovett's descriptions of which people to take for the kill. With music and word Soundheim's tale of tragic mayhem is not without a whole lot of entertainment value, more than one not familiar with the stage version would expect. I tapped my fingers whilst blood flowed and dark looks gleamed through the dark color palette.<br/><br/>Now, taking into account Burton's knack at surprise (and precise) casting choices- Depp exceeds greatly in his first musical role, giving moments of subtly in just the deadened expression on his eyes while his two-dimensional frame consumes him; Carter has the best role to fill in the main lot of characters, as someone seemingly pleasant in her dirty Dickens way but also far more evil than she'll let on; Rickman, for ever little word he utters, is savage in having whatever he can by hook or by crook- it should be noted how superlative Burton matches technique with the source material. It's such good directing where, as with Nightmare Before Christmas (only here arguably more operatic), we get wrapped up in what should be an escapist experience of a musical with vast sets and beautifully grungy 19th century costumes and (typically) Gothic makeup. It's a twisted time and place of the slums of London, and Burton and his DP supplant that look of despair, where we'll see for an instant (satirically of course) a look at paradise on a beach in the future, or a glimpse into the past. But there's also a fully rounded human experience going on too, where it all fits in the context where it's set: realistic it isn't entirely, but everything emotionally feels on-target.<br/><br/>One more note of the obvious, if you've already heard from critics: it contains the most graphic bloodshed of any musical I've ever seen, or even in Burton's oeuvre (and this is from countless beheaded folk in Sleepy Hollow talking). It flows as if Alexander de Large from Clockwork Orange were in charge of special neck F/X. And it's certainly not for the kiddies who flocked to Charlie and the Cholocate Factory or Pee Wee. Sweeney Todd is gruesome, but with a purpose: Burton and Soundheim have made a testament to the inescapable wrath of vengeance unyielded, where figures from the past, no matter how close, will get in the path of destruction, and terror is always up behind you, cleaning your face, giving one quick swipe as if by catharsis. I loved it."

","Everyone is going crazy for this movie, but, honestly, I hated it. I've only walked out of two movies in my entire life (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and Burton's last misguided offering, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), but I was very tempted while watching this slapdash piece of crap. I ended up dozing off a couple of times instead.<br/><br/>First of all, Johnny Depp is fantastic, and his singing is excellent. However, even he can't carry this mess of a film. Tim Burton has simply lost his gift, and his visual style here is bland and lazy. Burton's classic work seems to have stunted his growth as a filmmaker, and everything in this film seems recycled from earlier, far superior films. Even the flat where Depp's Todd carries out his work looks exactly like the dwelling that housed Edward Scissorhands. Nods to Sleepy Hollow are very apparent as well, and at times, it almost looks like Burton reused sets and costumes from that film.<br/><br/>The much-hyped gore is, indeed, shocking... The first time you see it. However, Burton repeats the grisly bits of Todd's work so frequently, and with such banal non-zest, that by the third repetition, the impact of these rotely executed scenes shifts from ""Oh, that was awesome!"" to ""Oh, that again?"". Burton even uses the same camera angle for each session, so these morbid snapshots of Todd's madness become interchangeable and unmemorable.<br/><br/>With a film this unattractive to look at, the length becomes a factor, and this is especially frustrating since Burton devotes a large chunk of the film to a subplot that never gets resolved. It's highly manipulative to waste significant runtime getting your audience invested in characters, only to leave their plot thread dangling when the credits roll. Adding another layer of needless filler, we have the presence of Mr. Baron Cohen, whose character in the film is essentially worthless, and whose lone contribution to the affair is padding out the running time even more. Further muddling the cast is Burton's nepotistic placement of his lover in the leading female role. Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job, but she doesn't bring anything to the film that scores of other actresses couldn't have pulled off.<br/><br/>While the ending has a nice punch because of the twists that unfold (I'll spare you the spoilers), we can't hold anyone here responsible for that, since the story is not Burton's creation. He chose great material, but a less self-derivative filmmaker would have done so much more with such a gruesome and delightful tale.<br/><br/>The lone piece of true interest in the film is the fine work of the brilliant Alan Rickman, who plays a villain better than anyone in the business. However, even here Burton falters, and Rickman's screen time is disappointingly short, especially considering the importance his character occupies in the overall story. <br/><br/>I've read so many positive reviews of this film that I felt the opposing viewpoint needed to be put out there so that others who felt like they wasted valuable time enduring this laborious drivel wouldn't feel alone.<br/><br/>Burton's body of work is unquestionably impressive, but he's clearly stuck in the past. Since he's obviously looking backwards, I urge you to do the same instead of wasting your time here. The running time of Sweeney Todd could much better be used revisiting Ed Wood, Beetlejuice, or even Mars Attacks, all of which are much better examples of what Burton is capable of as filmmaker."
"catuus","1","20","39","8 April 2008"," Burton's Todd gets a vat of venom, and deserves it.
","It would have been nice had Tim Burton produced a ""Sweeney Todd"" that did a certain amount of justice to Steven Sondheim's masterwork. Unfortunately, what Sondheim wrote and Burton put out bear only the most casual resemblance to each other  namely, they have a lot of the same words and much of the same music  assuming that you prefer Shakespeare's witches acting like Wagner's norns (Anna Russell: ""this dreary set of women""), or prefer Beethoven's 5th taken at the tempo of Chopin's funeral march. Blech!<br/><br/>It should be noted that there are already available 2 other versions of this opera (yes, I know it has spoken dialogue, but so does Carmen when it's done properly). Both star the talented George Hearn as Sweeney. One is the 1982 fully staged version with Angela Lansbury grasping immortality as Mrs. Lovett. The other is the 2001 concert version with the great Patti LuPone. Ms LuPone does an undeniable star turn in this role, but fails to achieve Lansbury's high orbit. Hearn is a tremendous Sweeney, although in 2001 he's showing the 19 elapsed years since the last recording. I would recommend either of these entries, although my recommendation of the 1982 version is unqualified, enthusiastic, and excited.<br/><br/>And now Tim Burton tackles the Demon Barber. Burton is an erratic director who often hits the heights but here sinks to a new low in this thing that is less a performance than a travesty. <br/><br/>The reader may notice I mention none of the other performers. This is done mostly to protect the innocent. They do well enough, but their quality is still leagues from the 1982 version. As in nearly everything that went wrong with this Sweeney, I blame the director. <br/><br/>Somebody must have told Burton that Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy. He seems to have forgotten about the ""comedy"" and concentrated on the ""dark""  to great excess, alas. Practically everything is filmed through blue filters  which may have been considered clever technique 50 years ago but is now just a strain on the eyes.<br/><br/>On first viewing the film, and assuming you know the score, the first thing you will notice is the complete absence of the chorus. Considering the deep relationship between Sweeney and Greek theater, this omission is akin to dropping the witches from Macbeth. It is this omission that robs the work of its dimensionality and causes the ending to fall flatter than last week's soufflé.<br/><br/>Aside from the directorial murder of the chorus and its music, this performance contains a number of omissions, truncations, and abbreviations. The flagellation scene, as I recall, is gone. The Todd-Pirelli contest contains only the shaving part, not the tooth-pulling half. (This omission is fairly common in performance, alas). The Beggar Woman's part is excised by about 50%, including most of the best bits. The ""God, That's Good"" number is foreshortened to the point of being seen on edge. The wildly funny lead up to Beadle Bamford's murder is gone. And so on and on. Somebody should remind Burton that this is a recipe for hash, not honest roast beef.<br/><br/>Burton's directorial aim seems clearly to rob Sweeney of almost every ounce of its considerable humor. He fails, and there's enough left to cause us to go into deep mourning for the rest. ""Hello, my name is Tim. I'm here to make sure you don't have any fun."" He seems to desire the players to be a funereal in their acting as possible.<br/><br/>As a result, a great actor like Johnny Depp is converted into somebody you'd never want to see or hear again. Depp, clearly too young for the role, is made up to look like somebody in a 1930s horror flick instead of someone who's spent nearly 2 decades in the penal sloughs of Old Australia. He plays Sweeney as if the man were loopy, which he isn't. He has a detached, dreamy delivery and never, NEVER catches fire. I suppose this approach may be considered interesting in a sort of abstract way, but mainly it's boring and tedious. Despite all the cuts, the film is only about a quarter-hour shorter than the 1982 and 2001 versions  yet it seems to drag out a lot longer. You do the math.<br/><br/>Perhaps the weakest link in the whole cast is Helena Bonham Carter, who is manifestly too young to play Mrs. Lovett. Her makeup may be intended to age her, but merely gives her a tired and haggard appearance. Lovett's first appearance should wrench the viewer's attention onto her relentlessly. Bonham Carter's first appearance gives us time to see if there are any pictures on the ceiling. The less said about ""Have a Little Priest"", probably the better. There are a few clever moments, but only in the sense of a convergence of a visual clue to the lyrics  a technique that doesn't hold up well with repetition. Bonham Carter's motherly effusions over Toby wouldn't convince a 3-month-old puppy.<br/><br/>Speaking of puppies, the staging of this dog omits the original wonderful mechanistic set in favor of a more realistic presentation of London. This can be understood, since films generally try to transcend the limitations of the stage. In this case, however, the relationship of staging with plot is too organic to be so lightly dismissed.<br/><br/>Look, guys  if you buy this you'll regret it  maybe not now, but later and for the rest of your life. (Thanks, Rick.) Try the Lansbury."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - Tim Burton's adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, a dark comedy with an ending bordering on Greek Tragedy. Tim Burton rounded up the usual suspects (Christopher Lee is absent though) and Johnny Depp is the lead as Sweeney Todd, a simple barber who once had a loving wife and daughter but they were stolen by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, wonderful as always) and Sweeney was shipped away. Years later, Sweeney wants revenge and resolves to cut as many throats as it takes to get to Judge Turpin! I have always enjoyed the stage version of this for it's dark humor and macabre style and Tim Burton was an easy choice to make as director. His noir style where black, white and grey are the primaries and color, when used pops out suit the show very well. Visually the movie is a treat.<br/><br/>Now musically the film is slightly controversial. The most controversial choice is the casting of Johnny Depp. He has the character down all well and good. Some fans might object to the fact that he isn't a bass, like Todd was written originally. I'm torn, because I love Depp and he sang well, but I know that whenever a film version of a movie is made, that generally becomes the standard version by which future stage productions are based. Depp, like Jaoquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line"" just doesn't have the lower notes. Depp is a bari-tenor. Still, he has the character down pat and sounds very good.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter will never be mistaken for a professional singer, but she does fine. There were probably reams of actresses who could have done better, but again she looks and acts the part of Mrs. Lovett very well. There isn't a bad singer in the bunch. I loved Sacha Baron Cohen's turn as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener both sounded lovely and Anthony and Johanna. Ed Sanders was adorable as Toby. Timothy Spall (the third cast member from the Harry Potter films) is great and weaselly as Beatle Bamford.<br/><br/>Some songs sound a little different from the original scoring. ""Pretty Women"" in particular because of the juxtaposition between a bass (Rickman, who sounds quite good) and a tenor (Depp), while in the original it was two basses. I loved ""Worst Pies in London"" ""A Little Priest"" ""Johanna"" ""Epiphany"" and ""By the Sea"". I was disappointed, as will be most fans of the original musical, by the sheer volume of songs left out. I and several other patrons stayed during the credits to see if ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was finally going to be played. I mean, it's only the catchiest and most iconic of all the songs in the show. All we get is a small instrumental of it at the beginning. Ridiculous. It should have been sung at the end because the film ending feels hollow without it. So much was cut for time. This is a case where a ""Director's Cut"" is most necessary. I loved what was there. I just want more.<br/><br/>Tim Burton fans will love it. Fans of the original musical will enjoy it but be disappointed by how much was cut to appease mainstream audiences.<br/><br/>B+"

","Let me preface this by saying Sweeney Todd is one of my all-time favorite Broadway shows and Sondheim my favorite composer. I am a HUGE fan of this show. (Most people will probably disagree with my complaints of this movie.) I sat through this movie with great expectations and was disappointed by a number of things, but enjoyed some aspects of this movie.<br/><br/>The good points are: the costumes and sets are incredible. With the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, I thought the rest of the casting was excellent. (I personally don't like HBC and her singing was so bad that I barely could get thru her songs without groaning or laughing at how bad she was singing.) Sondheim is hard enough for trained singers to perform, but relatively untrained singers like HBC have zero chance of making it work. Johnny Depp's singing was slightly better and not nearly as horribly distracting as HBC. Brilliant performances by Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Jayne Wisener, Sacha Baron Cohen (surprisingly!), Jamie Campbell Bower and Ed Sanders. Huzzah for getting that supporting cast! <br/><br/>The bad points: poor direction by Tim Burton! After Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton's directing has gone straight down the tubes and with Sweeney Todd, he really has hit the bottom of the barrel. The production was ""Burton"" stylized (been there, done that...OVER IT) and the acting always ends up taking a back seat to Burton's over-stylization. I really feel that there was little empathy in the character of Sweeney Todd. Not really Johnny Depp's fault if the director doesn't allow the character to develop properly. By the end, you're not sure if you should love or hate Sweeney Todd. Particularly when he realizes that he's killed his wife, you should feel something. I mostly felt disinterested. The movie ends up being about Tim Burton's ""creativity with darkness"" and less about the emotional baggage that all of these characters have and how they deal with it. I always feel that Burton doesn't think the acting is very important. Another disappointment was the cutting of so many great songs. I get why it was done, but I really miss hearing the entire score. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a fairly enjoyable movie, but not the next thing since sliced bread that people have been raving over. I'm glad I saw it, but I won't be purchasing the DVD and probably won't feel the need to see it again."
"Interrupted_Again","4","18","35","18 February 2008"," Very Disappointing
","Contrary to all the enthusiastic reviews of this films, I have to strongly disagree (as would most of the people I know who have seen it!). OK so I assume it's fair to say that usually you can take the winning combination of Burton and Depp and be guaranteed a hit. I had expected so before I gave my cash to the Odeon... but no. This film was a vast disappointment and I left feeling quite angry. The problem? The ""singing"". Are there any clearly defined songs? Few. Memorable ones? None. It's almost like a 3 year old's tapped something out on a xylophone and then Dad's written lyrics to be spoken randomly over the top in a hurry because he wants to watch the game. It feels pointless, tedious, unskilled and just plain never ending! This is the first time for a long time that all three of us in the cinema were sitting there tapping our feet and sighing as the soundtrack would not give us a break through the entire nightmare. Looks were exchanged after about 3/4 hour that clearly said, ""Let's go and find some food instead? I can't believe we just paid for this!"" Then a small smattering of actual dialogue and you can exhale and smile and all's OK, until thirty seconds later you're back smacking your head against the chair in front as Todd's wailing about his blades and holding them aloft again. We are not with you on this one mate...<br/><br/>This said, it does not denote the quality of the visuals, production or cast itself. The trouble is is weighs heavily over it. Visually this is Tim Burton at his best, the world created is stunning and pleasurable and certainly does not disappoint. The casting is fine, getting a little tedious perhaps but perfectly acceptable and enjoyable. The acting is unquestionably good and the effort put in to the musical side of it is also clearly given on their part. The ending was not good (no spoiler) and not even vaguely accurate to what the story is 'believed' to be, which in a way was a shame because it would have improved the conclusion vastly!<br/><br/>BUT (and this would be by summary sentence on this film) this should NOT have been turned into a pseudo-musical. If Mr Burton had stuck with what he had known it may not have been so err... Oscar-worthy in pretension terms but it would have been thoroughly enjoyable and i'd now be giving it an 8/10. A real shame."
"cobbler88","1","29","63","23 December 2007"," Incredibly unremarkable
","I've seen the overwhelming number of glowing reviews of this film, and what they tell me is that people who are fans of musicals, Johnny Depp or Tim Burton will gush about ANY of their efforts that actually make it to the big screen. The songs were okay, but this movie suffers from the fatal flaw commonly found in movie musicals, in that the songs are just padding for a story that would otherwise take about 12 minutes to tell. Come to think of it, that is a flaw shared almost universally by films directed by Tim Burton, who has been exposed since his early breakthrough efforts as a director who is clearly more comfortable with style than any sort of story structure. A couple of actors were brought in for a bit more singing talent, but none of the songs really required much in the way of pipes. Burton is well-suited in his typical role as a decent director (as long as the film in shot in blue-and-white) who makes bad movies. Depp again sacrifices doing watchable fare in favor of being what he apparently considers an ""artist,"" and Bonham-Carter does the yawn-through she usually does in roles donated to her by whoever her latest fling is. And as is also typical, a cast filled with actors many of us really like gives us a pedestrian effort, apparently believing that our affection for them is enough to keep us blindly attending sub-par fare. There's really just nothing to recommend about this flick, and if it's at the top of your list of movies to see, you'd really be best-served going with your No. 2."
"C22Man","8","2","2","8 February 2014"," Brilliant dark musical from Burton & Depp
","Tim Burton recovered from something of an iffy spell in style with an adaptation of the musical of the same name. Before seeing the film the stylistic choices were rather unusual. Johnny Depp as the haunted Cockney barber, half of the dialogue being sung and using Burton's usual gloomy visuals all seemed strange choices. As a non-musical fan I was also worried that the film might be a bit over-bearing on that front. Thankfully all my worries were dissolved from the beginning as Burton crafts possibly his most satisfying film to date, certainly since his earlier work, thanks to a great number of inspiring features.<br/><br/>The plot sees barber Sweeney Todd return to London after being exiled for a crime he did not commit with intentions of gaining revenge on the Judge who wronged him. Todd sets up his barbers above Mrs. Lovett's pie shop and he begins killing off unsuspecting customers for her to put into pies. After he discovers that the Judge also has custody of his daughter, Todd will stop at nothing to get the Judge into his chair. The story is a really interesting one dealing with themes like revenge and moral corruption in a gripping way. I like how the film flowed well and moved along at a decent pace, but still took the time to develop the characters and let you know the reasons behind their actions. It was extremely engaging because it really made me care about Todd's plight and I was interested in where the story was going to go.<br/><br/>But what about the main piece itself which is the music. I'll go out and say that all the music in the film is absolutely fantastic. There was not one bit of music that I didn't thoroughly enjoy and amazing all of these songs fit into the film perfectly. From the bouncy 'By the Sea' to the beautiful 'Johanna' to the serene 'Pretty Women' to the raw aggression of 'Epiphany', all of these songs where wonderfully composed and the different tones mesh well together in the grand scheme of things. The singing was also really impressive. Johnny Depp hasn't the best voice but for the pure emotion he puts into the songs it is impossible to fault him, while the distinct voices of Rickman and Bonham Carter fit really well.<br/><br/>The acting is also superb, especially when you consider all the things the actors have to do. Johnny Depp does a splendid job of conveying the restrained rage and sadness that encapsulates Todd. Depp's understated turn gives the role added powerful and tinges of emotion that fit very well. He also does a rather good Cockney accent and, as said, his singing voice is quite impressive. Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as usual as the opportunist Mrs. Lovett. It's a role that would be easy to dislike, but Bonham Carter adds such a down to earth tone and seemingly caring outlook that it always keeps your sympathy. Alan Rickman is simply a joy to watch as the crooked Judge perfectly showing off his seedy nature and Timothy Spall is wonderful as the horribly slimy Beadle, both creating unpleasant villains. Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener were effective, while young Ed Sanders does a great job as Toby and his singing is also rather good. Sasha Baron Cohen is also very convincing in a more serious role.<br/><br/>The visuals truly are striking. Burton brings his melancholy palette wonderfully to the film, giving London a twisted beauty. The shady colours worked really well in creating a contrast to all the blood that the film lays out. Even the flashback scenes and those imaginary ones are beautifully lit which also corresponds the misery of their lives very well. Adding to the look all the other visual aspects are perfectly done. The costumes look very authentic and capture the period well. The make-up is fantastic, especially on Depp. The sets are also superbly designed which gives the film a much more intimate atmosphere than you'd expect. There is just something about the cinematography that really makes the film leap out at you.<br/><br/>The gory parts are rather gruesome, but I don't think the film would have as much impact if they were toned down and it does have an important part to play in telling this story. There is no backing down on that front and at times it does become enjoyably over-the-top without becoming silly. The more humour moments are well placed. There is some really good understated humour especially from Bonham Carter that fits well and Ed Sanders gets a few funny lines as well. The contest between Todd and Pirelli is a lot of fun, while the 'By the Sea' dream sequence is very amusing simply for how cheerful it is against everything else. For me the ending was quite surprising just for how it didn't fall into the usual formula and gave a satisfying but oddly bittersweet conclusion to everything.<br/><br/>Overall I really love Sweeney Todd. It is amazing just how good these songs are, the way they're all composed, sung and fit into the film really is something to be impressed by, I mean they're so good that you can happily listen to them separately. Johnny Depp delivers a powerful lead turn as well as some excellent singing, the rest of the cast are simply brilliant and the visuals are really stunning to behold. The film is effortlessly entertaining, the story on its own makes for a really strong set-up to events. Sweeney Todd certainly had me gripped throughout and showed that when Burton & Depp are on top from then they are very hard to beat."

And the best thing about the movie is the musical parts.

I thought it was Johnny but then I heard him sing and went ""Nah it can't be him, this is just some Broadway performer."" That's just how perfect he is for this role. <br/><br/>Out of all the Mrs. Lovetts played by Patti Lupone to Angela Lansbury, Helena Bonham Carter is one of the best!

"Gravekeepre39","5","2","2","17 December 2011"," Skip the shave
","Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd adaptation is an interesting production to look at in terms of really delving into the intricacies and borders of where musicals and spectacles begin. The film is a grand production with a lot of flair but almost surprisingly the musical numbers seem just stylistically out of place in a way. Johnny Depp is a talented actor but I get the feeling that his musical skills were not up to par or that they were merely directed wrong in creating this character. Instead of really feeling like a musical this kind of feels like a pretentious piece of theatre.<br/><br/>Depp's Sweeney Todd is a boring character pure and simple. He is very static and is fixed with some really self destructive point of view the entire film. When I see any piece of dramatic narrative I want some sort of character arch and he doesn't really have one. How does this effect his singing? Well it seems that no song has weight over the other. Depp has pretty much thrown all his cards out there. We know he is insane and we know he is homicidal but these are only as good as the reason why. Why does being insane and homicidal propel you into a song at one point and not another? I think Depp is playing a caricature and a lousy one at best. I think what this film needs is a Sweeney Todd who goes on a descent into greater madness and is not foaming at the mouth like Depp is. Unfortunately, I have to think that this production is all about iconography and this might have been what hurt Depp's performance. That is what it seems to be. <br/><br/>Depp has always been an actor that comes up with odd voices for his characters. This Sweeney Todd character has a kind of inorganic gruffer version of Depp's voice and so that already gives a negative attribute against his singing. A choice that generally is a problem with the film is that the scale of the singing is muted and drawn back to a point where it is almost nothing more than speaking rhythmically. So, Depp just sounds like he is reciting a beat poem to music for most of his numbers. This is particularly noticeable and very disappointing in the numbers 'No Place Like London' and 'My Friends' which are supposed to be grand numbers of the show and deep insights into the character. Couple this with the fact that Depp is playing a character who pretty much only statically sings about how much he wants to slice throats and we have a problem, a very boring one dimensional musical. The music just doesn't have the weight one hopes to expect from such a storied production and an actor of the caliber of Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>We get a kind of boring and really pretentious musical because since the singing and acting are off most of the film is about set design and flair. When we get a bad performance from our lead Depp at the forefront of this it just makes the entire experience awkward and almost needless."

","One of my all time favourite films! Tim Burton at his best. A true piece of artwork. Stunning visuals, an entertaining and painfully tragic plot, musical brilliance by Steven Sonheim and extraordinary performances from the entire cast!<br/><br/>Tim Burton has always made visually stunning films, but with this one, he's really outdone himself. What I love about his films is that he never tries to please Hollywood with his movies like a lot of other directors do. <br/><br/>The film, set in the mid 1800's of dark and depressing London, leads us through the eyes of the tragically corrupted Benjamen Barker. Torn away from his beautiful wife and baby girl for crime he did not commit by the malicious Judge Turpin, is sent away, and after 15 years in exile, he escaped with the help of a young and naive sailor 'Antony', hell bent on revenge against Turpin. When he is reunited with his old neighbour, the comical yet delicate Mrs Lovett, a baker who use cats as the meat for her infamous pies, the two come up with a maliciously sinister plan, leading to many consequences...<br/><br/>A tragically sad twist at the ending, which made the dark story all the more sinister. Sad movie, but with some black comedy elements, especially in the famous song 'Little Priest'.<br/><br/>Spectacular performance from everyone, but particularly out two leading characters; Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp)and Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs. Lovett). Johnny played Sweeney Todd to perfection, making him sinisterly dark, but although he's playing a bad guy, he makes you feel very sympathetic towards him, brilliant. In my opinion, he should of won the Oscar for best actor that year at the Oscars. It came as a surprise to me that Helena wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for this amazing portrayal. Playing a gentler, subtler Mrs Lovett, one of the best portrayals of this character I've ever seen! The unrequited love story between Mrs.Lovett and Sweeney was so heartbreaking to watch, even more heart breaking than the plot itself at times, I thought Helena played it beautifully! Also with the help from a fantastic supporting cast; Alan Rickman (Judge Turpin), Timothy Spall (The Beadle), Ed Sanders (Toby), Jamie Campbell Bower (Antony) and Jane Winser (Johanna).<br/><br/>Stunning set designs, and surprisingly fantastic vocals from the entire cast, also something that doesn't get mentioned a lot, is the interestingly designed costumes, bravo to Coleen Atwood! And of course the breath taking directing by genius Tim Burton, a film that will have you on the edge of your seat, but at times watching it through your fingers!<br/><br/>Highly recommended! Musical Horror at it's best!"

","Although this is a Stephen Sondheim musical, the film adaptation is truly a Tim Burton work of art. Sondheim provided wonderful material to work with and Burton took his twisted, perverse sense of style and bravado to create a lasting impression on the senses that is sure to be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>Even more impressive is the fact that the entire crew sings its own parts. This makes Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's roles all the more astonishing, especially since neither of them had sung professionally prior to this. But natural talent they have and their on- screen chemistry is as good as need be; they are the perfect oddly admirable yet terribly creepy couple. <br/><br/>Still, it is Burton who leaves the biggest impression on this film; his use of blood alone is worth your time. The sets are gorgeously bleak and dank, the costumes almost reek of decay and dirt, and the camera swoops to and fro as we witness a man completely consumed with revenge so as to blind him from everything the world still offers. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but people should realize this is pure fictional fantasy and great entertainment as well. The blood flows freely, almost aesthetically, symbolizing the release of Sweeney Todd's pent-up anger and disgust with humanity. Tim Burton's visual style was never more perfect for material than this; the result is nothing less than remarkable."
"deacon_blues-3","9","11","20","8 January 2008"," Yo! Fans of the Broadway Production! Get over it! Chill! Join the throng!
","I am really disappointed by many of the comments by those who are devoted fans of the original Broadway production. Many of them seem to have lost all their aesthetic sense to a blind and cherished devotion to what they hold in their minds as the holy icon of the Sondheim/Wheeler version of the story. Some of the most atrocious opinions have been leveled against this film version, pig-headedly refusing to recognize the effort for what it is: simply the latest permutation of a classic urban legend that has gone through numerous and varied revisions since it first became a popular tale in the first half of the 19th Century. This is undeniably an unapologetically personal vision of the tale, as seen through the eyes of Tim Burton; and what else would you expect? In accord with this fact, it has been rightly recognized widely, across all demographic categories, as the monumental artistic achievement that it is. <br/><br/>Some of you complain about the singing. I am a musician and a singer, and can find nothing wrong with the technical abilities of any of the cast members. The intonations and phrasing of even some very difficult lines are all there and full of dramatic effect for any who aren't merely blinded by their hurt feelings of violated expectations. Just because Depp is a tenor instead of baritone or bass doesn't mean he can't sing. Broadway has a long history of making dramatic use of all styles of voices, from Ethel Merman to Nathan Lane; surely Depp's vocal styling is in no wise beneath any of those. In fact, he very much reminds me of Tony Newly in many ways. The rest of the cast are what they are, they all cover their parts with more than adequate technique to highly original and dramatically expressive effect.<br/><br/>Others complain about the brevity. I have it on good authority that many selections will be included on the DVD edition of the film for those who miss their favorite numbers. But regardless of this, the fact is that the theatrical version of this film works in telling the story to it's full effect. You must remember that Christopher Bond was the first to give Sweeney a motive other than pure greed for money, and this is likewise the main thrust of the Wheeler adaptation for the musical. This film version poignantly communicates this motivation to full effect, without many of the darling scenes that were cut out. So what's the problem? Hearn/Lansbury, as many of you point out, is now on DVD. If you want to hear all the selections, buy it! Or wait to see what is included in the DVD version of this film. But the fact remains that this version works to great effect, regardless of what was cut.<br/><br/>Others, rather inexplicably, I think, complain about the darkness and the lack of humor. Hello! We're talking about the story of a madman who killed people in his barber shop and then had his lover make pies out of their remains to sell for the general public's consumption, for crying out loud! If that doesn't give a filmmaker license to be as dark as he likes, I don't know what does! As far as the humor goes, I personally laughed throughout at the superb dark comedy and irony in almost every scene of this film. The timing of the humor was impeccable, as one would expect from a master of the genre such as Burton.<br/><br/>In summary: Get over it, people! This is not your father's Sweeney Todd! Nor should it be."

","Speaking as an avid fan of the show and all of the major players involved with movie, this is the greatest musical adaptation. Period. It's faithful to the original work, only making cuts and trims where it's necessary, and captures the essence of the show and the many dynamics and layers that go with it. This show is no picnic. They don't call it the most difficult musical ever for no reason. To pull off a movie adaptation of this show even remotely well can be considered an accomplishment. To equal, and in some ways surpass, the greatness of the original work is unheard of, and it happens with Burton's Sweeney Todd. I can't sing this movie's praises enough (pun half intended). Fans of the Broadway show will be happy, fans of Burton will be happy, fans of Depp will be happy, fans of Carter will be happy, even fans of Sascha Baron Cohen will be happy. Burton somehow pulled it all off, with the help of a stellar cast and Oscar caliber technical staff. <br/><br/>No, I'm not exaggerating in this review. The only excuse you have for not seeing this movie is if you're super squeamish about blood (even then the blood is pretty artistic and over the top, but not too much so) or you simply don't like dark material...and let me just say that you'd be hard pressed to find darker subject matter.<br/><br/>A little NOTE to FANS OF THE SHOW: The first time you see this, don't be surprised if it flies by really fast. This happened to me, and I realized that it was probably because I wasn't used to a lot of the songs being trimmed and such. The second time I saw the pace felt MUCH slower and more coherent."
"djvale","4","14","27","29 January 2008"," Do you like cheese with your crackers?
","One could honestly say, that Tim Burton is a legend in film making. His dark approach to films, that gets you under your skin and doesn't hold back. Quite often he's attempted to try his hand at other things, such as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"", which do the trick, if your a goth. Unfortunately, even the best have their off days, and this shows why you should stick to what you know, rather than be a jack of all trades.<br/><br/>With Johnny Depp playing really vital roles in the majority of Burton's films such as ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", Burton continue's his tradition of plonking the main role for Depp as Benjamin Barker. Judge Turpin (played by Mr. Bad himself, Alan Rickman) deports Benjamin Barker for a crime he did not commit, leaving Turpin to Barkers wife and daughter for the taking! With his wife dead, Barker returns to London to find salvation and seek revenge on the Judge.<br/><br/>With this, the story itself is brilliantly portrayed, Burton sprinkles his dark, moody, bloody self all over it. And thats brilliant.<br/><br/>What kills the whole film for me, and I didn't realise this upon entering the cinema screen, was the fact it was originally based on a Broadway musical. Way to go Burton! You've just made me pay £7.50 for what can only be described as your brilliant dark and dirty mind (which is what I love about Burton) ruined with the Broadway cheese wiped all over a pretty decent excuse for a film! From start to finish, you get cheese, cheese and more cheese. Actors who wouldn't really sing, trying to sing with dodgy cockney accents. Its been tried and tested before, and it didn't work. Oh, and abit of over the top blood for the sake of blood.<br/><br/>The only salvation in this film, is the fact that the supporting cast do really well to pull the film back on track. Sacha Boren Cohen shows how much of a multi talent he is as the mischeivous Pirelli, Timothy Spall also, shows how much of a talented actor he is, by being the dogs body for Judge Turpin, but it just doesn't hide the fact, that these actors should not be in a god damn musical. Even Depp, who I do hold high in esteem for his acting, can't face the music for this poor excuse of a role. At points, he even seems like he doesn't care. Like a bad Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>To be honest, people who are voting this film extremely high 8, 9 or 10's, should be ashamed of themselves. This isn't Pirates folks, its Tim Burton picking at genre's he shouldn't be touching.<br/><br/>If you do like musicals, you will love this, and you will love it even more because Johnny Depp is in it, and you obviously like Andrew Lloyd-Webber. If you don;t like musicals, simply avoid this movie, you won't like it going in, and you won't like it coming out. Even if you TRY and cover up the fact its a musical, it still won't work. Even with Tim Burton and Depp behind the wheel."

","Having never been a huge fan of Tim Burton's past works with the exception of ED WOOD and BIG FISH. I have usually found his work empty of what makes a film interesting for me. They are always full of style but totally void of anything resembling substance. Needless to say I was very skeptical of his taking SWEENEY TODD to the big screen.Glad to say how wrong I was. The film is stupendous from every department. Production Design,Costume Design, Cinematography, all hitting their marks with horrific beauty. As for the people claiming that the singing voices were weak, they have no clue as to the concept of the brilliant Lyrics and Music of Stephan Sondheim.The score was always meant to be Spoken/sung adding to the darkness of the story.Any other way it would have been down right silly. As for Johnny Depp, never has he been better. For an actor to take a role of a serial killer and manage to have the audience understand and feel his pain is to be admired. His spirit has so been destroyed,his revenge seems justified.There is however one last final betrayal that makes what has preceded even the more tragic. A truly great achievement for all."
"richard_sleboe","3","9","16","25 February 2008"," Back into the box
","The best thing you can say about this movie is that it doesn't try to give us a happy ending, a rare exception in big-budget Hollywood. But while ""Mars Attacks!"" was an undisputed masterpiece and ""Sleepy Hollow"" had its moments, ""Sweeney Todd"", like most other Burton pictures, lacks the wit to offset its essential triviality. For starters, I don't see why we should care about any of the lifeless characters. What the movie lacks in character development and storyline, it overdoes in production design. The blood is thicker, the night is darker, and everyone's eyes are wider than anywhere else. The pointlessly showy, physically impossible opening shot almost tops last year's CGI fest ""Beowulf"". Last not least, London is at its filthiest, dirtier yet than in the Hughes' brothers' ""From Hell"" and the Wachowskis' ""V for Vendetta"". But it's a special kind of Technicolor, candy-sweet chocolate factory filth that leaves you burping, yet strangely unsatisfied. The visual overkill, although duly rewarded with an Academy Award for art direction, makes you feel like you've had one too many of Mrs. Lovett's greasy pies. All principal actors are reprising roles they have played dozens of times before. Alan Rickman has long had his hairdressing moment when he was up against Bill Nighy in the British Hairdressing Championship (""Blow Dry""). The rest of the ""Sweeney Todd"" cast is unremarkable at best, except of course for a hilarious appearance by Sascha Baron Cohen in the part of Adolfo Pirelli, the fake Figaro."

","When I first heard that a new Tim Burton film was in the makings my ears perked. Doubly so because Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp would be starring in it, which had proved to be a winning threesome in the past. Then I heard the theme of the film would be just as grim as The Corpse Bride and my heart fluttered (for I love that one too). So, expectancies were high. Very high.<br/><br/>The film then. The story is the one of revenge. A guy named Benjamin Barker is wrongfully accused and sent to exile. When he returns he wants his revenge on the ones that did this to him. Returning to his home town as Sweeney Todd he starts planning, taking up residence with a pastry maker. And from there it rolls.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is dark. Grim colored scenes depicting a dark time to live in, and doing that well. Characters are picked with great care and played by actors that do it well. And, to make the grimness at the same time more and less intense, dark and twisted humor is added for good laughter, and most dialog is sung to add a sense of merriness. The totaling sum of all this is a rather morbid film that will bring a smile or a hearty laugh to anyone with a wicked sense of humor.<br/><br/>Not that the film only works for those with that sense of humor. The settings are so wonderfully worked out that it is just a pleasure to watch the scenes as they pass by - everything adds together and just works, no gaps, no jumps. Just a work of art.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 chins shaved"
"wforstchen","10","11","21","22 December 2007"," Exceeds the famed Broadway Production
","I've been a fan of Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd,"" for over twenty five years. Have seen it on stage, and treasure the 1982 video recording starring George Hearn & Angela Landsbury, along with the more recent ""concert version,"" also starring Hearn in a revival of his famed role, I've always thought him superior to Cariou's performance. (And true devotees, avoid the current Broadway touring version, it is minimalist, just viewing several clips turned me away from it.) But on to the movie. I approached this movie with mixed emotions. I mean how many times has a favorite musical, in this case what could better be defined as an opera, have a successful transition to film. Darn few have made it. Could an ""opera"" even connect, especially with a younger audience. Yes and ""I'm full of joy."" I've always admired all three primary components involved in this production, Burton, Depp, Carter. . . little did I fully realize the range of their talent until the opening scenes, the dark, frightful settings of Victorian London (one anachronism. . Tower Bridge did not exist at the time the story is set, sorry professional historian here). Carter's passionate voice gave a different feel for Mrs. Lovett, and Depp's every movement conveyed a sense of a coiled serpent about to strike.<br/><br/>I found inwardly I was almost like a judge at an event, ready to hold up a score card, how did each scene, each song match up to the Broadway production. (And I promised my daughter I would not sing along with the movie, though I did slip a few times with my favorites such as ""these are my friends."") There is a certain maniacal madness with George Hearn's rendition of ""These are my friends"" and ""Epiphany"" that I think are hard to ever match, but maybe it is like trying to compare a Dali to a Picasso, or whatever, both carry a power in a different way. In short, I was not once disappointed, and often found myself cheering on something far better than expected, especially the magnificent Perilli contest and the ""More Meat Pies."" (oh those close ups of the juice running out. . .you can tell they had fun making it.) And speaking of juices running out. OK, gory as all hell. I took my teenage daughter with some trepidation, she has seen the stage version and is a fan as well. I think I was more shocked then her with that first massive blood letting with Perilli. . .and the ""ride down the slide"" that has a certain resounding thump at the end that definitely shocked the first time.<br/><br/>So, if you are a fan of the Broadway productions, do not hesitate to go, you will be awed for behind both is the genius of Sondheim, and the different methods, stage versus film, actually compliment each other, art in two different forms and neither detracts from the other or makes you wish something had been done different. If you've never seen the stage production, do so, just avoid the current Broadway touring production.<br/><br/>After a great evening at the theater I waited until my daughter went to bed, figured she was asleep and then stood outside her door, calling her name, in the same way Sweeney and Lovett call out Tobie's name while hunting him. . .there was a moment of silence and then the reply from the other side of the door, ""father, how about a shave."""

","Here we have another dark Tim Burton film. After seeing several of his previous works, you can almost always expect violence and a grim tale. There is quite a bit of blood and gore in the film, so don't let the idea of a musical deter you. However, the acting and diologue are rock solid. The cast of this movie is magical. Of course Johnny, need I say more. Helena Carter, most famously known from Fight Club, also is an amazing supporting role. The story is a beautiful tale of revenge and love, which will keep you on the edge of your seat. If I would have to compare this film to previous Tim Burton films, I would say a mix of Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.

","I should love this movie. I've enjoyed almost all Tim Burton films I've ever seen, and this is really more of the same, right? But... It's so insipid. Maybe I'M the one getting boring, maybe Tim Burton is losing it, who knows. Fact of the matter is that this movies made one thing painfully clear to me. Tim Burton is a director of edgeless mainstream movies if I ever saw one. Sure, there's blood, and people with black hair, and sort of crooked set designs, but it's concocted to fit a perfect formula, just like any blockbuster studio movie, and it doesn't seem to have the slightest intention of ever challenging that formula. No hint of anything truly disturbing, truly gritty, truly weird, or truly anything at all. Just a perfectly slick, formulaic, safe movie for a safe audience.<br/><br/>I enjoy mainstream movies a lot, all they have to do is pretend to have substance and edge, and I'm willing to forgive so many flaws. But I don't think Burton ever considered challenging himself. Which to my mind makes him a very boring artist. I'm sure he's a very free spirited film maker, who makes his movies just the way he likes them, and how lovely and genuine of him that is. I'm sure Michael Bay makes movies just the way he likes them too. Doesn't make it interesting."
"filmfan92","9","6","10","21 December 2007"," Attend the tale
","Every pitfall this film could have fallen in-and were there ever plenty of pitfalls readily awaiting Tim Burton and his devoted cast and crew-it skillfully avoids. It's tragedy about the titular barber (Johnny Depp), who teams up with a local baker (Helena Bonham Carter) to seek vengeance on a malicious judge (Alan Rickman). It's also a musical, and make no bones about it; everyone sings. I would venture to say that over 3/4 of the story is told in song. But if all you Broadway-haters can get past the singing, you'll find a brilliantly crafted movie with heart and wit to spare. The performers are all spot on; Depp and Bonham Carter both give their characters a complete makeover (vocals included), and it works superbly. Rickman tucks into a role only he could play. And the assorted newcomers in supporting roles will be the bigshots of tomorrow-especially the gifted Jamie Campbell Bower. Production design and editing are top-notch, too. Oh, and for the slasher fans; wait patiently; the stuff doesn't really start spraying until the corpse-tastic finale, and boy, does it spray.

","Simply put, in 4 words : Don't watch this movie.<br/><br/>I can see why all the 12 year old girls are raving about this. They always want what they can't have, which was a clever trick on the producer's part, I'll give them that. Making the film an 18 really did boost sales. If it wasn't for Johnny Depp's appearance in this film, I may have been inclined to give it another star. If you ask me, Tim Burton is far too over-rated. I feel that I should tell all potential watchers not to waste their money, and go see a better film out in the cinemas right now, such as Cloverfield or In The Valley of Elah, the one thing that makes modern cinema worth being given the title ""modern cinema"" is innovation, and/or allowing the audience to reminisce, and this was a terrible mix of the two. The use of the star system to market this movie, Burton's ""If I build it, they will come"" approach appalls me, the fact that people will pay just as much to see a sold-out Johnny Depp as they would to buy a DVD from a bargain bin is beyond me. I'd much rather watch a $5 copy of an old early classic, than waste the same amount of my lifetime on this pile of nothing. I would call it something more obscene, but that would imply it meant something to me, which it did not. If you're looking for a good adaptation of Sweeney Todd, try the 2007 version which was a straight to DVD feature made almost completely independently. Or just see the play. This movie makes a mockery of the original writer, and if I were Thomas Peckett Prest, I would be spinning in my grave."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","9","17","4 April 2008"," Is This Music & Mayhem Pic As Bizarre As They Say? Yup!
","If you haven't seen this film and are expecting something bizarre from the collaboration director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp.....well, you're going to get it! This is different......mainly because most of the dialog is sung, like an opera. However, at least half of that is half spoken-half sung so it isn't really operatic. Burton displays his usual dark visions and wonderful cinematography and Depp plays his normal strange, dark character. I can't say that all the singing appealed to me, but the actors did a credible job with it. In fact, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and company surprised me how well they all sang considering they aren't known for that talent.<br/><br/>One other major warning: some of the bloody scenes are pretty graphic. There will be a number of people who will turn their heads at a few scenes. That doesn't start for awhile, however, as the first third of film sets up the premise.<br/><br/>What I found most appealing was the comedy. The wildest character was ""Signor Adolfo Pirelli,"" a guy pretending to be a famous Italian barber and played - incredibly - by Sacha Baron Cohen....yes, ""Borat,"" himself! I only wish his role had been a little bigger. The other guy who made me laugh was Timothy Spall as ""Beadle Bamford."" He was so bad, he was good! Some of the lyrics in the songs also were humorous. All the comedy is a mixture of dark and light stuff.<br/><br/>It seems like most of the scenes in this film were either very dark and foreboding or filled with outrageous dark humor. There wasn't much middle ground. I suspect you'll either stick with the film and enjoy it or be tempted to toss it in the garbage can before it's over. Either way, you'll have a definite opinion of this movie!"
"j_kurzyn","10","9","17","22 December 2007"," This is a strong recommendation.
","Wow!!<br/><br/>What I think is most amazing about this movie is that it successfully uses all sorts of great contemporary artistic minds to produce one fine product. You have a commercial celebrity directed by an off-beat, visual genius, singing one of the greatest scores off all times. I love how the fluffy pop-culture types will be exposed to Stephen Sondheim and I love how the stuffy snobs will notice how fantastic Johnny Depp is. I think that's why Tim Burton made such a fine director: he was the most appropriate bridge between these two worlds as he himself straddles both the avant-garde and commercial worlds. Accessibility.<br/><br/>Before starting on my review, I believe one needs to have an open mind and appreciation for (or better yet understanding of) musical theatre, melodrama, and old film noir/horror films and actors. This movie does not cater to the brutish. I don't mean this to sound elitist but the level of art going on here (visual, acting, music) is significant and requires participation by the audience. If you're passive you won't enjoy it.<br/><br/>I won't bore with a synopsis as everyone knows it already so I'll focus on a few points:<br/><br/>I will say that Depp makes the Sondheim anti-hero his own and provides a stellar, introverted interpretation that really delves into the emotional complexity of the character. His performance helps to articulate the kind of severe tragedy this ""penny dreadful"" is all about. He is truly a chameleon. A pillar to which all commercial, Hollywood actors should rise: a STRONG character actor who takes risk and has broad appeal.<br/><br/>The other performers were great if not all obvious casting choices. Remember, this is a film interpretation of the stage musical not a filmed version of the musical. The fact that Sondheim blessed every decision of this put all of my worries to ease.<br/><br/>The opening credit sequence underscored by ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was excellent even if it was overly digitized. I thought this framed the film well and provided an appropriate prologue. You knew exactly what the film was about before the first words were uttered. It also shows how cinematic Sondheim's music can be. Many people believe that Sondheim's music is ""married"" to his lyrics and that they can't be separated. While I believe the former, this proves the later false and amazingly so!!!<br/><br/>I thought that Burton did an excellent job in directing the film. He is truly one of the finest American directors. He made this play his own. This wasn't arbitrary. I love BURTON!!<br/><br/>I thought screenwriter John Logan did an AMAZING job in condensing the source material. Even with the song cuts (as above), he allows the functions of these songs to be expressed in other ways so the story and motivation is clear.<br/><br/>I was so surprised and impressed by this movie. I was initially hesitant given the cast and Depp's pop voice but this movie was absolutely phenomenal! This film accomplished a lot and proved to be an excellent collaboration of great artistic minds specifically Burton, Sondheim, Depp and Logan.<br/><br/>Honestly, please see this film. It will thrill you!"

","This is a musical for the insane. Not for the funny crazy ones but the truly psychotic madmen you never want to meet in your personal life. Tim Burton definitely has lost it. I was deeply disappointed by how low the maker of brilliant films like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood has sunk.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I write this review because I am enraged about the careless morals of the film. There are parts in this movie where Johnny Depp cuts throats in a cascade for several minutes and kills innocent people just because he is in a bad state of mind. A great number of bodies drop on the floor of the cellar and you see their heads crack open and the blood splashes all over the place in different ways. All over again. Just to see how cool it looks.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not against graphic violence in movies. Sometimes they can be powerful elements that are essential to the plot (like the killing of those two guards in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS to show us that Lecter is truly evil for example). But with Sweeney Todd (what a cuddly name, they also could have named him Humpty, Dodo or Fluffy) it's different: the gory mayhem is meant to be part of the entertainment value of the movie. <br/><br/>In connection to this they sing a lot of unmemorable songs in friendly and harmless ways as if everything was OK. Highly disturbing. And I mean not amusingly disturbing like Dennis Hopper in BLUE VELVET but disturbing in a way that forces you to shake your head and makes you think things like ""How can someone be nominated for such a role at the Oscars? If movies reflect society, in what kind of world are we living in?""<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is full of clichés and unnecessary gory violence. Johnny Depp once said in an interview that he also wants to make movies for his kids to see. SWEENEY does not fall in that category. I'd rather say that he should be ashamed of himself and one day he will be. Burton, too. If he's an intelligent man, he will realize what a turd he has produced. <br/><br/>As you can see I am totally opposed and truly don't like this film. Therefore I will spoil the ending with great pleasure to illustrate the ill nature of SWEENEY TODD:<br/><br/>Showdown at the cellar of blood: Sweeney realizes that the beggar woman - who has been slain a couple of minutes before - is his beloved ex-wife who once was separated from him by Judge Turpin (slashed too by Mr. Todd). He looks at Bonham Carter and says ""You knew it, why didn't you tell me?"" ""Because I love you and I want you to stay with me."" she answers. Sweeney tosses her into the oven and she dies under horrible screaming. After that realistic slaughter Sweeney holds his ex-wife in his arms, caresses her face softly and thinks ""Oh my, what have I done!"". Meanwhile Toby, a child who has been beaten constantly by his former employer (Mr Pirelli) sneaks up from behind. Mr. Todd raises his head, looks in the air and we all know what is going to happen: Yes, a 13-year old (or so) child cuts Sweeney Todds throat open. Ice-cold like a contract killer without a whimper. Streams of blood run down Todds body and onto the face of his ex-wife. They both die in a pool of blood. Fade out...<br/><br/>This movie is a sick joke. And studio execs will laugh their butts off. At our costs. This is Hollywood of today."

","For some time, this has been my favorite musical. Stephen Sondheim is my favorite composer, and his music is absolutely beautiful and he has pushed the boundaries of the stage often in his work. So when i heard that this was going to be a movie, at first I was excited to see it. But when i heard that the two leads were played by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, i was a little nervous. Don't get me wrong, i love Depp, and Carter is a wonderful actress, but i wasn't sure if they would be able to do justice to the music.<br/><br/>Depp plays Sweeney Todd, and even though his voice is not the traditional voice that you'll hear as Todd on stage, it was a nice surprise to hear how well he could handle the character vocally.<br/><br/>Carter was Mrs. Lovett, and although she had a surprisingly nice voice, it wasn't a Mrs. Lovett voice. She obviously acted the character well and was entertaining to watch during different songs, there was something missing. Angela Lansbury Has a Mrs. Lovett voice, being the original Mrs. Lovett. It was hard getting used to, but i think that towards the end, like in the song ""By the Sea"" it felt more like she fit.<br/><br/>The other characters fit in the story. I liked the girl who played Johanna, she was very well cast. The boy in the role of Antony may not have looked like an Antony, but he sang well and i find it sad that they cut out important scenes with him and Johanna. The songs that were cut don't affect the main plot with Sweeney, but they were important to the love story between Antony and Johanna and they are missed.<br/><br/>I don't want to seem too critical of the beggar woman because she wasn't bad, i just don't think that there was enough that she gave to make me really believe her. in the last Johanna number where she sings ""smoke! Smoke! City on Fire!..."" there's not enough there. If you want a good beggar woman example, get a copy of the 2005 Broadway cast revival CD with Patti LuPone and Michael cerveris (spelling?) and listen to that beggar woman.<br/><br/>the blood was too much. I mean, i could get used to it at first, but when he kills the beggar woman, the blood came out in a waterfall-like fashion and reminded me of a fondue fountain. I liked the theatrical approach, but it almost detracted from the main story.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and a fun but dark musical. I recommend seeing it on stage."
"MadCapTap","8","5","8","23 December 2007"," Mixed Feelings... A Bit of Critique, a Bit of Praise
","I am a die-hard fan of Sondheim's masterpiece which this film is based upon. I was positively giddy going into the theater to see this picture and I was very happy with the result. I thoroughly did enjoy this movie and will probably go back to see it many more times. However, there were certain things that somewhat belittled the overall message of the story.<br/><br/>In the opening song ""The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd"", the one lyrics ""Revenge may lead the road to hell, but everyone does it and seldom as well."" and ""He never forgot and he never forgave."" were incredibly important, however I can clearly see why the ballads were cut. They give it more of a Broadway show feeling, which the movie was trying to shake away. But when ""Never Forget. Never Forgive."" is the tag line, the lyric should be in there someplace. It's the whole point of the story, and it was sort of lost.<br/><br/>Also, while I did like the ending atmosphere while Sweeney mourned his poor Lucy in bloody silence, Sweeney was implosive the whole movie. I wish there had been some kind of contrast where he was yelling or something. Explosive anger. I mean sure, throwing a woman into an oven is definitely anger, but still... And if he had yelled at Toby or something, telling him to go away, scaring the kid, it would have made more sense for him to kill Sweeney, rather than just angrily slitting his throat (even though Ed Sanders was definitely a little bad-ass :). The contrast would have given the movie something more. Another kind of contrast that would have added so much would be the fact that Sweeney was morbid from beginning to end. Yes, it is a depressing, macabre story with few happy moments. However, the sadness would have been so much sadder if the happy moments had really been happy. Just because Sweeney was going to die in two hours doesn't mean that he needs to be depressed and angry whilst waltzing around the shop with Mrs. Lovett. If the happiness had been there, the character would have been multi-dimensional. Sure, all he focuses on is killing Judge Turpin anyway, but he would have seemed more human. Then when he died, the audience would have maybe felt a little more for him.<br/><br/>Another thing, Helena Bonham Carter's voice was this thin little wisp of a thing and she wasn't fun or funny as MRs. Lovett has always been. It was a different take on the role, which doesn't necessarily mean it was bad, but it felt like it was missing something. She wasn't as crazy in a lighthearted way, but just plain creepy. It worked, in a way, but her voice was what made it less enjoyable for me. If there was some kind of substance there in her tone, I would have enjoyed it more. But for never having done anything musical before, I give Helena mad props.<br/><br/>The blood, while somewhat overplayed (human necks are not fire-hydrants damn it), was great. I loved that the whole movie was black, white, gray, and dark green, and then the blood was this beautiful brilliant bright red. It added a real artistic edge to the film. It was a great contrast. If the cast had followed suit in that sort of contrast, it would have been one of Burton's best. However, there was too much in the very last scene. A slight trickle of blood onto Lucy's face coming from the gush of Sweeney's throat would have been beautiful and moving, but the woman was getting a damn waterfall. That was a bit much (even though I cried anyway).<br/><br/>In closing, Ed Sanders was the gem of this movie. Great voice for a kid of that age (I think he's either twelve or my age, not quite sure) and a truly wonderful performance.<br/><br/>A great movie overall, even if some aspects left a bit to be desired. Brava."
"Reef-Shark","7","5","8","22 December 2007"," Good, but not perfect adaptation of the classic musical
","Alright, I went to see the movie adaptation of 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' and thought it was amazing, but being a fan of the original Broadway stage versions I do have some complaints. The bloods levels were necessary is some parts, but some just ruined the moments. During the song 'Johanna' which is one of my favorite songs in the show, Sweeney will be slitting some throats. The thing that makes the stage version better for that song is that the blood isn't a distraction. You only see like a red line go across their throat, then down the chute they go. When the movie had blood flying everywhere in a real sort of way it was extremely hard to concentrate on the song. Another part was that they cut out some of the songs and lyrics to cut down the 3 hour musical into a 2 hour movie, another disappointment for a guy who loves the play like me. Now of course the big thing is how Depp was able to portray Sweeney and SING! Alright, shut up Depp fan-girls. He is not some sort of miracle singer. He's an alright singer, but a much better actor. His voice has menace, though pirate fans may have to hold back a snicker at the fact that when he says certain lyrics he sounds like Captain Jack Sparrow live on Broadway. I think in a movie musical he was well cast as the tormented barber who has lost everything near and dear to him, except his precious razors. Helena Bonham Carter did well as the sociopath Mrs. Lovett whose good idea is to turn Sweeney's victims into pies for her own profit. Sacha Baron Cohen who did well last year in his surprisingly critically well received 'BORAT' comes back to the big screen with a marvelous portray of the flamboyant street barber Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and I myself wouldn't have wanted to cast anyone else, the character seems like him. Finally Alan Rickman provided a truly menacing portrayal of Judge Turpin; Sweeney's nemesis and reason why he wants revenge. All and all the 1982 Broadway performance (On DVD) starring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury will always be my favorite musical version of this tale of revenge. Aside from me finding some parts a bit too violent I will give it a high rating. I give Burton's Sweeney a 10/10 instead of a 9/10 just because Sweeney Todd is my 2nd favorite musical, and the scenery, costumes, and atmosphere of the movie was brilliant."
"Venus-25","Null","5","8","21 December 2007"," A Flawed Masterpiece
","Burton's SWEENEY TODD is visually brilliant and 3-dimensional, bringing the audience right into the heart of the worst part of Victorian London. This is no place for the gentile characters of a Masterpiece Theatre production, but the sad characters of Dickens, the denizens of William Hogarth's 18th century etchings, and the criminals of any time. The darkness is claustrophobic and vast at the same time, and there is no predicting what's coming at you (if you don't know this story).<br/><br/>The casting is mostly brilliant, with Sacher Baron Cohen an interesting surprise as Pirelli. He brings the same Victorian Music Hall style to this character that's been seen in the previous stage productions. Johnny Depp's almost understated performance in the competition scene seems to bring us back to reality by comparison. Except for Cohen, the Music Hall atmosphere is completely lost in the voices as well as the staging. Helena Bonham Carter is a good enough actress for the role of Mrs Lovett, but her voice needed some more work; it's too thin. It wasn't the best match for Depp's rock-musician voice which worked surprisingly well in a role where we have been accustomed to hearing heroic baritones. I also expected a little more from Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin. His lechery is underplayed in ""Pretty Women"", although perhaps counterbalanced by the scene where he fondles his porn collection. <br/><br/>Jamie Bower's Anthony is a little younger than we are accustomed to seeing, but perhaps that was because Johanna is only supposed to be 16 years old. I had some difficulty believing that he had ""sailed the world"" yet. This role requires a little more maturity. Johanna also needs to look a little more mature; a Victorian 16-year-old would look like today's 25-year-old. These roles were also cut back a little too far, with a cut in a song that is highly significant in the stage version. This may have been done to satisfy a need for greater realism in the script, along with cutting the chorus parts.<br/><br/>Having said that, I have to wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to cut most of the other songs in half. The most egregious cut, in my opinion, was in ""A Little Priest"" where the absent stanzas and dialog breaks had supplied most of the humor of this piece. It then just becomes creepy instead of a brilliant example of gallows humor. We can hope that the forthcoming DVD will be the ""extended version"" with the full versions of most of the songs, which are Sondheim's most brilliant work to date and ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" sung over the closing credits.<br/><br/>In closing, Johnny Depp was his usual brilliant self, demonic and sympathetic at the same time and Ed Sanders' Tobias Ragg was perhaps the casting jackpot of this production, the first where we get a Toby who is an historically appropriate age to emphasize the horrors that poverty visited upon orphaned children. This kid will have an excellent career with this as a launching point."
"Alexis_Carrington","10","8","15","21 December 2007"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's Darkest And Most Satisfying Outing
","I have been a fan of Tim Burton's for years and have just recently grown to admire Johnny Depp to the point of calling myself a fan of his too (not that I did not respect him before I just never paid him a lot of attention outside of Tim's work, and seeing the trailer for this film inspired me to explore his body of work a little deeper.), and for me to claim that this is their best outing ever is hard since I am such an Edward Scissorhands fan, but alas Sweeney is a cut above that, pun most certainly intended. The story of a barber, sent to prison on false charges and returning home to seek revenge is indeed an intriguing and dark one that suits both in a way that it's a wonder they hadn't done this before.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is an enchanting piece of musical darkness that grabs you and pulls you in from the first moment until the last. Johnny Depp is as always the perfect choice and disappears into his role seamlessly. His singing voice is adequate, if not erring on the side of good, but it is more so his acting in the scenes that really conveys the emotions in the songs. What makes the movie so much more effective than a play in some ways is the way Burton can shoot the musical numbers and make them feel more personal and the actors can do more effectively in front of a camera. Johnny Depp and Tim both utilize this and it really gives the musical numbers something extra that some might feel is lacking without the powerhouse vocals.<br/><br/>I will admit to being skeptical about Ms. Bonham Carter. Even after hearing a few of her song clips I was turned off, but she plays the role in a way that is tender, sweet, looney and endearing. I found the Lovett character annoyingly chipper in the stage version though I love Lansbury's portrayal. This Lovett is darker, and more longing than the other incarnations but there is something about her you connect with even though you can see how hopeless her desire for Sweeney's love is and how sick their twisted cannibalistic way of disposing of Sweeney's corpses (almost a mating dance for the two). Bonham Carter almost makes Lovett sympathetic while proving she's diabolical in the same way. Her singing is perhaps the weakest but she makes up for it in screen presence IMO.<br/><br/>Rickman is diabolical as Judge Turpin and his singing is adequate though I think Johnny Depp's outshines his during Pretty Women (an enchanting number indeed) and Spall is delicious as the Beadle.<br/><br/>The teen characters perhaps have the best singing voices, but they have little to do and you find you care very little about them, but this is not a weakness of the movie as I cared little about them during the play as well.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is a scene stealer for certain as the barber Pirelli and his singing voice is adequate. It was very refreshing to see him in a more subdued role.<br/><br/>Edward Sanders was outstanding as Toby. His performance song wise and acting wise shows a lot of promise for a bright career in the future one can only hope.<br/><br/>And Burton's direction is amazing, the sets are stunning and the make up all help to really enhance the film's tone and add to the film's dark humor as well. One would be humorless to not giggle at certain gags especially Lovett's ""By the Sea"" fantasy sequence.<br/><br/>All in all Sweeney Todd is a complete musical adventure which will be pleasing to anyone with a wicked sense of humor and an appreciation for the uncannily beautiful. Be warned though the movie is 90% singing."

","I'm not usually a fan of musicals, but this one is great - I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.

Then add the talents of Sacha Baron Cohen, Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders instant hit.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is brilliant, the whole music track is great at setting the mood of every scene, then the actual songs are great at telling a story while relaying the characters feelings and thoughts.
The set also is good - how they depicted London as it was back in the 1840's, but maybe darkening it up for the film which really works well.<br/><br/>What I loved most of all is how they haven't just done the typical throat slitting, horror and gore fest that you think of when you hear the title, they tell the larger story, showing the betrayal of the corrupt judge and Sweeney Todd's descent into madness and the sad future that befalls his wife and child.
Then the attempted blackmail and murder of Sacha Baron Cohen that leads Sweeney Todd to his murdeous ways.<br/><br/>This all somehow makes out mass murdering Sweeney Todd to be the victim of the film, and by the end I felt sorry for the character.
Tim Burton you're a genius."

","Benjamin Barker returns to London with a hatred and vengeance in his heart that can only have come from lost love and false imprisonment. On his return he meets the crazed makers of the worst pies in London  Mrs Lovett  and a plan is hatched to use his barber show (now traded under the name Sweeney Todd) to extract revenge on those that ruined him. However as revenge evades him and his blood lust rises, his murderous rampage and his solution for getting rid of the bodies threaten to expose him or drive him to destruction  whichever comes sooner.<br/><br/>It took me some time to get to see Sweeney Todd as it hadn't appealed to me in the cinema and I kept putting off renting the DVD. Whenever I finally did get round to it recently I was quite pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked. The reason for this is that it functions perfectly as a big dark musical. The musical numbers are all strong because they are the film rather than being things that the film launches into and they fit the dark, blood tone of the film as the music is constantly brooding and, even when it soars you get the impression that any hope or beauty in the music will soon be sucked back down into the mire. You can see what attracted Burton to this and his Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this. His crew deliver a great set and costume base for him to film in and around  it feels dark and awful but yet also has the sense of unrealism that the film needs because ultimately it is a dark musical fantasy and it has no business feeling ""real"".<br/><br/>The performances match this as well because they are mostly very good ""musical"" performances, rather than dramatic performances built on small things. That said, Burton does use the camera very well to get closer to his characters and give you views (both physical lines of sight and also insights) that you would not get viewing this from the floor. Depp is impressive and he gets the ""dark quirkiness"" required  he looks the part, uses his face and body well while also delivering a great singing performance. Bonham-Carter is also good but her heavy ""cockney"" stuff is a bit distracting and did get in the way of me enjoying her in the way I did Depp. Rickman is a great central villain  although he has little time his presence does it all for him. Spall I was not so sure about  his character jarred with me and I didn't think his delivery fitted even though he was trying to do the same thing as everyone else. Cohen was a nice find and an enjoyable part of the film while Bower, Sanders and Wisener all deliver strong performances despite their ages and the cast they are starring beside. Special note to Wisener as well considering how infrequently I see people from the Coleraine/Ballymoney area of Northern Ireland show up in things.<br/><br/>Local loyalties aside though, Sweeney Todd works much better than I thought it would simply because it knows what it is and it sticks to it really well. This same approach will put off those who do not like musicals and the bloody effects may put off those who are musical fans but overall it is a Gothic musical with a rich comic vein running through it and it delivers on this."
"myrealnameisjon","9","3","4","20 January 2009"," Depp at His Darkest, Burton at His Best
","I've never seen the actual Sweeney Todd largely because I despise the great majority of musicals excluding Singing in the Rain. However, I decided to give Sweeney Todd a chance because the Burton-Depp duo is rarely set to fail. The darkness of the film is offset by the up-beat music and fast paced lyrics, but the story is actually heightened by the poetic slide from dialog to tune. I don't share the same level of reverence for Burton that others may hold because it is hard to forgive his destruction of the Batman series, but Depp's continued phenomenal presence is that of a god on film. I was impressed with his shift into character as I was of his surprisingly pleasant singing voice. In the knowledge that S. Todd is a villainous Brit, I half expected Captain Jack Sparrow to come about. Depp slapped me with the reality that he is a genius in his art. Depp reminds us that he hit the entertainment industry first as a musician, but the surprise really comes in the realization that he started as a guitarist, not a singer. Then, we have to remember that Depp is not only singing, but he is doing so in an infallible yet false accent. Johnny does not stand alone in the array of talent throughout this film. While the movie would not be the same without Depp, Helena Bonham Carter was more than a supporting role. She was pivotal. She was Mrs. Lovett more than an actress playing a part. If I had a tumor, I would name it Marla Singer; not out of spite, but as a mark of permanent notability. In essence, I found this movie appeasing. It is odd to say considering the amount of disturbing blood shed and deviant behavior throughout, but I can say that Tim Burton's adaptation of a show that I had no true interest in seeing has since become my favorite musical. It is to the point that I will not likely see this show in theater because no performance will top that of Depp and Carter. Leave the kids in the other room, sound check your equipment to make sure you don't miss a note, and enjoy rooting for villains roughing it out with villains. This film is one worth watching several times over just to make sure you absorb all details available."

"ghillie_kitten","1","12","25","9 April 2008"," Not my favorite
","I just went to see Sweeny Todd ... and I have to say that it was ... um ... well, not my favorite movie, let's put it that way. In retrospect, I was glad I saw it in the theater, because going to the theater is a whole lot less expensive than buying the movie, which, I can guarantee you, I will not. It was, though, interesting to actually hear Johnny Depp sing. I knew that he was in several bands, but I had never heard him actually sing. But, singing aside, I was not impressed with the movie. The only way I can think to describe the overall plot was The Count of Monte Cristo meets Othello, but, even though I like both, putting them together (and, in fact, taking the wost of both and exaggerating it) was, I thought, not much of a success. I was just a little weirded out by it ... and in truth I was amazed that the plot was so highly twisted - it's the story of a man who, in a search for revenge for the rape and subsequent death of his wife, ends up killing her (the wife), and very narrowly escapes from killing his daughter, and, in a final act of irony was killed with the same blade that he used to kill others. That brigs me to another sticking point I had with the movie - I also didn't care too much for the blood and gore, of which there was a lot. It would have been better if they had suggested rather than actually showed people's throats being slit. Granted, the blood had a fake quality about it, but there was so much of it. Too much, in my opinion. Also I was grossed out by the cannibalism - I mean the whole idea of meat pies just grosses me out in the first place, but making the meat people meat? Yuck! And as if the meat that she keeps in the bowl isn't bad enough, they have to ... ugh! ... and the meat grinder ... not to mention the meat coming out of it ... I think I'll become vegetarian now, thank you very much."

","In 19th century London, a town barber who goes by the name Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) is wed to a beautiful wife named Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly)and they have a lovely daughter named Johanna (Jayne Wisener). Lucy's good looks catches the eyes of crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who feels that she should be in his arms. So, he cooks up a scheme to have Barker thrown in jail for a criminal act he didn't commit. Fifteen years later, Barker is released from prison, with a new look, a new attitude and most importantly, a new identity, Sweeney Todd. His plot is to get even with the callous Turpin. Hoping to reconcile with his wife, Todd gets word from a local baker who specializes in meat pies Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) that his wife, Lucy killed herself years ago and that Turpin has custody over Johanna. In a plot for revenge, Sweeney returns to the barber business by opening a shop below Lovett's bakery and this time plotting revenge against those who enter his shop by slicing their throats and using their remains to make meat pies out of their flesh as a ploy to get to Turpin and end his madness once and for all. <br/><br/>The script adapted from the original musical by Stephen Sondheim speaks for itself. The dark, Gothic atmosphere, and the scintillating lighting is complimented by the brilliant direction by Tim Burton. Johnny Deep has never been more creepier since Edward Scissorhands and Icabod Crane. You may think that Sweeney's revenge is taken in vain, but in reality, he's hurting inside and badly too over the loss of his lover and soul-mate, Lucy. Even though I'm not a fan of murder, I thought it was very considerate that Sweeney is doing this for the love and a big piece of his life taken from him for being wrongfully accused. The supporting cast is very nuanced as each actor young or old adds great depth to their respected roles. <br/><br/>I knew going into the theaters this movie would be something special, but ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" went beyond what I expected of it. There was plenty of dark humor, lots of emotion by the characters, easy-flowing songs and every performance was a sight for sore eyes and ringing ears. If you're looking for an original movie with great depth, look no further. This movie has everything you need to keep you satisfied."
"gsygsy","5","4","6","29 January 2008"," missing ingredients
","Stephen Sondheim's stage work has not, with one significant exception, fared well when transfered to the cinema. The exception is, of course, West Side Story, for which he is credited solely as lyricist. Gypsy, his other significant lyrics-only credit, is a magnificent show which became a mystifyingly mediocre movie. Whatever cinematic virtues Richard Lester's version of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum may have, it wasn't well received. And the movie of A Little Night Music disappeared, almost without trace, in spite of the presence in the cast of Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg. As a composer-lyricist, Sondheim's most successful Hollywood outing has not occurred in an adaptation of a stage work, but as the songwriter for Warren Beatty's movie Dick Tracy, his contributions to which won him an Oscar.<br/><br/>Given the above, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is probably going to be the movie-going public's abiding view of Sondheim's oeuvre. In this respect, even with substantial cuts to the stage show's score, it serves the songs well. The original orchestrator and musical director were on hand to provide their considerable combined expertise, and in a big cinema with a state-of-the-art sound system, it's a terrific aural experience. At least as far as the instruments are concerned...<br/><br/>Vocally, it's another matter. I've heard people sneer at Johnny Depp's sound, but personally I think it's pretty good. For what Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall have to do, they get away with it, whereas Sacha Baron Cohen is splendid, as are Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, wonderfully bouncy Ed Sanders, and, in a sadly reduced role, Laura Michelle Kelly. Helena Bonham Carter is, unfortunately, little short of a disaster on this front: although she sings in time and mostly in tune, the sound is dreary and lacking energy.<br/><br/>In fact, the main weakness in the movie for me is that Mrs Lovett is played so listlessly. I can kind of see where this might have come from: the woman is worn out keeping her business going etc etc. But her songs are full of life. Tim Burton can evidently feel the exuberance in the greatest of them, The Worst Pies In London. The camera-work and the film editing are very sprightly during it. But Bonham Carter's wispy tone undermines the comedy.<br/><br/>Bonham Carter is not by any means a bad actress: her scenes with Ed Sanders are grounded and real, and she successfully conveys, in the midst of all the gore, Mrs Lovett's adoration of Sweeney Todd. But she is, essentially, and unfortunately, miscast.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the romantic couple, on stage generally too old (and mostly deadly dull), benefit here from appropriate casting, generous close-ups, and the tightening up of their story (at one point inexplicably: when Anthony Hope comes bounding in to tell Mr Todd of his discovery of Joanna, we have no sense of how Anthony knows where to find Todd, since we haven't seen them re-bond since they went their ways at the start of the movie, Todd giving Anthony only the vaguest idea of his future whereabouts). <br/><br/>Todd himself is the real centre of the movie that bears his name, which is also a welcome shift from what happens in the theatre. On stage, the sheer energy of Mrs Lovett's material works to favour her. It is no accident that while she has been successfully portrayed by a number of first-rate actresses, only journeyman George Hearn came near to making Todd his own. Johnny Depp has now stamped his indelible mark on the role. He is, as we all know, a fine actor. Although here he doesn't actually appear to have to stretch his acting muscles unduly, he is such a star presence that any film he's in will revolve effortlessly around him. The Burton/Depp partnership has given us at least two dazzlers - Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Sweeney Todd is not in that category, but an interesting lesser work. <br/><br/>In my view, the stage show is simply a piece of fun with Grand Guignol conventions. Its apparent dourness may stem from the political gloss on the Todd story in the play version by Chris Bond, which Sondheim took as his source material. Although Bond's play is anything but solemn, the sombreness of Sondheim's music undoubtedly darkened its tone, which has made mining the rich humour in it rather more difficult. The fact is that Sweeney Todd is not a work that requires much dwelling upon. Attempts to burden it with significance merely serve to show up its simple basis as an entertainment. It has been taken up by opera houses, where the fun has been duly taken out of it, and its musical limitations mercilessly exposed.<br/><br/>Tim Burton goes some way to reinstating the dark humour of the piece with his nimble camera. I can certainly see why the material would appeal to him. It's the Burtonland of Nightmare Before Christmas, The Corpse Bride, and even Mars Attacks. Whether Sondheim aficionados will be delighted, I somehow doubt. Never mind: they can always go back to the video of the stage show, which features the great Angela Lansbury in one of her showpiece roles, giving some insight into what is missing here."

Being that I am both a Johnny Depp and a Time Burton fan I was predisposed to liking it, but I have to say that this film will please even the harshest of critics. To start the cast was wonderful. Although many of them were not trained in singing (although some were) they do an amazing job with one of the toughest scores on Broadway. Their voices may not be the best out there but the flavor that they bring to an already wonderful score is wonderful. Both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter bring new life to character that have been portrayed so differently in the stage version. The art direction and costumes in this film were well worth the academy awards nominations and wins. The costumes are so beautifully done that they capture the essence of the character while still remaining true to the time period. The set and art direction bring you into a world you could never imagine. The dreary colors show the true emotion of the story and the set allows you to feel as if you are sitting there with the characters and you were part of the story If you are a fan of the Broadway musical and are looking to capture what has been portrayed on stage you may want to rethink your approach to this musical. It is not a duplicate of what has been done on stage. It is a whole new vision that should be appreciated for its uniqueness. Props to Tim Burton and the entire cast and crew of this film. You did a wonderful job at taking something already wonderful and making it that much better!"
"Jangobadass","10","7","13","31 December 2007"," To think I was worried
","As a fan of the musical, I was both excited and worried to hear that it was finally being filmed. I was excited because a one of the greatest and daring musicals ever would finally be given the put on the silver screen for all the world to see and worried because there were a lot of things that could go wrong. <br/><br/>When I heard Tim Burton would be directing, I felt it was in good hands because if anyone could get the dark look and tone of the musical, it would be him. Escpecially since he is a life long fan of the show who's seen every performance he could since it premiered on Broadway in 1979. <br/><br/>However, when I heard that Johnny Deep would be playing the title character, I thought ""uh-oh"". Having a man who's never sung in his life play the lead character in a musical doesn't necessarily mean it will be bad to begin with (look at how things worked out for Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY or Marlon Brando in GUYS AND DOLLS), but I couldn't help but worry. And I became concerned as I heard about the rest of the casting, including Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. So in the months of production, I listened for any news I could about the film and its star's singing abilities, which were kept under wraps. The fact that the trailers focused more on the horror aspects of the show didn't help. <br/><br/>But now that I've finally seen the film for myself, I can breathe a huge sigh of relief in knowing one of my favorite musicals was done justice on the screen. <br/><br/>The story: a London barber is unjustly imprisoned by a corrupt judge and is sent to an Austrailian prison for 15 years. He escapes and returns to London to reunite with his family, only to find out it was the destroyed by the judge. He vows revenge, but soon targets all of society and his partner in crime uses the bodies of his victims to help her poor meat pie business.<br/><br/>It looks great. The film's production team painstakingly recreate Dickens-era London in all its squalid glory, mostly using actual buildings and cobble stone streets in favor of the overused CGI Hollywood is addicted to these days. And the costumes and rooms look so authentic I wondered if they didn't actually buy and repair centuries old clothes.<br/><br/>And how did Johnny do? For starters, he looks the part. With his pale complexion, the dark circles around his eyes, and his wily black hair with white streak, he looks like a Victorian mad man. But how's his singing? Well, he doesn't have the big, boisterous, Broadway-style singing voice of the major actors who've played Sweeney in the past, but he makes it work. Instead he has a usually quiet, somewhat punk rock style voice that he makes very good use of. When he sung to his razors in the song ""My Friends"" I got chills. And he did just great on ""Epithany"", where Todd loses what sanity he has and vows to kill everyone he can.<br/><br/>Helena, however, left somethings to be desired. She looked the part with her frizzled hair and long, ruffled dresses. She's not nearly as good a singer but she has her moments. <br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they're all very good. Alan Rickman makes the corrupt Judge Turpin loathsome and despicable, Timothy Spall is a mean ass Beadle Bamford, and Sacha Baron Cohen makes wonderful use of his short role as the flamboyant, conceited, greedy Pirelli.<br/><br/>Then there's the newcomers. I have to give Burton a lot of credit for having the show's young characters played by actors that are more or less the right age. Jayne Wisener is a pretty Johanna and she sings a good rendition of ""Green Finch, Linnet Bird"" (no small feat considering this is one of the show's least popular songs), but her character does less here than on stage, so it was hard for me to really judge her. Jamie Campbell Bower struck me as a strangely pretty take of Anthony, but then again he did look ""fresh faced"" and he can really sing. But the best one is Ed Sanders. When I heard that Toby was being played by a kid, I was a little uncertain of how to take it, as the character has always been played by young men who simply looked youthful. But young Mr. Sanders does a wonderful job, bringing humor and pathos to every scene he's in, whether it be hawking fake hair tonic in ""Perilli's Miracle Elixer"" or singing a moving song of devotion with ""Not While I'm around"" or just swilling gin with the best of 'em. With a good agent, this kid could have a future in the movies.<br/><br/>Fans of the musical will lament the many, many cuts of material lost in the transition from stage to screen, but I was okay with most of them. Many made sense and there were some I even saw coming. The only ones I really miss are the chorus in ""God That's Good!"" and the Judge's version ""Johanna"", which both disturbing and fascinating at the same time.<br/><br/>All in all, a great adaptation of a great musical. Well done, Mr. Burton, very well done."
"jenkinscrowe","8","7","13","30 December 2007"," He served a dark and a vengeful god
","WARNING--the below contains SPOILERS, particularly for those not familiar with the original stage show.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to try to be objective: I loved this movie. No, it wasn't the same as the stage show at all, but it succeeded much better than it would have had it tried to be another ""filmed play"" version. The decision of which numbers to cut to take an hour out of the show was judicious. Much of the love story between Johanna and Anthony is given short shrift, which is great--in most plays, the young lovers are the least interesting characters. I was a bit sorry that ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was not sung in the movie, but although it's a great song, it is very stage-bound and was better left out. Burton did choose to use its tune as background music, over the credits and elsewhere. (Its ominousness/""Dies Irae"" riff means this decision probably worked as well for those not familiar with the show as those who are.) The fact that Burton made a movie rather than a filmed play also really helped the number ""By the Sea,"" which comes off as overlong and a bit boring on the Broadway soundtrack. Freed from its staging, the song is hilarious and doesn't drag a bit. In fact, it much better accomplishes its purpose--showing the contrast between Mrs. Lovett's feelings and imagination and Sweeney's attitude about it all--than in the play.<br/><br/>Depp's Sweeney, of course, is pitch perfect, with equal parts pathos, psychopathology and comedy. Bonham Clark's Mrs. Lovett is very different from former interpretations, and I'm not sure something wasn't lost here--I missed, for example, the Angela Lansbury Lovett's seeming(?)love for young orphan Toby, which chillingly vanishes when convenient. Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall were brilliant choices for the judge and beadle characters, and Sasha Baron Cohen's Pirelli is both hilarious and effective. (He's the first character to die; thus the balance of comedy and our desire to see those who deserve punishment get it has to be established with him.) The singing is, well, adequate. It succeeds even though we're not listening to opera-quality voices because nobody sings much better or worse than anyone else. The problem comes with some of the numbers that are sung very fast and/or dialectically, as conversations with overlapping speakers. It takes amazing diction to sing such numbers such that every word can be understood, and Burton's cast wasn't always equal to the task.<br/><br/>Like No Country for Old Men, Sweeney is a perfect marriage of director and subject matter. Burton's eye for dark but thoroughly imagined settings is a dead-on match for Sondheim's misanthropic, revenge-bent Todd and ""black pit"" of a London where children are executed and human bodies are baked into meat pies.<br/><br/>A few caveats: This is a musical that contains so little spoken dialog it might as well be called an opera. If you don't like musicals, you'll have a hard time enjoying this movie--although Jonathan, who hates musicals, liked it anyway. Also, Burton gives every throat-cutting in the script (and there are many) a cadmium-red- spurting Grand Guignol treatment that's appropriate- -even funny when it ought to be--but perhaps a bit disturbing for some viewers.<br/><br/>This film succeeds at doing the same thing the show does--attaining a perfect mix of horror, social justice, and comedy, but does so, as Sir Lancelot might say, in its own idiom."
"kchuplis-1","10","7","13","26 December 2007"," A tragic painting in music and shadows
","I saw this yesterday. I'm a HUGE fan of the stage musical. I was a little worried that the brilliant score would be shoved back for the shock effect of gore and outrageousness . Oh. My. God. I have never seen such a perfect translation of a stage musical to film. It flowed seamlessly. Every person was perfectly cast. It was a visual feast. It was stylized, keeping the ""melodrama"" aspect, but still managing to paint an emotional, poignant portrait of people so broken by circumstance that you know they cannot be fixed and yet you follow willingly into their insane world. I could have sat and watched it over again immediately. I will definitely be seeing it again, probably at least twice before it leaves the big screen. Hopefully your theater has state of the art sound, because every bit of this should be heard. If you are familiar with the musical, you do have to accept that The Ballad is there only musically, because it's purpose is as a device for theater, and, IMO also to in some ways alleviate the horror of the story. Here, you don't have that, nor do you need it. It's unapologetic in any way about the tale being told. But it is not unsympathetic, which is the brilliance of this musical in any form and I think heightened in the film. Unlike the stage play, the humor is not there to break the tension, but unfolds naturally to underscore the madness. If you can accept that this is a painting, of a tragic story, in music and shadows, you will be in for a real experience, not just a movie."
"jmorris236","10","7","13","23 December 2007"," It Works!
","Although critics have been unanimous in their praise, many fans of the show have been quite harsh, chiefly for two reasons  the principals are not great singers, and the deletion of roughly 50% of the score. I am in neither camp, although either of these factors might heretofore have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure. Instead, I am thrilled beyond my expectations, but might not have been, had I not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim, who says that he is satisfied with the film, and I have followed him long enough to know he would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied. I have listened carefully to Mr. Sondheim in recent interviews, and now understand why so many stage musicals transferred to celluloid don't work. Time passes very differently in a theatre than it does on film. What takes several minutes in a Broadway theatre (a full-blown production number) is apt to seem like a small eternity on screen. Therefore, the very thing that keeps most live theatre audiences clamoring for more is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium. Also, in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, and many moviegoers who are accustomed to a certain amount of reality therefore find musical films particularly hard to take. Thanks to some of the theories voiced by Mr. Sondheim in the past week or so, I finally understand why so many film musicals fall flat - the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences. Many theatre lovers, me included, would be happy to sit through a musical transferred to screen exactly as done on stage, but most movie audiences wouldn't. <br/><br/>Tim Burton has said that he has always been a fan of Sweeney Todd. As disappointing as it is for fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably even more agonizing for Mr. Burton to decide what to remove. The original ran over three hours, and at least 75% of the story was sung. The film runs only 117 minutes and, judging by the length of the soundtrack CD (72 minutes) easily 40% of the score has been removed, mostly the ensemble pieces. Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the choral numbers which worked so well on stage, and contained some of the wittiest lyrics, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the difficult decision to let them go. This is likely to be the sorest point for many fans of the show. Had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent interviews, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.<br/><br/>But what has been excised is compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and attention to detail. Although Sondheim made subtle changes to the lyrics, actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original. Though it's a tragedy, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I hardly miss the deletions, and I am someone who has loved this piece in most of its previous renderings.<br/><br/>Although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation. Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist. To reiterate, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house. If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film. It is also a pleasure to have Toby, Joanna and Anthony played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.<br/><br/>But the real star (to me, anyway) is the score by Stephen Sondheim. I am not amazed that some feel that there are no ""memorable songs"" in the score. Good music should be subtle; the absence of ""catchy tunes"" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score. Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't ""get it"" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the version with the complete libretto included) and follow the words as the songs are sung. The first thing you will realize is (as with any Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film or the theatre) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit. His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen. There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word. But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed. This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days. Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt, real music. Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life."
"bestactor","10","7","13","23 December 2007"," Outstanding Adaptation of a Very Difficult Piece
","When I saw the very first preview I was terrified that Tim Burton had really mucked it up. I must admit that my fears were unwarranted. This is definitely the best film Burton has ever directed. His direction and Johnny Depp's performance make this film adaptation of the Sondheim stage masterpiece succeed beyond all expectation. There are quite a few of the top film critics who have thoroughly embraced this movie. I'm so glad it is getting its well deserved accolades. I saw the first run on Broadway before it won all the Tony Awards. I know this piece very well. The changes and deletions from the stage version are reasonable and increase the success of the transfer to film. Stage to film adaptations are the most difficult of all. It is amazing how many stage works are making it to the filming process. It is a testament that imagination and intelligence are not completely dead in the film world. Although I knew exactly what was coming, I wasn't prepared for the sweep of blood and pathos at the end. It was powerful and poignant. Depp deserves credit for keeping this compelling from beginning to the bloody end. He will definitely get my vote!"
"ksmred2","10","7","13","22 December 2007"," Who sir, you sir? No one in the chair, come on! Come on! Sweeney's waiting. I want you bleeders. You sir - anybody. Gentlemen don't be shy!
","Bloody EXCELLENT. Sweeney Todd is the best film Tim Burton has created since Ed Wood (also an excellent film). Everyone knows Tim Burton has great eyes for visuals. His impressive resume just proves how talent his sight is: Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factor, etc. He is without a doubt one of the best visual stylists of all time, films or no films. His style is so weird and good that he leaves his mark in every film he directed. They are dark and twisted, but very neat. They mesmerize you and they take you in different places. However, Burton has been often criticized for heavily depending on the visuals only. .Many critics doubt his ability to tell flawless story telling without the use of visuals. Whether I agree or not, it's true that sometimes he does go off and rely too heavily on visuals more than the actual story itself (ex. Big Fish). <br/><br/>Now, let me be the first one to say this film will change anyone's mind who less think of him as a story teller. It will blow you away. Sweeney Todd is absolutely incredible beyond my words. There is everything people could look forward to in this haunting masterpiece (for the audience of 18 years and older. I wouldn't recommend this to kids or anyone underage) Plenty of gores, thrills, music, meat-pies (yuk!), horrors, BOOBIES and for ladies, plenty of Johnny Depp. He is nothing like you've seen before. NO MORE PIRATES! He will certainly have a chance in winning an Oscar for best actor this year. He is THAT good. Everyone else in the film is sensational, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen of Borat fame. <br/><br/>The recent musicals like Once and Hairspray were very good, and for musical fans, fantastic. In this typical case, you do not; I repeat DO NOT have to be a musical fan to enjoy this. People in the theatre were basically laughing when Johnny started singing (sing talking like West Side Story), but you get used to it quickly. You adjust to the film. <br/><br/>In closing, Sweeney Todd is entertainment at best. This is a film that will be remembered years from now. I loved every minute of it."
"LawrenceOfAlabama","10","7","13","22 December 2007"," A Nightmare During Christmas
","Tim Burton is officially the Master of Dark and Delightful. In his latest goth-fest Burton once again makes black seem brighter than ever. Adapted from the musical Broadway play, Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet street, is a pitch perfect early Christmas gift. Burton once again teams up with Depp (this is his 8th collaboration with the actor) and Burton also reunited Johnny with his Corpse Bride (Carter). I went into the film with a preconceived notion that once again Depp would be quirky and in another of his ""Look at how strange I am"" persona. I'm glad he didn't disappoint. He was nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>The film, which complements the musical, grows on you. The first hour is spent understanding the despair and demise of a once passionate romance (for the city of London and for Todd). The second act is a tale of vengeance, bloodletting, and tragedy. All this is set to music that is done in an almost Operatic fashion. Most of the songs fill in the story and set the mood of the film. However there are several numbers that you wont easily get out of your head. To make matters worse these numbers are set to a stunning visual reference that will haunt you each time you hum about mince meat pies.<br/><br/>Todd is also filled with an excellent supporting cast. From new faces (Jamie Bower, Laura Kelly) to unforgettable ones (Sacha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman). I have had several friends state that Cohen is a one-hit-wonder. I have to say that I'm wondering how he hits every note just right in this role. His duel with Todd is like High Noon on a bad Mushroom trip.<br/><br/>Todd being released during the Holidays won't be a gift for everyone. Even though it is garnering some Oscar buzz; Todd it is still a morbid, dark and skanky tragedy, with pie! So if you're a fan of Depp, or you love Broadway, or even if the latter two don't account for your movie dollar, go see this film. However if you you like your music and movies a-la fast food style: Alvin and the Chipmunks is still showing."

"maestrocrawford","9","7","13","21 December 2007"," Well, I liked it....a lot.
","First, let me say that I was probably the first person in my home town to buy and listen to the Broadway recording when it first came out, and I have been a fan of this show ever since. I saw it on Broadway with the original cast (except for Anthony Garber), and saw recently the revival with Patti Lupone and Michael Cerveris. In addition, I am a professional in the opera world, and of course am a fan of really excellent singing.<br/><br/>All that being said, this is a movie i will go back and see again. And purchase when it comes out. I found it a breath-taking experience, in almost every way.<br/><br/>For one thing, i was once again struck by the truly transcendent brilliance of the musical score. Whoever posted above that we needed Danny Elfman ought to have his head and ears examined...and I am a fan of Mr. Elfman. There is simply nothing in the history of American musical theater to compare with Sondheim's score of Sweeney Todd, in combination with Jonathon Tunick's astonishing orchestration. In fact, one of my biggest complaints was constantly hearing the orchestra figure which introduces the ""ballad of Sweeney Todd"" only to be denied the actual melody. Despite that, I was reminded what a true work of absolute genius this score is.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I would say there isn't a truly false note in the bunch of them - even Johnny Depp, who I have always loved but thought unlikely for this role - with special kudos to Timothy Spall (a favorite from Topsy-Turvy), Ed Sanders (as Toby) as clearly the finest singer in the film, and my buddy Sasha whose phony Italian barber is beyond priceless.<br/><br/>Thank you to Burton and Sondheim - you have created something together that is unique in my not inconsiderable experience of cinema, and I will be forever grateful."

One of the darkest comedies out there, you will find yourself laughing hysterically, hiding your face in your hands. cringing at the bloodshed (body count is, i believe, 26 or something like that) and crying for the emotional depth this film attempts and succeeds in digging. This film dares to go where very few others have gone, and it was absolutely stunning! On top of that Depp and Carter's performances were stellar (as is per) and could sing pretty well.

"dramaqueen817","7","34","88","7 December 2007"," Sweeney has it's faults, but overall a good interpretation
","Let me begin by saying I walked into this movie apprehensively. I had seen the revival with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone twice last year on Broadway, and had seen videos of Len Cariou, George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, so I had some expectations. That being said, this movie was definitely not as bad as it could have been. There were parts of it that were brilliant and parts that didn't work, but overall it was an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>It did have its faults. In the beginning, the film itself seems a little confused as to whether it is going to be artistic and theatrical or realistic. There are moments where the characters are making grand gestures and acting in a big theatrical way, and then others that are very quiet, close shots making the film seem more real. Eventually it settles into a rhythm that becomes a balance between the two. There are some moments that I felt had so much comic potential that were not utilized, especially ""A Little Priest."" Sweeney and Lovett just didn't seem to be enjoying their plotting, which made the number a bit bland. The film doesn't really reach its full comic potential until the ""Johanna"" quartet (which is actually a trio) and ""By the Sea"", though we do see earlier glimpses, especially in ""The Contest."" Concerning the song cuts, I had a problem logistically with the cutting of ""Ah, Miss"" and ""Kiss Me."" It just didn't make sense that Joanna and Anthony never spoke to each other until the end of the film. Going into the film I was also upset at the cutting of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" but Burton cleverly used this as an instrumental underneath the scenes where it would have been sung. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp surprised me in his portrayal of Sweeney Todd. He was able to find both the blood thirsty monster and pained husband/ father in this character, and though obviously not a trained singer, his vocals are not bad. Helena Bonham Carter left something to be desired vocally, but acted the part of Mrs. Lovett beautifully, especially in ""By the Sea"" which I thought was the best number in the movie, darkly comic and sweet at the same time with stunning visuals. Regarding the other actors, Sacha Baron Cohen absolutely stole the scene in ""The Contest"" with his Pirelli, Alan Rickman (who has a wonderful voice!) and Timothy Spall are perfect as the villainous Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford, and Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Ed Sanders as Johanna, Anthony, and Toby respectively provide a nice contrast of innocence to all of the madness surrounding them. Laura Michelle Kelly is an absolutely eerie beggar woman. Regarding all the blood, yes, it is a lot. And yes, it does spew absolutely everywhere (camera lens included). But its coloring, opaqueness, and great amount make it not so much disgusting as artistic, especially in the ""Johanna"" quartet. <br/><br/>Overall this was a good film. It does have its faults, but it captures the mood and story of the Sondheim's originally musical beautifully."

The songs are OK-they are by Sondheim right? but for some reason they seem like an afterthought. It seems Burton could not make up his mind on whether this was a musical or another one of his self-indulgent and quite tiresome journeys into cinematic ""art"". Also on hand is Sasha Baron Cohen playing an Italian in a Borat like style that is totally devoid of any substance. The rest of the cast consists of no-name actors. This drivel can't hold a candle to the Broadway original or the filmed Hearn-Landsbury version of the late 1980s.You've seen it all before-just rent ANY Tim Burton movie, add some songs and a wimpy Johnny Depp and viola-you got it!

"ahnisnujra","10","6","11","1 March 2008"," Blood, lots of blood, and some powerful performances
","From the start to the end, you're left in no doubt that it's a Tim Burton film. All of his dark, macabre, eccentric signatures are right in place in the film, unmistakable, subtle and in your face in the same time.<br/><br/>London is dreary and hopeless, a god forsaken city, inhabited by vermin, as Sweeney so menacingly tells us. Who is Sweeney? Well, he was a barber with a different (more normal) name, with a pretty wife and a pretty child, who is packed off to Australia on false charges, because judge (Turpin) has eyes on Sweeney's wife. Until he's found by a young sailor (Anthony) 15 years later. When he moves back to his house/shop in Fleet Street, he finds the landlady (Mrs. Lovett, who's as much of a loony as Sweeney) baking the worst meat-pies in London, who tells him about the fate of his family. The wife raped by the judge, later gulps down arsenic, and the child adopted by the same judge who is the root of all of Sweeney's misery. Thus he goes mad with rage. After that follows a series of events which is best left covered up. I'll divulge only the following : the sailor who saved Sweeney falls in love with his daughter (I feeeeeeeeel youuuuu, Johannaaaaa!!), and the judge also wants to make her his wife. Oh and the chair, though I guess most promos have already shown it (again and again), sinister, very very sinister.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp just becomes more immense with every film, every performance. There's not much more to say really. One of the finest of his generation. Helena Bonham-Carter is brilliant as well. In fact, I can't think of anyone else to play Mrs, Lovett, even more so than Depp/Sweeney, she's so perfect. You fall in love and are repulsed by her in equal measure. BRILLIANT. Alan Rickman is suitably evil, Timothy Spall as slimy as he has ever been. Sacha Baron Cohen, as Signor Pirelli, a rival barber, who in a way starts 'it', is madcap as always (very good actor nonetheless). The sailor and the daughter don't have much to do, but do it well anyways. Toby, the boy employed by Pirelli from a work-house, and later Mrs. Lovett is surprisingly good as well. Surprisingly because you don't expect a child to be an important character in a movie like this, and it finally turns out he is.<br/><br/>The music's quite good. The singing's quite decent, the situations almost perfect.<br/><br/>Go to the theaters to see a film which is quite exquisitely, breathtakingly, brilliantly beautiful. I mean, a musical about serial killing. You'd be stupid not to see it. However if you're queasy in the sight of blood, stay faaaaaar away. This is one of the bloodiest, most violent films I've ever seen."

","Sweeney Todd has become another classic of Tim Burton's! Despite the blood and darkness that devours London, Tim Burton always has a way of turning movies into beautiful, magical and hilarious creations! If you enjoy how his movies, tap deep within your imagination then this movie is definitely worth watching! Every single character is absolutely amazing! Johnny Depp is simply wonderful and very sexy although his obsession with his razors keeps him astray of seeing the big picture. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen add so much light and humor to the story its almost hard not to laugh! Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall define the meaning of evil and every time you see them you cringe with anger! The musical aspect of the movie is wonderful, the songs are so beautiful and haunting they leave you singing right out of the movie theater! If you ever bump into Sweeney Todd, I would advise you to replace his razors with butter knives and whatever you do, Don't eat the meat pies!"
"pyrocitor","8","6","11","23 December 2007"," Macabre and gruesomely entertaining revisionist musical
","""Bright, cheerful and fun"" are three of the words one would most commonly hear when describing the latest movie musical. Not coincidentally, none of the aforementioned words in any way describe Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, eccentric director Tim Burton's adaptation of Steven Sondheim's macabre stage musical. In many ways, Burton's latest serves to either deconstruct or blatantly oppose the conventions of most glitzy cinematic musicals, resulting in a uniformly pitch black, macabre, gruesome and undeniably entertaining film, the likes of which have seldom been exposed to mass audiences.<br/><br/>In many ways, Burton's Sweeney Todd functions as the ""anti-musical"" - the notion of passing off Sondheim's gruesome but clever story of a nihilistic, vengeance seeking barber and his similarly deranged landlady under the guise of a mainstream musical is a subversive idea indeed, and Burton contrasts the typical musical flashy cinematography and stunning choreography with static camera movement and musical numbers sung with little to no movement - all the more unsettling but eerily captivating and fascinating. Burton is also given the opportunity to unleash his twisted visual genius upon the setting, and his atmospheric vision of turn of the century London is a gritty visual masterpiece, a world of deep greys, consistent shadows and even shadier denizens. With its slew of throat slitting, the film also stands out as one of the most visceral and outright bloody films in recent memory, proving equally effective as a Gothic horror thriller than as a movie musical. And while the film may occasionally feel unbalanced, rushed and underdeveloped in the same way which plagues many such grandiose stage adaptations, Sweeney Todd unfolds with an operatic flourish unseen in most of its contemporaries, and it is near impossible to avoid being swept up by the gruesomely enjoyable rush of it all. <br/><br/>The film's eccentric and endlessly talented cast prove equally proficient singers as they are superbly capable of crafting a memorably deranged myriad of characters. Johnny Depp embraces the titular Sweeney Todd with a malicious relish just as laudable as his superb previously unheard singing voice. Depp's brooding presence drives the film, just as quirky, captivating and compelling a lead performance as ever. Helena Bonham Carter similarly brings her offbeat charm to perfect use as Mrs. Lovett, Todd's cheerfully sinister landlady. Alan Rickman is superbly classy as corrupt Judge Turpin, crafting yet another delightfully despicable antagonistic figure to add to his roster of them. His duet ""Pretty Women"" with Depp is truly an unmissable spectacle. Timothy Spall is perfectly cast as the grimy Beadle Bamford, Turpin's swaggering second in command, and Sacha Baron Cohen is tremendously entertaining in a far too brief role as faux-Italian rival hairdresser 'Signor Pirelli'. Jamie Cambell Bower feels out of place in the gritty surroundings as a more typical mainstream romantic male lead lusting after Todd's daughter, but his presence adds to the ""anti-musical"" aspect by being pushed to the side in favour of the darker, more compelling leads. <br/><br/>Brash, bloody and gleefully disturbed, Burton's antidote to the mainstream musical proves brilliantly subversive of the conventions of its genre, while boasting a stunning spectacle of a variety unto its own. The chillingly brooding Depp and the rest of the cast are enough to bring Burton's dark vision to gritty life, and the excellent song numbers prove among the most memorable of a year fraught with many movie musical efforts. For all willing to stomach the admittably copious quantities of blood and thoroughly morbid content, Sweeney Todd may prove to be just the thing to counterbalance the syrupy glitz plaguing its musical contemporaries of late - unsettling, stylized and undeniably entertaining... in other words, exactly what one would hope for from a new Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>-8/10"
"tonya-jarrett","9","6","11","23 December 2007"," Burton Was Born to Direct This
","Sweeney Todd has been in my life for 28 years, and Stephen Sondheim even longer. I read the first part of an acquaintance's review last week and had to stop. But I was thrilled that this extremely opinionated person was throwing out the superlatives left and right.<br/><br/>This is an absolutely beautifully-executed, exquisitely dark and brooding adaptation of the Broadway musical. I'm afraid the gorgeous music and poignancy, power, and creativeness of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics will be lost on many viewers, who will titter, as a few young women did in the audience I sat with, and lose the story that is being told here.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, bless him, has made his actor/singers into naturalistic (at least far more naturalistic than the stage version) recognizable human beings, turning down the melodrama and Grand Guignol of the stage to the quiet, chilling and at times passionate despair of Sweeney Todd, embodied with every fiber of his being by Johnny Depp. Depp is a slight man but he fills up the screen with power, and you can see every year of the 15 years Todd suffered for a crime he didn't commit, losing his wife and child in the process.<br/><br/>Depp fares better with the singing duties than others in the cast, with perhaps the exception of Johanna, but even the version of Green Finch and Linnet Bird here is scaled down to sweetly pretty. In a very demanding role, his voice is expressively sweet, rough, raspy and robust as needed.<br/><br/>Helen Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett is at least in striking range of her desire to have a relationship with Todd. As embodied by HBC, Lovett is utterly delusional and a cold, conniving businesswoman at the same time, and later shows herself to have a heart when it comes to Toby, the boy she's taken in. But she can turn on a dime and Bonham-Carter takes full advantage of every twist and turn.<br/><br/>Another thing that I noticed is that, with the exception of the Beadle, everyone in this cast is younger than usually seen in the musical. Again, painstaking lengths have been gone to, ensuring believability over melodrama.<br/><br/>Burton also doesn't stint on the violence, which is only hinted at on stage. The juxtaposition of more naturalistic singing and acting (none of the singing here is particularly operatic as it is on stage which is all to the good of this film) only enhances the means by which Todd exacts his revenge, not only those who wronged him but on all humanity. The gushers of blood condemn Todd for the very things he rails against as they provide him with much needed relief for his torment.<br/><br/>The film is a morality tale, to be sure. No one comes out of Sweeney Todd unscathed. Even his daughter, who is 16 on his return, has been imprisoned by the very debauched lecher, a judge, who had Todd ""transported"" and is haunted by ghosts of the past. Sweeney Todd is the voice of all people wronged, all people who have loved and had that love wrenched away, all of us who are haunted or tormented by ghosts of the past. Sweeney Todd shows us that revenge may have momentary pleasure but in the end, it will only destroy you.<br/><br/>This movie will haunt me for a long time."
"Mdgeist316","9","6","11","22 December 2007"," Greatest Horror-Musical Ever!
","My girlfriend turned me onto the stage play of Sweeney Todd last year, and I became a big fan. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, I cringed. Then I heard Tim Burton was going to be directing, I felt a little better. Then I heard Johnny Depp was going to be Sweeney Todd. I felt a lot better. But once I saw that it was actually going to be rated R for strong bloody violence, I was sold. This to me meant that they were going to keep it faithful to the original story.<br/><br/>This is by FAR the best horror musical ever and one of the best movies of the year. People initially get turned off of it when they hear it's a musical. I'll be the first to tell you, that you won't notice it after the first 5 minutes. Johnny Depp makes this picture, and has a great supporting cast around him. He goes from being a funny, adventurous pirate in PotC, to becoming a homicidal madman out for blood and revenge. The one thing I didn't much care for was the character of Toby, as he irritated me, but the rest was superb.<br/><br/>Another thing I will mention is the violence. When I heard it was strong bloody violence, I couldn't really picture it since it was a Tim Burton film. But this is also one of the most blood soaked mainstream movies I've ever seen. Many throats are slashed and we are treated to glorious showers of blood spray each time. The ending is one of the most disturbing I've ever seen. It's a hell of a twist, and it's just sad as hell.<br/><br/>So whatever memories you have of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or any of his other characters, throw them out the window. This is a new, vicious, violent, and vengeful Johnny Depp who further makes his case as the best actor of this current generation. He along with Tim Burton, and this fabulous cast, has made Sweeney Todd one of the best movies of this year.<br/><br/>And please don't ignore it just because it's a musical. 9/10"
"chikuzen","10","6","11","21 December 2007"," Absolutely Terrific
","I saw and loved the original show. But what's done on a stage has to be rethought for the screen, and Burton and company have done so marvelously. On stage Sweeney and Mrs. Lovet have to stand front and center and sing with a force that will let the last row in the upper balcony hear every word. They don't have to do that here. Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett are in her shop and upper apartment conspiring with one another most delicately. The result is a singing horror movie. Easily puts all other recent musical films in the shade. It's the real Sondheim deal. And that means, among other things, it's a full press homage to the great Bernard Herrman. Be sure to see ""Hangover Square"" -- Sondheim' primary inspr iration -- after this one."

OK fine I'm a grown ass heterosexual male who wants to reclaim a small piece of my childhood.

"denis888","1","8","16","2 May 2008"," An Old Chemistry Of Burton And Depp Do Not Work Always
","Tim Burton is a great filmmaker. He can really shine in his warped, wry, painfully gory movies. Johnny Depp is a very deep and mature master of acting. He is the star. But sometimes, something wrong happens. Like in this much hyped movie. Sweeny Todd starts very well, then it gets sickly sick, then simply gory, then unbearable, then horribly terrible. No, this ain't about singing. After all, Depp sings much like David Bowie, Helen Carter Bonham boasts of quite strong falsetto, and even Alan Rickman is not devoid of depth and imagination. The songs are sometimes too banal and prolonged, but this is not so bad. What is really poor is the plot. You never feel sorry for poor Todd and his wife's fate, as well as his daughter's future. The situation balances between complacency and stupidity. And then, all of a sudden, Sweeny starts lacerating throats of many innocent men, with all that blood gushing so thick that Burton comes closely to Quentin Tarantino with his total lack of any taste. Depp is vapid, miserable and extremely poor all throughout the film, as well as Bonham who simply is laughable. The same may be said about wholly weak part of Sasha Baron Cohen and his character. All this is forgettable, as well as the line of Johanna, Todd's daughter, and her future. This part of the script is hugely underdeveloped and thus begs wanting. Blood is all galore, no real script, no deeper efforts, no persuasive performance  the movie is a large waste of your time, your money and patience. It only proves that great men often fail and flop most miserably."
"rick-j-walsh","10","8","16","21 December 2007"," The best translation of a Broadway musical to film, ever
","The best translation of a Broadway musical to film, ever The film differs on many points from the brilliant original stage version--most noticeably the absences of choral numbers and the running metatheatrical commentaries of the Ballad of Sweeney Todd. Yet the film perfectly captures the spirit of Sondhiem's ferocious masterpiece and presents it in a film, not a filmed play. Tim Burton weaves together the music and an equally expressive visual style to create the film of his career. From the devilish opening credits to the final image, the film astounds, entrances, mortifies, and entertains like nothing else that has hit the screens in a very long time. Yes, it is graphically gruesome. When Sweeney dispatches his victims, we clearly see their instant transformation into meat. What happens after the razor frequently is more disturbing than the juicy slice. The film also contains a chilling undercurrent of violence directed at children. The younger characters in this film, Johanna, Antony, and especially Toby, are played by very young actors--in fact, Toby is just a child (which adds historical accuracy and unnerving queasiness to his character).<br/><br/>Sounds pretty grim. But the film is a spectacular entertainment. It's wickedly funny, visually breathtaking, and filled with excellent performances by every single actor who appears on screen. Everyone, not just Depp (who gives the performance of his life with his eyes in one moment, when he asks ""How about a shave?"") soars in this effort.<br/><br/>This has been a great year for film. Eastern Promises, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, Gone Baby Gone, The Assassination of Jesse James . . ., Michael Clayton, and American Gangster all share a place beside The Departed as great films. But this twisted, bloody meditation on the consuming nature of revenge goes up there with the best of the best."
"onepotato2","6","10","22","21 December 2007"," Humor is gone + Bonham Carter is horrible
","Let's get the bad out of the way first. This piece did not need to have it's grimness, bleakness or grotesque violence emphasized; and material this dark doesn't need dark film stock; that's unimaginative and literal. Leave it to Burton though (I'm not a fan) to strike the wrong & most obvious chord. This story is so dark that Sondheim provided much humor to lighten the piece. Burton is still too much in love with his production dioramas, and he mutes every glimmer of humor, because he's still more committed to being Goth than to finding a suitable expression for a unique project. I imagine he liked Sweeney Todd because he saw something he could squeeze through the same exhausted & shallow filters his previous work came out of. He took an epic sweeping tragi-comedy and found only a horror movie in it. How literal... How small.<br/><br/>While one gets used to Johnny Depp's singing, Bonham Carter doesn't even register with her thin, dull, piping voice. Most of her lines are inexpressively sung and therefore her lyrics are utterly lost. Depp cold be playing opposite a mannequin for how little she brings to this. Nepotism handed her a star-making role, and she chose to sleepwalk through it. Any other female with a pulse and working facial muscles would have been a better choice. There has been talk of Deep getting an Oscar here; He does better than H.B.H., but just how nuanced is it to hold a scowl for an entire performance?<br/><br/>Although some have praised this for how it's been opened up, the best filmic moments come early. There are just too many grey shots of Depp looking out the window. These characters need things to do. All Burton can muster over and over is to point them at each other while they're singing. That isn't enough, and it isn't direction. It still feels stagy & Burton's signature artifice can't relieve that. The final moment is the wrong tableau to end on. It's just too, too bleak. We should have had a few seconds of Antony reunited with Joanna.<br/><br/>I'm amazed at how much they were able to keep from the play. They didn't muck it up too badly. The missing songs are forgiven. And I cried at least twice, from beautiful songs that Burton couldn't ruin no matter how 'adequate' or 'bland' his visuals; Sondheim is just that good. ""My Friends,"" a love song sung to a razor, is still both powerful and chilling. ""Not While I'm Around"" which somehow, miraculously didn't get cut is an absolutely beautiful moment. Ed Sanders who sings it blows Bonham Carter off the screen, because he can actually sing (There's an idea!) and as an actor he's able to realize the drama of that moment; meanwhile Bonham Carter seems to only be concerned that her lack of effort matches from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Sondheims rousing orchestrations, despite changes, are as powerful as ever, and wonderful to hear on a movie theaters enhanced audio system. And his breathtaking musical structure (leit-motifs & revisited melodies) is largely intact. It reached me emotionally. I was crying as I drove home. But I just don't think that's the emotional terrain I had hoped a film Sweeney would cover. I'll be amazed if this material finds an audience."

Wow, was my gut feeling right! Recently I watched this movie on DVD, which I checked out from a public library. This may be the worst musical ever produced by Hollywood. The story is grotesque, the acting stagy and the musical numbers forgettable. Making a musical about a mass murderer is stretching literary license a bit far. Stephen Sondheim'syrics are clever, but even his music cannot save the story. Johnny Depp plays a role that is completely out of character for him; he is not an opera singer and his role required an actor who could belt out tunes; Ms. Bonham Carter's performance is laughable; and Alan Rickman is about as chilling a character as Charlie Chaplin. What this movie needed was Judge Dredd, not Judge Turpin. What's next on the agenda? A musical about Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy?"

","I really wanted to like this film; honestly I did. I'd looked forward to it ever since I heard Burton and Depp were involved, and I thought to myself that if *anyone* could carry off the incredibly twisted comedy, it would be Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Sadly, it doesn't work, nowhere near as well as it might have. Burton actually proves that he doesn't really know how to stage a musical number (JOANNA drags on and on and on and on until you want to throw something at the sailor, and LITTLE PRIEST is sung so softly and mechanically that the orchestra, by necessity, declares aural victory.). There had been talk of a chorus of ghosts, then a single ghost, singing the opening BALLAD OF SWEENEY TODD, but instead... nothing. The number that sets up the tone of the entire show is cut, for no real discernible reason.<br/><br/>There's also a very odd approach to BY THE SEA, which, in Burton's eyes, has to be opened up into this strange fantasy sequence. It's nice to look at, sure, but it woefully undercuts the point of the song.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's, for the most part, a gorgeous film, with stunning art direction. Some of the costume designs -- like Mrs. Lovett's goth ballgown and Perelli's pants, which are laughably tight but again beg the question: why? -- don't really work, but the architecture and the interiors all carry Burton's brand of dark, desaturated colours and strange, mysterious shadows.<br/><br/>But all in all, a huge disappointment."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","5","9","13 March 2008"," The cleanest shave you'll ever know
","This is the third musical by Burton I've seen, and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three. This is the first live-action(I shall leave you in suspense no longer: the other two are The Nightmare Before Christmas(granted, he didn't direct it, but still) and The Corpse Bride(which may be the only other two musicals he's done) of his I've seen, and it's by far the best(but all three are of high quality, and very much worth watching). The themes are interesting and there is food for thought(meanwhile, you may not want to eat close to your viewing of this, in fact, you probably shouldn't). The plot is well-written and well-told. I'm not usually up for musicals, and had Tim's name not been attached to this, I doubt I would have granted it a second glance. I cannot deny that this was spectacular. The trademarks, his style, are very much present: the Gothic visuals, the stylized and at times comical violence, the grotesque, the macabre, and so forth. There is little, if any, gore, but there are bucket-loads of blood... it is too red and doesn't come off as horrifying as that of other films(this would appear to be entirely intentional). The pacing is marvelous. The acting is flawless, as is the singing... in both cases, the performances are quite simply excellent for every actor-singer. The characters are fleshed out expertly. The songs are well-written, and composed well. The cinematography and effects are magnificent, and the editing is as sharp and effective as one of Todd's razors. As the FAQ suggests, pay attention to the lyrics, not only will you miss out on delightful word-play, but important, perhaps crucial, details will also evade your attention if you do not. The humor is black, at times pitch black, and any potential viewer should consider if they can take all the contents. There's no actual sexuality, but some is implied. Language is not pervasive, and what little there is really isn't as strong as it easily could be. I recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and possibly of the play(I haven't watched it, but hey, the composer of it not only was involved with this, he's since said that he likes the movie, a lot, even). 10/10"
"walsh-22","10","5","9","2 March 2008"," Bloody Marvellous
","Let's be honest this was a hard subject to make into a musical and then a film but both Stephen Sondheim and Tim Burton did it. The reason being the real Sweeney Todd was a man of the times he was born into where society was not compassionate about their fellow man especially the lower classes and Sweeney Todd had no redeeming character traits so I can understand how the character changed into being someone who had been cruelly taken away from his family and sent far away and the audience can understand his need for vengeance against the men who did this to him Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall).<br/><br/>The film is another successful collaboration of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I have yet to see them make a bad movie together.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is as usual, amazing. He is one of the most gifted actors I have ever seen. He plays Todd as this man who is just holding onto his sanity but who looks like he could explode at any minute and when he does its just as frightening the coldness of his gaze when he is killing his customers to when he erupts into anger. He gives such an intense performance but also sings beautifully and seems to relish the singing side of the film as much as the dialogue.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has done it again. He clearly understood the character and story which shows in the whole set-up of the movie from the cinematography, set design, costumes and actors. I love the Gothic feel to the production which is so attractive especially when he subtly introduces a little bit of colour to each scene.<br/><br/>The music was unbelievable, well done to Stephen Sondheim who covers the whole spectrum of moods and emotions in the songs. My particular favourite was when Sweeney Todd is singing about having his vengeance, I can't remember the name of the song. When I heard that the film would be a musical it put me off but I'm glad I went because I realised it worked better in a musical format then just having the actors talk.<br/><br/>I can't imagine any other actress pulling off Mrs. Lovett accept Helena Bonham Carter who just fits the role like a glove.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall remind me of typical pantomime villains that you love to boo at. They seem to relish the meat of their characters as it shows in their performances. The person who surprised me the most was Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Aldolfo Pirelli who shows he can act along side the more established performers.<br/><br/>The gore is not as bad as you would think, the blood was so bright that it reminded me of the old vampire movies where they made the blood so theatrical that there was nothing to be scared about. In fact, the scene I found the most scary was Todd throwing Mrs. Lovett in the furnace.<br/><br/>I wasn't surprised when the beggar woman turned out to be Sweeney's wife because I had guessed this but was shocked at the climax of the movie when Todd killed her quickly and without thought and then realised he had killed the wife he loved and who he had never gotten over. A sad ending but I was glad Todd's character died the way he did and not at the end of a rope like the real Sweeney Todd."
"simonparker1990","10","5","9","19 January 2008"," Bloody Marvelous!
","When I went into Sweeney Todd this evening I admit I expected it to be brilliant, I adore every single Tim Burton movie, yes and I do mean every single one in their own way. Burton is a very acquired taste in my eyes, you either love or loathe his movies. In fact I am the only member of my family who love Burton movies, my mum actually made me turn Mars Attacks off because she despised it so much. I on the over hand will lap any Burton movie up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Corpse Bride, I love them all. So I went in today, sat down and prepared to be amazed. And I came out of that cinema more than amazed, I was practically in love with the movie. I am a huge Burton fan, but this might just well be his very best work to date! Sweeney Todd is just amazing, the music, the performances, the storyline, the ending, oh they are all so wonderful. I think I have already seen the best movie of 2008! However despite this being a Burton movie through and through, if you despise his movies this isn't for you, the movie is also surprisingly dark for him. In fact its quite easily Burton's darkest film to date. Johnny Depp excels in this movie and Bonham Carter is a true joy to watch. The movies songs are also amazing, while none of them are happy and foot tapping like they were in Hairspray, they are superb to listen to and each and every one is memorable.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's favourite actor and actress both appear in this movie as the leads, Johnny Depp being the infamous demon barber, and Helena Bonham Carter as equally as infamous Mrs Lovett. Johnny Depp recently won a Golden Globe for his performance, and in my most humble opinion I think he should take the Oscar as well. Sure he was superb as Captain Jack Sparrow, but in this movie he possesses such emotions, such a great voice and such a complex character that he really does a better performance in this movie. When he sings ""My Friends"" that's when I truly appreciated his performance. Bonham Carter also delivered her very best performance in this movie. I've started to find her a bit overused in Burton movies, I mean what was the point in her being cast in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? However in this film she is spectacular. Sure her singing voice isn't the best, it seemed oddly high in ""Worst Pies in London"", but she does deliver in terms of emotion. Her scenes later in the film are simply put amazing, and she like Depp deserves an Oscar as well. Alan Rickman is on fine form as the villainous Judge, its a shame he is underused, but there are a few scenes where he is amazing. Sacha Baron Cohen makes an amusing appearance as a rival barber, a shame he too underused. But the biggest surprise comes courtesy of Ed Sanders playing the young boy, Toby. I cannot spoil the character for you as he is important, but the performance from the boy is simply stunning.<br/><br/>A lot of the reviews for the movie I have read have claimed that Sweeney Todd is a surprisingly violent film. Well obviously it was going to be a bit violent, the whole meat pies scenario hardly meant the film would be good for the squeamish. But its nowhere near as violent as people have made it out to be, the neck slicing isn't too bad, its only when the bodies go down the trap door I found a couple of moments a bit nasty. Anyway this movie is not about the violence at all, anyone who went to see this for their gore dosage deserves to be shot. This is a musical, in fact about 80% of the film is singing, and you know what I wouldn't want it any other way. Every song is amazing. By the Sea, My Friends, A Little Priest, they're all just so perfect. And the score itself is brilliantly grand and suits the movie superbly. When the organ kicked in when the Warner Brothers sign popped up I knew the score was going to be one of the best in a Burton movie for a long while. The movie also has a killer ending with a twist I actually didn't see coming, I knew nothing about the movie before hand and so wasn't even expecting a twist! Anyway the ending is pitch perfect and had me gripped. Even my Burton hating friend I saw this with fell in love with the movie just because of the ending. The movie also succeeds because despite its darkness, the film is also quite funny. Mrs Lovett has some great lines, and Depp reactions in By the Sea are priceless to watch. While this is extremely dark and hardly for the little kiddies, I guarantee you will still smile in the movie.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a true masterpiece of cinema that I actually don't expect to be topped this year. It's the best musical I have ever seen and features such stunning songs and performances it left me speechless. Go and see this movie as soon as possible, you will not regret it!"

","As usual, Tim Burton's adaption of the play to movie was well done--he is a director who can give us the odd in a very entertaining way. All the lead actors did good jobs (especially with the singing because it is not the norm for any of them), and the twists and turns in the plot were excellent. Helena Bonhiem Carter did an exceptional job and deserves recognition for her rule. Johnny Depp, as usual in Burton movies, was outstanding. It was good to see Alan Rickman as the judge responsible for Depp's family situation--he is a good actor who is able to perform whatever is required. This movie definitely deserves the nominations received for the Golden Globes, and hopefully there will be more nominations along with some wins for this incredible movie."

","Those who happen not to have a musical theater affinity may likely be surprised by the ease and inclusiveness of this masterful musical film creation. Perhaps, because I do love stage musicals it was natural to anticipate this film on the one hand, but on the other I wondered and worried about how successful the director and crew would be at transferring the Sondheim genius on to the big screen. I was not disappointed! <br/><br/>Burton and Logan supremely translate the stageplay on screen into the thrilling unfolding of the tale of the Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, offering brilliant and authentic sets with eery lighting and once the viewer gets passed the first ten minutes or so of lyrics in lieu of lines, even the anti-musical enthusiast will either become a convert or at the least - in this particular instance - easily make the leap into the genre for the next few delightfully thrilling hours.<br/><br/>Of course, the Sondheim tunes are fabulous, the cast talent stellar and Depp's musicality surprised and impressed. Not only with his debut singing abilities but honestly, in his never-ending labryinth of character development and genius. This film, more than any other to date(and he has a lot), shows how incredibly gifted and willing to take risks he is,despite what is or is not kosher in Hollywood or even with public.The hallmark of a gifted actor is one who can really take on the whole spectrum of characters and therefore not a typecast. This man is an actor's actor. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter was hysterical and developed character in a way that mesmerizes you when she's on screen. I could not wait for she and Depp to be back on screen. That said, Alan Rickman was stupendously evil and loved his portrayal of Judge Turpin. Timothy Spall - OMG, he could not have been more deliciously smarmy as Tourpin's sycophant. Sacha Baron Cohen was seriously funny and showed his skills as a dramatic actor. Kudos for Jamie Campbell Bower as perfect Anthony Hope and really enjoyed the performance of Ed Sanders as Toby; worked great with Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Set design, lighting and cinematography is a dream and in large part is what helps to make the translation from stage to screen so great and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Burton and the entire cast and crew is spot-on and I plan to see this film again and again. Brilliant!"

","I just saw this last night on a bit of a whim and I am glad that I did. As someone who has never seen the musical, this movie has inspired me to want to go and see it. I am listening to the soundtrack right now. However I should point out that for those whose only experience with Depp is Pirates of the Caribbean, this might not be for you. It contains a lot of animated, exaggerated blood (kill bill levels). And while there are parts that are laughable, it is a serious movie. This is by far one of the best movies of the year, however it's hard to compare to something like American Gangster or No Country for Old Men since Sweeney Todd is such a unique flavor. If you enjoyed Depps earlier work, or enjoy grim stories with fascinating characters, or even if you enjoy musicals and have an open mind, you should go see this film."
"seby2765","1","17","44","30 December 2007"," The critics must have seen a different movie. Surely.
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street<br/><br/>Last week a movie opened in theaters that I had been very curious about for quite some time. It was ""Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", as the avid reader will already have discovered from subtle clues laid about the text so far, and the concept was really quite novel to me; a shlocky horror-comedy-musical about a barber who apparently killed his customers or something. I need not tell fellow fans of the offbeat and the shlock how much potential this has as a concept, a potential classic in fact, but I was skeptical, so I waited this long to see it, figuring that any really bad points about it would have long since been whined about by now, and that if it was a generally bad movie I would have had it disrecommended to me. I even read some reviews, which I never trusted very much, but they all seemed to hail it as a godly genius masterwork. Heck, its www.rottentomatoes.com rating was a very good 87%, six percent higher than 'I Am Legend', which I saw last week and adored, despite it's small flaws, so I decided to go see it last night. <br/><br/>And woe is me, I'll never get those two hours and ten dollars back.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, it's flaws are extremely obvious. The singing, which I won't even call off-tune because that would mean there was a hint of proper tune to begin with, is performed poorly, and at many parts completely drowned out by the background music ( oh wait, does it seem like that's a complaint? ). The lyrics are completely forced, have radically different syllable counts from line to line, and amazingly repetitive ( ""...and she was beautiful"" was repeated probably 40 times during the movie ). Not only is it bad, it's completely random. I like a properly executed musical very much and I've seen and listened to quite a few, so disagree if you must but don't dismiss my opinion to simple lack of education on the matter. I mean it's completely random and doesn't really serve a purpose. It isn't more expressive, it's not extravagant and large-scale, I really felt the whole way through the movie would have been far more enjoyable without it.<br/><br/>But my problems with this movie don't stop at the audio, oh no, they spread out to the realm of video almost just as much. The outfits and places I will admit are indeed stylized, and even at points sort of cool, but it really bugged me, even for a time-piece of a very dirty, crappy period for England, that such reputable people as a judge would go see a barber who has apparently never washed his work-space, and for that matter, despite claiming to offer "" the closest shave you've ever had"" sports a five o' clock shadow. But that's excusable. You know, style and all that. What is not acceptable is the very lame look of the intro credits and that scene ( or where there two? ) where the camera flies around the city. Basically, the prior scene has 3D effects that would have been at home in a 1995 teen shlock crap fest, and the latter looks like one of those 3D puzzles you can buy. And the blood. Oh lord the blood! Aside from the fact that every death in the movie but two was by throat-slitting, which is an alright movie death but amazingly overused here, the violence was completely ridiculous. The blood honestly looked exactly like V8 and gushed like fountains, almost like in Kill Bill, except it didn't look stylized and cool. It looked cheap. And I don't care what you say, there was no style there at all. <br/><br/>""But Seby, you'd surely say, that's all well and good, the style is total crap to you, but surely there must be substance? "" and frankly, there is. The execution is the problem. The story is pretty interesting actually. The eponymous barber gets back to London after fifteen years of forced march brought on to him because the judge who sent him away had an eye for his wife. He naturally wants revenge, and goes to his ancient barber shop where one Mrs. Lovett now has a shop that sells ""the worst pies in London"". One thing leads to another and he ends up setting up his barber shop anew upstairs of Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop, where he establishes himself as the best barber in London ( in by far the best scene of the movie, a great barber-off against Borat himself, Sasha Baren Cohen, here in outlandish garb and hilarious fake accent. ) and, as reputation means nothing to him, he starts slitting his patrons' throats so that Mrs. Lovett, disgusting woman that she is, can use them to make far better meat pies. All the while, some young nameless ( his name was probably mentioned, but it seemed very unimportant ) fellow is trying to seduce Sweeney's daughter who now lives with the judge fellow. This part seemed very tacked on really. And I know, this seems like a good story! It truly does to me! But frankly, as it was, I can't understand how anyone enjoyed it. It wasn't whimsical enough not to be disgusting, and not serious enough to not be whimsical. And the music once again did not fit.<br/><br/>Please, do not buy the hype. Don't pay to see this movie. Do yourself and whatever shred of artistry is left in film-making a favor.<br/><br/>-Seby Duguay"
"DaveDiggler","4","6","12","24 April 2008"," A Throat Slashing Extravaganza Gone Wrong
","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a hard film to watch and will test some audiences, maybe most audiences. I was tested during this musical, turned for the silver screen, that never felt so wrong. There were some things that were done extremely well and I can appreciate that, such as the make up, set design and costume design. Those are all worthy of the Academy Award nominations that they got and I can't complain about their wins. There was some great CGI and special effects that give the look of the film a very contrasting picture of dark, bright, beautiful, and a down right heinous look. The blood is just as black as the clothes, or the floors, or the rooms which gives ""Sweeney Todd"" a very dark feeling that was captured very well by director, Tim Burton. The feel and tone of the film are pitch perfect, but once these characters open their mouths the film quickly turns from perfect to nearly unbearable.<br/><br/>I actually would really like to see this film adapted to a fable instead of a musical much in the mold of ""Edward Scissorhands."" That's where I think this can be an exceptional film. The music is down right awful and it made me cringe in my seat. I had to leave during parts of the music because of the words and the sounds were just so hard to listen to; it's just bad. It's a musical and the music sucks. There was one song here, in a rare bright spot for the film, where Sacha Baron Cohen sings which generated a couple laughs, especially with the look of his hair growth formula. That's where the laughs end. This isn't funny and it isn't supposed to be, but that scene may have been one of the best the film has to offer- and that isn't even that good. It's just an average scene. The best scene comes at the end of the film. The ending is what got ""Sweeney Todd"" a rating higher than a half a star in my book. I won't ruin it, but it's a strong ending that doesn't wavier from the theme and tone of the film and even though it's predictable it's still very well executed. The progression of Sweeney' thirst for vengeance takes such a severe course where he forgets what he's avenging and who he's doing it for. In his blood-lust he forgets where he came from and what he's here for. Sweeney looses himself in his hatred and grows so dark that he does something that he could not bear to do.<br/><br/>The acting is average. Depp should not have been nominated with so many other strong performances from the year. Brad Pitt in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" was much, much better with a similar type of character; just against a very different backdrop. Ryan Gosling was much more deserving in ""Lars and The Real Girl"" and in all reality this performance doesn't even stand in the same breath as those two. Depp just mails in another one of his makeup soaked, black eyed, yellow teethed, over the top, completely out there performance that only Johnny Depp would want to do. He's done this same performance before and basically plays another variation of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Charlie in the Chocolate Factory,"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" It's a performance that I've seen before and quite frankly a performance that I've been tired of seeing a long time ago. Depp has a lot of talent and was great in ""Blow"" and even better in ""Donnie Brasco,"" but with films such as this, all those talents are wasted with ridiculous characters. His singing is mediocre, but it's not like he's got the greatest songs to sign, so I don't fault him there. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good in this, and this is exactly in her ballpark, as well. I'm not sure why she didn't get nominated since I couldn't find much of a difference between the two lead performances, but I guess it's do to the fact that she's not a big name like Depp.<br/><br/>In the end, the plot was good, the look was great, but the musical just doesn't work. Without the singing this is probably one of the best films of the year. This is, however, not one of the best films of the year. I'm not a musical guy in the first place, but I am open minded. ""Sweeney Todd"" struggles with getting to where it wants to go and you can see where it wants to go from a mile away. I'm watching and knowing what's going to happen, but I feel like I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for it to happen as the music breaks up any kind of rhythm or pacing the film gathers. Instead of a 2 hour film, it should have been no more than 80 minutes. It becomes tedious and tiresome. I'm squirming in my chair, waiting for something to happen while Johnny sings for 5 minutes about his razor. It becomes boring instead of interesting and captivating. The music is the worst part of the film, and once again, for a musical? I don't think that's a good thing.<br/><br/>P.S. don't show this to anyone who doesn't know anything about it other than Johnny Depp is in it. I've seen the results. They don't last ten minutes before they're gone. I have watched this two times with six different people. The results the same. Even Johnny Depp can't save this film. Main reason? It's a lost cause to begin with and he just isn't very good giving the same old tired performance that we've been watching for 15 years. The best part may have been the look of the giant breasts full of milk. And who doesn't love that?"
"WriterDave","7","6","12","22 December 2007"," Grim Musical OJ's the Audience
","Tim Burton's gleefully macabre adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical smash hit ""Sweeney Todd"" is the strangest holiday season Oscar bait to come out of Hollywood...well, ever. I'll be the first to admit I am not a fan of film musicals as they are inherently loud and full of paper-thin characters singing and dancing their way through horribly obvious and clichéd plots. However, every so often one comes along that I thoroughly enjoy, like ""Chicago"" with its hot-blooded dames committing cold-blooded murder during the roaring '20's. Here, bloody revenge is the topic, and Victorian London the setting. The stage was set for a bizarre juxtaposition of seemingly disparate genres: the over-the-top operetta and the over-the-top horror film. On both levels, ""Sweeney Todd"" delights and horrifies in equal measure.<br/><br/>The film starts awkwardly with foggy CGI set designs and off-key singing covering a clunky exposition about a barber wrongly imprisoned (for, well, I never caught why) and looking for revenge against the judge who drove his wife to suicide (allegedly) and kidnapped his daughter. The film moves slowly until Sacha Baron Cohen (""Borat"") shows up with a gin-swilling moppet in tow (Ed Sanders as Toby, the best singing orphan this side of ""Oliver!"") adding a sense of color, humor, and heart to the film's bleeding core. Once the killings start, the set designs and gore seem to take on a life of their own as Burton paints his vision on screen with the rare wanton abandon of an auteur with final cut.<br/><br/>It would be unfair for me to judge the music and the songs (they were adequately lively in my humble opinion), but the acting was far better than I expected. Johnny Depp was perfectly off-kilter in the lead role. His lack of expression during the ""By the Sea"" fantasy sequence was priceless. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter performed her third successful evolution as an actress. She was once the darling of the Merchant/Ivory costume drama, then the cult star of ""Fight Club"", and now the Cockney-accented comic relief in the darkest movie musical ever made. I thought her facial expressions and timing where especially spot-on. I can't think of another actress who has such distinct groups of rabid fans. Alan Rickman is effectively creepy in the villain role, while the two young stars playing the whatever-the-heck-his-name-is-pretty-boy and Johanna were appropriately annoying and dewy-eyed.<br/><br/>While the film goes through the requisite motions of an operetta, it succumbs to a fantastically grim and fitting conclusion that ultimately won over the audience. With more dark psychologically rich subtexts and better acting then you come to expect from a film musical, ""Sweeney Todd"" OJ's its audience with cartoonish gore and spirited song and dance. It's no masterpiece, but it's bloody good fun."
"BretSmith360","9","6","12","22 December 2007"," Tim Burton is Back and Better than Ever
","I just got back from the theaters after hatching one of the most Interesting films I've seen in a long time. Before seeing this movie I had pretty standard expectations of what this film would be like. I actually didn't really know much of the plot or story of the movie before seeing this. All I knew was that it was a Tim Burton movie and we haven't seen one of those for over two years. Like most Tim Burton movies this one stars Johnny Depp who did a fantastic job as Sweeney Todd. Now the plot to the story is hard to describe without giving anything away but I'll explain as best as I can. A barber is seeking revenge for a cruel act against his wife, and he's doing so by killing people and having them ground down to meat with the help from Mrs. Lovett a mysterious and eccentric baker. This story has interesting views of morality and a dark presence that you can identify as a Tim Burton. It also has a humorous look on death were you might find you and the person nearby you laughing at something that is disturbing( Think of any horror movie that over exaggerates the amount of blood a person has. like Dawn of the dead or evil dead.) Some might find the deaths cheesy and silly but I enjoyed and I thought they were awesome. The camera work and digital effects were stunning to say the least. The entire movie the environment is dark and old looking almost black&white (which is a theme for Tim Burton) and when you see that red blood for the first time it's beautiful. Pirelli played by Sacha Baron Cohen(Borat) is one of the greatest characters in the film keep an eye out for him. And one thing I would like to add were was Danny Elfman? This was the first Tim Burton movie I ever seen without Elfman composing the score WTF? So basically go see it but don't take your kids. Its to long and gory for any child to withstand."
"allenblake21","10","6","12","21 December 2007"," I guarantee you will have the closest shave you've ever known
","I have always been an avid lover of Stephen Sondheim, especially the musical theatre Sweeney Todd. At first, as I presume many people were, I was skeptical of the ability of the cast in their vocal performance. Let me just say that their voices, though not the 'best' in the world, fit the characters perfectly. Also, the casting was marvelous and I do not think that better pairs and people could have been chosen. It is hard to follow suite of Angela Lansbury, Patti LuPone, George Hearn and Len Cariou, but I think Depp and Carter both blow the socks off of the watcher and listener.<br/><br/>The eyes are also given a stimulating roller coaster ride with the amazing color differences, stunning cinematography and intriguing mind puzzles that are displayed throughout.<br/><br/>Though I know the musical well, I was still able to be at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I was still just as emotional stirred during the infamous Johanna and Not While I'm Around. I was also shocked, once again, when Sweeney kills his beloved Lucy. Even more though, when Mrs. Lovett is thrown into the fire, your heart aches and burns. How tragic it is when Toby, such a young and innocent boy slits Sweeney. There could have not been a better drastic and traumatic way to end the movie then to have Sweeney mixing blood with his ""vengence"" (aka his wife).<br/><br/>What a remarkable movie it is that draws your attention to minute detailing in the background and costumes; a movie that keeps you guessing whilst squirming at the same time; a movie where your heart is pulled.<br/><br/>Many movie musicals keep to the original stage feeling where chorus and dance numbers occur on a ""stage"" of some sort. Sweeney Todd breaks all of these barriers. It is hard to believe that this originated on Broadway. Tim Burton does bring back some of the same ""stage"" choreography with the ""At last my arm is complete again,"" ""These are the worst pies in London"" beatings, ""We'll serve anyone...at all"" butcher knife and rolling pin stance etc...<br/><br/>This movie is nominated for some Golden Globes. There have been many movies that qualify and even can win for the ones that Sweeney Todd is nominated for. It is, however, not very often when a movie is able to be an 'art form' and also an engaging visual experience."

","Fans of the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp franchise can rejoice, and as usual, leave their critical faculties at the door. Their heroes have come through, spraying the screen with ketchup, acting the gamut from A to B, yelling their way toward Oscar noms. Or not. For the rest of usaware that Sondheim's great score is also the high point of late-20th Century music theatrethe movie Sweeney Todd is a noisy, thudding, completely unsatisfying bore. Depp starts out angry and goes nowhere. The voice is thin, reedy, and often overpowered by Jonathan Tunick's aggressive orchestrations. Depp barely manages to even look at Helena Bonham-Carter, and she, as Mrs. Lovett, connects only to little Ed Sanders--who as Toby, steals every single scene he's in. In other words, the chemistry is off, off, OFF. Alan Rickman is the sexiest Judge Turpin on record, but must make due without singing the great ""mea culpa."" Anthony and Johanna are sung by pretty actors who have little to no impact whatsoever, and Burton leaves their story unresolved. I enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, but don't think he was right for his role either. Again, Ed Sanders as Toby was amazing, but that's not the reason we go to see Sweeney Todd. In the words of the real fright master, Bela Lugosi, ""Beware, beware, beware."""

Funny - Not one bit.<br/><br/>The story is depressing, disturbing, disappointing, and hideous. The ending is, well... hideous, disturbing, depressing, and disappointing.<br/><br/>I did not care for the characters. Todd's revengeful mind does not make up for the hideous acts he performs. Johanna's love story? Come one, she doesn't even know the guy. The cinematography is quite good, with the dark shades, pale faces, and distinct reds, but that's all that's good.

However, this film is different, it is a combination of Comedy, Thriller, musical, Drama and tragedy film. And it is well enough to be watched again and again without boring. The music is impressively wonderful. It fulfills all the meaning of what they want to say and also the emotion. The voice of Depp is good and compared to the stage play(without bias indeed) I think he can show more appropriate feeling of the songs. Everyone else's singing is great, too, except for Mrs. Lovett's. Her voice is quite thin and makes the songs less sweet, but still acceptable. And it is good to shorten the songs, or else they would be too long and I would have been boring like some other musical film. The humor of the film is fabulous especially the contest scene. The performance of all the actors is good and I am not surprise to see Depp in the list of Oscar's nominee though I do not expected him to get that award. In conclusion, this is an enjoyable film, good enough to see it twice. (If you can tolerate the blood)"
"curtisloew","6","4","7","26 January 2008"," Fantastic Performances
","A fantastic film, as I'm sure has been said many times and part of this was to due to the way music was incredibly well integrated within the events. Indeed, this was so much the case that the actors seemed to effortlessly switch between song and dialogue managing to portray the characters as well in singing as through spoken dialogue. The music itself was wonderfully composed with strong juxtaposition between the music and the lyrics behind which the character of Sweeny Todd was lurking.<br/><br/>Jonny Depp was sensational and thoroughly, in my opinion, deserves an Oscar for his performance, enabling the audience to see the evil of the character, not to mention his deep desires. Helena Bonham Carter also portrayed Mrs. Lovett in an equally disturbing manner, creating an almost farcical world in which the characters live in, but, paradoxically involving the audience into what many think of 'old London' to be like.<br/><br/>An incredible film that definitely makes it into my top 5 films of all time...worth several watches!"

","A few years ago, I watched on VHS the television version of the Broadway musical Sweeney Todd with Angela Lansbury and the Emmy-winning performance of George Hearn. I enjoyed it very much so I was psyched to see the movie version starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton. Despite, or maybe because of the deletion of many of the chorus segments, I thought this was an excellent version of the bloody Stephen Sondheim horror musical. Depp brings a David Bowie-quality to his singing in the title role. Helena Bonham Carter brings a creepily romantic vibe in her role of Mrs. Lovett, Todd's accomplice. Alan Rickman brings a crafty charisma to Judge Turpin. Timothy Spall, who I had just seen in Enchanted, brings a droll goofiness as Beadle Bamford. And Sacha Baron Cohen makes a humorously insolent Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Also compelling are Jamie Campbell Bower as the sailor who accompanies Todd back to England, Jayne Wisener as Todd's grown daughter-Johanna-who Anthony the sailor is smitten with and she in return, Laura Michelle Kelly as a beggar woman with a secret, and Ed Sanders as Toby-Pirelli's and, eventually, Mrs. Lovett's boy servant. Most of them provide compelling singing voices. Kudos to the Golden Globes for awarding the Best Actor-Comedy or Musical-statue to Mr. Depp (too bad, because of the writer's strike, he couldn't accept it in person). And congratulations to Mr. Burton for providing such an excellent movie of this most entertaining Stephen Sondheim horror musical."

(minus the singing) I went to see the movie this past weekend with my mom and a group of friends. I loved the way that it was done. The blood, was a bit shocking at first, but I got used to it, and the singing voices were wonderful! I mean not stage quality, but good enough for the movie theater. I do agree that you should see this.<br/><br/>We pretty much described the movie as ""Captain Jack killing the cast of Harry Potter bad guys (minus one not so bad guy)"""
"nsnolan55","10","4","7","29 December 2007"," Best film I have seen this year
","My daughter gave me the Sweeney Todd soundtrack for Xmas. I admit my only exposure to Sweeney Todd up til now was thanks to Jersey Girl (though I have unknowingly loved Sondheim's music most my life). Anyway, Johnny Depp and Helena Carter were awesome and I would gladly watch this movie again and again and will own it when it gets to DVD. I am no expert (just a fan and a humble member of the audience) but listening to Johnny D, Ed Sanders, Jamie Bower, Helena Carter and Alan Rickman thrilled me and gave me goosebumps for 1 hour 57 minutes. And I found Tim Spall and Sacha Cohen very entertaining as well. (My daughter: ""Mom! Three of the main characters are from Harry Potter!!"") Well, unfortunately I live in Jackson Mississippi and the audience at Tinseltown was packed w/very young children (R rated movie remember?) that obviously couldn't get tickets for the Chipmunks movie and older kids that had no idea what they were in for (I heard teenagers in the parking lot debating whether to see Sweeney Todd or Waterhorse), so next time I go to this movie I want to sit among a sophisticated intelligent audience that will appreciate and enjoy a great story as well as wonderful music, directing and acting. Yes it was bloody but campy and exaggerated like Kill Bill. My daughter and I just closed our eyes whenever we knew something scary was coming, as I did the first time I saw Jaws in a theatre a million years ago.<br/><br/>My question for the day: why do people treat movie theatres (and restaurants) like they are in their own homes. Hey rude selfish obnoxious people! Just stay home! I am paying to see, hear and enjoy the movie! Why do you pay money to NOT watch the movie but to just talk to each other or be on the phone? You parents are responsible for not teaching your children how to act appropriately in public and you are doing them a great disservice. And yes this inappropriate moronic behavior happens in other places besides Tinseltown, Jackson, Mississippi.<br/><br/>Happy New Year!"
"moviegeek310","10","4","7","28 December 2007"," Brilliant and Twisted
","What a messed up, yet brilliant movie ""Sweeney Todd"" is, Oscar-worthy also comes to mind. Though because of the extremely dark subject matter, it might not do as well. Based on a play by Stephen Sondheim it's about a barber played by Johnny Depp is living the good life until evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) wrongfully throws Sweeney into prison and takes his wife and child for his own. When Sweeney gets out, revenge is the only thing on his mind, so he opens a barber shop but instead of shaving faces, he slits throats in preparation for when the Judge sits in his chair. But what does he do with the bodies you may ask? He lets his tenant Mrs. Lovett, owner of the worst pie shop in London; make the bodies in pies, which sell like wildfire. <br/><br/>So as you can see, this is a truly messed up movie, even more so because it's a musical, and a comedy. You may think it sounds disgusting, it is, but not as bad as one would think since everything is over the top and done lightly. The genius who is Tim Burton puts his signature Gothic stamp on the film and makes 1800s London look like a bleak, almost black and white city. If it gets no other Oscars it should get Best Art Direction and Best Director for Burton who is long overdue. And oh-my, the actors, almost all of them are superb. And yes, Depp can sing. It's about time he gets an Oscar as well, especially for making us care for a mad, crazy, slightly demonic barber. Now that's tough. Alan Rickman is brilliantly creepy and evil as the horrible judge. Sacha Baron Cohen as Sweeney's rival Signor Pirelli is hilarious. The one weak point of the film is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. Her acting chops are great as always, but her singing is on the weak side. And one wonders whether Burton cast her simply because she's his wife. Otherwise ""Sweeney Todd"" is an engrossing, Gothic, twisted, fun, and just plain weird movie, much like Burton's other films. Though this is my favorite, second only to his masterpiece, ""Big Fish"". I highly recommend this, but the easily queasy should definitely not see this, in fact, stay far away. Fans of musicals, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, or weird movies will be enthralled and delighted by ""Sweeney""."
"bckesler","10","4","7","24 December 2007"," Burton creates Masterpiece from Sondheim's Classic
","It's impossible for me to fathom somebody not liking Sweeney Todd, although I know there will be plenty who can't appreciate pure genius. Listen to this idea for a movie: Sweeney Todd is a man set on avenging his wife and daughter by killing Judge Turpin. Along the way, he slits people's throats and his neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, grinds the bodies up and bakes them in her popular meat pies. It's a horror movie, but it also has a dark comedic edge to it with a fair bit of romance, drama, suspense, and with about it. Oh, and it's a musical.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is done in the style of old 1930s monster movies. The color is mostly drained from the film, leaving it looking like a black and white, which is perfect! The only color that does pop up is bright red. The movie feels like a classic, with bits of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and 'The Avengers' added in, the story truly becomes gripping and the characters more complex. I've often criticized Tim Burton for lack of character development. With this film, Burton shows that he truly can dive into a character. I haven't seen characters this intrigueing in a long time.<br/><br/>The plotting and pacing is ingenious, the acting is superb. Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as always, but Helena Bonham Carter truly outdoes herself. She plays a woman desperately in love with a psychopath. She knows that he could endanger her life, yet she follows him blindly. Tragically, she chooses him, who doesn't love her, over somebody with true genuine love and protectiveness over her. Alan Rickman is remarkably cunning as Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall, engaging as always as The Beadle. Sacha Baron Cohen makes a great turn as Pirelli, a rival barber, and the two newcomers, Jamie Cambell Bower as Anthony, and Jayne Weisner as Johanna are romantic and thrilling. Laura Michelle Kelly also give a terrific performance.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's best film. There's not one loose screw here. The ending is tragic, and rightly so. Sweeney will not be what some people expected, but for many it will be a thrillingly new experience that will forever touch them emotionally. Sweeney Todd is the best film of 2007."
"EUyeshima","8","4","7","23 December 2007"," Powerful Combination of Sondheim and Burton Makes the Demon Barber Come to Bloody Life
","It's been nearly thirty years since a Stephen Sondheim musical has been translated from Broadway to the big screen (the last time was 1978's dismal ""A Little Night Music"" starring Elizabeth Taylor), and judging from the previews of this dark 2007 musical, the producers don't seem very anxious to publicize the fact that most of this film is sung in verse. That's too bad because it's really Sondheim's evocative and powerfully haunting music that drives and ironically humanizes the chilling storyline. It also helps to have director Tim Burton's visionary talent guiding this audacious venture since the horrific and heartrending subject matter ideally suits his idiosyncratic film-making style. I was fortunate enough to see the original 1979 Broadway production with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury, and screenwriter John Logan does an admirable job of streamlining the original musical to the core story of Sweeney's relentless vengeance.<br/><br/>Sondheim-loving purists may balk at the fact that certain characters are gone in the screen version, as well as several songs with some of the remaining score switched around from one character's voice to another to serve distinctly different purposes in the story. It's also true that Burton does not hold back on what is an uncompromising gore-fest, but luckily, he doesn't dwell on the barber's bloody acts. Instead, he fixates on establishing the moody, nearly colorless atmosphere of nineteenth-century London and how the key characters become entrenched in the pervasive grayness of an urban purgatory from which no one can escape. All the production values on display are top-notch with stellar work from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (all three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films), production designer Dante Ferretti (""Gangs of New York"") and costume designer Colleen Atwood (""Memoirs of a Geisha""). The technical virtues of this production are undeniable even if it does become somewhat wearing to experience the constant dankness.<br/><br/>Burton did not venture far in casting the leads since his frequent leading man Johnny Depp plays the title role and the director's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter is the smitten Mrs. Lovett. Both make their roles work within the contours of their recognizable screen personas. Depp lends his almost feline-like brand of menace to a role more often played by more robust, operatic-style actor-singers a decade or so older, while Carter eschews Lansbury's comically buffoonish performance for a more sinewy, cynical approach. Their singing may lack range and nuance, prerequisites for mastering Sondheim's complex lyrics, but they perform with vigor and certainly within character. Alan Rickman is his usual villainous self as Judge Turpin, whose act of jealousy provides the impetus for the blood-soaked plot; and in genuine callow fashion, Jamie Campbell Bower plays the aptly named sailor, Anthony Hope, the devoted suitor of Johanna, Sweeney's long-lost daughter now Turpin's ward. Orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the soundtrack does not suffer for the marginality of the star voices, as he brings the full potency and epic grandeur of Sondheim's music to the fore.<br/><br/>Several of the musical numbers are quite effective. There is ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"", which introduces Sweeney's preening competitor, Adolfo Pirelli (a nice bravura turn by Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen), at a medicine sideshow accompanied by a gin-loving orphan named Toby (affectingly played by Ed Sanders), who becomes intractably involved with Sweeney's and Mrs. Lovett's affairs. Bower sings the ballad, ""Johanna"", with proper yearning as the purity of his intentions is contrasted sharply with Sweeney's murderous deeds. Depp gets his moment in the sun with ""Epiphany"", in which he spells out the inevitably tragic fate of London under his switchblade, and he duets with a tentative Rickman on the haunting ""Pretty Women"". My favorite ballad from the show, ""Not While I'm Around"", has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing ""The Worst Pies in London"", the deceptively coy ""A Little Priest"", and the sunny ""By the Sea"", which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color. But above all else, this film is a triumph of Sondheim's musical genius and Burton's craftsmanship."

The songs were terrible both in writing and in performance. I often could not even understand what was being said. Johnny Depp was poorly cast as Sweeney Todd...can you say overrated.

","I have to admit that as a true fan of Sweeney Todd and Johnny Depp, I was excited to know there would be a movie that would combine the best of everything. I also admit that I was already prepared to enjoy the movie despite what critics were already saying about it. I am very pleased to say that IMHO, this is possibly the best Depp-Burton collaboration ever. I would have enjoyed it even if JD was not in it. Johhny Depp CAN sing. He is wonderful, beautiful and so terribly tragic all at the same time. Helena Bonham-Carter is amazing. They might not be the classic Sweeney-Lovett pairing, but they have made these roles their own. The entire cast is a dream. Sacha Baron Cohen proves how multi-faceted an actor he is, Alan Rickman is superb and Ed Sanders is so totally fantastic that those who have seen this movie will want to see more of his amazing talent. Timothy Spall, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener & Laura Michelle Kelly are also terrific to watch. The film is lush and beautifully Tim Burton.

"cchase","9","5","10","23 December 2007"," At Last - The Razor Swings Wide...And So Does The Musical!
","First of all, a note to the ""Sweeney"" purists among us, of which I thought I was one. A movie is NOT a Broadway musical and vice versa, so if you are coming to Tim Burton's rendering of SWEENEY TODD expecting to see a slavish recreation of the live theater version, go buy the DVD of the George Hearn/Angela Lansbury revival from the Eighties and stick to it. You'll be much happier than you will be with this version.<br/><br/>Having said that, now let us ""attend the tale."" I came away from seeing this a lot happier than I thought I would, and here's why: no one else could have or should have done this film except for Tim Burton. With his proclivity for all things Gothic and macabre, the material is a perfect fit, and he doesn't waste one iota of the opportunity. I can already see that this has a firm lock on many technical Oscar awards, because everything from Dante Ferretti's production design to Colleen Atwood's costumes are darkly scrumptious. The grit, grime and grue of Victorian Era London only hinted at in musical pieces like OLIVER! (and barely mentioned in MARY POPPINS) gets the 'full monty' here. These are the same streets that would also give birth to Jack The Ripper...<br/><br/>Employing the talents of musical director/conductor Paul Gemignani and arranger Jonathan Tunick from the original show is probably the second best move from Burton and the producers, because the orchestrations are as lush to the ears as the visuals are to the eyes. Another musical may be made that looks and sounds this good translated to the screen, but it won't be this year, and probably not in the next one, either.<br/><br/>Now for the songs: at least a good third of the tunes are missing, and many will lament the absence of ""The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd"", although the theme is played over the stunning main title sequence. All of the ensemble pieces have been excised and many of the core songs have been shortened, but it's all for a very good, logical reason. These tunes set the stage, the tone and drive the narrative, drawing the kind of pictures the audience in live theater would need to be transported to this time and place with these characters. With movie-making this meticulously good, this is unnecessary. You can almost smell the mud and slime on the cobblestones, hear the racket coming from the many pubs and peer into the dark back alleyways...the time and place are more than firmly established. Unlike the stage version, it's all about the characters and here we get to know them more intimately than ever before. <br/><br/>The vocal performances don't need to be as bombastic as they are in previous versions...When you're dealing with a ten-foot wide screen, there's no need to project back into the ""cheap seats."" So, with that in mind, who comes off best and who doesn't?<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as would be expected, leads the way as Sweeney. He sings in a register much higher than the part calls for, but he acts the living hell out of the part, so this is a minor quibble. His is a Sweeney who wears the ravages of injustice and betrayal like an overcoat, one that is only discarded once his ""friends"" are finally in his hands. He's said that he will never do a singing role again. More's the pity, but even if he doesn't, he can consider this turn as one of the best of his career, if not THE best.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett is good enough to hold up in this production, but it seems as if all the loopy, twisted, sanguine JOY has been sucked out of the role. Mrs. Lovett is the love-starved, amoral and more-than-slightly bent comic relief, and it's a pity that Carter couldn't access that more. I was much more concerned with that than her singing ability or lack thereof.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen knew EXACTLY what to do with Adolfo Pirelli, and hits his comical and sinister turn dead on. If everything else about this movie had been dreadful, he would've made it all worth it just by himself.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are my new heroes. Spall is every bit as foppishly, fawningly nasty as Beadle Bamford should be. And I expected no less than perfection in villainy from Rickman, who's re-written the book on it in the past two or three decades. But SINGING? I wasn't expecting that, and what a wonderful surprise it was. <br/><br/>Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener as Anthony and Johanna, respectively, are refreshingly winsome in their roles - innocents just trying not to get devoured by darkness. It's a pity that most of their meatier numbers are cut, but here it makes sense. They are nothing more than convenient cogs in Sweeney's malevolent machine of vengeance, and as such are required to do little more than serve their purpose. <br/><br/>One of the main performers that will have tongues wagging is Ed Sanders as Tobias Ragg. A stunning combination of both Mark Lester's and Jack Wild's characters in the movie version of OLIVER!, he is age-appropriate, but hardened, seasoned and wise beyond his years, like many of the real children described in the writings of Dickens, and the unfiltered account of Oliver Twist softened by the Broadway version. His delivery of ""Not While I'm Around"" may be one of the most poignant yet, and the dramatic arc of his character feels exactly right up to the shocking, bitter end.<br/><br/>I hereby pronounce multiple viewings of SWEENEY TODD as essential, if only for myself, because I know there's a lot I missed the first time, as I'm sure Tim Burton planned. And I won't mind uncovering even more of the details and dark pleasures of this bracing reinterpretation of Sondheim's career-defining work."

","Another subtle gem from Tim Burton - he completely misses the point of the stage play in order to hit viewers over the head with ""I'M TIM BURTON! THIS IS SWEENEY TODD! I'M TIM BURTON!"" Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are flat out boring in the main roles, and neither understands the nuances that make Sweeney Todd and Ms. Lovett work. Sacha Baron Cohen, for all of the 5 minutes he is on screen, brightens up the movie, while Alan Rickman bogs it down with one of the worst singing performances since Ashlee Simpson's SNL snafu.<br/><br/>This isn't London that the movie takes place in, it's Tim Burton Presents A Gray Town populated by Citizens With Poorly Affected Accents. There are zoom-cuts that happen for no reason (and never again!), strange tangents into pointless areas (the entirety of By The Sea does not work WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY BY THE SEA) and the ""symbolism?"" Haaahahahahaha! The last shot is the only worthwhile shot in the entire film, so of course Burton lingers on it far too long so that HEY! LOOK! LOOK WHAT I MADE! I'M TIM BURTON!!!!<br/><br/>As far as the score goes, Stephen Sondheim's excellent lyrics are washed away in a sea of organs and strings that are much too loud. In fact, before the movie even started, at the Dreamworks logo, I mentioned to my friend that the music was already too loud. Sadly, it only gets louder, and drowns out the singing. For the most part (Depp, HB Carter, Alan ""I was my singing voice in mud"" Rickman) I was OK with that, but when the sorrowful strains of ""Johanna"" tell you to be sad more than what Antony is singing... ugh.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money. If you want to talk Oscar contenders, go see No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood - actual films.

","In a shark's feasting frenzy, instincts take over and attack becomes more intense, their prey swiftly turns to a cloud of blood. During this carnal mêlée, the shark is so consumed with death that nothing will draw its attention away from the attack. It continues to kill until the killing is over. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a frenzy of brutal murder fueled by the revenge of a man destined to destroy the lives of those who broke his family into pieces. It is a London-based bloody musical, true to Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical-theater production, with elements of deception, destruction, bloody throat-slashing and cannibalism that left me thinking, ""Sometimes, death wins."" <br/><br/>Benjamin Parker (Johnny Depp), once a happily married man with a beautiful loving wife and gorgeous baby girl, was stolen away from his family destine to live the rest of his days in prison, all so Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could assume his place in the once blissful family. Returning 15 years later under the assumed name Sweeney Todd, Depp seeks his revenge upon Turpin, destroying everything in his path, liked to Quentin Tarantino's main character in Kill Bill who sets out on a mission of cold hearted, bloody revenge and doesn't stop until the blood does. Unbeknownst to Todd, his accomplice Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) is the most deceptive person of them all. As the rage for revenge grows, so does the body count, as Todd becomes increasingly consumed with his passionate hatred for the liars and sinners of London.<br/><br/>Burton's use of high-key lighting and vibrant colors filled the screen during flashbacks of time spent with Benjamin's family, to emphasize happy times and a sense of blissful peace  only for the film to transform into dramatically low-key lighting, setting the stage for the death and destruction Sweeney Todd wreaks upon the city.<br/><br/>The roles of Sweeney Todd and Nellie Lovett could not have been so magnificently executed by any other actors. Although they are not trained singers, the two pull it off with uncanny ability. Depp and Carter have a history of portraying dark vengeful, mysterious characters in such films as Pirates of the Caribbean, Edward Scissors Hands and Fight Club, to name a few. In Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Todd and Lovett compliment each other in personality and appearance with their hatred for humanity and desire to condemn those who clutter London with lies and deceit. Todd and Lovett's appearances emphasize the dark, vengeful tone of the film with their pail skin, heavily contrasted by dark eye makeup  emphasizing the hatred in their eyes toward London  massive, curly, black hair  emphasizing their incomprehensible state of mind  and drab clothing  Lovett wearing hints of scarlet, foreshadowing the deepest evils within her.<br/><br/>Their presences sent chills up my back, with the look of vengeance in their eyes and shown on their saddened faces. Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's award-winning musical thriller, Burton's directing style of humorous brutality makes this a masterpiece of revenge any Tim Burton fan will admire  especially those with a gory appetite in films."
"BaronBl00d","8","3","5","13 January 2008"," Overall Satisfying Though Not Quite Full
","I love the Sondheim musical and the performances of the great Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou, George Hearn, and company. The music was breathtaking and every note had a purpose - not such the case in virtually every musical before and since. Tim Burton took on quite a task of bringing the three-hour epic musical to the screen. It was with trepidation and enthusiasm that I went and was overall pleased yet not quite satisfied. On the plus side I have always admired Burton and his vision in film. It is about as pure as it can get for this medium. He tackles what interests him for the most part just as his popular star Johnny Depp does as well. Depp always gives a good performance and here is no different. He even sings much better than I thought. The film is gorgeous with lush colour dripping in every scene, attentive detail given to set design and costume, and some wonderful lighting. Burton's London is almost surreal and yet breathtaking all the time. The blood flows generously - as it would in this film. Burton is not shy in showing the dark side of life. The performances are all pretty good. Depp was better than expected and manages to embody the skulking silence of Todd torn by thoughts of revenge and personal tragedy very nicely. Helena Bonham Carter looks th part of Mrs. Lovett(except for the plunging neckline I cannot quite remember seeing Miss Lansbury proffer) though the singing aspect of the role is quite honestly a bit much for her abilities; nonetheless, she is acceptable. Alan Rickman makes a formidable judge(though he cannot sing a lick), Timothy Spall makes a convincing Beadle(not asked to sing for the most part), and Sacha Baron Cohen really shines in a scene-stealing role as Pirelli. The rest of the major roles, Johanna, Tobias, and Anthony, are all played by newcomers who all out-perform the stars in terms of real singing talent however. It is important to remember that Sweeney Todd is 80% or more sung not spoken. The lack of singing ability from the stars does have to detract somewhat from the film especially for a fan of the original Broadway hit. But Burton's direction and the cast rise above these small problems and create a film that is highly enjoyable and entertaining. For me the biggest problem wasn't the lack of singing talent but the material that was cut from the original play. Whether for budgetary or time constraints or both, Burton shaved about an hour off the original musical composition: whole songs(at least four that I could count), bastardized lyrics(some songs edited heavily), and a frame story of storytellers telling us to attend the tale of Sweeney Todd MIA. I wish that Burton could have included these in the film and missed them sorely. But for the individual that is not familiar with the original at all or only briefly, this won't even be a minor consideration. So all in all I really enjoyed this production just wished I had more to taste."

","It is a scene worthy of Charles Dickens: gray buildings, gray skies and gray-faced people, living and dead.

"DonFishies","9","3","5","7 January 2008"," A gothically twisted and darkly satisfying musical epic
","In Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Johnny Depp plays the title role of a barber sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, losing his wife and daughter. After fifteen years, he returns to London to seek revenge on the man who helped send him, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). But to lure him in, Todd needs to become a barber again, albeit one who slits throats now too.<br/><br/>It may have been hard at first to imagine the film being true to the Broadway show, but Tim Burton has helped craft a Gothic and darkly satisfying version that is all his own, but still does the original musical justice. Every set piece, every costume and every minute that passes breathes an authentic stench of old 1800's London, only matched by those recreating the work of Charles Dickens (and in many cases, Burton's vision tops those too). The painstakingly detailed art direction is simply marvellous, and even with the film's graphic content, is enough to make just about anyone feel the need to see the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing (stylistically wise) are also very well done, capturing quite a few great angles, and giving the sequences just the right amount of exposure that they need. They also help showcase the grand set pieces rather well. The cast is fairly small (speaking wise anyway), but everyone helps make the film exuberantly capture the murky and lurid feel of Burton was obviously going for, and also help to allow the film to fit neatly in with his twisted visions in his older films like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Batman Returns.<br/><br/>Depp plays Todd brilliantly, leaving behind his over-the-top Jack Sparrow persona and tapping into his decades old emo-style he helped perfect in his previous work with Burton. He is quietly menacing throughout the entire film (and frequently frowning when he is not yelling at the top of his lungs), and his brooding sense of destruction only helps to make this another one to add to Depp's list of best performances. He outshines everyone, musical number or not, and never once does he allow let up in his intensity.<br/><br/>Supporting turns by Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, the baker who works under Todd's barbershop, and Rickman as Tirpin are both very well expressed, and help complement Depp's performance beautifully. Carter has genuine chemistry with Depp, and plays off him very well (even when his character is not giving into any of her advances). Their musical numbers together are probably the best in the entire film. Rickman, while a little underused here, does very well in the scenes he does have and has a great singing voice. His twisted malice is used very well here, and further makes him a shady icon in the film world. Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall do very nice work in their small roles as well, further proving their use as great character actors.<br/><br/>I was really impressed however with the rest of the cast, including Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders. Despite their relative newness to the film scene, all four of them do fantastic in their roles, and work fabulous with the more commonly known actors. Special mention must go out to Sanders' work, who goes above and beyond the needed maturity for the role, and nearly steals every scene that he is in.<br/><br/>Anyone who felt the all too important element of Todd's throat slittings would either be trimmed down or cut out entirely will be very surprised to see quite a few moments here, in all of their bloody glory. While some of the blood may look slightly excessive, Burton has amped it up to truly express the rage Todd is feeling, as well as the sheer violence of it all. I was intrigued and disheartened by how bright red it was at first (and how it resembled the geysers spilt in the likes of Kill Bill: Volume 1), but it slowly grew on me. It just felt right to have it so vividly expressed, and it helps lend a darkly comic touch to more than a few of the throat slittings. What is even more intriguing is how the blood is actually the brightest element in the entire picture, and that says a lot about what Burton was obviously focusing on rather deeply.<br/><br/>What brings the film down from true greatness is how it feels every minute of its near two hour running time. I loved every moment of it, but I think the film really dragged in the middle section, and even near the beginning. There is just no fair balance for the film, and even at its best moments, it still feels like it is kicking its feet and delaying its eventual ending. I realize that quite a few songs were trimmed or completely taken out of the film (whether this is good or bad, I have yet to decide), but the ones that were left in do not make the film feel any brisker. I also did not like how the film did not attempt to correct a few of the woes of the original show. Tirpin's character is still not developed enough. The emotionally bleak finale still feels a touch rushed. Fans of the original show will pick up on these details rather quickly, and while they do not make the film any worse, it just makes it so that the film cannot be any better.<br/><br/>It may be the darkest and most graphic musical ever put to celluloid (at least, until Evil Dead: The Musical graces the big screen), but Sweeney Todd is also very authentic in its capturing, and is packed with great performances and even better musical numbers. It is not perfect, but it is a step in a much better direction than Dreamgirls made last year.<br/><br/>9/10."
"jdkraus","9","3","5","4 January 2008"," Tim's unique vision is brought to life with Logan's script and Depp's performance!
","I've never seen the play so I did not know what to expect from Sweeny Todd. Directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, I had a feeling that it was going to be something out of the ordinary. Now that I have seen the movie, it was unusual and even bizarre; however, I really got a kick out of the two hours.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a simple tale about a man named Barker (Johnny Depp) who is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit, which was plotted by an evil judge (Alan Rickman) who wanted Barber's wife for his own.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Barker returns with the alias Sweeney Todd and seeks vengeance for the man who wronged him with the help of his landlady Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bohman Carter).<br/><br/>The direction by Tim Burton and the script by John Logan deliver a sheer genius movie with vivid characterization and a fresh tale of murder, vengeance, and implications of cannibalism. This is a very dark and gruesome movie; it is definitely not a one for the squeamish. Sweeney at ease slits the throats of his victims and drops the bodies down a trapdoor, leaving them for his accomplice so to get rid of the evidence.<br/><br/>Simultaneously though, I found some of the violence rather comical. The blood squirts and sprays profusely in gallons at a time from the slit throats as if a bottle of red cool aid was cut open. It was overdone in a funny, but a disgusting way like in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Nonetheless, it was bit of the top for me, particularly at the tragic ending.<br/><br/>The set-decoration, costumes, and make up were absolutely exquisite. The cinematography set the dark and grim atmosphere of the tale of vengeance and the music was downright fantastic. It flowed with the film's plot and shaped its tone. Unlike The Sound of Music, which carried the same cheerful and uplifting sound, the music for this film had several different tunes to it. It was haunting, dramatic, suspenseful, and even at times upbeat. I enjoyed all the songs, particularly ""The Worst Pies in London"" and ""Pretty Women"".<br/><br/>Once again, Johnny Depp shines as among one of Hollywood's most influential actors. Honestly, there has not been a role of his that I did not like. But I have to say though that this a bit of a different role for Mr. Depp. From the movies I have seen him in like the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy he plays the guy that is lovable. In this, I liked his character not because he was a hero or funny, but due to how scary he was. The intense and insane look in his eyes as the vengeful Sweeney gives me memories of Jack Nicholson in The Shining. He is brilliant as Sweeney, a guy who no one would want to cross.<br/><br/>However, since this is a musical, Depp reveals that he wouldn't be the next star on American Idol. Rather than singing, he speaks and shouts with the melody. At least he tried though. The other really impressive performance was by Helena Bohman Carter as Mrs. Lovett. Her character is the exact opposite of Depp: likable, very humorous, and has a pleasant singing voice. Alan Rickman was also another nice addition to the movie. He's always played a great villain, and he was definitely a good one in this movie.<br/><br/>I'm highly impressed with this movie. But I give it a 9/10 due to Johnny Depp's lack of singing talent and the over the top violence."

","I waited for this movie for nearly 3 years, and I burst into tears with excitement the first time I saw the trailer. I have shamelessly promoted this movie to anyone who will listen for 2 and 1/2 minutes, and I went to school dressed as Mrs.Lovett for 2 days leading up to the release. When I finally saw Sweeney Todd, I was not let down. This movie is amazing. It is beautiful and dark and perfection at the highest. The songs are beautiful, and sung, while not traditionally, the best I have ever heard them. Johnny Depp is great, but who would expect any less? Helena Bonham Carter was perfect as Mrs.Lovett. This was easily the greatest, goriest movie I have ever seen. Go watch it. Now."

","It is absolutely the greatest musical ever it has love and despair with a little comedy it is all around a very great Tim Burton movie. Johnny Depp plays the role of Sweeney Todd so well. He sings and dances and plays one of the freakiest barbers in the world. The movie starts off kind of slow with the opening song ""No Place Like London."" The movie is also very bloody, in a comedy way. Especially, when he finally goes mad at the end and kills the beggar woman and Judge Turpin. The bloodiest scene in the entire movie. Until he realizes the crazy beggar woman was his wife. Lovett told him she died and he threw Ms. Lovett in the furnace. Of course, Little Toby kills Sweeney and the morale is revenge is great until you make a mistake"

","This, personally, is one of my more favorite Tim Burton movies to come out. Not only does the story line follow the play fairly well but Johnny Depp is a fantastic singer, something that not many people have found out in past movies. Though the blood looks extremely fake, it still gives the effect Mr. Burton was looking for. Although this movie is rated R for gore, blood, and violence there is not much difference between this and an episode of CSI, but I would not recommend it for a child under the age of fourteen. Both Mr. Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter portray their rolls very well. From what I saw it was an amazing movie and I highly recommend it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans."

","Sweeney Todd was so good! I loved it so much. I saw it twice. The acting and music were fantastic! It was pretty gory, but the throat-slittings, as weird as this may sound, had a sort of poetic essence to them. They weren't just random and disgusting like you see in regular slasher movies. They were done while he was singing which made them seem a tad less violent. Also, I really liked how they ended the film. I thought the end scene was beautiful. Sweeney, dead himself, holding his dead wife, the thing that had meant most to him in his life. Sweeney Todd was just so fantastic. It's one of the best films I've ever seen."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","3","5","31 December 2007"," Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...
","Sweeney Todd, the film version of Stephen Sondheim's critically-acclaimed 1978 Broadway play, is perfect in every way imaginable. Tim Burton's best film so far, Sweeney Todd is a movie-musical unlike anything you've ever seen. Its Gothic tone, its dark grays and blacks, its massively creative cinematography, and its beautiful lyrics, songs, and acting are a welcome treat to the amazing year of 2007. Sweeney Todd is directed by Tim Burton and stars Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman, Sasha Baron Cohen, and Timothy Spall.<br/><br/>Years ago, a barber by the name of Benjamin Barker and his lovely wife and their child were torn apart when a wicked judge sent Barker away for life on ""a fool's charge."" Judge Turpin was simply a jealous monster who craved the attention of the beautiful wife. Now, almost fifteen years later, Barker returns to London under the alias Sweeney Todd. It is virtually unknown as to how he escaped, but the audience doesn't need to know: the story is captivating, and the movie relies a lot on your imagination, putting a previously unforeseen amount of faith in the audience. Sweeney returns to his old residence to find it utterly abandoned, apart from a wise and suspicious figure known as Mrs. Lovett, who tells him from the moments she sees him that she has ""the worst pies in London."" The two of them make for an unexpected duo when Todd starts killing off some of his old rivals with the sharp blade of the barber's razor.<br/><br/>The movie is undeniably bloody. That's the first thing that everyone has to know. The blood is over-the-top, though, on purpose. The blood isn't supposed to gross you out, it's supposed to be a character all its own. With all of the dark hues and blacks everywhere, the blood serves as a frightening contrast with Sweeney's spiraling madness. The bright colors are so noticeable that it's no wonder the upbeat number ""By the Sea"" works so well; it shows viewers a world different from this one, where everything is bright and pretty and colorful. Mrs. Lovett has fallen so completely and totally in love with Sweeney that when we finally glimpse what she's thinking, it is beyond beautiful in some strange and twisted way.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this film work so well is the poetic and tragic story that unfolds in front of you. Underneath all of the beautiful lyrics and songs lies a completely enthralling journey into madness. It seems that by the film's end almost every character is driven completely insane. The ending is so perfect in its beauty, but it's definitely a very strange ending.<br/><br/>The acting in Sweeney Todd was absolutely phenomenal. Obviously Johnny Depp was spectacular, and I was particularly surprised by his vocals, which were extremely rough and reminded me of a rock-type voice. His performance as Sweeney Todd was my favorite by him; it was even better than his absolutely groundbreaking performance as Edward Scissorhands. Helena Bonham Carter was the best surprise; her vocals were sugary sweet and amazing, her acting was perfect, and Helena herself is quite stunning. Baron Cohen was hilarious as Pirelli, and it was great fun seeing him in that role. The scene where he sang was laugh-out-loud funny, and his character was quite a monster! Ed Sanders was fantastic as Toby, and he can really carry a note! Alan Rickman was just as deliciously evil as I was expecting him to be. His singing voice sounded exactly like his talking voice, but it worked well enough. Timothy Spall just annoys me; I don't know what it is exactly, but he just really annoys me. When he started to sing, I literally gasped aloud.<br/><br/>While I have never seen the play on Broadway, I think that Sweeney Todd was absolutely incredible. Tim Burton was the perfect director to helm the film, and the cast couldn't have been more perfect. The soundtrack and all of the songs were sensational, and the ending was simply poetic. Sweeney Todd was not just one of the best movies of 2007, but one of the best movies of all time."
"marissas75","8","3","5","30 December 2007"," Excellent stage-to-screen transfer
","I'm a longtime Sondheim and ""Sweeney Todd"" fan, so it's hard for me to briefly sum up my thoughts about this movie version--but, if I had to, I'd just say, it's a success and I truly enjoyed it. Yes, I have some quibbles--but I'd probably have similar quibbles with any stage production; I nitpick because I like this show so much and know it so well.<br/><br/>The musical is based on the nineteenth-century urban legend of vengeful barber Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) who slits his customers' throats, and his accomplice Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who bakes the corpses into meat pies. Tim Burton was obviously attracted to the terrifying Gothic elements of this story (he favors the bloodletting over the cannibalism) but the characters have true passion behind them; they are not just Gothic cartoons.<br/><br/>Depp acts the role of Sweeney Todd very well, getting more intense, more aloof, more inhuman as the movie proceeds. But he sometimes sings in a crooning pop style that proves distracting--too modern. I prefer Mrs. Lovett portrayed as jollier, less haunted than Bonham Carter plays her, but she eventually eases into the role and finds the humor in it. The two have good duets in ""My Friends"" and ""A Little Priest.""<br/><br/>The distinctive supporting roles are all well cast and add texture to the movie. For a sadistic, villainous judge and his unctuous assistant, what current British actors are better than Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall? For the young lovers, I enjoyed seeing a Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who really looked just 16 years old and a teenage Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) to pair with her. It was also great to finally see Toby played by a young boy, the talented Ed Sanders. Usually onstage this role is filled by a grown man who has to act mentally retarded; a real child engages your sympathy more, like something out of a Dickens novel. And Sacha Baron Cohen provides a hilarious cameo as a vainglorious barber who employs Toby.<br/><br/>Tim Burton exercises his usual meticulous control over the look of the film, bleaching out almost all color from the production design so that the gushing red blood shows up better. His Victorian London is its own sooty, industrial, sordid world (though I think he borrows his initial winding-through-the-streets shot from Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge""). The few brightly colored flashback and fantasy sequences, especially Mrs. Lovett's song ""By the Sea,"" are a nice contrast.<br/><br/>People like me may regret the loss of some clever Sondheim songs, but the cuts in the movie version make sense: when you're watching it, it feels like a complete work of art. More importantly, the stage show ""Sweeney Todd"" already had some cinematic aspects to it, and the movie allows them to be realized more fully. In a song like ""Johanna,"" Sweeney sings tenderly of his lost daughter while slitting throats, Anthony wanders the streets searching for his lost love, Mrs. Lovett bakes pies, and a crazed Beggar Woman prophesies doom. The use of intercutting and montage, along with the beautiful and complex song, is the best that movies and musical theater can provide."
"belowzero8","8","3","5","29 December 2007"," Non-Conventional musical wins you over
","I went and saw Sweeny Todd tonight at the movie theater. I am a pretty big fan of musicals, like Grease and various Disney movies. Musicals are generally really cheery and bright. This movie put an interesting twist on the idea of a musical by putting a dark perspective on it. I initially did not want to give it a shot because I did not like the idea of a dark musical. However, it was the only movie I had left to see in theaters so I went. It was surprisingly awesome. The music and lyrics were well written and sung terrifically. The composer did a great job mixing the music to the action in the movie. Also, the plot was well devised, although a bit predictable at the end in my opinion. The colors in the movie are also done interestingly. The contrasting darks and lights are very intriguing. It was all very well put together and a great movie. ""A must see,"" especially if you like musicals and gore."
"ctg0724","8","3","5","29 December 2007"," There's one place I'm never getting a haircut or shave
","Tim Burton loves to take well-known stories and turn them into his own personal freak show. Sometimes, like with Sleepy Hollow, it works. Sometimes, like with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it does not. With this movie, it definitely works.<br/><br/>When I read an article in a newspaper that described Sweeney Todd as a movie with ""oceans of gore,"" I thought I knew what I was in for. By the end of the film, I could not think of a bloodier film. This movie was more violent than Eastern Promises. The shock factor was a huge part of making Sweeney Todd an intense ride.<br/><br/>I am no musical expert, and I know Johnny Depp is not the ideal singer, but he along with everyone else seemed to stay on note, which is enough for me. Some of the songs, like the one by the Hanson-looking boy singing about Joanna dragged on a little too long. Other than that, I liked the music.<br/><br/>Cool style, terrific acting by everyone, funny moments followed by extremely emotional ones, and a basement with a meat grinder and a furnace with a floor of blood pouring into the city sewers. Who could ask for anything more?"
"Britinmiami","10","3","5","27 December 2007"," A different interpretation
","If you go to see this film and you know nothing about Sweeney Todd you are in for a great surprise! If you are a Sondheim fan and know the work well then you will have to leave your mind open to a very different Sweeney than you have been used to.<br/><br/>This is not the film of the stage version and I was glad about that. What would have been the point! However, you have a fresh take on a piece that is very well known and performed regularly both in New York and on the circuit. As the film came out the touring version of the new ""scalled down"" stage show came into Miami.<br/><br/>What you have with this Sweeney is probably what Sondheim had in mind all along. He has repeatedly said that he does not like his work sang as opera and he prefers ""non-trained"" singers in the parts. Remember the wonderful rendition of Send in the Clowns by Glynis Johns! Now she wasn't a great singer, but she made that song. I personally hated Judy Collins"" version...<br/><br/>So here we have a Sweeney played by Johnny Depp who is probably one of the greatest actors around and I think was perfectly cast. Also giving Tim Burton the Directors chair was an intelligent choice. This is a dark film and he is the master.<br/><br/>What helped me to understand the choices of the rest of the cast was to listen to the soundtrack. It puts into perspective the voices and how they work together. Additionally, I think the orchestrations have been ramped up and the music sounds even better then the original.<br/><br/>After seeing the film and listening to the soundtrack a few times I went back and watched the Hearn and Lansbury show. This allowed me to understand why Burton had made some cuts in the film. They were not needed! Yes you miss some of the music, but the medium if film makes some things redundant...<br/><br/>My only problem with the film was the way the story was changed in relation to the beggar women and how Sweeney is not introduced to her at the beginning of the film. For me the crucial scene is always when he is in his shop with his daughter hiding in a case and his wife comes in looking for the Beedle. Right there he has all he hoped for but he cannot see it.<br/><br/>However, I think this is a great movie and will go on to win the awards it deserves! A movie to see over and over again!<br/><br/>P.S. Sweeney Todd is a work that has a life of its own and seems to evolve and continue to show interest. I would recommend you get all the versions you can to see how adaptable it can be which only goes to prove how great Sondheim really is!"
"ChasSaur","8","3","5","26 December 2007"," Review from a 1979 Cast Sweeney Todd Fan: it's worth seeing.
","Okay - my husband and I went to see Sweeney Todd with a friend of ours on Christmas Day (he's going through a bad divorce and wanted to do something ""anti-Christmas"" - I assured him this was it).<br/><br/>I have been listening to the original cast recording for 25+ years, and have seen the video of the George Hearn/Lansbury stage production more than once. To say I came into the movie with some apprehension is an understatement.<br/><br/>My husband and our friend had barely heard of the Sweeney Todd story, let alone the Sondheim Musical. I considered it to be an experiment of sorts - to see who would like it better: the Sweeney Todd devotee or the novices.<br/><br/>Result - we all enjoyed it immensely, though with different eyes.<br/><br/>Both the novices enjoyed the movie immensely, and our friend even noted that it made you want to see the show on stage - and he isn't even a big musical theater fan.<br/><br/>But here's the breakdown from a devotee:<br/><br/>This piece is Sondheim's masterpiece, and the care with which Burton approached it is manifest. The orchestration of the music itself is lush and lovely. No punches were pulled with the dissonant score, with the exception that the factory whistle appears to be absent (or if it was there, it simply wasn't as noticeable - gouts of blood seemed to replace it).<br/><br/>The cinematography, costumes and sets are beautiful. As noted in many reviews, vibrant color has been drained from the film, except for the blood, which pops in huge gouts and waterfalls. (This IS in contrast to the stage show, where stage craft limits that kind of exorbitant display.) London is appropriately grimy and seamy, the ""By the Sea"" has vibrant dream color which makes it stand out as fantasy.<br/><br/>As for the singing. These are not Broadway voices (with the exception of the little boy who plays Toby - his voice is OUTSTANDING). They could not perform these pieces 8 days a week, belting to the back of a house and never missing a note. They are simply not those kind of voices.<br/><br/>However, adequately rehearsed and allowed several takes? Yep, they do the songs justice. I didn't feel that Johnny Depp's ""Epiphany"" quite pulled off savage, vengeful joy, but that's about my only complaint about his performance. The more lyrical and less difficult songs he performed quite admirably.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter does a nice job as Mrs. Lovett - it is obviously inspired by Angela Lansbury's quasi-comic portrayal. She doesn't necessarily have strength of voice, but you can feel Mrs. Lovett's passion for Todd and craftiness without problem.<br/><br/>As for the other members - the young man who plays Antony is serviceable, but this young man looks like he could have been blown over by a strong wind. Antony's role is not overly taxing - you couldn't tell me they couldn't find a more masculine appearing actor that had a voice with more character.<br/><br/>Johanna's role is diminished. The young woman is lovely enough, but ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird"" sounds like it was a stretch for her. It is a difficult song, no doubt - but they should have found someone who could have sung it more effortlessly and worried less about finding a pretty unknown.<br/><br/>The Beggar Woman's role is also diminished, and her eventual impact at the end looks more like a parlor trick than a plot twist. I was also expecting more from Laura Michelle Kelly, to be perfectly honest.<br/><br/>The Judge and Beadle have diminished singing roles as well. However, Timothy Spall is a perfect, nasty, slimy Beadle, and Alan Rickman is a good Judge Turpin. And ""Pretty Women"" - as performed by Rickman and Depp - is admirably done, not one ounce of disappointment.<br/><br/>I was prepared to hate Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, as I'm not a big fan of him. However, he was absolutely great, I can't deny it. He pulled off Pirelli beautifully.<br/><br/>Several numbers were shaved down a bit for time and many were removed - only us maniacs would notice, as the cuts were done judiciously.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism is Burton pulled out all of the ""Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" pieces. The Ballads help move the story along (plot-wise as well as musically), so to have them gone feels like a major loss.

"Chris Knipp","9","3","5","24 December 2007"," A brush dipped in blood and soot
","Here's a great Christmas idea for you: a movie about a man who as revenge against a cruel judge in Victorian London kills dozens of people, whom his wife grinds up and bakes into meat pies that she sells from her shop to a satisfied and unsuspecting public. And you will lose count of how many times you see this hero sit customers down in his barber chair and slit their throats, with the necks opening up and the blood spurting out in bright red fountains in the dim gray room.<br/><br/>That doesn't sound very festive, does it? But this is a sophisticated modern musical, by Stephen Sondheim, adapted to the screen by Tim Burton with the assistance, among others, of his male muse, Johnny Depp, and his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (as Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett, his landlady, then wife, and baker of the pies)not to mention that arch-villain, Alan Rickman (as Judge Turpin, the villainous magistrate) and that facetious bogeyman, Timothy Spall (as Beadle Bamford)with a newly notorious comic scoundrel, Sasha Baron Cohen (as the mountebank Signor Adolfo Pirelli) thrown in for good measure. And they all sing, even though they're not singers by profession (though a couple of the cast members clearly areor so you'd think to hear the lusty boy soprano of Ed Sanders (as the workhouse orphan, Toby).<br/><br/>Burton is an artist of hermetic imaginary worlds. Fortunately. Why there has to be quite so much blood, why there must be so many gleaming silver razors (they themselves key players, featured in the film's publicity) drawn across exposed throats I don't really know, but we grownups are well aware none of it is real. What it has is not the crude horror of some kind of numbingly endless snuff flick, but a unified vision, a world whose look has awesome artistic validity. And it's a vision whose artificiality, thank God, is further underlined by the prevalence of music and by how often the dialog is sung, not spoken. But more than a world of sound, it's a world of image, and if anything makes this a great film it's the fact that nobody west of Prague has ever painted so beautifully on film with a brush so heavily, voluptuously dipped in blood and soot.<br/><br/>The dark, gloomy, overcast, oozing, perfectly hopeless London is the real star of Burton's new film. Everything else is of a piece with it. It's remarkable even how much the faces of Depp and Carter grow out of it, like the face in Edvard Munch's The Scream, and grow out of each other. They have the same cheekbones, the same white pallor and grainy dark raccoon eyes. Without being digitalized or rotoscoped or motion captured, Johnny Depp's face becomes a thing as grainy and drawn-looking as an image by Edward Gory or Charles Addams. But this is a world more fanatical and obsessive than theirs. It's not whimsical; it's driven. It's not spooky; it's horrific. I guess maybe Depp has always had the gift of negative capability, of being the more impressive for being not quite there, as much in the William Blake of Dead Man as in Edward Scissorhands. One of his gifts is that he's so powerfully present and conscious in every frame, and yet at one remove. His character is not a personality but a creature possessed by one object: annihilation, of others, and chiefly of his arch-enemy, and then of himself.<br/><br/>Burton's achievement is that his work has never seemed less fussy. He has always been a master of detail, but it all fits into the whole here, as if everything happened inside a dark boxexcept for the wonderful short looks outside at the long vistas of narrow streets and the dark skies. (And it is said that the movie otherwise ""opens up"" the musicalwith the insane asylum scene, for instance.) Anyway, what makes this a great movie is its focus, and its utter lack of distraction. And when the camera moves back a long way, those are the best, the most surprising, moments, freezing the scene into a painting. The final shot of Sweeney has been justifiably called a Pietà. Those are self-conscious tableaux, but the movement is swift, the editing is sure.<br/><br/>This is a Victorian costume show--a horrible permutation of the Dickensian vision of the workhouse, the orphan, the perversion of justice, the greed of the powerful, the dominance of the wicked man, the long suffering of the weak, the reversal of fortune. I'm not clear why Sondheim is reckoned such a superior writer of musicals, so original. Is this original, or just a logical extreme? Isn't every ugly thing turned into a musical now; haven't musicals been dark from The Threepenny Opera to Les Miz and beyond? Sondheim's lyrics sometimes seem prosy and repetitious, his tunes lightweight. Is it a sign of sophistication that Sondheim's tunes aren't catchyor just a sign that he hasn't the gift of writing catchy tunes? None of that finally matters though, because whatever failings Sondheim may have as a pure maker of musicals all the better enable Tim Burton to make Sweeney Todd his own: Sondheim's music does not overwhelm his film but simply blends into it.<br/><br/>There isn't much more to say. Why do I like this? I don't. It's horrific. Like another of the year's best American films that's also ugly and violentNo Country for Old Menit's just wonderfully crafted. Cocteau said Art produces ugly things which most of the time become beautiful; fashion produces beautiful things that most of the time become ugly. Which is Burton's Sweeney Todd? Perhaps a work of art; and so even its horror in our topsy-turvy world may become beautiful."

Based off the 1979 Broadway musical, Depp plays a man named Benjamin Barker, who was removed from his family and taken away to prison for a crime he didn't comment. 15 years later, he returns as Sweeney Todd; the demon barber of Fleet Street. When he comes back to London, he encounters Mrs. Lovett played by Tim Burton's wife Helena Boham Carter and slits out the throats of innocent men who come to his shop for a shave so he can get the revenge he wants truly badly on the judge who ruined his life.<br/><br/>I won't spoiled the rest of the movie for you, not even the ending, but I will tell you this...Sweeney Todd is one hell of a serious good movie, and it's got a little bit of humor of it. But the best part about the movie is it's a musical. I'm a fan of musical movies but I strongly dislike horror films, but this one was more than I expected. Johnny and Helena's singing was truly remarkable and the fake blood they use in the movie was outstanding, you can't tell whether or not it look real. To me, it took too bright to ever look like blood. You'll be stunning amazed once you watch the movie. If you're a fan of Johnny Depp, Tim Burton or just like musicals or horror movies, this one is for you.<br/><br/>The movie is nominated for best actor, best director and best actress. Johnny Depp totally deserves to take home the Oscar!"
"bradtjl","9","3","5","22 December 2007"," Shakespearean Tragedy *big Spoilers*
","I went to this movie thinking I knew what to expect, but I was wrong. This is an amazing film, but what really surprised me was how much it is like a Shakespearean tragedy. You have your two main tragic characters: Mr. Todd (Johnny Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). They both have the same characteristics of Shakespeare's tragic characters. In the case of Sweeney Todd, he becomes so bent on revenge that nothing else matters to him. He doesn't even acknowledge Mrs. Lovett's infatuation with him. Mrs. Lovett, on the other hand is so in love with Todd she would do anything for him, including lying to the small boy, Toby, who is staying with her and considers her his new mom. This lie is one of the many small, tragic mistakes that are made throughout the movie leading up to the very tragic ending in which Todd mistakes his wife, Lucy (who Mrs. Lovett said was dead because of she is in love with Todd). Lucy was a crazy beggar woman on the streets because the poison she took to kill herself didn't kill her and actually mad her insane. He kills her when she becomes suspicious of what is going on at the barber and pie shops. He then finds out it was the crazy beggar woman who was his wife and gets fuming mad with Mrs. Lovett and throws her in the giant oven in which she makes her meat pies. Toby then sneaks up behind Todd and kills him while he is morning over his wife's body. I know that is a lot to think about which also makes it like a Shakespearean tragedy because in his tragedies there is so much messed up stuff going on and it is all leading up to the very tragic endings. The acting and singing is done very well by Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter and even Ed Sanders who plays Toby. Tim Burton does an excellent job once again with this film. I really hope to see him. Depp, and Bohnam Carter team up once again for another great film. So, if you enjoy Shakespearean tragedies and/or any of Tim Burton's films or even if you don't still give Sweeney Todd a chance. It's worth the risk."

","I actually can't remember the last time I saw a musical; skipped Dream Girls, passed up Moulin Rouge, but this SWEENEY TODD: DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET seemed to hit a certain chord with me: the vocal cords! And they were slashed all movie long! Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's horror/musical that looks as good as it sounds, with dark humor abound and open neck wounds wherever one looks. Sounds good? It is.<br/><br/>I've never seen the play, and only knew slightly of its story, but the characters involved, all flawed and charismatic, do a great job singing and acting. The music is excellent even though Danny Elfman wasn't to be found, and Burton's directing style seems to really shine with his version of a barber whose lost it all.<br/><br/>There were a couple things that bothered me: one being an ending that despite all its bloody grandeur seemed to lose sight of a couple characters, and some occasional predictable situations.<br/><br/>But never mind such frivolous drawbacks, this film is just great entertainment.

"stephanie-simoes","3","7","17","25 December 2007"," Very underwhelming and lacking a climax
","Though moderately entertaining, Sweeney Todd fell far short of all the critical acclaim it has been receiving.<br/><br/>First of all, I should say that although I am a fan of musicals (Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Dreamgirls, Harispray are 4 of my favorite movies) however, I was completely unaware that Sweeney Todd was a musical until a friend told me. So basically, I went in with no expectations other that the expectation to be entertained, and honestly, I was not.<br/><br/>I looked at my watch a number of times throughout the movie to attempt to figure out about how much longer I would be sitting there. Though I did not feel the urge to leave, I was definitely looking forward to the end of the movie--to a climax and a resolution.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie delivered neither of these. Any kind of story revolves around the plot and the build up to the climax and the resolution. Unfortunately the ""climax"" of the movie, if you so choose to call it that, has the same energy level, volume, and power and the remainder of the movie and it falls WAY WAY flat.<br/><br/>And although I generally like Johnny Depp in most of his roles, he was horribly cast in this movie. One of the things I most remember about movies like Chicago and Dreamgirls and Moulin Rouge was being amazed at the powerhouse voices of big stars who had been plain old actors for the majority of their careers.<br/><br/>Basically, they should have either completely eliminated all the music from Sweeney Todd and made it into a regular movie, which would have made it a masterpiece if the same actors had been chosen, or alternately, cast little known actors who CAN sing (like Johanna for example)and give us the musical climax we so badly desire when watching a musical or any movie."
"middleburg","3","4","8","5 April 2008"," Ruining a Broadway masterpiece
","Reasons this film is such a heartbreaking disappointment to those of us who consider Sondheim's musical one of the great triumphs of the Broadway stage: 1.The missing song: Can you imagine Oklahoma without ""O What a Beautiful Morning"", or ""The King and I"" without ""Shall We Dance?"" or South Pacific without ""Bali Hai""? By eliminating the Ballad of Sweeney Todd which was a riveting opening number possessing both understated energy, going from the depths of ominous repetitive rhythms to the High penetrating falsettos of the tenors was a terrible miscalculation. Replacing it with just the opening introductory vamp is pointless. I noticed in the comments that so many people who did not know the show complained about the music. The genius of Sondheim's score is that it had a combination of clever songs, heart wrenching songs, lyrical passages - and a memorable, rhythmic driving song--the Ballad of Sweeney Todd -- which appears throughout the show -- at the beginning, the ending and several key spots in between. Without it, you've robbed the audience of a memorable tune -- and you've robbed them of rhythmic drive. No wonder their are complaints about the music! It's missing a key and crucial ingredient. 2. The casting. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are terrific actors - but not in this film. Oh how we miss the over-the-top outrageousness of Angela Landsbury's Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn's manic, desperate Sweeney Todd, and the more recent inspired interpretations by performers like the powerhouse Patti Lupone. Instead we get sour, dour often understated characters filled with pure bitterness and hatred -- robbing them of their humanity. On the stage, believe it or not, we could even identify with the characters. Here we could care less about them. 3. Where's the humor? By focusing only on the dark aspects of the show, there is no fun. The few more-light hearted moments are non-existent. The attempts at movie humor (the roaches in the ""worst Pies in London "" scene, the comic turn of Pirelli's crooked Italian barber, marred in the film by his so obviously beating and abusing Toby, makes the audience just feel uncomfortable. In ""Have a little Priest"" both Depp and Carter hardly ever crack a smile - they just sing with bitter irony and almost no facial expressions. 4. Speaking about Toby, another huge miscalculation was making his character a child. In the Broadway show -- he is at the very least a teenager -- even in his 20s. With Toby now a youngster -- his story line becomes pathetic. In the original he was a perfect foil for Mrs. Lovett's and Sweeney Todd's gruesome antics. His revenge is satisfying on the stage. In the movie it is macabre. 5. The singing. Helena Bonham Carter's singing is so weak -- and has such poor diction, she sounds like a little girl without any vocal training. Johnny Depp's pop singing sound (""I will have vennnnnnnnngeance"") is such a letdown after having heard some powerful operatically trained voices singing the role. 6. The violence. In the recent version of the Broadway Show with Lupone and company playing instruments in addition to acting (creating its own wonderfully imaginative, circus- like atmosphere)-there was no blood -- just red clothes And yet, when the violent actions of Sweeney Todd were shown on stage either realistically or symbolically, they were shocking - jolting. In the movie, the buckets of blood are not shocking -- we get immune to it. So the whole impact of a musical based on such macabre material is muted.<br/><br/>Having said all of this -- one should note that the set decoration -- the scenes of a spectacularly grimy blue-gray London covered in soot and smoke and existing in nightmares is just fine. It's just too bad that such disservice was paid to the spirit of the musical -- what was remarkable, fresh, riveting and memorable is all lost. How sad!!"
"servoskull","4","4","8","26 February 2008"," Sacha Baron Cohen stole the show!
","Yep, Sacha Baron Cohen's performance was the sole highlight of an otherwise over-hyped musical that failed to deliver on so many levels.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Todd was just a mash of characters he's previously played. There was strong essence of Captain Jack Sparrow and Edward Scissorhands in his portrayal. Also, after their initial introductions, Timothy Spall's, Alan Rickman's and Jayne Wisener's characters were sorely under-used. Far too much focus on Depp and Bonham Carter and yet nothing really bonded or deepened their characters.<br/><br/>Suspenseful, intense scenes involving gore and violence were virtually non-existent. I barely batted an eyelid as Todd took his razors to the throats of his victims. London, as a backdrop, was wasted. Fleet Street felt more like a very small cul-de-sac. Surprisingly for a Tim Burton film, the surroundings didn't feel all that dark and dreary.<br/><br/>Finally, as much as I didn't want it to be, the ending was very predictable and therefore a real let down when it arrived. The movie could have been better executed, but in the end the theatrical cut was dull."
"nessa_tulcakelume","4","4","8","10 February 2008"," Highly unpleasant experience
","I like musicals. I really do. Lots of the films out there can be easily classified under that genre and I've had my fair share of being obsessed with Evita, The Nightmare before Christmas and The Phantom of the Opera for instance. But Sweeney Todd didn't cut it for me for several reasons: <br/><br/>1) The Cast cannot sing. They can't and you cannot have a musical with a cast that cannot sing. Opening your mouth to the music does not a singer make. And Johnny Depp is no singer. Period. Which is why this film sucked so hard compared to other successful musicals by Burton such as The Nightmare Before Christmas or even Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>2) None of the characters are likable. None whatsoever. Yes, there's the theme of revenge going on, but Todd / Benjamin Baker did not kill out of necessity. He killed because he could. This is no ordinary fall. At least Macbeth killed, after the initial murder of Duncan, because he wanted to ensure that there would be no one who could incriminate him. Todd killed for economic profits (turning the Rich into meat pies and what not). As such, the element of tragedy is lost. And a protagonist who cannot hold the element of tragedy about him cannot possibly be one that is memorable to the audience.<br/><br/>3) Musical =/= bursting into a song at every possible opportunity. God, it reminded me of Whose Line is it Anyway whereby at the utterance of a decent one-liner, the buzzer is sounded and they'd have to burst out into an impromptu song. Which is comical because it's absurd and out of place - the exact effect that this film brings about.<br/><br/>4) Characters had the depth of a teaspoon. And I don't think I should elaborate.<br/><br/>Argh... and I was really looking forward to watching this too. What a disappointment. Still, for all that it's worth, I think a 4 should be a fair assessment of this disaster - it won't have been a very good movie, but, to me, it fails as a musical."

"dead47548","10","4","8","13 January 2008"," Another Burton masterpiece.
","A Burton work in the truest sense. Sure it's an adaptation but it feels like something he actually created and his direction is flawless. It's filled with everything he brings to his best films; dark, poetic beauty and aesthetically gorgeous but haunting visuals. His style is at an all time high as he perfectly crafts this dreary London and all of the characters within it (the costume design is also some of the best I've ever seen). All of the songs are so phenomenal combining vocal power and intensity with wonderfully unique and fun rhythm, while having sometimes hilarious and always dark lyrics.<br/><br/>The performances all combine to be one of my favorite ensembles of the year. Depp is as good as ever. His raspy voice is perfect for the vengeful, murder-driven mind of Sweeney Todd. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's exhausted voice is the perfect embodiment of Mrs. Lovett's internal anguish while her adorable appearance is so cute. She was absolutely perfect for this role (just as Depp was for Todd) and perfectly captures the love that Lovett has for Sweeney, which makes the ending that much more devastating. The rest of the cast is exceptional. Rickman and Spall have a lot of fun with their characters. Jamie Bower and Laura Kelly bring some of the best vocals I've ever heard. But the real surprise of the film was the young Ed Sanders who creates one of the most sympathetic and warm characters I've seen in quite a while. The power of his voice is truly stunning. Of course Sacha Baron Cohen is also there and Burton took the best approach possible with him. Cohen is funny in the time that he's there, but Burton was wise and gave him the axe (erm, knife) before he was on screen long enough to become unbearably annoying.<br/><br/>Of course behind every film I love, there is a story that I adore. On the surface, basically none of the characters are likable but somehow the story makes Todd and Lovett two of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in quite sometime. It makes their actions perfectly understandable, however absurd and sinful they are. I was behind Todd every step of the way and wanted him to succeed in every aspect of his murderous plot. A phenomenal film in every way that truly lived up to my original expectations."

","I just got back from the midnight showing, and being a HUGE fan of Sweeney Todd prior to seeing the movie, I was prepared to be awed. While I loved it, I felt it was lacking in a couple of areas.<br/><br/>Maybe I am overly-used to seeing the character of Mrs. Lovett played by Angela Lansbury, but I felt Helena Bonham Carter was lacking a bit of the energy and sparkle that I think is necessary in that character. The story, though dark, needs a bit of comedy.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed that there were a few scenes/songs missing. Perhaps I'm being too nit-picky here, but I think there were valuable scenes of Anthony and Johanna left out.<br/><br/>I would like to say, after my criticism, the film was wonderfully directed and photographed. It was a true Tim Burton piece. So, if you love Tim Burton and have a slightly twisted (or very twisted) sense of humor, go, enjoy the film. You will be glad you did."
"FeLiPe-7","6","5","11","21 December 2007"," Ups & Downs: Thoughts on Sweeney
","I decided to give this review a go, since the hype among Sondheim, Depp, and Burton fans alike has been massive. I just came back from an opening weekend screening with friends of mine, and as a professional musician who does musical theatre, I can only tip my hat so far to this cast and crew. At first glance, the visual effect of the movie is quite brilliant and beautiful; Tim Burton delivers splendidly with his adaptation of Sweeney Todd's London, and you truly feel that it really is ""a hole in the world with a big, black pit."" If you watch closely, the film's initial greyscale-like filter gives way to more colorful and edgy lighting and scenery as the plot (and the blood) thickens. Make-up, costume, and hair people on this project are also to be given a sound nod, as the characters are most excellently portrayed visually. Sweeney is as deranged and enigmatic as he's ever been with his dark eyes and wild hair, while Johanna is a mysterious and stunning young beauty.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is fitting of the stellar cast. Johnny Depp most definitely rises to the occasion dramatically, giving you all the facets of the manic, sometimes humorous, and profoundly terrifying character that is Sweeney Todd. Helena Bohnam Carter is a darkly funny and conniving Mrs. Lovett, while Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford (Alan Rickman & Timothy Spall respectively) are the tried-and-true 'evil duo.' You have a surprisingly funny and enjoyable performance from Signor Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen of 'Borat' fame), and the younger members of the cast do quite well. Probably one of the more interesting casting changes was the choice to have Tobias (Toby) played as an actual young boy (Ed Sanders). However, it really works, and you feel for him and his safety throughout the film.<br/><br/>All this being said, the main issue I held with this film was the fact that major elements of the original musical were excluded from the film. Now I can certainly understand making cuts in a stage-to-screen adaptation of a piece such as this, but I feel that there were some things that should not have been left out entirely as they were, namely the chorus and the choral commentary of the story (The Ballad of Sweeney Todd). I don't feel that much time would have been wasted or added by keeping that in. Also, the vocal performance from several actors (Depp, sadly, among them) was less than acceptable. With the knowledge that movies won't always cast the great singing actor, I think that there could have been a lot more work and detail on the singing of this show, as it is crucial to the acting itself, and not just soliloquy or additional material. Finally, I felt that the cuts made to the score were useless, as the film still ran over 2 1/2 hours, and some of the editing really did not make any sense (e.g. the dialogue between singing in ""A Little Priest"" - and the point of cutting that out was???) All in all, I did enjoy myself, but I found myself missing a lot of things that make Sweeney Todd the wonderful musical theatre piece that it is. So if you're an MT enthusiast and are still interested in going? I'd wait for the DVD...and borrow it from a friend."

","I watched Sweeney Todd 10 years ago on the big screen & was blown away by it, now I'm reviewing it having just watched it again on DVD at home. This film is many things - Gothic horror/slasher/musical/melodrama/comedy. It certainly starts off at a fairly leisurely pace in the musical/drama/comedy vein for it's first part, but once Todd begins his bloody work the story becomes very dark indeed, with many bloody & ruthless murders. Gore fans may become impatient for the wait, but on the other hand musical lovers may find the graphic violence too much. 
Great performances all round & fantastic dark, Victorian London sets. This is Depp, Burton & Bonham Carter at their best. My only quibble is that some of the scenes are a little too long, perhaps a slightly shortened running time would have helped. Superb."

","I've always been a fan of Tim Burton, so that was the only reason I saw this movie. But from the moment the song ""No Place Like London"" came on, I was instantly in a trance. The dark theme Burton set for it made it a Victorian goth story, and the love interests and heavy emotion made it a romance as well. Johnny Depp played Sweeney Todd to a T. (try saying that 5 times fast). The songs were amazing as were the voices who sang them. Every time I watch the ending, I want to cry, while others (such as my mom, who watched it with me) wanted to vomit. The only complaints I have is the bad effects of the blood, the could-have-done-better casting of Bonham Carter, and the mediocre acting of Sanders (although his singing made up for it). I still can't put my finger exactly why I love this movie as much as I do, but I can say that it is the best Tim Burton film (directing) yet.

","Upon seeing Sweeney Todd, I had not seen the play, but was informed a little about the story. It sounded a little absurd, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. After leaving the theater I was more than satisfied. The film was great. Although the film was a musical, the music never feels forced or unrealistic and I actually enjoyed some of the songs. The singing was done very well by all actors especially by Depp who claims he has never sang publicly in his life and even more especially by Helena Boham Carter who had some very challenging songs to overcome. Acting was great and a great performance by Depp who shows how easily he can scare you by just glancing at you. The script was well written and all the characters well casted. We even get to see Sacha Baron Cohen who gives a brief but great performance as well. Overall a great film with great songs, acting, script, a great ending, and probably the only musical where you get to see someone get their throat slit. Another great Burton and Depp combination."

","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, is based on the Stephen Sondheim musical from the 1970s. I remember sitting stage right, down front, in the theater when I saw this musical with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou and being completely, utterly blown away. As a stage show, it was jaw-dropping, with some of Sondheim's most beautiful music: ""Johanna"" is perhaps my favorite of all Sondheim's songs, but the score also includes the beautiful ""Not While I'm Around"" and ""Pretty Women."" <br/><br/>Seeing the film is a different experience from seeing the musical. Burton does a marvelous with it, blending the macabre grand guignol with the cartoonish and also with reality, overall giving the movie a really murky atmosphere. ""By the Sea"" was, for me, pure Burton. Depp, Carter, Rickman, Ed Sanders, Jamie Bower, etc., are all excellent, Sacha Baron Cohen does a great turn as Pirelli. Sweeney can be a great singer, as he usually is on stage, but he really doesn't have to be, and Depp and Carter match well. The singers need to be Joanna, Anthony, the judge, and Toby if at all possible. They all sing very well in the film, and the orchestrations are fantastic, ""Johanna"" and ""Pretty Women"" being the highlights.<br/><br/>The ""gore"" looked fake so it wouldn't be too off-putting; it off-put me anyway. More than that, the entire story is sickening - somehow the distance between the audience and the stage makes it more palatable. Plus, the original show has a much lighter touch and, in the character of Mrs. Lovett, a good deal of humor. Burton plays the story much darker. I literally gagged a few times. I would have been better off just listening to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>In the end - not my thing, but this extravagant musical may surely be yours."

","Sweeney Todd is perhaps the best musical in the last 20 years. The direction of the film by Tim Burton is perfect. Burton commands the screen with every aspect possible, with beautiful music and excellent production designs. Johnny Depp gives his best performance to date in my opinion. He excels at showing true anger and lust for revenge perfectly, with only showing few expressions. But I think the most memorable performance is given by the lovely and talented Helena Bonham Carter. She is not a very trained singer, but I thought the way she commands her voice, even though it is not great, her emotions and feelings come through very obviously. Her tones of expressions, her comedic timing, her dark presence, I thought she gives one very amazing performance, one that was greatly ignored at the time of the film's release date. It gets better with each viewing. Alan Rickman does a great job as always, but the more professional singers, who play Johanna and Anthony, are the weakest in the film, but that is not saying much.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly great film. It is filled with amazing designs, great music, perfect acting, and shocking plots and twists. This is a film that has to be seen. Tim Burton's best film in my opinion. A true masterclass"

","I guess blood is appropriated in the movie of betrayal, revenge, and cannibalism among the other things. Benjamen Barker (Johnny Depp in his third Oscar Nominated performance) comes back to London after being falsely imprisoned by the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who wanted him out of the way, so he could steal his wife and daughter. He goes back to his old profession under the name Sweeney Todd as a barber but his purpose of life is to take revenge of the judge. Before he finally gets to the judge, Todd masters the shaving skills on dozens (maybe hundreds) of customers, becoming The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Todd's neighbor and accomplice Mrs. Lovett helps him to get rid of the corpses at the same time improving greatly the taste and quality of her meat pies for sale that soon become the hottest item in London.<br/><br/>Who else but Tim Burton could adapt this material to the screen? As we would expect in his films, he does his usual admirable job with dark Gothic sets and art direction (Oscar winning). Staging, production design, costumes, editing, cinematography are impressive and create gloomy and doomed mood. Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter both did very good job not just acting but also singing in the film. Depp has gotten high praises for his performance and was nominated for many awards but I found Carter's performance most interesting and her character most memorable.<br/><br/>The loyal fans of the original musical praise the songs and the very specific darker than dark sense of humor. While I agree that whatever songs have made it to the movie were melodically interesting enough, hard as I tried it was difficult to find humor in Burton's version. What was easy to find - enormous amount of blood gushing from the screen ""in your face"" in the very realistic manner, preceded by numerous throats slicing. Blood overwhelmed everything and everybody on the screen. Blood is the thing that I remember distinctly. Yes, I got the point. Sweeney Todd was the barber, and his specialty was to give his clients too close of the shave but did Burton really need all that blood? I am sure everyone got the point after the first throat slicing and certainly after the second. After that - all the bloodshed became boring, tedious, and disgusting. I guess, Tim Burton needed it so, he ""could reflect on the horrors he had invented"". I've been always a subscriber to the opinion that ""Implied is so much better than literal"". The scariest monster or the most horrific murder is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see (especially as many times as in the movie), it is not scary anymore, it is laughable, and it loses whatever impact it was supposed to make, at least on this viewer."

","A musical masterpiece draped in gothic splendour and an incredible experience! Based on the theatre musical by Stephen Sondheim, Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is a barber who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 15 years after an evil judge (Alan Rickman) desires to rid of him and pursue his wife. On Todd's release, he seeks revenge with the help of Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) the local pie shop owner whose pies will be made of Todd's victims.... This film holds a very special place in my heart; for a good three years I was obsessed with it from the characters to the songs and the making of (the dvd has great features into the production process from the gorgeous costume design by Coleen Atwood to the perfect prosthetic effects!) It has a very unique style and dark beauty that is hard to capture but it manages to do it perfectly. Depp and Carter are absolutely amazing in the central roles and make for an engaging screen couple. Burton has always said it's in the eyes that performances really shine and if an actor can communicate something strong without talking, that's something really special. This is completely the case here; although it's a musical with grand numbers, there's also its fair share of more somber tunes and the revenge plot is riveting just through the look in Depp's eyes and the way he moves. The supporting cast are all just as important; from Timothy Spall's slimy performance as Beadle Bamford to Sacha Baron Cohen's scene stealing one as Pirelli, Todd's rival in the business. And the gore... wow! Just slasher spectacle at its very best! The first time Todd slits a throat is shocking, disturbing and a great horror moment. His subsequent murders are all equally as splendidly mad. Darkly comic, emotionally devastating and the best horror musical by far, this is a must for fans of both genres"

(R)<br/><br/>Dark but dazzling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical infuses the Grand Guignol with toe-tapping melody, an operatic tragedy with the cold steel of a slasher and the pounding heart of a hopeless romantic. Burton didn't seem a likely candidate to ever helm a snazzy song-and-dancer, but who else but him could bring this deliciously sordid story to life on the big screen? By dropping much of the dancing and group choruses and focusing on intimate musical performances driven by the plot, emotions, and inner thoughts of the characters, Burton does what few movie musicals ever have: near-total immersion in the (heightened) reality of the narrative. Strong production values (set designer Dante Ferretti already knew a thing or two about infernal urban slop of the 19th century with ""Gangs of New York"") and top-notch casting of the leads--not to mention a memorably flamboyant turn from Cohen as a rival barber--make up for the occasional lull and a few too many unvaried throat slittings. In both their performances and the characters they play (equally insipid), Bower and Wisener's would-be-lovers spoil the ghoulishly glorious fun almost every time they show up, but it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to see Depp show more affection for shiny straight razors than for Carter's aroused meat pie vendor downstairs.

"jaredpahl","9","1","1","11 October 2019"," Stephen Sondheim's Gory Opera is Given A Powerful Tim Burton Adaptation
","There are words that pop up all the time when describing Tim Burton and his films: Kooky, Weird, Esoteric, Irreverent. They all fit. The man makes Tim Burton movies, and he's the only one who can. You might be forgiven for thinking that all Tim Burton makes are bizarre, deadpan, mad scientist entertainers. But then, along comes a film like Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The Stephen Sondheim musical adaptation is a shockingly assured effort from the weirdo auteur. Extremely provocative in its violence and maturity, Sweeney Todd is a major achievement by Burton. Paired with truly great material, he makes the first of his films that I can confidently describe as powerful.<br/><br/>After being framed and exiled by the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to Victorian London under the alias of Sweeney Todd to take revenge on the man who stole his wife and child from him. And what sounds like a straightforward revenge plot is then complicated by the arrival of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), the pie shop owner who finds in Sweeney a devious partner in business and pleasure. Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, Sweeney Todd is a story of ever-building darkness, of the gradual blackening of the soul into total despair. Sweeney Todd is one of Sondheim's most well-written musicals, not only in terms of music but of plot and character. There are rich themes and complex characters nestled within what is otherwise a booming musical extravaganza. And while Sondheim's themes are present on stage, they are even more potent in the film. Credit the performances foremostly. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney as a furnace of suppressed anger, distant to Mrs. Lovett, pinpoint-focused on revenge, and bursting with fury when the moment finally comes. Likewise, Bonham-Carter is brilliant in a role she was born to play. She is a delicate psychotic, preening for Todd's love while baking his victims into the Worst Pies in London. There are also professional, understated performances by Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall, and a standout appearance by Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant showman with a darker offstage persona, Pirelli.<br/><br/>With the underscoring of an eloquent story to fall back on, Tim Burton is able to flex his filmmaking muscles. It's something we don't often see from Burton, who prefers to keep within his comfort zone of darkly funny mainstream-adjacent fare. With Sweeney Todd, his is forced to break out, and the result is all but perfection. He pulls Sondheim's lyrics inward. Focusing the camera on the characters, placing them in intimate ""stages"" and letting them sing with natural gravity. When he does break out of the pie shops and barber chairs, Burton sweeps the camera across the monochromatic beauty of Dante Ferritti's coal-black Londonian production design. And when violence comes, Burton handles it with over-the-top glee. Blood sprays in ridiculous fountains, and you can almost see Burton in the background giggling as we shriek in giddy horror. These moments, or the artful framings (of cracked glass or flames) are there to enhance the emotions of the story. They look incredible, but at the same time, they serve a purpose. There is a distinction that Burton rarely makes. With schlocky material to work from, he often only compensates with visuals. It's a very common criticism of Burton's to say he makes films that look great, but don't register on an emotional or intellectual level. Here, with a solid baseline, his visuals work in tandem with everything else, giving the story even more power.<br/><br/>Musically, the film also upstages the stage version. With a cast of untrained singers, the movie takes on a rougher, grittier life. The songs are not belted out, but sung gently and naturally. The approach gives the characters so much more authenticity. They don't turn from characters into singers every time the orchestra picks up. They are characters all the way through, expressing themselves through song in a way that enriches instead of distracting. And still, even with the pared down direction, Sweeney Todd manages to feel just as bombastic and roaring as the stage musical. From the opening explosion of organ music, the orchestral score is thunderously good. At the risk of sounding ignorant, I find the Sweeney Todd film to sound better, in its songs, arrangements, and scoring, than any other stage version I've seen. Almost all the runtime is dedicated to songs, and the way they roll into each other, from No Place Like London into Johanna and Pretty Women into My Friends, is musical genius.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for the success of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street has to go to the original writer, Stephen Sondheim. It's a great story, a modern opera with a brilliant sense for storytelling through music. Sondheim is a certified genius when it comes to making this brand of mature, nourishing musical. And because Sondheim is so good, Tim Burton can relax. Burton doesn't push the material too far into his territory. He massages it, pumps it up with enough visual style to enhance its underlying ideas without detracting from it. Directing this musical would have been a high-wire act for any director, and that is why I find myself so shocked at how well Burton pulls it all off. He shows intelligence and skillful cinematic intuition, realizing that part of the thrill of Sweeney Todd is in its Grand Guignol excess, and part is its deeply felt characters. He plays both elements exactly right, knowing when to hold back and when to let loose. Tim Burton was certainly deserving of a best director Oscar nomination, and the film was clearly one of the five best of 2007. But alas, murderous barber musicals are not really the Academy's cup of tea. I'm sure ol' Timmy likes it that way.<br/><br/>93/100"

","I was still disappointed with the end result of the film adaptation of SWEENEY TODD. Most of the problems lie in the fact that Burton makes an already dark and gory tale even darker and gorier. This is precedence over plot and character detail, even cutting songs from the original show that greatly helped these areas.<br/><br/>In discussing the film with my fellow moviegoer, we agreed that the movie does suffer from having ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" excluded from this version. By including any passerby that the camera zooms by (which in this day of CGI, such editing was inevitable) or lingers on, Burton could have easily made this work, too - what a shame. Some cuts and changes, do better the story, such as the toning down of Johanna by making her less freaky a person and less shrieky a singer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately every plus like the aforementioned instance, is met with more than one minus, such as the way the character of the homeless woman in brought into the movie. By introducing her so late into the story (also by cutting an earlier song of hers), we wonder, why bother at all? She becomes a tacked-on subplot, an afterthought of the screenplay. It's no wonder Johnny Depp looks to feel almost nothing for her at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I am also on the ilk that thinks principle characters should not be shown gruesomely dying in the picture frame, unless it serves a clear purpose (e.g. Janet Leigh in PSYCHO). If not, then it only becomes pure exploitation (and hopefully I've given enough hints as to which character I'm speaking of without totally giving it away). This only becomes more apparent as you watch certain characters die and ask, ""how come they got an explicit death scene and not this character?"" What is the point, indeed..."
"myownventricle","2","1","1","15 May 2017"," An Eye-Rolling Insult To Sweeney Todd
","Goddammit Tim, must you ruin *everything* that's good? The original Broadway production and score of Sweeney Todd are brilliant and nuanced, balancing subtle notes of humor and horror, tenderness and savagery, lightness and dark, often within singular characters. Burton just suffocates it all in black tar and stage blood with all the sophistication and discernment of a 13-year-old suburbanite giggling at slasher comics in his basement.<br/><br/>It is clear that Burton didn't really want to make a musical in the first place and thus all the numbers come off as reluctant obligations rather than the vital organs of the film. Additionally, if you are going to make a musical, it is important that your actors can actually bloody SING! Depp employs a bad alt-rock whine while Helena Bonham Carter deadpans/talks her way through what are supposed to be giddy, effervescent, and funny songs with the bored resignation of a corpse bride waiting for her paycheck. Considering the heartbreaking beauty, dynamism, and texture of the original score, this rendering comes across as merely a self-serving insult to its source.<br/><br/>It is thus difficult to call Burton's Sweeney an ""interpretation"" when it is such a tone-deaf butchering on so many levels. As suggested earlier, Mrs. Lovett was originally written as a goofy, overeager, dim-witted bubble of a woman who counterbalances Sweeney's brooding menace. Here, Carter squelches her into the iron bodice of her austere ennui and creates just an equally brooding bedhead who glibly tosses Mrs. Lovett's $100 lines into the toilet as though the whole point of her character and the script were boring her to death. Depp's performance seriously lacks depth as well, coming across as Mr. Mean Looney-Pants the entire time rather than a suffering man with a deadly secret who has any real vengeance to seek. The sailor, who is supposed to be an embodiment of virile safety and valor, was for some unidentifiable reason cast as a twelve year old-looking boy rather than a capable man who could actually ""steal"" Johanna away. Plus, his and Johanna's songs together were cut, neutering their relationship and the urgency of their union. Johanna sits and sings her liberation-desire song while sewing and looking bored. The judge is rendered Mr. EvilEVilEVIL rather than the cluelessly gross man who actually thinks his adopted daughter would willfully marry him. Nearly every decision made, casting and otherwise, was amateurishly wrong and undermined the integrity and effectiveness of the story.<br/><br/>If you want REAL Sweeney Todd, see the Angela Lansbury production on DVD and listen to the original cast recording (or find a capable live production, such as the excellent one currently at Barrow Street Theater in New York) and let this dumb, ham-fisted, kiddie-goth misfire rot in the dollar bin where it belongs."

","Do serial kills start singing after they murder their victims? Most likely not, but Sweeney Todd tackles that very premise as Tim Burton directs his bloodiest film to date.<br/><br/>When musicals are done right, I'll be one of the first in line to see them. Much like Westerns, they are rare to come by these days so I'm always down to go back and check out one that I hadn't previously seen. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was one of those musicals, but sadly I don't think it lived up to the hype for me.<br/><br/>To have a cohesive character arc, you need obstacles or just something significant a character goes through so that the ending feels justified and earned. In my opinion, there is no real character arc for Todd. Sure, he begins as a normal man starting a life with his wife and daughter, but this is done in a brief flashback. I never once felt attached to this character or really cared at all. The wrongs that were done to him and his family are bad, but again, it wasn't like we see a lot of this on screen, we are told about it. For as much bad as we see Todd do, it just would have been nice to have some material balance it out the other way.<br/><br/>As for the musical aspects go, it's pretty paint by numbers. Perhaps, if I were into the story a little bit more and cared about what the characters were doing, I would have gotten into the songs they were singing. I really tried, but I just couldn't. It's also worth noting that because this film does have a fair amount of dialogue as well, the transitions to song weren't as smooth as they could have been. I love me some Alan Rickman, but when he breaks out into song at the barbershop, it feels pretty dang awkward.<br/><br/>I'm in the minority here though, this musical is beloved by many people, and at first glance it seems like Burton did a nice job of adapting the musical to screen. So perhaps it's just me. I just feel that in order to make a good film about someone who says ""we'll not discriminate who we kill"", I have to believe that what he or she is doing is warranted, and I didn't. Of course, these aren't just regular murders. These are bloody and premeditated murders in which the victims get baked into pies and fed to the town. Brutal. Just brutal.<br/><br/>+Burton was the right man for the job<br/><br/>-Never felt connected to the story or characters<br/><br/>-Pretty gratuitous if you ask me<br/><br/>-Song transitions are rough<br/><br/>4.5/10"

Directed by Tim Burton, this film has a screenplay by John Logan, based on the stage musical of the same name written by Hugh Wheeler. The cast is headed by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Jayne Wisener, among other actors.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is a director about which I have many reservations. No one disputes his creativity, not their ability to create great movies. The problem is that he makes excellent films with the same ease that makes huge mistakes. So, I had few expectations when I went to see this film, and it still fell more when I saw it was going to be a musical. However, I was very pleased with what I saw, and I think Burton, this time, did a great job.<br/><br/>I don't know the original play, so I cannot tell if the script was true to the original story but I think it's a good script, doesn't make mistakes or leaves important questions unanswered, besides having interesting twists and an excellent finish. The actors were excellent, particularly Depp, who knew how to combine his taste for bizarre roles to a strong and deep voice. Helena Bonham Carter also shone, in an obscure character whose obsessive love leads to a journey to doom. This macabre couple really managed to give life to this film, turning it into a mix of horror and musical movie, which thickens as the plot goes to the end. Its a film that proves without doubt that the musicals doesn't need to be romantic and very cuddly, since the musicals can be seen as a scenic (and cinematic) variant of the opera, a so popular and dramatic spectacle in the past.<br/><br/>The sets, costumes and visual effects are excellent. We are talking about Burton, so it couldn't be otherwise. Its a fairly graphic film to some extent, with several liters of arterial blood and scenes that may shock more sensitive people. The soundtrack is the responsibility of Stephen Sondheim (author of the original musics and lyrics) and is excellent, remaining in our memory for a long time."

","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is an Academy Award-winning American movie from almost 10 years ago and another collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The atmosphere is occasionally similar to ""Edward Scissorhands"", equally dark, but lacks the comedic moments completely and instead tries to deliver as a musical. And this works successfully to some extent. Some of the songs are fine to listen to while others are fairly forgettable. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen played together in ""Les MisÃ©rables"" (which I liked a lot more) too a couple years later. This may just be a personal criticism, but I thought the really dark subject and plot was not working well as a musical. It brought something in there that made it difficult for me to really take the developments seriously.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I agree with the Academy that the film mostly delivers from the visual perspective. The nomination for Johnny Depp may have been a bit too much I guess. ""Sweeney Todd"" runs for almost 2 hours, but the story is maybe only good for 100 minutes and as a consequence the film drags on several occasions. Nonetheless, thanks to the atmospheric touch, this film is a success and the positive outweighs the negative, but just slightly. I give the movie a thumbs-up, yet a cautious one. It did not deliver as much for me as I hoped it would, especially from the horror perspective. I myself wasn't scared once."

Having not known anything about Tim Burton prior to seeing this for the first time, I was hooked and went on the watch and adore all of his other films and artwork. This really is the the work of a true genius. I have seen the stage show and can clearly understand how different these two are but I have to be honest I prefer the film. Firstly, Sondheim's score is exquisitely brilliant, horrifying and strangely beautiful and emotive. Johnny Depp IS Sweeney Todd and it just pains me to see when other people disagree. Yes, in terms of technicality, it is questionable but that was not why he was rightfully given this role. The schizophrenic undertones to his voice and his actions are absolute perfection. His ability to commit to such moods and thoughts is outstanding. Many comments of all the actors underacting or doing nothing is, to me, just missing the point. Stage and film are so different and in stage, your character has to be so exaggerated to be able to project it to the very back of the theatre, where as in film it is much more intimate and the ability to show internal emotion is much more accessible. Helena Bonham Carter has a beautiful yet untrustworthy appearance and voice. Just small touches just make the film utter perfection."

Even though it borrows the old Hammer aesthetic for its gory scenes (kind of like Sleepy Hollow), it would end up very disturbing, had it not been for the dry sense of black humor and the excellent choreography and orchestration. But the movie is not afraid to cross the line when it has to and the dramatic effect is then very powerful.

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is the sixth Johnny Depp-Tim Burton collaboration. They previously made ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Corpse Bride"" together. They obviously like working together, and really being out the best in each other. This musical is no exception. It's in my Top 5 Musicals Of All Time.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Based on the hit Broadway musical. The infamous story of Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd, who after 15 years in prison sets up a barber shop in London where he forms a sinister partnership with his landlord, Mrs. Lovett. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is great in the title role (who knew he could sing) Sacha Baron Cohen is also worthy of praise as Adolfo Pirelli, I'll talk about Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett in a moment but for the moment I'll discuss the others Alan Rickman is excellent as Judge Turpin, whilst Timothy Spall is splendidly slimy as Beadle Bamford.<br/><br/>I have a slightly weird crush on Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett in this movie, I am not sure if it's because she was pregnant throughout filming and that the size of her breasts noticeably changes throughout the film, as filming was done out of sequence. Or maybe it's just because she is serving food, I don't know. What ever it is I'm attracted to her. <br/><br/>But the trouble is, the main cast members I have mentioned are so superb, the movie is weaker when they are not on screen. Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony and Jayne Wisener as Johanna both do well, but are completely blown away by the main cast.<br/><br/>Some of my favourite songs are 'The Little Priest', 'Pretty Women', 'The Worst Pies In London', 'Poor Thing', 'My Friends', 'God That's Good', 'By The Sea' and 'Epiphany'."

Selected actors was a very good choose. This film left a very big impression for me. I recommended it for all my friends and family members,because it's really worth to see. A plot was perfect. Helena Bonham Carter-she is like Johnny Depp,but she's woman. I want to say that perhaps their personalities are similar. I don't know how to say,I just know.They both are strong actors in my opinion. This film is a good choose if you love complicated films,where you can't find an answer fast. I love it. I would really like to see it one more time. It's not boring,and that tension,which I felt during the film was pleasing and strong. Tim Burton is a talent,he is unique. You know,when I watch a very good film,personally,then I want to became an actress...I felt the same when I watched this film. Sounds crazy perhaps,but it is. So it's really worth to see it. 10 points from me,from Johnny's Depp and Sweeney's Todd fan."

","This movie is my absolute favorite musical in all time for 3 reasons: I have a deep lying infatuation with the entirety of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter's character dept. Neither leave me disappointed and without seeing actual pictures of them outside of film, I cannot imagine what they would look like outside of costume. The many faces of Johnny Depp remind me of a Count Olaf (from Lemony Snickette's: A series of Unfortunate Events) with actual talent and intelligent adults. Tim Burton has an amazing way of mixing my 2 favorite movie genres; animation and horror/thriller. His way of combining elements and twisting something dark and cynical into something dark and whimsical, while conversely making the light and whimsical light and demented intrigues and aids in perceiving the darker/lighter side of a situation. I love musicals. I do not, however, love movies that claim to be a musical and simply have musical numbers here and there as an aside. In many ""musicals"" you can skip over the singing and still follow the entire plot of the story without a single pause. In TRUE musicals (except the dreadfully overly musical, like Les Mis') the song is the dialogue and a full conversation between the character and themselves, two characters, or the entire cast at the time. The music of Sweeney Todd plays as full dialogue that shouldn't be missed and helps to further develop the characters. For instance, how else should they show that Sweeney had completely lost it than having him fantasize and sing to many citizens of London while another person consciously watched him unravel? And the music behind the lyrics expressed each individual character to aid in the plot development...that is a true musical. The music isn't simply an accessory or some paint to tickle your fancy, but a functioning element ensuring that the machine run smoothly."

","If you have ever, even once, fancied yourself a connoisseur of filmic arts; or ever felt a special passion for the medium; or, heck, ever felt certain that you could actually spell the word F-I-L-M first try out of the box, then you will absolutely want to see Depp and Carter singing and slashing and filleting their way through SweeneyTodd. Not that this is a great film, or even an entertaining film, or even, dare we say, a film you would ever possibly want to see a second time. Rather, this is more akin to a true astronomical event, a meeting of the great planetary bodies of Hollywood as it were (Depp, Carter, Burton); and, as such, is only going to happen once or twice in your lifetime. So you simply can't miss it, if only for the sake of the grandkids, and also to have something to share with the other guests in the 'Home' when you are in your 80s and constantly in need of memories to dissect . Whether they are worth dissecting, or not. ???Can Depp sing??? Dammit, laddy, he can. One doubts if even Depp himself, prior to this role, knew that he could have had a robust career as a Broadway leading man, but such is the ""dep-th"" of his enormous talent (pun intended), that no one really knows if he can do a particular thing unless you actually pay him to do it. Beyond that, you are left, sadly, with Burton and his 'dream team' trying to bring life back to an ancient and weatherbeaten Hal Prince musical. And there's the rub. Prince was an anarchist in his day, doing everything differently than his peers, whether called for or not. And Burton is clearly an anarchist in our own day, which raises the metaphysical question whether two negatives ... make a positive? Sadly, no. Todd is possibly the most depressing and somber film you are likely to see in your lifetime (many critics have gravitated to the word ""humorless,"" but that's only because they themselves were in post-traumatic shock, and lost the manual dexterity needed to access a thesaurus) -- but the sad and simple fact is that, if you were already melancholy prior to entering the threate, then you should BY LAW have to leave your trouser belt and any sharp objects at the popcorn stand, lest you do yourself, and nearby patrons, serious harm. (Of course, if you are bound and determined to commit such acts, arguably, this would be the most appropriate forum for such mischief ...?)"

","My favourite movie of all times, seen this movie more times than any other, it was a typical, perfect Tim Burton. Dark and Gothic the way I like it, visually stunning. Actors were shockingly brilliant singers, at first I was a bit weird about thinking Johnny, Alan and Helena but Johnny blew me away at how brilliant he could sing, Helena too blew me away at how amazing she was. Alan was brilliant and hilarious, but sung well. A lot of the Harry Potter cast which was a plus for me! Beautiful costumes, Colleen Atwood again always amazing me with the brilliance of the costumes. Music itself was fantastic, bought the soundtrack and still listen to it. Tim Burton took a risk with the choice of actors for a musical but it definitely payed off, would 100% recommend to anyone, especially Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman fans."

","I, personally have not seen a better musical. First time I watched this movie I did not expect a musical but a horror. I was dragged into the movie quickly with the mystery of what happened to Barker. By the the halfway point of the movie I was very pleased.<br/><br/>The movie is not as violent or gory as some make it out to be, but if you thought Lord of the Rings (my other favorite movie) was too violent then this movie surly would be. The gore is done more in an artistic way, showing Todd's mood. Without giving anything away, I must say it has to be seen rather than read about.<br/><br/>Assuming the reader is either seeing what others think of the movie after watching the movie or seeing what others think of the movie before watching, the latter should forget that it is a musical before they watch it. Nobody likes musicals that I know of but all who have seen this movie that I know love this movie.<br/><br/>The romance, the despair, the anger, how every second of the movie achieves more than one emotion; and not to mention the music is unlike the typical musical. This is a must see. If you scare easy this isn't horror, but if homicidal maniacs are your fear best avoid, but the character is actually a character you can connect to."

He trod a path that few had trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.""<br/><br/>Those are the opening lyrics to the 1979 Broadway production with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The movie version, made 28 years later with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, will blow you away. The entire film is so unique and so strange that you can't help but take in the awe of it. It is the story of a troubled barber who was imprisoned after a judge took his wife away. Years later, he returns to London where there is no sign of his wife and now his daughter is locked away in the Judge's house. His goal now, is to bring in customers, primarily the Judge, and slit their throats so that his new friend, Mrs. Lovett can make them into delectable ""meat pies"". And the best part of it all is that it is a musical and all of the actors, never previously singers, have unbelievable good voices that are very enjoyable to listen to and fit the story. The majority of musical films seem to be quite upbeat and contain large amounts of dancing, but this has neither. I prefer dark musicals such as this and also ""Les Miserables"", because I think it is harder to bring those emotions out in song and this kind of musical has much more meaning to me. Every actor in this picture does an incredible job in their individual role and I don't believe that a single actor was miscast. What's more, the writer of the stage musical, Stephen Sondheim, approved which he often doesn't do with movie adaptations. Tim Burton really scores on this one."

"k-a-schuetzenhofer","8","1","1","17 October 2012"," The Closest Shave You Shall Ever Know
","In this dark, witty film adaptation of a popular musical, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" actor Johnny Depp plays the lead role as a barber in London during the mid-seventeenth century. We learn that his character, Sweeney Todd, has just been freed from a fifteen year sentence in prison for a false crime. Todd had been put away by a powerful judge who was quite intent on stealing his beautiful wife. Todd's goal throughout the film is to seek revenge on the judge by slitting his throat while giving him a shave. Because of his new look and name, no one recognizes Sweeney Todd as his former self, Benjamin Barker, and he would like it to stay that way until the judge is murdered. In anticipation for the judge to come for a shave, Todd ""practices"" on other, less deserving throats.<br/><br/>As always, director Tim Burton delivers a quirky film. Its message is a simple one. A person always gets what they deserve. Todd plans to take back what is his when he returns from prison, this, of course, being his family. Whether he can get them back or not is irrelevant, it becomes more about his fixation on the murder of the man who locked him away. Other individuals, too, are killed for their wrong doings. Several deserving characters (we assume) go on to lead happy lives.<br/><br/>It is impossible when discussing this movie not to mention how well filmed it is. The gloom and darkness that engulfs London in every scene gives the viewer an even deeper understanding of the story line. There are several parts in the movie when the mood changes from melancholy to whimsical, but the transition is not just in the acting. Tim Burton does a fantastic job with lighting and setting change to give the viewer a feel for what is really happening in the story."
"laojim","10","1","1","17 September 2012"," Excellent production with a few minor flaws.
","Don't read this, go watch it.<br/><br/>If you must know, I fault the production for omitting the chorus that begins and closes the stage show. Particularly, this flaw is at the closing of the show where the chorus brings us back from the story and states what the point of the story is in stark terms. I quote here but this is not a spoiler simply because it is not in the show. ""Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd, who served a start and a vengeful god. To seek revenge may lead to hell, but everyone does it and seldom as well as Sweeny Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street."" The story is set in an ancient English tradition of the revenge story and the English imagination can develop the most horrific and hideous forms of revenge. See, for example, Titus Andronicus, recently released as Titus and set in the Fascist modern architecture of the mid 20th century. In this story the raped and disfigured who had her tongue cut out identified her attackers who are cooked and served to their parents. This grand old English tradition goes back to the ballad of Lambkin who, having not been paid for his work stabs the baby in the crib, and so on. In more recent films The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is in this tradition, although it is not English.<br/><br/>I like a good tale of vengeance but I also like good music and the music is done surprisingly well in this movie."

","""Sweeney Todd"" is actually a very well-made movie. Sondheim refers to it as the only one of his musicals that actually succeeds as a movie, rather than an opened-up version of the stage musical. <br/><br/>Director Tim Burton uses shades of red and black almost exclusively in the film, from costumes to scenery to lighting. It adds to the film's overall effectiveness. He doesn't shy away from all the blood, which doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers yet another fantastic performance. He is lacking one important element, though -- a singing voice. He sounds like he would be more comfortable singing a pop or rock musical (such as ""Rent"" or ""Rock of Ages""). However, the score for ""Sweeney"" is an extremely demanding one, almost operatic (indeed, the stage version has been performed at numerous opera houses). His acting saves the character - he is absolutely riveting.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter's voice suits her character well, but it could be stronger. She plays the character well, but she could have been a bit more scatterbrained.<br/><br/>Of the other cast members, only Jane Weisner (Johanna), Jamie Campell Bower (Anthony), and Sascha Cohen (Pirrelli) have voices that suit the work.<br/><br/>Musically, Burton has cut several songs, including the opening of the stage version, ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"".

"JamesHitchcock","8","1","1","3 December 2010"," The City of Dreadful Night
","Sweeney Todd is sometimes, wrongly, believed to have been a real historical character, but he appears to have been the creation of an otherwise obscure Victorian writer named Thomas Peckett Prest. Prest was a prolific author of what were known as ""penny dreadfuls"", lurid and sensational novels serialised in weekly magazines which cost one penny each, and it was in one such novel, entitled ""The String of Pearls"", that Todd first made his literary debut.<br/><br/>This film, however, is not based directly upon Prest's novel but upon Stephen Sondheim's musical adaptation. The action takes place in the London of 1846, the year in which the novel was first published but not the year in which it was set. (Prest set his tale in 1785). In this version ""Sweeney Todd"" is the alias adopted by Benjamin Barker, a barber who was transported to Australia after being framed for a crime he did not commit by the corrupt and evil Judge Turpin, who had cast his lustful eye upon Barker's attractive young wife Lucy. After fifteen years in exile Barker returns to London to discover that Lucy poisoned herself after being raped by the Judge and that his daughter Johanna, only a baby when he last saw her, is now a beautiful teenager and Turpin's ward.<br/><br/>Maddened by grief, Barker swears revenge not only upon Turpin but upon the human race as a whole. (His rationale is that death is a just punishment for the powerful and guilty and a welcome release for the powerless and innocent). Using the name Sweeney Todd he once again sets up in business as a barber and starts to murder his customers by slitting their throats with a razor. Disposing of the bodies is no problem; after killing his victims Todd delivers the bodies via a trap door to his accomplice, the pie-maker Mrs Lovett, who bakes them into her tasty meat pies.<br/><br/>In some ways this is an unexpected film; Tim Burton is not a director normally associated with musicals, and Sondheim is not a composer normally associated with the cinema. Despite the great success of his musicals on Broadway, only three of them, ""West Side Story"", ""Gypsy"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"", have been made into feature films, and only for the last of those did Sondheim write both the music and lyrics. (For the first two he wrote the lyrics but not the music). The neglect of his work can partly be attributed to the decline in the popularity of the musical in the cinema (although it remains a highly popular form in the theatre), but it may also have something to do with the fact that his works are often dark and challenging, both in terms of musical style and in terms of plot. They have little in common with the warmth and lyricism of, say, Rodgers and Hammerstein.<br/><br/>Burton, however, is a director whose films (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", his interpretation of ""Batman"") often concentrate on the Gothic and the macabre, and the bleakness which lies at the heart of ""Sweeney Todd"" made it a natural target for him. As one has come to expect from a Burton film (although ""Big Fish"" is something of an exception) the film is visually very sombre, with muted colours, a literal darkness reflecting the metaphorical darkness of the story. In his vision, Victorian London becomes the nineteenth-century equivalent of Burton's Gotham City, a City of Dreadful Night, a place of both physical and moral blackness.<br/><br/>The two leading roles of Todd and Mrs Lovett are taken by those two Burton stalwarts, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter; this was Depp's sixth collaboration with Burton and Bonham Carters' fifth. (Both were also to appear in his next film, ""Alice in Wonderland""). Neither is an actor I would normally associate with musicals, and their singing here was criticised in some circles. To my mind, however, both have a quality of voice which, although it is not particularly polished, is well-suited to Sondheim's astringent music and his often cynical lyrics. (Their duet ""A Little Priest"", in which they discuss which types of people make the best eating, was the for me the musical highlight).<br/><br/>On the acting side, Depp has given some of his best performances in Burton films, such as ""Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"", and he is excellent here, coping brilliantly with the difficult task of bringing out the dual sides of Todd's nature- on the one hand he is a bloodthirsty villain, on the other a tormented victim who has suffered much through no fault of his own. In previous films, even those made after he turned forty such as the various ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" adventures, Depp's youthful, boyish good looks have been an important part of his screen persona. The role of the middle-aged, careworn Sweeney Todd is perhaps his first older man's role. Bonham Carter is also excellent, as is that splendid villain Alan Rickman as the wicked Judge Turpin. (The name was presumably borrowed from the notorious highwayman Dick Turpin, but it also carries overtones of the word ""turpitude"", meaning moral depravity). There are also good contributions from Sacha Baron-Cohen as Todd's pseudo-Italian rival Pirelli and young Ed Sanders as his assistant Toby.<br/><br/>Burton is not always a great director, but is generally an original and interesting one. His work varies in quality, but he is capable of making some excellent films, and ""Sweeney Todd"" is one of his best; of those I have seen I would rate only ""Big Fish"" and ""Scissorhands"" more highly. It will doubtless be too gruesome for some, but for those with stronger appetites it makes a splendidly bleak and cynical horror-comedy. 8/10"

But Sweeney Todd is one of the greatest movies ever made, I think.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is magical as Benjamin Barker, a barber who is arrested for no reason by the evil Judge Turpin(portrayed brilliantly by Alan Rickman) so then he can get closer to Barker's wife. 15 years later, Barker breaks out and changes his name to Sweeney Todd, and rekicks his old business. He forms an alliance with Mrs. Lovett(also played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Carter), who makes terrible pies.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Turpin has adopted Todd's daughter, Joanna.

"neil-476","7","1","1","27 November 2010"," Very good, but....
","Tim Burton's take on Stephen Sondheim's Broadway show, probably the most explicitly gory grand guignol musical ever made, has a lot going for it: great songs, excellent performances, very good singing (unexpectedly so from Depp), and Burton's strong visual sense at work.<br/><br/>I confess to being irritated, as more than once before, by Burton insisting that he knows better than the source material. Having said that, he makes a fair fist of this particular project.<br/><br/>It is extremely grisly, and that may matter to you: I found that the blood was fairly comic book-ish, and easy to not take seriously.<br/><br/>More critical is the fact that the protagonists are essentially unsympathetic. While one sympathises with why Todd becomes this character, and while one is saddened by the tragedy of what happens, the absence of any redemption (or hope thereof), unleavened by an actual resolution for Johanna, means that there is little satisfaction for an audience to hang onto at the end (even Toby settles matters by dropping to the same level of those he has learnt he despises).<br/><br/>Does this outweigh the good things along the way? For me, it was a close thing, but my enjoyment just about outweighed my disappointment at the absence of humanity at the end."

After Sweeney dies the movie just ends with no aftermath, I understand everyone is dead but it just felt like there could have been something more.<br/><br/>The movie had an interesting look at society and the metaphor of ""Man eating man"" was put so literally and so brilliantly.

"mark.waltz","10","1","1","8 October 2010"," If only every other film version of a Broadway musical was like this!
","The problem in making movie versions of Broadway musicals today is that the temptation to make it so big that it comes off as pretentious has made several recent attempts rather poor. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Nine"" are two examples. ""Chicago"" worked because having the musical numbers in Roxie's mind was an excellent choice considering her character. ""Hairspray"" and ""Mamma Mia!"" were simply fun summer movies that pleased the audiences that flocked to it and ended up being the ""Grease"" of the modern era. In the case of ""Sweeney Todd"", it was getting the right director interested in the project and a loyalty to the original show that made it the outstanding film that it is.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has been down ""Sweeney Todd"" territory before. Imagine ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"" with songs and Burton's delightfully artistic mentality. His artistic view of 1800's London was as colorful and true to the period as 1800's New York along the Hudson was for ""Sleepy Hollow"". Who better to play Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd today than Johnny Depp? He actually possesses a fine singing voice, and if not as scary looking as Len Cariou or George Hearn were in the original Broadway production, he definitely brings on an aura of ""don't mess with me"" from the moment his face is shown from the side in his first close-up. Actually, having him be less evil looking than his predecessors makes the character more dangerous when the wrath pops out and his mayhem begins. Helena Bonham Carter is a far cry from her predecessors too as Mrs. Lovett; She may not have the singing skills of Angela Lansbury, Dorothy Loudon or Patti LuPone, but really acts her songs very convincingly. Together, Depp and Carter remind me of a more demented Bill Sikes and Nancy from ""Oliver!"". (In fact, it would be very interesting to see what Burton could do with a remake of that musical.)<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are appropriately malevolent as the Judge and the Beedle. In fact, Spall's Beedle is so grimy he almost seems like a beetle! His character also has a slight look of ""Batman's"" penguin. Rickman's polished judge is so wonderfully evil it appears as if he has transcended into the type of characters Boris Karloff used to play. In his short time on screen, Sacha Baron Cohen is appropriately oily as Pirelli, Sweeney's first ""customer"". I just loved his Mamie Eisenhower hairstyle! Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener do their best as Anthony and Johanna, but are overshadowed by the more colorful evil characters surrounding them. Laura Michelle Kelly as the beggar woman displays a strong Broadway style voice but is hidden behind a grotesque costume. Special credit goes to young Ed Sanders as the young Toby who is very touching, especially singing ""Nothing's Gonna Harm You"". He manages to hold his own with the stars and not be over the top. While the entire cast is great, it's Depp, Carter and Sanders that are worthy of unqualified praise.<br/><br/>This show took almost 30 years to get to the screen, and it was worth the wait. The murders are not as horrific as one would assume them to be. In fact, they are done rather comically over a wonderful musical number sung as a montage by Depp while Bower is singing romantically in a separate interlude. Burton and the musical crew should be commended for utilizing practically the entire score, which is orchestrated beautifully and sounds like you were listening to it live. The art direction, make-up, costumes and photography are all top notch."

Whatever the truth may be the results of his filming of 'Sweeney Todd' are ambivalent.<br/><br/>It looks like a Burton film, the sets are great (studio bond) and the costumes and makeup out of his top drawer. The film is similar to 'Sleepy Hollow' in that the colors are muted, mostly sepia, browns, gray and black with emphasis placed on the bright red blood (lots of it) and yellow, for the charlatan's elixir of urine at the street fair. Sasha Baron Cohen shines as this character and is the most entertaining of all the cast, and he can sing!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp sings well too, though obviously he's not all that comfortable with it, this being his first filmed singing role. Helena Bonham Carter is also good, and she seems better at acting and singing at the same time than Depp. But as they are both duffers at musicals they are well-matched together and make a compelling couple in their dark machinations. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is good if only amounting to stock character acting. It was type casting to have Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin. He gives his trademark mush mouthed performance and sings okay. Timothy Spall is rather wasted as Turpin's brutal flunky but he does what he can. The star is Edward Sanders as Toby, the young lad who is taken on by Mrs Lovett as her shop assistant and in the end dispatches Sweeney Todd. The kid can sing and act with beguiling aplomb. <br/><br/>The minor love interest is totally dull, the two young actors hardly having a chance to create any chemistry between them. Joanna, Todd's long lost daughter, is an empty vessel, there simply for the plot, and the actress can't sing for beans. <br/><br/>I don't understand the great popularity of this Broadway show. Sondheim's lyrics are the strongest points, but the music is largely unmemorable, containing not a single memorable tune. It's the lyrics that stick in the mind. 'Sweeney Todd' is nowhere near Sondheim's greatest musical (to my way of thinking) 'A Little Night Music'.<br/><br/>The comedy is almost non-existent, and I don't see what could possibly be funny about this gruesome tale in the first place. I haven't seen the musical play which may be funny, I don't know. This film is not. It's gory, in Burton's usual manner. The blood looks more realistic than it did in, say, 'Sleepy Hollow' and there are copious quantities of it, the cumulative effect of which is indeed rather sickening. Something about razors, I suppose, that makes it very squirmy watching.<br/><br/>I liked Bonham Carter's Mrs Lovett. She's on the young side, compared with Angela Lansbury, and is beautiful in a decayed way, and she does add some comedy at moments with her wide range of subtle facial expressions. I enjoyed her very much. Depp is not so satisfying, though good. He looks the part and expresses the anger and murderous intent very clearly, but he's more down the lines of a dark Jack the Ripper than the, supposedly, more buffo Todd.<br/><br/>Victorian London is evoked beautifully, too beautifully. The streets are clear of horse manure and other offal and it doesn't 'smell' visually as it should. Mary Poppins would have been quite at home in the pristine throngs of these London streets and byways. There is one glaring spacial mistake with Mrs Lovett's shop. Sweeney's trick chair upstairs is placed so that, in reality, it would dump his victims directly into Mrs Lovett's pie shop by the front door. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I can't see the point of this film, other than to get Sondheim's mediocre score on celluloid with big name stars, and for Burton to show off his best trademark features. The blood is gratuitously over-bearing and the plot line is very thin and the script is very weak.<br/><br/>If I watch it again it will be for Bonham Carter, Cohen and young Sanders displaying their talents under Tim Burton's meticulous direction.<br/><br/>I look forward now, more than ever, to Burton's upcoming 'Alice in Wonderland' to redeem him of this relative failure. 'Sweeney Todd' is Burton's least successful film and I hope he never sinks to this level again.<br/><br/>Lastly, I missed the music of Danny Elfman in a Burton feature. He and Tim Burton are as strongly associated with one another as were Bernard Hermann and Alfred Hitchcock."
"Vovion","6","1","1","8 July 2009"," A film that could have been a lot better, had there been plot structure in the first half an hour.
","Musicals are a funny thing; on paper they make absolutely no sense at all. The characters live in a world where breaking into song and dance while at the shops is completely normal and where not only do the bystanders accept this but the audience do too. Before really understanding musicals or liking the genre full stop, it always seemed to me that the songs were more important than the story, almost to the point where the story became irrelevant; it seemed just a device in which to have songs. However, after recently starting to really appreciate the style, I now understand that I couldn't have been further from the truth. Now, to say I am a Johnny Depp fan is an understatement. I also enjoy Tim Burton when he is on top form, so you can understand just how much I have been looking forward to this film. So when I say ""I am severally disappointed by Sweeney Todd"", I hope you get the gravitas of what I felt after watching it and funnily enough the cause of why it fails is because of the very reason that I didn't understand musicals at first. Before I go into its failures though, I will give you an oversight of the plot and what the film succeeds at. <br/><br/>The story is essentially a revenge tale; Benjamin Barker (Depp) is sent away by Judge Turpin (the ever good Alan Rickman) after he sees his family at a market one day and decides he wants Barker's wife for himself. Skip ahead a couple of years and Benjamin Barker returns to London as Sweeny Todd, with only one thing on his mind - finding Turpin and taking revenge for ruining his life. When he returns to his shop, he finds Mrs. Lovett (played by Helena Bonham Carter) who supposedly makes the worst pies in London and begins a depraved killing spree, which can only end in tears. The first thing you notice about Sweeny Todd, as with most Burton films is the gorgeous Gothic set design, makeup, clothes and style. Some criticise him for his films always having the same look and design, but you can't argue the fact that even though he does use the style a lot, he's gotten very good at using it. His direction also stands out in this film more so than in his previous works. Whilst always having appreciated his directing and style, I never really thought of him as one who wants to experiment with the art of film itself. Whereas here some of his choices work very well, most notably the scene towards the start where the camera zips through the London streets, randomly noticing people as it flies by. Yet at the same time the direction is the reason why the film fails and it's all down to the first half hour. <br/><br/>In my mind, typically speaking in a musical, a song is used to emphasise a certain emotion or important plot device. A good musical is when it understands this and doesn't just put songs in all over the place because it can. The best example of this that springs to mind is Moulin Rouge!; when a song was used in this film there was always a reason for it. It would give insight into the way a character was feeling but couldn't show in a normal expressive way, or if there were songs that weren't part of the story they were used in a realist manner, most of the time on stage. The problem with Sweeny Todd is that it completely forgets the most important and basic film element; plot structure. There is literately little to no plot for the first thirty minutes of the film; there's song after song with nothing for them to emphasise, because the characters haven't had a chance to explain why they are doing a certain thing or feeling a certain way. What the film tries to do is what Once did so successfully by telling the plot through song, but the songs that Sweeny Todd has, while catchy and technically sound, are not expressive or informative enough to do the job. This therefore creates the devastating problem of the audience only being able to invest and care about the character half an hour into the film, at which point you just don't feel part of the story. Instead you feel as an outsider looking in, which means you don't care what happens to the characters. The acting too, while good and serviceable is not what I've come to expect from Johnny Depp. His singing is fine and fits the film well, but unlike almost all his other films, I never felt like I was watching one of his new character creations; it was more like I was watching Johnny Depp do his 'From Hell' accent with a bit of Jack Sparrow. Due to this I never really believed in the character, or what he was feeling the majority of the time, because it seemed to me Depp wasn't comfortable with the part. Thankfully Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Sasha Baron Cohen all provide good support, which stops it from falling on its face, but even they couldn't save a film which shot itself in the foot at the start. <br/><br/>I think it is a true shame they couldn't have fixed the beginning's structure before releasing Sweeney Todd, because I believe it would have been great if a relationship with the character had been built from the start. This is not to say that the film is a complete and utter failure, because it does have redeeming qualities, such as the support acting, gorgeous production values and catchy songs. If you are going to watch Sweeney Todd simply for Johnny Depp though, I would suggest instead buying The Libertine, sitting down in your chair and watching him at his mesmerizing best, because unfortunately he doesn't show it here."

","Given the high ratings of this movie, I'm clearly in the minority of people who didn't quite ""get"" this film. It's well produced, directed, acted and darkly styled. So - I'd venture to say this a pretty good movie for most moviegoers.<br/><br/>But somehow, watching on the small screen with lots of singing - well, it just didn't grab my attention. I remember the huge difference in watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" on TV (unwatchable) and then later seeing it in on a big screen with an audience (wow!) ... and maybe this is the same phenomenon.<br/><br/>While it's clear that the movie is full of intensity, emotion and style - maybe something is lost when you see in normal definition TV. On that basis, I'd say this film is probably best experienced in a movie theater with an audience."

","Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) had it all, a lovely wife named Lucy (Lauren Michelle Kelly) and daughter named Johanna (Jayne Wisener . They were his reason and his life. But the corrupted and twisted Judge Turpin (Allen Rickman) takes it all away, he sends Barker to prison on a false charge. <br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Benjamin Barker is found floating in the sea by a sailor named Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower), Barker identifies himself as Sweeney Todd. ""Sweeney Todd"" returns to London for revenge. He takes back residence in the small apartment above Mrs. Lovette's (Helena Bonham Carter) meat pie shop. Sweeney wants revenge upon those that wronged him. Mrs. Lovette also wants to be more than his landlord though, she has a secret admiration for him. Sweeney begins to murder people as practice for Turpin with ""his friends"" (his straight razors) and Mrs. Lovette bakes the corpses into her pies and sells them to unsuspecting customers. <br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. It is an incredible musical-thriller that could only be created in film by Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie to Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, and horror film fans. If I could give this film more than ten stars, I would!"
"gkeith_1","Null","1","1","30 April 2008"," Singing great.
","Depp and Bonham Carter very good singers. I enjoyed them. The kid Toby great too, although I felt his upper range soprano was just a little too high-pitched. Fun comedy. I had already seen this show live on stage, and the movie was not disappointing. Enjoyed seeing Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman. I remember seeing Bonham Carter in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", where she played Charlie's mother, and of course Johnny Depp in that same movie. Both excellent in that, too. I keep saying (read my other reviews) that long live movie musicals, and ""Sweeney Todd"" I hope will help in the revival of this totally enjoyable entertainment medium. I even enjoyed seeing Johnny and Helena doing their dancing (waltzes?) around the room (in ""Todd""), and you know I like dancing movies, too. Finally, kiddos, do not be discouraged by all the blood in this movie. Remember that it is all fake, that you would well know if you had had acting classes and stage makeup coursework like I have had. I am sure Johnny Depp must have a hard time keeping a straight face as he carved up the dastardly judge as played by Alan Rickman. I'm sure it must have been really tempting to just burst out laughing. I have seen Rickman play some sinister parts, like Rasputin, so I am glad the judge character got what was coming to him."

","Pleasantly surprised by how well everyone sings, and you can hear the words! This is not an ordinary musical for sure. Bought the soundtrack and am anxiously awaiting the DVD. I think the fact that these are actors first made the movie more enjoyable. The casting director should get an Oscar, everyone fits their roles to a ""t"". <br/><br/>Johnny Depp has yet to make a movie I didn't enjoy, and this continues. Helena Bonham Carter tends to pick scary, wild-woman parts, but I think this role could be her finest ever.

","Okay, this was Burton's best movie, this was Depp's best role, but the real scene-stealer TO ME is Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd tells a story of vengeance, hate, blood, despair and cannibalism (okay, there is love to, but almost inexistent).<br/><br/>Here we see another Johnny Depp, in another level of acting. He is brilliant. He gave me chills. And he surprised me because I never ever thought that he could sing, and he sang VEEERRRRYYY WEEELLLL! He was not funny like all his other roles, he was mad... he was bloody, and to me, that was the BEST performance of a psycho-vengeful that I've ever seen. Congratulations Mr. Depp, you really scared me.<br/><br/>And in contrast with his bloody humor, we have Mrs. Lovett, portrayed magically by miss Helena Bonham Carter. Man, she was perfect... Helena Bonham Carter gave Mrs. Lovett sweet eyes, and a dark appearance. She was just mad as her platonic lover, Sweeney Todd. But the difference was that Mrs. Lovett still knew how to love. Bonham Carter stole the scene. Her voice was wonderful, especially singing ""The worst pies in London"". I can't express how thrilled I was. She made me almost cry, and she was able to make the audience know how it is to love someone, and not be loved instead. Every time she stared at Sweeney, we could see how sad and lonely she was, and we even understood why she lied to him...<br/><br/>Everyone congratulated Depp (well deserved), but the real bloody diamond here is Miss Bonham Carter...<br/><br/>As for the movie. Well, nothing much to say... Just that... when I saw it, I felt all the magic of the cinema ounce again, a magic which has been lost since long ago...<br/><br/>Congratulations Tim Burton, you gave a new life and a new hope for us, movie lovers. Thank you!"
"kieran-wright","8","1","1","11 February 2008"," Deliciously Grim
","Let me say from the outset that even I - as a self-confessed aficionado of music - was unprepared for the sheer volume of songs in this movie. That said, everyone acquitted themselves well, and yes - at times, Johnny Depp did produce shades of Bowie in his voice. For me, Helena Bonham-Carter was equally as good as Depp, if not the best thing in this movie. She seems to have come a long way in her range of characters since hooking up with Mr. Burton. Both leads clearly enjoyed themselves in what turned out to be a memorable and thought provoking film. People have said that this is a musical, but I actually felt that it was verging on opera. A couple of beautifully delicious twists at the end made for an experience as memorable as one of Mrs Lovatt's world-famous pies."

","At the very beginning of the film after the opening titles, when the ship emerges from shadow, you appreciate that it is again a film of Tim Burton and you are about to watching it. And then you see a face without hope and agony, and says with a familiar voice ""There is no place like London"". It is the time of you to be impatient about the images of beauty and ""you'll learn"".<br/><br/>The sixth film of the one of the best team in movie history, you would regret to not seeing this film in a dark, quiet place. It is a big opportunity for our souls to be relieved.<br/><br/>The third component of the long life cooperation Danny Elfman is not a part of the film but with this film it is not a problem. The music is excellent, I have not watched the original display but I like Johnny Depp and other player's voices. The soundtrack of the motion picture is another beautiful experience.<br/><br/>Every scene in the movie is excellent. There are a lot of classic moments: The duet between Sweeney Todd and Judge Turpin, the stunning and brutal last picture and lots of them.<br/><br/>Even if you are not familiar with the musicals, you have a doubt about the film, you have to overcome this idea and go to watch this movie or Sweeney Todd would come for you."
"megahip42","10","1","1","6 February 2008"," It's man devouring man, my dear! The dynamic Burton-Depp duo scores another point for Team Delightfully Creepy
","THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER ABOUT ANOTHER MOVIE, ""FINAL DESTINATION 3."" PLEASE DON'T BLACKLIST ME.<br/><br/>I'm probably the fourth biggest Johnny Depp fan in the world (next to his mom, his wife and his two kids.) But I was one of the last people in my school to see this film, because I haven't much time on my hands. Believe me, it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>First of all, Johnny Depp can sing. I saw Cry-Baby, and they dubbed another guy's voice in. But Johnny doesn't sing like a youngish Elvis, he sings the way he speaks - amazingly well.<br/><br/>I'd never seen Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie before, because Borat wasn't really my type of film, but he was pretty darn good too.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter: I don't care who she's married to, she's an amazing actress and singer on her own merit. I went to see this movie because my friend was singing ""A Little Priest"" at lunch (worst part is, she's a vegetarian!) And I just adore her character's name, or rather I love it. Get it, Love it, Lovett? Feel free to groan.<br/><br/>Sorry, Alan Rickman, I'm afraid you will now forever be stuck playing the sleaze.<br/><br/>But the real star of this film was the music. The lyrics, melody, harmonies; it was awe-inspiring. It pains me to admit that I've never seen the musical itself, but what songs were intact were spectacular. I don't think I'll ever get ""A Little Priest"" out of my head (which is a bit embarrassing during Mass) and ""Epiphany"" gave me goosebumps. I apologize if this hurts any feelings, but I just didn't care for the Johanna song. Not the one she sings, the one Antony sings about her. His voice is just too perfect and clean and innocent. This is what drives hard-rock fans *away* from musicals. He reminded me of Raoul in Phantom just a little bit. I gravitate toward the dark side.<br/><br/>One thing bothered me: the ending. It was justified but it surprised me. I'm known in my class as ""the pyrophobe."" I can't even light a Bunsen burner, which makes me infinitely grateful for lab partners. I almost died watching the tanning beds in Final Destination 3. On the other hand, my friend with whom I saw the film was more bothered by Toby with the knife, because children killing people freaks him out (probably because he's got a thirteen-year-old brother and a preteen sister.) Overall a splendid movie which will have my friends and I singing about ""shepherd's pie peppered with actual shepherd on top"" for a good long time. Much love for a musical that doesn't involve cheerleaders, shiny dresses and bad dancing, or Donny Osmond in a multicolored coat."
"Vince-44","10","1","1","3 February 2008"," Tim Burton's highly original dark vision
","Set in the darkest pit that is London, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is a dark Gothic and extremely gory masterpiece. He mixes the violence of Sweeney's acts with the darkest humour and shows that horror movies don't have to be about screaming teenagers. The cast are excellent and Tim Burton has excelled at finding some of the best there is. Look out for the cameos and see if you can spot Anthony Head. Johnny Depp's performance is outstanding (I never knew he could sing) and he works very well with Helena Bonham Carter whom I have always admired as an actress. The film seems to have been colour bleached as it is presented in beautifully dark tones of grey and black with the redness of the blood being the main accent throughout. It is a tragic tale of woe and revenge set at a time that seems to be but a distant memory now. The songs are excellent, the score is beautiful and Mr Burton's vision of London is breathtakingly displayed. A must-see film but please don't take your children. the film is extremely gory and has subtle sexual overtones at times bordering on the disturbing."

This goes over the top, even for him.<br/><br/>Only O.J. Simpson could watch this film with any comfort. I lost count after endless throat slashings and buckets full of squirting blood, which simply left me squirming in my seat. This film will give you nightmares.<br/><br/>The only unintentional comic relief comes from Borat's Sacha Baron Cohen, who is guaranteed to send giggles though the audience. His character briefly allows you to come up for air in this otherwise morbid, dreary tale.<br/><br/>And as a musical no less?! Get real. ""My Fair Lady"" has no worries about being eclipsed. I've heard better tunes from stray cats.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp sort of makes you imagine that Edward Scissorshands has grown up into a shaving blade wielding serial killer.<br/><br/>This is a relentlessly grim, dark, grimy film that is monotone from start to finish. The final scene betrays sort of a blood-fetish by Burton, and is nauseatingly disgusting."

His dead white faces are about as original as Tarantino's plot placements. May as well use black and white film if you're gonna desaturate it that much, but oh, need color for the blood! -The blood looked completely fake. Japanese ninja b-films have better effects. In fact, the dubbed dialog in those films are better too. -Script? I mean lyrics... In fact, in the 30mins I watched, that was around 28-29mins singing, with a 30sec musical interlude between scene changing. Can't say I'm a huge musical fan, but, really? Is constant singing necessary? Oliver! is one of my favorite movies, every song is memorable and fitting, and easy to see a good musical over one of the worst movies I've ever seen. -Ever notice how the only people to recommend this movie are people you'd normally encounter at the local Hot Topic? ""Misunderstood people"" that only a singing zombie could impress. Scoff the normality of society as you consume Todd's tees, stickers, dolls, and dvds, heh. Seems to be a rarity that an average film lover would enjoy this (let alone feels it earns such a high IMDb rank). Hell, even the followers of the older version have their deeper knit picking against this movie. With such a fine fan base it should be obvious whether or not you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>*Only other movie shut off was King of the Ants, if you've seen either one all the way through, you have earned my respect and an award of many sorts."

","I went into the theater with high hopes for this film. I am usually a Tim Burton fan, and a Johnny Depp fan, and I like dark films and musicals. It seemed as though I would love it. However, in order for a musical to be good, the lead character should really be played by somebody who can sing. Johnny Depp is no such somebody. I suppose I should have been prepared for that, after hearing bits and pieces from the trailer, but I wasn't, and when he sang his first line, I was already cringing. Even Johnny's acting didn't seem to be full-hearted. Maybe it's because the character was so dead that it would be hard to act, but I just wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>On to the blood. Oh my goodness. I was definitely not prepared for the blood. I went to see this with my 18-year-old brother, and even he squirmed when the first throat was slit. No, ""slit"" really isn't the right word...more like ""mutilated,"" ""gouged,"" or something else along those lines. After the first throat mutilation, I could barely watch the others. Even now, as I think about the movie, I can practically taste blood in my mouth.<br/><br/>The sets. OH MY GOODNESS. Can someone PLEASE pry Tim Burton AWAY from the studios and the green screens??? I liked the parts of London that looked real, but some of it was just obviously green screen, especially during some of the songs. It's like when he could have shot ""Sleepy Hollow"" IN Terrytown, and instead decided to film the movie in a studio in London.<br/><br/>Anything good? Yes, actually. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. She was cute, charming, and actually could sing. The same with Anthony, except his look of adoration for Johanna while he sang about stealing her kind of creeped me out. The girl who played Johanna had a tremendously sweet voice. She was adorable, but rather expressionless. Toby was probably the best part of the film. He was adorable, incredibly talented, and just charming to watch.<br/><br/>The entire movie, I was waiting for some sort of explanation for Sweeney Todd's hatred towards absolutely everything. What happened to him in prison? What was he accused of to send him there? There was no background information, no motive for him to kill (except for Judge Turpin). Basically, this movie is a crappy rip off of The Count of Monte Cristo. Yeah yeah, getting revenge will come back and get you, yada yada. I think it could have been good if Johnny had been replaced, or at least dubbed, and if the unnecessary blood had been cut out.<br/><br/>Let me just close with this: If you liked this movie, then you are probably a die hard fan of Johnny Depp/Tim Burton, or you are just really strange.

As a result, one of the most boring films ever to grace the earth was made. Not the mention the weak performance by the lead actor, who was not even vocally exceptional. In short, it was like a film where people sang about what they did, and how they felt. The most basic thing a movie needs to do is grab its viewer, and this movie failed. <br/><br/>A masterpiece of awful.<br/><br/>And yes, I made an account just to say this."

","Take one musical with complex, non-rhyming lyrics, add two dramatic leads with voices fit only for a choir, and what you get is a visually handsome movie without entertainment value. Depp has the fierceness and snarl of a man hell-bent on bloody revenge down pat, and Rickman carries off the part of a covetous, imperious, manipulative tyrant with his usual aplomb. The only off-key performance was Carter, whose lack of energy is noticeable alongside even minor characters. The only truly affecting scene she has is with the street urchin, Toby, whom she's taken in to work in the shop. He sings beautifully of his fidelity to her and his wish to protect her from Todd, which makes her realize, with horror and sadness, that she will have to kill the boy to keep her and Todd's secrets.<br/><br/>And while nobody really sings off key, none of the marquee names sings any better than to carry a tune. Since this is a musical, that's quite a serious flaw, made more obvious by the singing talent of each of the minor characters. Plus, Depp is a tenor, and the role originally called for a bass-baritone, the better to convey Todd's sinister and insane mind.<br/><br/>If there's ever a traveling production of Sweeney Todd, I intend to see it to find what was lacking in the film."

Every single camera angle is imaginative in a way that most directors could only dream of accomplishing. The desaturation of the color frames the mood perfectly, and of course there is Burton's usual contrast with this macabre scene to the brightly lit dreamworld of the pie lady.<br/><br/>The performances are outstanding. Depp and Bonham-Carter are perfectly cast (I wonder if Burton knows there are other actors out there!), and pull off their roles superbly. All support cast are tremendous too, although I must say I'm getting a little bored with Spall's performances - very much a one trick pony.<br/><br/>I'll be first in line when this comes out on DVD. In fact, I may just buy an HD/BluRay player to see this at its best.<br/><br/>(One issue: the picture at my local cinema had a very strange shake throughout, most noticeable when there was a bright area contrasting with the dark around it.

","A visually beautiful, very well choreographed & engrossing drama that is emotionally captivating, but at the same time very dark, violent & saddening to watch, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is, arguably, the darkest musical to come out in cinema history & tells the story of an ordinary man who had everything until a man of power stole his freedom, destroyed his family & banished him for life. And in his sorrow, a new man was born who returns to have his revenge."
"sk8alypse","5","3","6","29 March 2008"," Disappointing
","This movie has a lot of potential but for me all the singing in the movie totally ruins it. I just don't get why this had to be a musical. The effect of the long singing is to dull out the action parts of the movie. Made me want to fall asleep towards the end. And it's too bad because there is a load of talent and potential in this movie.<br/><br/>Some plus sides are that the acting is quite good, especially Johnny Depp. Although, again, the singing in the movie is horrible and pointless almost. Cinematography is also quite good in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall though I just found that the musical aspect of the movie did not fit in well with the action sequences and overall plot development of the movie."
"The_Void","5","3","6","15 March 2008"," Visually stunning, shame about the singing.
","I know a little about ""Sweeny Todd"", but I haven't seen any other films/TV Shows or read any books based on the legend, which makes this my first experience with it; and I'm highly disappointed. The disappointment grows further because this story and Tim Burton's directorial style are clearly a match made in heaven - but for some reason, a terrible decision was made on how the film would work and it's spoilt something that could have been great. I would write a song about this film's main problem - but I'd prefer to clearly state that it's the musical elements that spoil it. The plot is rich with horrific elements and should be a great base for a gory Gothic horror film. We focus on Benjamin Barker; better known as Sweeny Todd, a barber returning to London for revenge against all those that have wronged him. Upon his return to the capital, he meets Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a pie shop where ""The Worst Pies in London"" are made. If I made the worst pies in London, I'd keep my mouth shut about it - but she sings songs instead and unsurprisingly her shop isn't doing very well. Anyway, Sweeny Todd opens up a barbers shop upstairs and his lust for killing soon combines with her need for meat to put in pies.<br/><br/>I have to say that the film looks great. Tim Burton has his own directorial style and it translates to the screen very well here and aesthetically, every scene is a joy to behold. The good points continue with the cast; Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch and he clearly relishes this role, while Mrs Tim Burton; Helena Bonham Carter, does well starring opposite and the director has also done a good job recruiting some good British talent to fill the supporting roles. The film is also rather graphic and Burton provides the viewers with some real nasty sights including a spate of throat slashing that result in blood spraying everywhere, a succession of corpses falling through a trapdoor and hitting the ground with a brutal thud as well as a machine that grinds Sweeny Todd's victims into pie meat. This is all well and good but it all comes down to the execution, and the musical elements really spoil it. Many reviewers have said that the horror and musical elements bode well in this film; but for me it really doesn't work. It comes off as being almost cringe-worthy in places and constantly forced me to ask myself WHY they made this a musical (I know there was a musical version of this story, but there's also several none musical versions). Another problem with the music is that it all sounds very similar and the songs are not very diverse. The first hour or so is really rather boring anyway and the constant singing soon starts to grate. Things improve massively towards the end and despite a couple of songs; the final half hour is really quite good. Overall, I love the atmosphere and the gore of this film - but I can't get on with the musical elements at all, which unfortunately means that a film which could have been a masterpiece is sadly not much better than passable. A shame."
"dan_marsala","9","3","6","6 March 2008"," There Are No Differences!!!!! ""They both deserves to die!!!""
","Why would I lie?? i didn't know anything about Sweeney Tood before this film comes out, and as soon as I know that it was already a musical, I put it in my hands...<br/><br/>And this is exactly the kind of musical I was waiting since long time ago, a bloody one, a creepy one and, for a wile, a scary one (all the closing scene). Id really love it, there is no doubt of why Tim chose it (the Burton's dark stile, the sweet music, the blood, etc.). He made an amazing work with this movie, especially. I mean, how could he get that beautiful voice from Johnny or Alan?? now, that could be the hardest part, maybe. Just, listen Johnny's voice while sings like crazy around the fire in ""pirates of the Caribbeans""... and right now...WHAT???. Every one should know what could be made with Helena's cute voice, but JOHNNY, ALAN...God. Every song in this film were very well done, I was really surprised.<br/><br/>But I keep just a little doubt, since I first watch it, I notice, Judje Turpin knows Benjamin Barker, knows he was a barber (""Benjamin Barker"" he said), always was visiting Lucy at is home and taking her flowers, and now appears Sweeney, in the same house, with a familiar face and with the same job. How couldn't know? He deserves to die!!! But beside that, Im satisfied with my blood desire.<br/><br/>Well, I just still cant chose between live version or movie version, and I think that nobody could do it, 'cuz they're in fact the same thing. Tim didn't change the screenplay, or the music, or the lyrics or the characters (beside Toby), which is GREAT... in fact, he'd reduce some songs and skip some details from the script, but they're the same. And no matter what anyone could told me, I saw no differences between the characters, even if Angela Lansbury locks a little bit more crazy as Miss. Lovett, or Helena Carter more shy, it makes no sense, at the end, is the same character, no better, no worse (Helena prettiest, talk about it later).<br/><br/>And don't even touch the Sweeney character, Johnny and George are uniques in the role. They both are the same demon barber at their own ways, even when George Hearn is already a tenor master and Johnny more like a rock stile (yeaa). They both really scared me, but i guess that the original creator owns the credits.<br/><br/>Well I think that Deep did is best in this role and now he must be thinking in is next musical, definitely, he must cast for another one, he got skills. I'll be waiting for the next dark musical which I hear about, till then this is my very first choice and I hope that Burton made a sequel... (NO, just joking)"
"wolfy_the_black","5","3","6","25 February 2008"," You're Making a Musical, what's Not Theatrical?
","For anybody that knows me, they know that I am a musical theatre geek, and they also know I love Sondheim and this musical in particular, so I was bit miffed when I finally saw this.<br/><br/>Certainly the cinematography was top notch in capturing the dark side of London, as only Mr. Burton can do, and I was dazzled by the camera movements, sets and costumes. I had my reservations with the casting of Johnny Depp for sure, but he surprised me and pulled off the title role wonderfully. The same can be said for Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jayne Wisener, who was a perfect Johanna. The number ""By the Sea"" was probably the best number of the whole movie. Cinematically it was brilliant, and the sullenness of Sweeney coupled with the buoyancy of Mrs. Lovett and Toby made the song a delight to watch. Although the brightness did make my eyes wince a little from the almost total blackness from the first hour and half of the movie.<br/><br/>However that's about where my positives end. Jamie Campbell Bower, who played Anthony, and while a good performer, he had a very effeminate air about him. I mean he looked like a girl with that hair (what is with these movie musicals and the girl hair on the male love interests (Roger in Rent, Raul in Phantom)?), and he sounded like a low alto. The kid who played Toby, while awesome, I thought was too young. It made Pirelli's abuse just sad instead of funny like it should have been (see more about lack of humor below). My biggest casting complaint was definitely with Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. For one thing she talk-sang the entire part, which I could have forgiven had she acted the hell out of the character, but she didn't. Instead all I got was this very tired woman who watched everything happen bemusedly. The whole movie I wanted to go in there and slap her, or give her a Redbull. Anything to wake her up. A completely nepotist miss-cast. I would have loved to have seen what Toni Collette could have done with the role.<br/><br/>Casting issues aside, my biggest complaint was the lack of ensemble. I mean he took out the opening song which sets the mood, and is the freaking' title of the musical. How could you not include ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" in Sweeney Todd? I read that Burton was originally going to have a chorus of ghosts fill the role of ensemble, but it was too theatrical so he dropped it. Too theatrical? You're doing a freaking' musical, what's not theatrical?! The lack of ensemble also made certain songs either lose their luster (like in Pirelli's Miracle Elixer) or questioned the entire point of why it was there (God, That's Good). On that last one, I especially questioned why it was there since half the song, the bit about Sweeney worrying over his new chair, was depicted already. I later heard that Depp and Carter tried to really focus on the music but Burton told them to stop it because it sounds too Broadway. Refer to my above mentioned comment on theatrics. I swear, if Tim Burton hates musicals and all their conventions, why didn't he just do away with the music all together? Get a Danny Elfman score if it'll make him feel better.<br/><br/>The other main beef I had was the fact that Burton took virtually all the humor out and made it darker than it had to be. I mean the show is essentially a black comedy, but all the funny lines were either taken out or made in such a way that it wasn't funny, such as the above mentioned abuse of Toby by Pirelli. The number ""A Little Priest,"" could have been a lot better had they not just looked out a window the whole time pointing at what they were singing about. It's supposed to be their version of foreplay that they delight in, but the direction coupled with half the song cut, the comedic genius of the number was wasted.<br/><br/>Despite all that I said above, I didn't hate the movie. It's just my musical bias. I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out and I already have the soundtrack. The thing is, like I said before, I'm a musical theatre geek so I notice these types of things. My brother, who is certainly not a MT geek, absolutely loved it and apparently the awards deciding public loved it enough to nominate it for top awards already. It's not bad, I was just disappointed with some (most) of Burton's decisions that's all."
"tbaybars","5","3","6","21 February 2008"," cut-throat vulgarity
","Not even the stupid music can save this abominable film from being the worst of this year. It is shot in the fashionable twilight mode which is either an invention by film directors to save on grips and lighting, or they erroneously believe that lack of lighting adds to the atmosphere. Oddly enough, I've just seen yet again in the art-house cinema of Narbonne, In cold blood (Richard Brooks, 1965) which still chills and moves you for the dead and the killers. As relevant as it was at its time (but Sweney will be forgotten by the end of this year), and without gimmickry of lights and irrelevant musical outbursts inspired by Dennis Potter. How could Tim Burton turn out this junk? How could the inimitable Depp accept the role? Do not be deceived by Oscar nominations and others. To share my disgust, go and see it..."
"metalback","10","3","6","25 January 2008"," Sweeney is splendid!!!
","I have seen Sweeney Todd on stage some years ago, I enjoyed it hugely. I thought Johnny Depp's Sweeney was amazing, he sang with so much emotion and skill, a brilliant man!! There were no weak performances here, young Toby, heartbreaking and beautiful, the always incredible Alan Rickman and Helena Bonham Carter who manages to be stunning despite the hair, was chilling in the calm way she entered into the mayhem of the piece. Sweeney IS quite violent with heaps of gore, but you are given enough time to hide your eyes should the need arise. It would be lovely to see Johnny Depp receive that long overdue Oscar, he has proved himself to be a fearless and versatile performer in so many rolls. Tim Burton has outdone himself!!"
"jcbitsas","10","3","6","12 January 2008"," Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd
","The only movie that almost made me throw up! Anyway, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is still an amazing and beautiful film. Johnny Depp is terrific as the tensorial killer. Helena Bonham Carter and Depp both do have beautiful singing voices and Sacha Baron Cohen hams it up as a rival barber that used to know Sweeney, but when he was Ben Barker. SPOILER:In the scene where Sweeney finally kills the fiendish Judge Turpin, Sweeney continuously slashes Turpin's throat and a splurt of blood hits the skylight. Actually, the really sick part of the scene is when Sweeney turns, looks back and as Turpin's neck is still a bloody waterfall, he turns and nearly hacks off Turpin's head. Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's best film and my favorite film."
"diegohernandez","8","3","6","31 December 2007"," Sweeney Todd: Bloody Damn Good Christmas Gift
","If you were to talk to people knowledgeable about Tim Burton and Johnny Depp films, most of them would tell you that such movies are often dark and unique in subject matter. However, they would also concede that the movies are normally whimsical and yet not so heavy at the time. ""Edward Scissorhands"", the tale of an outcast rejected by society? It ends on a somewhat happy note. ""Ed Wood"", the biopic of one of cinema's worst directors? It glorifies Wood as a legend, not as a failure. ""Corpse Bride"", the story of a man torn between his love for a living woman and a ghoul? It was rated PG! Perhaps ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is not the best Burton-Depp collaboration in existence (its up against some formidable siblings: ""Corpse Bride"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Ed Wood"", and ""Edward Scissorhands""), but it is the darkest and a generally great movie. As can be expected, Depp takes his character, and truly becomes him. Not only is his acting top-notch, but it's his looks of contempt and fury that perfects his character. Depp doesn't act like Todd; he is Todd.<br/><br/>Depp may be the most noticeable actor of ""Sweeney Todd"", but the movie also boasts a legion of other high-quality players. Helena Bonham Carter is impressive as Mrs. Lovett, especially considering how she models her character as deluded and foolish. Alan Rickman is villainously heinous as Judge Turpin, and makes his character easy to despise. Sacha Baron Cohen, despite having a limited on-screen presence, stands as one of the highlights when playing the flamboyant Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford is tremendous; everything about him from his dwarfish frame to his sneering face to his naval tone is hideously wonderful. And do not get me started on Ed Sanders, who nearly steals the show with his awe-inspiring talent. Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, and Jayne Wisener round out this incredibly talented cast.<br/><br/>Similar to other Burton films, ""Sweeney Todd"" utilizes brilliant cinematography to emphasize its singularity. In this case, the imagery drives the point home about how depressing the whole story is: the central location of London is portrayed as cold, hard and callous, a concrete jungle where no sun shines and where a shadow always seems to be cast. However, London's look is completely contrary to the movie's short beach sequence, in which suddenly everything is bright, vibrant, and bursting with sunshine.<br/><br/>What also remains vivid in my mind is the wardrobe and costumes, and how they blend so well with some of the characters. Todd and Mrs. Lovett are twisted creatures, and so they look as such. Turpin is a narcissist, compassionless judge , so his character is covered with drab, unaffectionate colors. Bamford is short and repugnant, and resembles a perverse Mad Hatter. What is most astonishing though is the transformation the Toby character undergoes; he goes from looking like a harmless young man to something much more different later on.I will not give the image away, but it is truly haunting.<br/><br/>The bloodshed of ""Sweeney Todd"" is the proverbial nail in the coffin, so to speak. In other words, it is what helps Sweeney Todd to be the awesome movie that it is. If you are a gorehound such as myself, then you will be smiling from ear to ear as neck are split open to the tune of beautiful ballads. An efficient amount of the red stuff is used; not too little to disappoint fans of violence, but not too much to be over the top.<br/><br/>Of course, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a musical, and what would a superb musical be without superb music? Though many of the actors are not professionally trained singers, they all share the same talent, although some more than others. Depp, in particular, can hardly keep himself from exploding with emotion, and he works wonderfully well with Rickman, whose scraggly voice lends itself to a powerful yet elegant tone. Cohen, even with his few lines, is hilarious. However, as previously stated, Sanders is the surprise hit of the film. His lyrical skills will blow you away. The lyrics of ""Sweeney Todd"" are the work of a maniacal genius, and the score is tragically poignant.<br/><br/>It's a shame that ""Sweeney Todd"" hasn't become a box office hit because it deserves to be. ""Sweeney Todd"" is one of the few films that doesn't follow an established formula, and it does so brilliantly. All who worked on ""Sweeney Todd"" gave cinema patrons a worthy Christmas gift; if only the rest of the country realized that.<br/><br/>RATING: ****/*****"
"TOMNEL","9","3","6","21 December 2007"," A wonderful adaptation of a very bizarre play.
","Who better to direct a musical about a barber who slits his patient's throats than Tim Burton? Who better to star as the lead role than Johnny Depp? Actually, quite a few people could have done better in the singing department for Depp's title role, but he still gave a marvelous performance otherwise. The movie was all around really great.<br/><br/>Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a happy man with a wife and daughter. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes his family away for his own. Benjamin returns 15 years later under his new name Sweeney Todd, and he wants revenge on those who wronged him. He meets Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who runs a failing meat pie shop and he opens a barbershop up right above her. Violence, murder, cannibalism and catchy tunes ensue. The acting was good, but the real standout was Helena Bonham Carter who managed to play a murderous character who still managed to be sympathetic. Sacha Baron Cohen plays a small, hilarious over the top the role, and was a great addition to the cast. I had heard that Johnny Depp talk sings all his songs, but that is not true. Even if he isn't the best singer out there, he does actually sing several songs. The music is strange, but catchy, and it fits well with the tone of the movie. As a musical, there are better ones out there, not to say this isn't a good musical. One positive to the film, was the smooth transitions from comedy to drama and violence. The London town looks great, and the dark sepia-toned colors didn't get annoying, and I thought they would.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Sweeney Todd is a bizarre musical, but it made for a great movie that I'd see many more times.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence."

"CelluloidRehab","4","3","7","10 April 2008"," Going against the grain
","First of all I am not a big fan of musicals. I have seen several good ones and many, many bad ones. Where a bad play can induce laughter, a bad musical just induces nausea, anger and boredom. Unfortunately the latter two describe my feelings after watching Sweeney Todd. These feelings were probably accentuated by my dislike for almost anything written by Stephen Sondheim (West Side Story being the exception), Tim Burton's drab, dull, and lifeless direction and unfortunately not one of the actors has much in the way of a gifted voice (I'm sorry Helena, Alan and Johnny).<br/><br/>The story revolves around a gifted barber named Benjamin Barker (Depp) with a beautiful wife and child. The envious Judge Turpin (Rickman) covets Barker's wife and proceeds to frame him to get him out of the way. Barker's innocent wife is taken advantage of and his child becomes the ward of the lecherous Judge. Years pass and Barker returns to London after being released from incarceration. He is now Sweeney Todd and has returned to enact his revenge. He meets Mrs. Lovett (Carter) who becomes his villainous accomplice. If you didn't figure out the predictable plot, his victims become the stuff of the meat pie Mrs. Lovett sells (and yes Soylent Green is made of people too).<br/><br/>I have not seen or heard any of the original musical so I do not have anything to compare this movie to. I can only judge it based on its own merits, of which there are few. Tim Burton (who has a tendency for great visuals but not telling stories well) has created a dull, drab, dirty and lifeless London. You would think with the vast amount of bloodletting in this mostly gray movie, it would show up in vivid and cherry red. Instead it looks like dull paint. I have found Johnny Depp's presence in most movies to make any film better. It sadly fails here. The cast is pretty talented consisting of the aforementioned Depp, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall and even Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen. None of them is particularly gifted vocally (this could also be a limitation of the musical itself, but I doubt it). After seeing the ultimate in revenge movies (Chan-wook Park's trilogy), this movie turns very predictable. Other reviewers talk about the dark comedy aspect of the movie, of which I saw little. Perhaps the musical had some, but it has been completely stripped away by Burton, much like the visual representation of London.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of the movie is the best of the approximately 2 hour runtime, most likely because no one is singing. I would have liked to have seen a version of this movie without the music. An adaption of a musical without the music, now that might have been interesting. That along with the usually talented cast is the sole reason this movie got a rating above 2 in the first place. If you like to be bored, disappointed and annoyed then this movie is perfect for you. I do believe that a film aspires to be the vision of a collaborative effort, with the director at the helm. The goal is to make you see something or feel something they want, not what you want. It is to make you feel something other than what you would be comfortable with. I seriously doubt Tim's vision was to bore, disappoint and annoy. If you are curious about Sweeney Todd skip the movie and go straight for the musical."
"Coventry","9","3","7","25 February 2008"," How would you like your throat cut, sir?
","The films of Tim Burton are always a gift from the heavens (the mediocre ""Planet of the Apes"" being the one notable exception), especially for horror fanatics, since they always strike a happy medium between mainstream production values and availability and yet always revolve on sinister topics. And if there ever was one story that literally begs to receive the typical Burton-treatment, it has got to be ""Sweeney Todd"". The gloomy Victorian setting, the continuous moody atmosphere, the depressing decors, the mentally tormented main characters and the unhinged depiction of shocking murders Â… all these aspects simply have Burton's name written all over them. Sure it's a musical, and this generally isn't considered to be die-hard horror fanatics' favorite genre, but even the smallest detail featuring in ""Sweeney Todd"" makes it damn clear the movie is primarily a genuine horror effort, and even one that is more revolting and macabre than most. Benjamin Barker once lived a life of true happiness. He was married to a beautiful woman with whom he had a cherubic baby girl and he was the most promising young barber in the whole of London. But then the malicious eminent Judge Tulpin spotted his wife and promptly ruined his whole existence. Barker got exiled and Tulpin literally claimed ownership of both his wife and daughter. Now, 15 long years later, Barker returns as a thoroughly embittered person going by the name Sweeney Todd and with only vengeance on his mind, particularly when he learns that his beloved wife poisoned herself and his daughter still lives imprisoned in Tulpin's house. Sweeney forms a diabolical alliance with the eccentric Mrs. Lovett. He cuts the throats of unsuspecting clients and she processes the bodies into meat pies unique in the whole of London. Naturally his rising stardom fetches the attention of Judge Tulpin and soon Sweeney Todd will be able to extract his long-anticipated blood vengeance, but in the meantime a whole lot of new complications arise. ""Sweeney Todd"" is a truly masterful accomplishment and I don't mind admitting I stared at the screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open throughout the entire playtime. I'm usually not a big fan of constant singing myself, but it never once bothered me here because the lyrics of the songs are as grim & disturbing as the plot itself and, moreover, the film is just breath taking to look at. I just found out ""Sweeney Todd"" won the Oscar for best art direction. This has got one of the best well-deserved awards ever handed out during this ceremony, as Burton's movie is almost like a Gothic nightmare coming to life on the big screen. The London streets and alleys never looked so ominous, the people never looked so uncanny and the political corruptness rarely appeared so convincing. Admittedly it takes a while before the blood starts flooding from random throats, but until then there's always the nightmarish atmosphere to keep you thrilled and, besides, the gore-soaked second half widely compensates for everything. The way those bodies came crashing down hard in Mrs.Lovett's cellar after having their throats slit wide open from ear to ear.... that's a real horror film, singing or no singing! The acting performances are flawless and perplexing, even though nobody really expected them to be. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are regular Tim Burton choices, but not at all obvious musical stars, even in spite of their semi-musical roles in ""Corpse Bride"". But still they both leave a big impression and also the (even less obvious) supportive players deliver stellar performances as well. A masterpiece."

","As a director, Tim Burton has made a collection of eccentric and altogether different films that have been greeted with mostly positive praise. He has legions of devoted fans that think him the most brilliant man in the world. His skills have always been considered something special, and altogether different.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is the crowning achievement of his career. If this film does not sweep the Academy Awards, they are some seriously bad judges.<br/><br/>Everything here is done to perfection, creating a world unlike anything you've ever seen. Visually, the film is stunning. Everything from set design to costumes and make-up is done wonderfully. Then there's Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in two of their best roles, giving Oscar-worthy performances. They are also surrounded by a very talented supporting cast. All film-making aspects are put together perfectly.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's the amazing story that makes it something truly incredible. As someone who has never seen the stage show, Sweeney Todd literally took the wind out of me by the end; this tale of the evil of humans and the blinding power of revenge and greed is something you'll never forget. Apart from the leads of Sweeney (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter), there are two smaller characters who work their way in as contrasts to the anti-heroes. They show the desperate hope that people hang onto amidst the evil of men, a hope that can scarcely survive. This is a story of a man blinded by rage and driven to madness. It is at the same time both terrifying, disgusting, and heartbreaking. Not to mention darkly funny.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is probably one of the finest creations ever put on film. The only thing that could hold it back from Oscars is that it is based on previously written material. If it were an original motion picture, there would be no competition. Do yourself a favor and see this masterpiece on the big screen, but don't take the kids: It is, at heart, a horror film. 9/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","A joint venture between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton usually meant money well spent at the movies. ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" are good examples. But this is no longer the case with ""Sweeney Todd"". A poor script, bad singing and excessive blood is the only way to summarize this film. A musical does not have to be this poorly executed and I was quite surprised to see so many critics hailing this film. Even the art direction looks tired with a story lacking any drive. You cannot identify with the characters portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter and Depp, and their motives. Without the novelty of a gory Musical, the story is both simplistic and predictable. By the end, the only motivation left is to write Burton a letter and ask for my money back."
"michaelinps","3","5","15","23 December 2007"," I wanted so much to love this film. I didn't!!!
","I have been anticipating the opening of ""Sweeney Todd"" for the last several weeks. Being a true fan of Sondheim and of ""Sweeney Todd"", I was excited to see Tim Burton's version. I knew it would be visually stunning and it was. Each frame a visual feast. I was quite disappointed, however in the lack of passion and strength in the performances. Johnny Depp's portrayal of ""Sweeney Todd"" lacked the drive and lust that the character requires. This lack of passion and vocal talent was evident throughout. This was most evident when Sweeney is reunited with his razors. That moment should raise the hairs on the back of the neck of anyone watching. Johnny Depp just couldn't take us there. Helena's Mrs. Lovett lacked the crazy, fun, lighthearted feel of the original Angela Landsbury performance. Often times she missed important moments in which humor could break the monotonous dark overtones. I believe Meryl Streep would have been a better choice. The kid playing Toby had a great singing voice and did his best, but in my opinion was too young for the part. I just didn't believe ""Nothin's gonna harm you"". Now for the blood. It was too much and too often. We got the hint after the first kill, must we be beaten in the head with it over and over again. It was not necessary and detracted greatly. On a high note the characters of Anthony, Johanna and Beedle were played to perfection. Well-cast and well acted. I can see how people who were not previously familiar with ""Sweeney Todd"" could give it high marks. But for those of us who have seen stage productions of this fantastic musical, and sat glued to our seats at the beautiful and haunting melodies, the deep rich voices, the passion and the polish, we can't be anything but a bit disappointed."
"DarthVoorhees","5","5","15","21 December 2007"," A visual achievement but that's about it
","All the praise in the world deserves to be given to Set Designer Francesca Lo Schiavo, he should be a shoe in at the Oscar ceremony. Really though he is the only thing worth watching in this film besides for Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>I have immense respect for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp but they haven't done an overly original collaboration since Ed Wood. Depp is an outstanding actor but a so-so singer at best. Burton downscales the music to the point where the numbers are very intimate and small. Tey should be much much grander after all we are adapting a very successful Broadway musical. Some of the great numbers of the play are in closed corners without much dancing or moving around.<br/><br/>Depp is good in the speaking role but overall I felt this is one of his weaker performances. He doesn't create a voice for this character, Depp is using his conversational voice. I love Depp because of his mastery of matching voices with characters. <br/><br/>Carter is easy on the eyes but not on the ears, her singing is more disappointing than Depp's. It's not horrible in fact it's a worthy effort, it's just that you know she doesn't have much experience in this field and that she only got the job because she's sleeping with Burton.<br/><br/>For those concerned about the gore, it looks about the same as your standard Karo syrup solution. It's actually kind of comical because I don't know if they are trying to be realistic or silly. The musical has some dark humor but you can't really tell if it's a black comedy or a tragic musical. It tries to be both ineffectively. Burton couldn't juggle these two genres.<br/><br/>Burton has used this dream team of Depp and Carter to the point where it has become more repetitive and annoying than Scorcesse only using DeNiro or DiCaprio. I know that these two actors weren't the most qualified to tackle these roles. I would have looked to you know someone who actually has some experience in Musical theater. Time for Burton to look back to his Rolodex of actors. Hell I'd even settle for another Keaton collaboration.<br/><br/>Rickman on the other hand is brilliantly cast. He creates another fascinating and unique film. His Turpin is one of the most evil characters he's ever played.<br/><br/>I realize I'm in the minority about this film but here's my opinion for what it's worth."
"indogeniclegal","1","4","11","18 July 2009"," Meaningless Violence
","I took all the time to register with IMDb so I could write a comment and warn prospective viewers about this film. I am an admirer of Burton movies, and when I read about this movie I thought it would be something similar to the Illussionist (not Burton's), a movie I liked immensely. I like historical movies, old cities and stories about them, so I decided to see this movie.<br/><br/>What I got was a horrible, gory, bloody and utterly meaningless movie. This movie does not entertain, it does not charm, it does not thrill, and it does not make a human being laugh. There is no plot, no serious climax, no wonder or awe or amusement. There is just a lot of blood sprouting out of throats of men, and then cannibalism and other such horror.<br/><br/>I wonder what Burton was thinking, what the Oscar people were thinking, and what Sondheim was thinking, as well. There are violent things that happen in the world. But if you depict violence in such a fashion that almost goes beyond reality, you actually create real violence just like some of these American serial killers.<br/><br/>Intention to crime is being punished these days, though there is much doubt as to the verifiability of such intention. But this movie leaves one in no doubt that there is a sick mind at work here. I feel sick having watched this movie, and will immediately buy an electronic hair/shaving kit to spare myself from going to a barber."
"crazymother","2","4","11","20 March 2008"," Bloody Boring!
","There seems to be a tendency for movie fans to label ""great"" anything that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborate on. This is the only reason I can think of that ""Sweeney Todd"" has been ranked so highly on this site. I am a big fan of both Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, but this does not cloud my judgment. Sweeney Todd is an average film at best. Like all Tim Burton films the imagery is beautifully dark but surely at this stage this is the least we expect of the man. Apart from the cinematography there was little else I liked about it.A rolling stones-like English accent and Gothic make-up does not constitute a brilliant performance in my book.<br/><br/>The scenes were repetitive, especially when the killings began; this was more boring than horrific. Little effort was made to move past the imagery of the deep red blood contrasting with the dark setting. It seemed that Burton thought that this was enough to keep the audience satisfied. It wasn't. A man sitting near me in the cinema actually fell asleep for half the film and I didn't blame him.<br/><br/>Ultimately I thought the film was mediocre and I won't be watching it again. I am still a fan of Tim Burton though and hope his next project is a vast improvement on this one. Sweeney Todd will no doubt appeal to Burtons many Gothic fans who will worship the man regardless but for other less ardent fans this is possible one to miss, or watch once to satisfy curiosity."

","This film based on Stephen Sondheim's musical was inspired by music by the great Bernard Hermann has taken fifteen years to get made. Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker who gets arrested, wrongly convicted and deported to Australia after a Judge Turpin played by Alan Rickman decides he wants his wife and their baby. Eventually Barker returns to England as a dark and macabre character with a new name Sweeney Todd and is intent on revenge on the Judge for taking away his happy family life and business as a barber. Sweeney Todd returns to his old business and meets the shop owner Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who tells him that his wife took poison to kill herself and that his baby daughter has grown up and is in the care of Judge Turpin who now has decided he wants the child to be his woman. Sweeny becomes a new barber and kills his customer in this insane killing spree whilst Mrs Lovett makes meat pies from the human carcases. The flows like cheap plonk and spurts here and there. Eventually Sweeney kills Mrs Lovett for lying about his wife's death and then inadvertently kills his wife but not for getting revenge on the Judge. <br/><br/>This contemporary slasher version of ""Rocky Horror"" show did deserve an Oscar for art direction as it depicts the true grit of 19th century London. Its a very simple and gory film with predictable outbreaks of forgettable musical genre songs however those females obsessed with Johnny Depp's looks will declare this a masterpiece due to their misguided and childish adulation. In fact in most cases Depp is a very ordinary but highly entertaining actor who chooses weird character roles where overacting and over animation are expected. I have enjoyed much of Burton's works immensely especially ""Mar's Attacks"" and forgive him for this fairly mediocre film. Both Burton and Depp can afford to make movies of this type at this stage of their careers as they know they have a captive audience. Retro Goths will also enjoy it."

","There's a hole in the world like a great black pit, and the vermin of the world inhabit it, and it's morals aren't worth what a pin can spit"". - Sweeney Todd <br/><br/>I couldn't have said it any better, or any worse. This lyric, sung by Sweeney Todd during his intro to the film, not only sets the theme of the movie, but also offers insight into a man beaten, jaded and tormented by societies' ill will. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is such a man--one who's back-story is so horrifying that it dares you to not empathize with him, begging the question: How far will one go in the name of revenge? <br/><br/>On a lighter note, there is a lot of spirited singing. Based on the musical of the same name, ""Sweeney Todd; The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is the most recent vision of Tim Burton--a director who's been fascinated by the musicals' macabre sensibilities since the early 80's. And no one does macabre like Tim Burton. Much like Hitchcock films were branded ""Hitchcokian"" for their uniquely brilliant style, this film is undoubtedly Burton's most ""burtonesque"". So, as a huge fan of Burton's Gothic masterpieces {Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Sleepy Hollow}, and having no problem with his uh, burtonesqueity, this film is more than a welcomed return to his dark morose side after his slight deviation from it over the last 8 years.<br/><br/>This in mind, Burton, in his Gothic element, does not fail to deliver. But, given the fact that world of the original play was such a perfect fit for Burton, re-creating the gloomy universe seemed less of a case of inspiration, as much as it was an exercise in humble restraint and modest eccentric touches. Thankfully, Burton makes a wise choice to take somewhat of back seat to an actor's film. And, rest assured, ""Sweeney Todd"" is an actors film. As for the major players, Johnny Deep once again proves he can do anything by singing all his songs while giving another top notch performance. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helen Bonham Carter also do an amazing job of balancing their singing an acting. Yet the most impressive thing about the film is the pacing and maintenance of the original play's story line.<br/><br/>Indeed, the storyline, much like Todd himself, maintains a thematic-focus on the old adage: ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"". It reveals the cyclical nature of corruption; moralistically asking to refrain from apathetically disregarding others, but more importantly, it reveals the 'black pit' that humanity is capable of creating...which makes serving human meat pies a just desert. Get it?....No? Fine."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is Tim Burton's best. It's exciting, it's dark, and it's awesome. There were many moments where I wanted to cheer. There are a ton of songs in Sweeney Todd, most of them by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonahm Carter. Which is a very good thing. Sweeney Todd is the story of Benjamin Barker. Benjamin had it all... a wife, a child. Until one day, Judge Turpin( the great Alan Rickman) puts him in jail because he has a thing for his wife. Fifteen years later, things have changed. His barber shop is now a meat pie shop run by Mrs. Lovett(the great Helena Bonham Carter). His wife is gone and his daughter was adopted by Turpin. So Benjamin changes his name to Sweeney Todd and seeks revenge on the man who destroyed his life. Johnny Depp makes one of his best performances as Todd. Helena Bonham Carter gives one of her best performances as Mrs. Lovett. Every moment in this film is plausible. It's on my favorite's list for many reasons and it deserved a best picture nomination at the Oscars. I think it should've won. The problem with it is Anthony, a sailor that looks like he could pass off as a drag queen. He is in love with Todd's daughter Johanna. They have these stupid pointless songs that I don't care about. I give Sweeney Todd a humongous recommendation."

","In my opinion, it is the Hamlet of today. Tim Burton should have the reputation for being meticulous in his production of work, because he is. Every element is considered, no matter the medium.<br/><br/>I am a person who cannot stand a play that is sung, a musical production, but for once, I was stunned and absolutely amazed. That in itself is a triumph of the film, but what became of this movie was more, a beautiful credit to story telling.<br/><br/>The idea that Sweeney Todd was at his most vulnerable when a man identified him as himself is brilliant. Not when his throat is cut by a child but by an observant individual that he is forced to overcome by physical means. It is a tribute to the blindness of men.<br/><br/>The ending I adore for one reason- everyone gets what they want."

Nice mood and art direction and singing and all that. But Deep really blows the ""My Friend/ Now I am one"" song. Doesn't compare with the George Hearn. In fact, as things progress, he is nowhere as sympathetic as Hearn portrays the Demon Barber.<br/><br/>And then the killing starts. And its like South Park blood. And corpses falling on their heads and flopping on their necks. Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone took over directing duties. Over and over again. Every killing never fails to show the bodies falling on their heads or necks.<br/><br/>Some nice moments (Nellie's seduction of Sweeney, his death) stand in stark contrast to the over-the-top ones.

","I understand that the movie and stage play are very popular, and I agree that the music, acting, and so on are excellent. But I am totally put off by the grisly scenes of murder. The comic point-of-view does not for me justify the wholesale and rather pointless murders of innocent victims, and the ""poetic justice"" at the end, when Sweeney Todd himself dies, was a completely extraneous device intended perhaps to make the story seem less morally bankrupt than it truly is. I do wish the blood and gore had been more off stage, because the songs are wonderfully melodic and the lyrics at times very funny.

","Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a talented barber who returns to London after 15 years to wreak bloody revenge on Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and his nasty cohort Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall)the men who imprisoned him for a crime he didn't commit, and took away his wife and child.<br/><br/>As Sweeney Todd, the vengeful barber sets up business above a run-down pie shop (owned by his admirer Mrs. Lovett, played by Helena Bonham Carter), where he plans to lure his unsuspecting victims and cut their throats with his trusty open razors.<br/><br/>After a practice throat-slashing session on a unscrupulous business rival leaves him with a body to dispose of, Todd develops a convenient working relationship with the infatuated shop owner below, who is always in need of a fresh supply of cheap meat. As the barber's seething hatred for mankind grows, and he proceeds to provide 'very' close shaves for all of his customers, so Mrs. Lovett finds herself with a never-ending supply of filling for her pastries.<br/><br/>With plenty of practise under his belt, and a nifty tip-up chair for sending victims directly to Mrs. Lovett's basement, Todd concentrates his efforts on evening the score with Turpin and Bamford.<br/><br/>Based on the Broadway show by Stephen Sondheim, Sweeney Todd is a violent, dark, and twisted musical about unrequited love and retribution, as seen through the eyes of Hollywood's resident goth director, Tim Burton. The result is a rather uneven offering: a very imaginative and visually impressive movie (as one might expect from Burton), but one unfortunately marred by the director's tendency to concentrate on style over content, poor casting of the lead roles (Depp and Bonham Carter look the part, but struggle to carry a tune), some occasionally leaden pacing, and not enough in the way of memorable songs.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from too much coincidental plot contrivance and a rather long running time.<br/><br/>But it's not all bad news: there are some great turns from some of the supporting players (Sascha Baron Cohen proves that once again he is a force to be reckoned with, as rival barber Pirelli; Spall is brilliantly slimy and loathsome as Beadle; and newcomer Ed Sanders gives a confident performance as Toby, the young lad who discovers the terrible truth about Mrs. Lovett's secret ingredient) and the bloodletting is delightfully juicy, with plenty of arterial spray to please the gore-hounds amongst us.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, but not good enough to convince me to round it up to 7 for IMDb (at least until I've watched it a couple more times)."

","I do not hold the opinion that only fans' or experts' views count, Tim Burton is an acquired taste and it will never be mine. Often appraised as an original and revolutionary filmmaker, he always creates a slight variation of his dark Gothic fantasy world, nothing more.<br/><br/>Truly innovative directors are able to succeed in many genres with bravura, Mr. Burton does not. And for that reason he is not yet among the great directors such as De Palma, Stone, Coppola, and the other legends.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy/musical with a Depp in the form of his life. He is Sweeney Todd and rightly won the Golden Globe for it. Of course the whole looks attractive, the set designs are wonderful and the cinematographer deserves mention too, but it simply bored me out of my mind. I simply don't see how it's possible to mess up such a great concept, Johnny Depp as a throat-slicing vengeful barber, whose victims are then baked into pies, each profession apparently having a different flavor. Sounds sensational, but every time the actors opened their mouths to heave another badly chanted song, I was ashamed in place of the actors. Sure, the lyrics were cute but every time a song began it took me out of the hypnosis of the story, and it was very funny (unintentionally unfortunately).<br/><br/>To be fair I never have and never will like musicals. It doesn't help that Depp hasn't got any more talent than the average American Idol contestant. Even the deliciously dark humor couldn't save the movie, it bored me out of my mind and though it wasn't the train wreck I anticipated, it's pretty disappointing. The film just loses me after the first act, there's a lot of repetition and the story felt uninspired and in the end it was...predictable. For the final plot twists to be surprising, they shouldn't have covered up the 'old' woman's face so excessively.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to lose hope of Burton every being up to the task of outdoing his best movie so far, Big Fish.

","I just came back from watching Sweeney Todd (if you're wondering why I've only seen it now - I'm from Austria and the movie just came out this weekend).<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start! Well, I'll just begin with the singing. I've already heard a lot from the soundtrack before watching the movie tonight, but I was still completely awestruck by the performance of the actors. Johnny Depp (who is my favourite actor) has not only an amazing talent to act, but also - as many of you already stated - can sing wonderfully! Of course he doesn't always hit every note but he puts so much emotion in his every word and expression that you can just sit there open-mouthed and wonder how one man can do that to you. When he sang ""Epiphany"" I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen for even a second. The rage, the desperation, the disappointment of having lost the opportunity to kill the Judge - everything was just there in his voice, in his face and in his whole body. I felt for him in every scene - especially at the ending. I already knew from reading so much about Sweeney Todd before watching it that the Beggar woman was his wife and at the end when she was in his shop and he came in with his razor I immediately knew what was going to happen and I just muttered underneath my breath, ""Oh my god, oh my god - don't do it!"" And then, when he realized that he killed his wife I was near to tears. It is so tragic and ironic that he killed her after wanting nothing else than to avenge her... I really, really hope that Johnny Depp gets the Oscar this year (after being robbed of it for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow). He deserves it so much for this tragic and sad character he brought to life.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter was also perfect in this role. I loved her voice - especially in ""The Little Priest"". Her vision about life at the sea was also too funny! <br/><br/>Ed Sanders was so adorable! I love him and I hope we'll see more of him in the next few years! I wanted to hug him and hold him when he sang about protecting Mrs. Lovett in ""Not while I'm around"". His performance was great! <br/><br/>And not to forget - Mr. Alan Rickman! God, there are no words to describe how much I love his voice! Not only when he sings (which he does very, very well) but also when he just talks. He has such a deep, sultry voice! I loved the scene where he and Johnny Depp sang ""Pretty Women"". Their voices sounded perfect together and the whole scene was thrilling - everyone was just waiting for Sweeney to slit his throat and the Judge just sat there not knowing what was coming - and then of course Anthony burst in and I didn't know if I should sigh in relief or be just as mad as Sweeney became after that.<br/><br/>The make-up and the cinematography were brilliant. I think everyone behind the scenes did an amazing job just as all the actors. Tim Burton really does know how to make dark movies with such black humour it leaves you cringing sometimes.<br/><br/>All in all I can only say that this is now my absolute favourite movie of all time! I was never overwhelmed this much before and I think a big part of the reason for that is that it's a musical! I pity everyone who doesn't watch this absolutely amazing, astonishing movie because it's a musical. It is so much more - believe me!"

","If you have a taste for a dark tale, with lashings of blood, an unquenchable sadness, that leads to terrible deeds, then this is the film for you. The singing was wonderful, and there is so much humour in the lyrics; thank goodness that the actors took so much trouble learning to sing. Helena Bonham-Carter is fantastic as Sweeney's partner in crime; her singing is astonishing, as her words don't get lost in a warble of sound, but rather trip across the ears to amuse the audience.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is dark, completely focused of his awful quest. His singing is also a revelation, strong where it needs to be, with a menacing undertone. He wields his razors with the grace of a flamenco dancer, but they leave a lethal trail right across the story.<br/><br/>I adore Tim Burton's touches of humour, and his dark, Victorian vision makes this film a fitting companion to his back catalogue. The other actors all fitted their characters like a glove, with Ed Sanders and Timothy Spall deserving special mention for bringing a comic touch to their horrible creations. Can't wait for the DVD and all the extras!"

","Tim Burtons adaptation of the Broadway musical thriller ""Sweeney Todd"" is nothing short of genius. Johnny Depp scowls, sings, and slashes his way stunningly throughout. Whilst Helena Bonham-Carter as Mrs.Lovett provides the perfect delusional partner in crime, disposing of his victims by baking them in pies and serving them to the unsuspecting London public, for love.<br/><br/>Stephen Sondheims masterpiece first opened on Broadway in 1979 starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. Audiences were stunned and thrilled by the ground breaking score and titilated by the gruesome story based on the old London legend of ""Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". The films main cast are not Broadway vocalists, however this does not detract from the work, indeed it suits it well in this form as not to put off anyone not familiar or comfortable with ""muvicals"". The young supporting cast Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders do have theatrical voices however which brings a nice touch to the more tender if uneasy moments of the story. Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are delightfully demonic and loathsome as the villains who are responsible for Sweeneys cataclysmic character change into the murderous revenge seeking barber. I particularly liked the extra scene (not in the stage production) written for Judge Turpin ( Rickman) which enphasizes his black hearted villainy. Sasha Baron Cohen will surprise many with his fleeting and nearly scene stealing appearance.<br/><br/>This film is truly a work of art on all levels, and one can feel the loyalty to Sondheims creation throughout. Purists of the stage production may well miss the material that has been left out, but I'm sure they will also agree that for Tim Burtons vision of the terrible tale, the focus needed to be fixed on the main characters and peripheral choruses would detract and not enhance on film. This is a bloody terrific and terrifying treat for anyone over 18 ( and not squeamish!).<br/><br/>The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com"

","Benjamin Barker returns to London, years after being framed by a judge who lusted after his wife. Taking the name of Sweeney Todd, he plans revenge against the judge, while at the same time begins a killing spree that supplies fresh meat to Mrs. Lovett's pie shop.<br/><br/>Based on the musical by Stephen Sondheim and with a screenplay by John Logan, Tim Burton has made a Gothic horror movie, that could easily be seen as a tribute to the Hammer Studio's movies. The mood is atmospheric, it's bloody as hell, and has an ending truly fitting with the piece.<br/><br/>Johhny Depp is good as Todd, acting and singing the part well. Helena Bonham Carter gives good support as Mrs. Lovett, as do Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen. All the actors do their own singing, which means that the voices aren't always the best, but the movie is better for that. And for a musical there's no big dance sequences. I don't know, as I've not seen this on stage, if there are actually any in the musical but I'm glad there is none in the movie. It would have slowed down the tale, and in truth not really fitted in.<br/><br/>As I said, Burton doesn't skimp on the blood, as it sprays across the screen during numerous throat slashings. Burton has admitted to a love of Hammer movies, and this shows through-out the movie. You could almost picture Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in the middle of all this! From a story point of view, there is a slight twist towards the end, which in truth is easy to see coming, but you don't mind little flaws like that.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and while not a great musical fan, I really enjoyed it."
"blackburnj-1","9","2","4","19 January 2008"," Stylish and macabre musical that effortlessly entertains
","Tim Burton is a master of style and he brings all of his experience and talent to bear here. Supported by brilliant performances and impressive music, Burton's ""Sweeney Todd"" is a really fine piece of cinematic entertainment.<br/><br/>It is a masterclass from Burton as a director. He toys with the audience's feelings, sympathies and ideals, all the while immersing them in world that is grim, unforgiving and twisted. He shocks and entertains and creates humour out of horror. The film looks fantastic, makes you laugh and is pumped with violence and shock-horror. The make-up and the costume are brilliantly monochrome, but the Gothic design of the film as a whole is ingenious, all, ultimately, down to Burton's skill and imagination. From the bloody title sequence to the bloody end, Burton is always in control and never puts a foot wrong.<br/><br/>The story of a wronged man's descent into madness and murder is a classic fable that requires a central performance that has to be entirely believable and Burton gets this from Johnny Depp who is, quite simply, superb. His performance remains human, even through Todd's darkest moments, and this is crucial, as an inhuman Todd loses all sympathy. Depp holds that sympathy. He is pitch-perfect and every shot that focuses on him is filled with interest.<br/><br/>Depp is brilliantly supported, chiefly by Bonham Carter who is excellent and has tangible chemistry with Depp, both of whom eek out humour at any opportunity. Then there are the trio of established English thesps, Rickman, Spall and Baron Cohen. Rickman is a convincing villain, though you get the sense that his usual venom is somewhat subdued, though he is still entertaining. Timothy Spall is chillingly creepy and Baron Cohen is hilarious in his small but memorable role. But mention must be made of the young Ed Sanders, as the workhouse boy who has a difficult role which he pulls off extremely well.<br/><br/>All of them sing well, with Sondheim's music, beautiful and engrossing, filtering into the film effortlessly. Some of them sing brilliantly (Depp and Bonham Carter especially), bringing humour or emotion to the songs whenever required, which is essential. The music is also brilliantly orchestrated, emphasising the tone.<br/><br/>All of these elements build up the brilliant climax in this wonderful, macabre and entertaining piece of work; more than solid, darkly comic and pretty satisfying fare. I urge you to see it  not for the squeamish, but utterly enjoyable."

Burton's penchant for rich set design isn't a surprise, yet the film still leaves you in awe with its vividly arresting scenery, exquisite wardrobe, solid casting, and terrific songs.

The music? As expected from one of the greatest musical writers of our time  Steven Sondheim. But for me the direction was spasmodic, especially in the first part of the story. It felt as if the audience were rushed into the tale itself and certain scenes were too short and 'staged' to maintain momentum.<br/><br/>Best performance came from Jamie Campbell Bower as the love torn sailor  showing enough emotion required for cinema. Timothy Spall did a great job as the slimy Beadle, as did Alan Rickman as the perverted Judge.<br/><br/>It seems that Burton tried to dilute stage expressions to such a degree that they were non-existent, especially from Helena Bonham Carter in the opening scenes. She appeared to be there only for the pay cheque.The boy apprentice, Toby, was also under-directed during his songs, but otherwise did a good job.<br/><br/>Although the film is entertaining and Depp is an acceptable Sweeney, the overall flow is slightly disjointed for newcomers to this tale.

","""My one true friend!"" as Sweeney Todd sings this line, leering into the mirror, viewing the reflection of himself, in the polished silver, straight edged, razer he holds tenderly in his hand, close to his demonic face, once again after 18 years of incarceration, a sardonic smile appears. The audience knows that blood will flow, and lives will be lost, in a revenge driven musical, based on the original play by Stephen Sondheim. Johnny Depp takes on the persona of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, with such ease one would almost imagine he was not play acting at all. Joining Mr. Todd is the lovely (sic) Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who joins him in this lively but deadly, duet. Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett make a handsome couple, although their facial colors are a bit ashen, and the circles about their eyes are rather dark, non the less they seem quite appropriate, for working class folk in the mid-1800s, in London, England.This 'R' rated opera is lavishly funny, with ghoulish glimpses, of blood curdling buffoonery, and musical merriment, although, it is difficult to hear all of the wonderful lines, in the verses in the songs, while one is laughing, from the previous lines,while listening to the quick witted phrases currently being sung by our favorite, devilish duo. Mrs. Lovett runs a bakery, specializing in meat pies on Fleet Street. She allows Mr. Todd to use the room above her Estblisment to ply his close cutting trade. This gives rise to a fresh supply, and a new ingredient, for Mrs. Lovett's now fiendishly good meat pies, and an increase in business. Special notice must be given to the performances by, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Ed Sanders. Be forewarned; this is not everyones tea cake. Sweeney Todd does get carried away while shaving some of his customers, too closely!"

This film almost practically being a bloodbath for me was awesome to watch. Other highlights of this film are the performances of all the actors and their signing. Its great to see another film where Depp kills people!! Burton is a great director and did a fine job making this film. Another exciting bit is seeing Cohen's character getting killed right off the bat. The only thing about the film which surprised me was that Sweeney dies at the end, but obviously we know after watching the film that was expected. He kills his wife and everything!! Based on a true story, there is nothing really wrong with this film. Burton is an awesome director who should continue to produce films like this!! One last thing in which is cool is that Depp is from Kentucky and can talk with a cool accent! Hey if it isn't the bloodbath that gets you, you should be impressed by the singing!!!

","I had to sit through two screenings of ""Sweeney Todd"" to erase my memories of the Broadway cast (I saw the New York stage company in 1979, with the magnificent Anglela Lansbury and Len Cariou in the leads.) But I came to appreciate the unique approach of Tim Burton's cinematic ""Sweeney Todd"" and to judge it on its own merits. It's a delight. Depp and Bonham Carter are superb actors, and their untrained, light singing voices somehow suit the intimacy of the silver screen. One thing I wish the film had is a greater sense of fun with the waltz number, ""A Little Priest"". The Broadway Todd and Lovett were clearly entertaining themselves with their macabre speculations in that song, laughing and smirking their way through Sondheim's fiendishly funny lyric. But in the film, that song lost much of its ""black comedy"", merely retaining its ""blackness"". As if to atone for draining ""A Little Priest"" of its lightheartedness, Burton has discovered new levels of comic relief and irony in the song ""By the Sea"". About Helena Bonham Carter  She won me over. Her Mrs. Lovett was a sexy corpse of a woman. Whereas Lansbury had provided a sort of burlesque comic-relief in the role, Bohnam Carter's Mrs. Lovett had much more pathos. Hers was a woman who obviously had been beaten-down into a state of malaise by years of hard-scrabble struggle to survive. And, although the superb young Ed Sanders out-sang Bonham Carter in the achingly beautiful duet ""Not While I'm Around"", the tears in Bonham Carter's anguished eyes, at the end of that song, haunted me as I left the cinema. Overall, the bombastic Broadway incarnation of ""Sweeney"" and the new, intimate screen version of ""Sweeney"" are vastly different animals, but each one roars like hell!"

I felt that Helena Bonham Carter was particularly impressive in this picture and she added a much needed lightness to the material. Johnny Depp does fine with singing. Sacha Baron Cohen was quite bizarre. The first half of the film was rather stylish and moving, with barely any on-screen violence, but the second half was just an all out blood feast, littered with spraying arteries, broken bones, and sliced flesh. It's all rather foul, but the film still feels alive despite having a lot of washed out colors and pale skin. If you don't mind A LOT of blood and gore, it's probably worth seeing. But there were parts that really grossed me out. Still, the violence didn't ruin the film for me. Check it out. It has some neat songs."
"etsm92","7","2","4","1 January 2008"," Sweeney Todd: Sweeney Blood
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street/2007/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Sweeney Todd: Johnny Depp Mrs. Lovett: Helena Bonham Carter Judge Turpin: Alan Rickman<br/><br/>Tim Burton calls it The Sound of Music with blood. Indeed it is. Lots and lots of blood. However, it wasn't the color of real blood: dark, cherry red. It instead had a much brighter red color and it was of thinner volume.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of sadistic violence. There's absolutely no point to it. But I decided to go and see it and I saw graphic, bloody violence. And it will be that way and there's no turning back. I do not recommend this film to anyone who has that same thought. It is and is supposed to be disturbing and dark. What do you expect from director Tim Burton? He is dark-minded and apparently likes to show sadistic violence to a certain longer extent.<br/><br/>There was one reason why I wanted to see this film. I like Tim Burton. His films are very entertaining and this was entertaining. But I have to admit I hate pointless violence or any violence for that matter because I see it as evil, sadistic and highly immoral. Excuse all the bloodthirsty, sadistic people out there that like to see this type of stuff. Go ahead and see it.<br/><br/>So why did I recommend this film? I found the music, the directing, acting and even some of the macabre humor to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is very versatile and played his part to perfection and so did all the other actors. The acting could have not been better. The entire picture is very impressive, so one should expect from a bloody big budget film like this.<br/><br/>It is a marginal recommendation. The film is dark, evil, and disturbing. It's ghastly. But it is meant to be that way. This is based on a musical by Stephen Sondheim and based on the play by Christopher Bond. Who knows? Maybe Sweeney Todd was a real demon barber and he slit people's throats, had the people grinded, put into meat pies, had people eat them at Lovett's (Carter's) restaurant then have the people that just ate the people come up, get a shave and a haircut (HA) and get recycled.<br/><br/>Doesn't the story sound lovely? Lovely and bloody? Yes. It would actually come across to me as not surprising if I found out Benjamin Barker (changed name to Sweeney Todd when he wanted revenge) was a real person. If this whole thing was made up, then Christopher Bond is one messed up fellow or just highly original.<br/><br/>But hey, there are insane people in the world like Benjamin Barker. But he was sane until he was separated from his love and child by the person (Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)) he desperately loathed. Was he satisfied? In a way, yes.<br/><br/>If this story was made up then I will say to Christopher Bond that it is highly original. I have never seen anything like it before. If it is real, however, then I will say that God have mercy on Benjamin Barker's soul, who was obviously an insane man clouded from logic thoughts by his vengeful attitude because he loved his wife and child so much and hated Turpin to death.<br/><br/>Johanna (Todd's daughter) was held captive by Turpin and Todd's friend and comrade who came across to London with him loved her. But Turpin held her as his prisoner which made Todd madder at him and, well, proved that he didn't care who he slit. DEMON!<br/><br/>The film is a melancholy tragedy. It is disturbing, dark and sad. I felt a slight pity for all the people that were slit. Because, again, this could all have really happened. It's a horrifying thought really but so is the world.<br/><br/>So if you're expecting a happy musical with jolly moments, happy conflicts, climaxes, and resolutions, then you're on a fool's mission. This film is deep and dark and thrilling and musical at the same time. It is produced well with the Tim Burton style to it.<br/><br/>That's what I saw it for. Tim Burton has an ingenious visual talent, symbolic, and, in this, dark and evil.<br/><br/>I hate violence. I like movies. It evens out to a positive rating. Movies overthrow the violence because movies are escapisms and violence is life. Life is unfair. Violence is unfair. Movies are a different form of life. Something you can soak yourself into for two hours or three and walk out with either a happy, or sad, or angry, or nauseous, or scared, or neutral feeling. I think I felt all those. I like movies. This is a movie. I try not to look at it as a real thing but sometimes you do. And even Sweeney Todd can't stop me there.<br/><br/>Movie directed by Tim Burton."

I won and we watched ""Sweeney Todd"". I really liked it, and my wife was very happy that I made her watch it.<br/><br/>(SLIGHT SPOILERS>>>>>>>>>>>)<br/><br/>The movie is centered around Depps' character (Sweeney Todd). It is the story of how he had a beautiful wife and daughter, and was the town barber. However a corrupt judge had seen Todd's wife and wanted her for himself. So he has Todd charged with false charges and sent of to prison. While he is gone to prison, the judge attempts constantly to win her affection. Finally he gets her to a party and rapes her. She then poisons herself. The judge adopts the daughter as his own, and pretty much keeps her a prisoner in his house.<br/><br/>The movie centers around Sweeney Todd coming back to that town and finding out what has happened to his wife and daughter. He sets out for revenge. He decides he wants to open his barber shop back up and get the judge in the chair for a shave, so he can kill him. However, after killing another man who tries to blackmail him,... and a little later, a failed attempt on the judge,............ he pretty much goes completely crazy and decides that no body is innocent and that everyone deserves to die.<br/><br/>He is helped throughout the movie by a woman who back pies (the worst pies in all of London). A woman who knows his real identity, and apparently had a crush on him along time ago, before he went off to prison. Together, he kills the people off one by one....... and she gets rid of the evidence and at the same time starts making some of the best meat pies in all of London.<br/><br/>(End Spoilers)<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of musicals,.... but this didn't bother me.

","Oh lovely day! Here is a Hollywood romance that I hope lasts.<br/><br/>Two aspects of this production: the magical triangle of Burton, Depp, Carter, and the music of Sondheim. The latter I'm not familiar with, outside of those Madonna-sung torch numbers in ""Dick Tracy."" The music here is fine, I suppose, but the musical is just canvas, anyway. It's that first aspect that excites me.<br/><br/>It's easy to accuse Burton of being more a production designer than a valid film director, but when compelling visions of alternate worlds in the cinema are so infrequent, need that be a bad thing? He's a man whose work I decided to follow from early age and it's a film-going relationship that's been peppered with a few successes and some appealing failures (his low point was ""Planet of the Apes""). With his design-first mentality, his cinematic approach is one that appeals to me: matters of story and character are secondary to the development of engaging film environments, ones worth the consideration of our time and our willingness to enter.<br/><br/>Yes, it doesn't always click, as he hasn't consistently integrated movement and coherence with his elaborate set-work. But he's getting better, and this is his most accomplished film since the two Batman movies, anomalous achievements considering he neither matched nor topped either in the last fifteen years.<br/><br/>I think partner Carter and friend Depp are instrumental in this evolution. Helena's always been a lively and intelligent actress, and her collaborations with Burton find them seeking out meat worthy of her supporting talent and his artistic growth. Added to this is the allure of watching a filmmaker construct loving visual tributes to his significant other. See the way Helena is photographed here, exuding that unorthodox but undeniable sensuality of hers, quite apropos for the Burton style but not a grotesque transformation of her image. Rather, he draws out a beauty heretofore muted, even when she was being similarly appraised through the lens by ex-boyfriend Branagh.<br/><br/>Depp is here in all his introspective glory. He's usually been the one at the forefront of Tim's ventures down the more intriguing paths.<br/><br/>Together, the three of them descend on Sondheim -- highly melodramatic, quite predictable -- and turn it into a feast of multiple projections of reality. Depp as barber and as actor who invents a past idea of the barber as anything but the vengeful ghoul, tangling with Carter as lovelorn vamp who secretly controls and motivates actions in the plot. Burton assuming the stance of Depp's imagined ghost (that of the tormented ""dead"" wife), always in the odd corners of every scene, observing from all angles, freeing the theatrical environment from the limits of its stage origin, and then intruding at the climax with the driving hammer of fate. We as audience have the option of moving anywhere among these multiple vantages, all pooled into a coherent world of Victorian goth, probably Burton's most coherent evocation to date. We can be predator or prey. Rickman, Cohen, Spall, the young lovers, the boy -- all simply the prey.<br/><br/>Burton's eye here is highly architectural, very Langian. If you've never attached yourself to this man's work, now may be the time. I anticipate great things from here on.<br/><br/>Blake's rating: 3 (out of 4)"

I think it is an excellent adaptation of the stage musical, though it does lack a chorus. But the chorus probably would not have worked with Tim Burton's conception of the film anyway. In one way the film is better than the stage production. It is more tightly knit, probably due to the elimination of the chorus. <br/><br/>The cast was outstanding. Depp's portrayal of Todd's transition from a simple desire for vengeance against Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford into an insane desire to kill anyone in the upper classes is marvelous.<br/><br/>If you can stomach the gore(I think it is the most gruesome film I've ever seen), I recommend it highly."

To the contrary. He played the role well and carried that film like a master. The cynicism in some people can be a real barrier sometimes, so DON'T FALL FOR IT.

"emwolf","8","2","4","28 December 2007"," An Excellent Movie Version
","Many times the movie adaptations of the stage tend to seem almost desperate in attempts to break free from the restrictions imposed on the original productions by live theater. Cinema is truly a different art form, as the early silent greats discovered when trying to film the stage hits of their day. Burton does a marvelous job of opening up the stage production and making it truly a movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit, being a huge fan of the stage show, every edit & change in the music was jarring. However in looking back the only part that I thought wasn't an appropriate edit was in the song ""God that's good."" Sweeney, true to any Tim Burton character (Pee Wee, Edward Scissorhands, Batman), is fascinated with gadgetry in this movie, eliminating the need for a new chair to be delivered and eliminating ""is that a chair fit for a king?"" song. The patrons of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop no longer smack their lips singing ""God that's good."" I did find the elimination of the Greek chorus from the story appropriate for the movie. A movie can condense story exposition quickly in a few images, making the chorus redundant. This makes the story zing along with almost as much speed as the frenetic camera movement from the docks to Fleet street. The violence is much more graphic, but suitable for the macabre comedy it is intended to be.<br/><br/>As far as performances, I found Depp to be an astonishingly good singer and effective Sweeney. Rickman is superb, as always. Cohen was a surprise as Pirelli, singing well and mining the comedy deftly without being over the top. The young lad playing Toby was a revelation and one can only hope he is cast in a remake of Oliver! Carter, on the other hand left a lot to be desired. She was adequate, but no more than that. If anything the movie suffers due to the lack of a talent comparable to Lansbury from the stage version.<br/><br/>Overall the movie satisfied me greatly. I had felt that many of Burton's latest efforts were sub par. Sweeney Todd reaffirms my belief in his talent as a top notch filmmaker."

In most cases, it is almost as if we are given traits, post-birth. My family, in particular, oozed of theater. So, you can see where I am trying to lead this comment. I came across Sweeney Todd when I was about 9 years old. I have been used to all of the ""campy"" and ""happy"" productions such as: oliver, The Kind and I, and many others. So, after hearing the story and seeing it live a few times, I immediately and helplessly fell in love with it.<br/><br/>Fast forward 11 years. I have been pursuing a career in the arts and entertainment industry for about 3 years. With film-making, we look up to our favorite directors. Mine being Tim Burton, for instance. Movies let us escape into the mind of the director. It is as if we are the directors themselves. Sweeney Todd, is most definitely one of biggest and most challenging projects Burton has come across. I came on opening night, with songs from the Broadway production, clear in my mind. Upon walking into the theater I felt an uneasiness that continued on toward the first song, ""No Place Like London."" I thought, ""Oh dear, another butchered adaptation."" But let it be known, as the film continued, the voices - which at first were tempting me to walk out - began to suit the film. Johnny Depp's voice suited his character very well, and his performance was nothing less than his best. <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a feast for the eyes. With dark, eerie, and beautiful sets, we are emerged into Tim's world of Sweeney Todd. It is a refreshing take on a once beloved theatrical masterpiece from one of the worlds greatest play writers. Come into the theater with a clean slate and get ready for the shave of your life!"

","This film was absolutely incredible. I went into it a little skeptical, as it seems Tim Burton has been in a bit of a slump lately. The last film of his I saw was ""Corpse Bride"" which, I must say, sucked. At least in my opinion. ""Sweeney Todd,"" however, brings back all the perfectly darkly comedic aspects of Burton's work that I (and I think most people) love him for. I loved that they kept the musical bits and Burton did a wonderful job of making the whole thing very theatrical. For instance, the gore (which there is a lot of) is extremely fake looking in a funny way... it emphasizes the theatrical comedy of the whole story. My friend commented that it seemed a bit over the top, which I would agree with completely. She looked at that as a downside, but the over-the-top exaggerations are part of what made this so amazing for me. I highly recommend this film. I knocked it down one star because it left out my favorite song from the original musical and because they changed the ending a bit. Other than that, amazing film... very Tim Burton."

","""Sweeney Todd,"" Tim Burton's big-screen adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, was faced with the nearly impossible task of meeting the expectations of both Burton and Sondheim fans alike. So if it falls a little short, I'm willing to forgive and forget. I think Burton made probably the best film that could be made from Sondheim's musical, but his movie also confirmed something I already suspected: ""Sweeney Todd"" is inherently theatrical, and though Burton mostly succeeds in reinventing the musical as a film, he doesn't totally succeed in justifying the necessity of doing so.<br/><br/>I felt during ""Sweeney Todd"" the way I so often feel watching screen versions of stage musicals: the medium of film only serves to highlight the weaknesses of stage shows. Things simply work on stage that don't work on screen and vice versa, and that's the case here. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sweeney Todd"" the movie, but I've enjoyed live performances of the show much more, and despite all of my efforts to forget the stage productions while watching the movie, I couldn't help but compare the two.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the movie. It's a deliciously macabre and dark story, and Burton deserves great credit for resisting the urge to make it more palatable to mainstream film audiences. Indeed, his interpretation of the tale is darker and bloodier than any stage version I've seen, and the film's final moments left me chilled and disturbed. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney, a vengeful barber who declares war on humanity for the wrongs he has suffered at the hands of a malicious judge and beadle. Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, whose meat pie business becomes revitalized when she starts using Sweeney's victims as, ahem, ingredients. Carter and Depp have tremendous chemistry together, maybe because they look so much alike. Depp does a good job with Sweeney, but he's limited from the start because Sweeney is a one-dimensional character. Depp delivers an intense and frightening performance, but aside from the interest inherent in whether or not he'll be able to pull off Sondheim's notoriously difficult music (which he does just fine, thank you very much), I didn't find the performance itself that interesting. Carter, however, if a weaker singer than Depp, does wonders with Mrs. Lovett. This is the first version of ""Sweeney Todd"" I've seen where I actually felt bad about what happens to her character. Carter balances the role beautifully between ruthless accomplice and maternal caretaker. She doesn't play the role big and blowsy like Angela Lansbury did in the original stage version, or like Patti LuPone has played it, and she'll probably be criticized for taking too meek an approach to the material as a result, but I think her's works wonderfully as a film interpretation of the role.<br/><br/>Sondheim's score sounds glorious, but I was disappointed at the many cuts made to it. A few songs are missing altogether, and there's hardly one left that isn't at least shortened. My one bit of unqualified praise goes to the film's visual style, which is magnificent. The production design couldn't be improved upon.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd"" might get better with subsequent viewings, once the automatic screen-to-stage comparison is flushed out of the system and one can watch the movie for what it is. As it is, I liked the movie a lot without thinking it was one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"ClaytonDavis","7","2","4","26 December 2007"," The Johnny Depp Show
","Welcome to the darkest and most morbid film of Tim Burton's career entitled Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Starring Academy Award nominee Johnny Depp in the title role as the revenge seeking barber, wrongfully imprisoned and looking to settle the score with the man who put him there, Judge Turpin played by Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>A side not before even diving into the review of the film; DreamWorks and Warner Bros. marketing department should be commended. As I sat in the theater with a lot of Johnny Depp fans, I heard many people say, ""this is a musical?"" as soon as the opened with Jamie Campbell Bower singing. Even though the trailer does have Depp singing a few lines from his strong musical number ""Epiphany,"" I don't think youths grasped the concept entirely, ""oh wow, this is a musical."" The reason I say this, the young men that followed these young girls were grumbling the entire time as each line was being sang. Morons.<br/><br/>Back to the review: As stated before, Burton has created his darkest film of his career with lots of grotesque images and even darker set decorations and mood settings. Depp is as great as can be as Mr. Todd bringing great characterizations not yet seen before by the actor and surprisingly, a very good voice. Even though Sweeney is the one who is wronged, he makes some choices that don't agree with the viewer. You're pulling for Sweeney and feeling the tragedy for the character even though, you know you shouldn't be. That is Depp's greatest achievement from the character.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter as the Baker, Mrs. Lovett is great in energy and poise and brings a much needed humanity and sensitivity to this morbid tale especially with her scenes with the young Toby played by Edward Sanders. However, her singing leaves much to be desired and its her singing scenes with Depp we love because of Depp being in them.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen in his brief appearance is adequate but with wardrobe distractions (those who've seen it know what I'm talking about) its hard to focus solely on his speech. Alan Rickman plays his villainous role as great as we've seen him before but weary of past performances in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Dogma. He is an actor yearning for awards consideration one day soon, but needing the right role to do it.<br/><br/>The music as far as musicals go is fair, not the best of any I've seen but it does have some moments. The art direction, make-up and cinematography is the film's true beauty and the awards magnet that is needed. As far as the narrative goes, Johnny Depp is the man of the hour like anything else we've seen of him before.<br/><br/>Grade: ***/****"
"nicman911","9","2","4","26 December 2007"," You Won't Want To Leave Your Seat!
","From the moment those dark, blood-soaked gears began turning to it's bloody and epic conclusion, I was hooked. Tim Burton truly delivers in this big-screen adaptation of one of America's classic musicals. From the get-go, there is a classic Burton-esquire theme, from the drab streets of filth-covered London to Depp's shroud of hatred for those around him. Depp performs unlike any other with his dark musical numbers and his pairing with Carter (Mrs. Lovett) works out perfectly, with just the right amount of secret admiration on Carter's part. Sweeney Todd is one movie that you won't bring yourself to get popcorn during!"
"kcfoster90","9","2","4","24 December 2007"," this movie gave me chills...
","This movie made my skin crawl...<br/><br/>As a fan of music theater as well as film, i had to say that the adaptation of the musical to a movie was pretty well executed...<br/><br/>The music was not flawless, but really, thats what added to its sadistic charm.<br/><br/>Depp does a fantastic job creating ""The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and making the audience buy into his sadistic tendencies. Depp also does a great job with the music. As an actor and not a singer, the music feels and sounds more organic, and really adds to the character of Sweeney Todd. Helena Bonham Carter also does an incredible job as Mrs. Lovett from both an acting, and singing perspective.<br/><br/>The movie itself was dark...VERY DARK...<br/><br/>Knowing the film was directed by Tim Burton, i fully expected the film to be dark, but NOTHING could have prepared me for what I experienced.<br/><br/>Visually, the film was flawless. Costumes, set, everything was done Seamlessly to provide a grotesque and UTTERLY REPULSIVE environment for the film. The gore was a little surprising...to say the least. From the head splitting fall from the barber's chair, to the slit throats of the unfortunate patrons, I was at a loss for words to see a COMPLETE evasion of anything one might call a ""subtle killing""...the whole thing was BRUTAL...and i LOVED IT! The only criticism i have is the complete absence of comedic relief in the film. In the musical, many of the songs and many of the moments experienced by the characters provide a great deal of ""dark comedy"" that only ADDS to the appeal of Sweeney's character. Burton, however, created what seemed to be more of a slasher film using a libretto. Rather then falling in love with the unfortunate, sadistic, and utterly MAD Anti-hero that is Sweeney Todd, i was completely at a loss for what to feel.<br/><br/>I really wanted to SYMPATHIZE for Sweeney, but the film really didn't allow for that to happen. I wanted to see the moments where WE felt how much Sweeney loved his wife and child, and how their memories feed his madness and his thirst for revenge. Burton really didn't allow for the audience to see and feel these moments.<br/><br/>as a conclusion...the film was dark, twisted, and horrifying...just as the story of Sweeney Todd SHOULD BE...BUT...i would have liked to see more LOVE in the film...Sweeney's LOVE for his wife and child is what feeds his anger and the monster that is ""The Demon Barber of Fleet Street""..."
"ms_jade_li","9","2","4","23 December 2007"," Depp animates a tragic hero yet again
","A few words about Tim Burton's production of what has been performed as live theatrical performance up until now (as far as I know there hasn't been a movie made of it previously). Fans of Burton's admirable ability to capture a tragic hero's quest for finding a niche in a cruel world -- a world that has no understanding, and less tolerance, for misfits -- will not be disappointed in Sweeney Todd.<br/><br/>Where there is a possibility that live performers have captured the torment of Sweeney, it is certain that Johnny Depp succeeds. He exudes torment. He is a man driven. Obsessed even. He brings Sweeney, a man who is, in all spiritual respects a walking corpse, to life. He's a man who has been driven to madness by the cruelty of human nature turned against him, yet manages to keep enough wits about himself to wreak a considerable amount of payback.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast shows no flaw. A short but sweet cameo by Sasha Baron Cohen, is the only splash of color other than red in the dreariness of the geographical and human landscape. The young lad who gets drawn into the madness looks like he will have an acting career ahead of him. Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Burton's long-term partner, has nailed her role as the consummately common baker of meat pies, expert roach smasher, and unrequited lover. Alan Rickman plays the perverse villain with his usual flair. I like the closeups of his face, which is gathering even more character, believe it or not, as he ages. His loyal, sneering manservant (sorry his name escapes me, but he plays a similar minion in Enchanted) adds his talents to the mix. The naives playing the roles of sailor and ward are sweet and innocent pawns unwittingly drawn in as well.<br/><br/>Expect lots of blood and some rather graphic violence as the bodies hit the floor.<br/><br/>Expect to be surprised by the pleasant sounds of Depp and Bonham-Carter's voices."
"aloesby","9","2","4","22 December 2007"," Tim at his best
","I am an avid Tim Burton fan, Johnny Depp fan, and Sondheim fan. I could not have asked for a better combination of the three. I am usually not a huge supporter of movie musicals, but the overall tone of Sweeney Todd is theatrical enough to support people bursting into song. Tim's production design goes with the story - it is dark and creepy, but still, as I stated before, theatrical enough so that the bright red blood seems okay. Tobias is played by a young boy, which is new, but it works quite well, especially at the end. And who would have thought that Johnny Depp could sing that well? He really shines - Sondheim was right to approve him. Helena Bonham Carter is also singing for the first time, and she does quite well, although her voice is not terribly strong. I loved her character, though, and hope she gets recognized for it. However. this is not the movie to take your kids to. There are some really truly scary moments - the end is truly chilling. The old beggar woman really creeps me out. It is darkly funny, but not in a way that is appropriate for people under the age of 17. It is rightly rated R. Tim, you have done incredibly well. Its just the movie musical I needed."
"minnie_swirl","Null","2","4","22 December 2007"," Burton Crafts a Thrilling, Dark Tale
","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a quite simply a masterpiece. Every aspect of the film is top-notch. The music thrills, the acting is tremendous and the look of the film dazzles. It is hard to put into words when everything in a film comes together, but I left the theatre immediately wanting to see it again.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the gore in the film and I think that talk is largely exaggerated. The film does have its share of bloody scenes but it isn't a wall to wall blood fest. Everything is so stylized that it's really blood and brutality as high art so I found it easily tolerable and I am a squeamish person.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter is extraordinary. She brings humor and a kind of pathos to her wonderfully wacky Mrs. Lovett. Then there is Johnny Depp. He simmers with rage and aches with pain all while singing with a vocal quality that is rich and tremendously pleasing. His body language and eyes tell a story all on their own. I have always thought him to be a magnificent actor and this performance does nothing to betray that. Both Depp and Bonham Carter were up to the task and succeeded beyond my grandest expectations."

Also, although the cast put on great performances, they were nothing compared to the original Broadway cast. Finally, the amount of blood was way over the top.<br/><br/>Now on to the good parts.

","First of all the Sweeney Todd script is unique itself being a musical. Burton's vision was perfect for it. So dark with some vivid colors at times.<br/><br/>The whole plot of Sweeney getting his revenge because the love of his life was taken away was so touching. And all the little quirks throughout the movie with all the different characters was so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>I went into the movie knowing it would be a great movie, but it exceeded my expectations by far! There was humor, a lot of emotions, incredible music, and so much talent from the actors. It was also weird and creepy at times, but I loved it anyway! I highly suggest you to see this if you want to see a movie so different from any other movie."
"edgeofreality","Null","0","0","27 June 2020"," The closest shave
","A real ripper of a musical slasher film. It all works - the grim 19th century London setting, the costumes and songs, the director having a field day and the actors getting wholeheartedly into the spirit of it. The story barely matters, but the philosophy about all humanity wallowing in excrement is so richly delivered by Depp and has a ring of truth so pertinent to our times that I think I'll buy me a meat pie and do some wallowing."
"sebaweirdo","7","0","0","24 June 2020"," Swing the razor..but It aint that high
","The adaptation of Soddenheim's dark and tragic musical, Sweeney Todd, is the delightfully depressing story of Benjamin Barker. But, as a fan of the musical, I have to say, tis film is a bit more gruesome then the stage show and I don't know if that's good or bad.
In the stage show, blood is basically a prop, even some productions use different ways to portray it, some of them even using red lighting, this is both practical, since you won't have the actors slipping every way, and it can make it more special when a character does die. But the film does something different, it goes for a full on Evil Dead type of blood, this thing goes everywhere, it's a freaking fountain, with can be good, but turns something that is a theatrical and highly effective Drama, into something a bit more pulpy, though luckily, it does give some good visuals in some of the later scenes of the film.
Like any good Burton film, the gothic streets of London look perfectly decaying and dirty as they should be, it almost reminds me of Burton's Batman, where it was basically a hell on earth, sadly the film doesn't go for many bold colours, limiting it's palette to cold blues and intense oranges and reds, but with the style it uses, it makes the times they use color pop out a bit more.
Johnny Depp is giving probably one of his better interpretations and reminding us why we can't stop looking at him, though the costume is a bit much, he is not far away from the great actors that have portray him on the stage, going for a more animalistic mr Todd, something that Michael Ball would take when he played the character in the revival.
Boham Carter is a more subdued Mrs Lovett, and though she's not bad, she doesn't really compels me as the motherly type, but she really goes for the weak and even scary moments as the film goes on, showing us just how broken she is and how evil she can be.
Finally, the other main player is Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, who is just perfect for this role, maybe not much of a singer, but he can be so hatable and despicable, you really want the moment that he gets the razor in his neck, specially in Pretty Women ,this guy was a perfect villain and it just reminds me how much we lost after Rickman's passing.
The music is amazing, with should be obvious, there's a reason why so many people love the musical, but the interpretations, though iffy, portray a more broken version of the characters, a bit more personable and almost a bit more sad. The original music wasn't grand, but it was theatrical, this version is a lot more calm and subdued, even filmed like if it wasn't a musical. In fact, it's shot more like an actual horror film, and speaking of that.
The tone of this film is just amazing, managing the dark comedic tones with actually terrifying moments, you will both be laughing and crying at some scenes and be completely scared in some others, it's an exhausting film, but it finishes just the right way, with everything going wrong.
If you are a Tim Burton fan like me, watch it, it's one of his best jobs from the 2000's. If you are a fan of the musical, give it a try and try to remember that these are both different medias. And if you love blood baths, give it a watch. It may be a bit too much or a bit too less depending on your opinions, but it's a really good movie, enjoy it, it's a bloody good time....I don't regret that obvious pun."

When Suwaini killed this quorum, he felt that he was achieving virtue in society, but his evils - and we can say that the evils of society - dominated him and his hunger killed for his personal or material interests so that he could plan to recover his kidnapped daughter, but the fate led to his psychological destruction by killing his wife and then physically destroying him He killed him personally, and so he got what he deserved.<br/><br/>I liked the musical performance, the production design, or the costumes.

","""Sweeney Todd"" is a revenge story draped around sorrow many times over. Once you face the fact that Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and the entire cast, minus Timothy Spall, have magnanimous voices, which isn't hard - it's spellbinding.<br/><br/>Most film directors open stage productions by adding meaningless busyness to make them more cinematic. Burton constricts the space and concentrates on the melodrama at hand that lies within the soul of the story. The minor-key chamber music reminds me much of a Catholic Chapel organ tune that carries throughout the film. This element adds to the growing suspense and climax of the film. Burton uses gouts of bright ruby blood that geyser out against the monochromatic backdrops.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a film for weak of stomach or young of age. The MPAA rated well as the movie contains explicit throat slashing scenes that would indeed make Jack the Ripper envious. Now Depp has another aurora about him in light of the fact he can sing very well. Burton shoots him close-up in a loving way; and mad Johnny has the right intensity; the right morbidity about his characters that causes the other characters to fall in line.<br/><br/>Ms Lovett, for example, has the frugal idea of grinding up Sweeney's victims for her minced meat pies. Bonham Carter brings both a ghoulish and erotic tone to the film. If there were a Playghoul magazine, you'd want Burton atop the centerfolds, after all, he has spawned ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Batman,"" and many others.<br/><br/>Like Ms Lovett's minced meat pies, Sweeney isn't for every viewer's appetite. Sondheim, the original creator and arguably the greatest theatrical composer and lyricist could've never been more proud of the big-screen adaption being so deliciously served! The film is simply one you will love or hate. Hit or miss with everyone I've come into contact with."

","Now, don't get me wrong. I love musicals. However Sondheim has never been one of my favourite composers. I find his scores rather depressing and more focused on storytelling much to Webber's dismay, where he does the songs in order to focus on the present. This was very much present in 2014's Into The Woods. This and Into The Woods have a very similar score. Nevertheless, Sweeney Todd is a hidden masterpiece that is truly one of the most horrifying stories about vengeance ever told, perfectly through Tim Burton's gruesome direction.<br/><br/>The film opens to a river of blood, flowing through machinery until finally arriving a river (""Opening Scene""). On a boat, almost docking at London bay, we meet two strangers, Mr. Anthony Hope and Mr. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) as the two talk about their plans of what they'll do when they finally dock (""No Place Like London""). Todd reminisces of the last time he was in London: Fifteen years prior, where he was falsely convicted by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who longed for his wife. Todd arrives at a meat pie shop run by Ms. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) (""The Worst Pies In London"").<br/><br/>Mrs. Lovett brings Todd upstairs to where her former neighbour Benjamin Barker had his barber shop. Todd reveals himself as Benjamin Barker and asks about what happened to his wife Lucy and daughter Johanna. Lovett responds by stating that Lucy was sexually assaulted by Turpin and poisoned herself, and Johanna now lives in Turpin's ward (""Poor Thing""). Lovett then presents Todd with his old razors, where he swears to seek revenge on Turpin (""My Friends""). Elsewhere, Anthony encounters a pretty girl who sings by her window (""Green Finch and Linnet Bird""). Anthony asks a beggar woman, and she responds Johanna (""Johanna"").<br/><br/>Todd and Lovett arrive at a marketplace to encounter the city's best barber Pirelli. Pirelli's young assistant, Toby, sings of Pirelli's elixir, promising that hair will grow in less than a week. Todd fights back, causing Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha to take matters into his own hands (""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir""). The two have a shaving contest, judged by Turpin's henchman, Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Todd wins (""The Contest""). The following afternoon, Pirelli shows up to Todd's shop, revealing himself to be Davy Collins, Todd's former henchman. Collins threatens Todd that he will take 50% of the profits Todd makes. Todd brutally murders him, leaving Toby in Lovett's clutches. Lovett attempts to calm Todd down (""Wait"").<br/><br/>Johanna, having noticed Anthony, throws him down a key to her room. Turpin visits Todd that same day, where he announces that he will marry Johanna to Todd. Todd mildly threatens to kill Turpin, but is interrupted by Anthony, revealing his plans to elope with Johanna (""Pretty Women""). Turpin storms out, angered. Anthony, having ruined Todds plan, forces him out. Lovett returns to Todd, where he states that ""We all deserve to die"", finally losing his marbles (""Epiphany""). Lovett condemns his plan by building a chair that leads Todd's victims into Lovett's bakehouse, where she will cook them into meat pie (""A Little Priest""). Anthony heads to Johanna's, but notices that she has been taken away to Fogg's Asylum by Turpin.<br/><br/>A few days later, Mrs. Lovett and Toby celebrate the re-opening of her pie shop, now with ""better tasting"" ingredients (""God That's Good""). Todd continuously murders his victims, almost for fun. On a day off, Lovett tells Todd of her plans to marry him and move to a city by the sea, but Todd does not listen (""By The Sea""). Anthony tells Todd of Johanna's current state. Todd tells him to disguise himself as a wig maker, where then he can get into the asylum. The plan goes off without a hitch. Toby feels something is off with Todd and swears Mrs. Lovett his life if Todd were ever to harm her. After noticing that Lovett has Pirelli's wallet, Toby threatens to call Turpin in, but Lovett distracts him by showing Toby the bakehouse. After showing him how to work the machinery, Lovett locks Toby in (""Not While I'm Around"").<br/><br/>Beadle arrives at Lovett's shop, after getting too many complaints of the stench erupting from the chimneys. Todd offers to groom Beadle before the inspection, which he accepts. Todd then kills him and sends him down to the bakehouse, where Toby gets startled. Lovett and Todd go searching for Toby, but assumes that he fled in the sewers. Meanwhile, Anthony demands Johanna hide in Todd's shop while he finds them a coach. There, the beggar woman rushes in, but is swiftly killed by Todd after hearing Turpin's voice. Todd finally murders Turpin and threatens to kill Johanna before hearing Lovett scream from the bakehouse. Downstairs, Lovett attempts to get the beggar woman in the oven before Todd can notice that it is indeed his former wife, Lucy, who poisoned herself but lived and went crazy. Lovett reveals her love for Todd, but Todd feels cheated and throws her into the oven. Todd drops his razor and holds Lucy in his hands, when he is finally killed by Toby (""Final Scene"").<br/><br/>Now, Sweeney Todd is not for the faint of heart. Ironically, the plot is very heavy, but the film is very slow-paced, especially In its first act. All of the actors do phenomenal jobs with what they are given, but the two that really stand out are Johnny Depp and Ed Sanders (Toby). Although Bonham Carter's performance is good and critically praised, she holds nothing to the broadway people who have played Lovett. Sanders is creepily unsettling throughout the film and Depp goes full madness and ironically, he does not feel like the villain of the film. The villain is the mind.<br/><br/>Overall Score: Sweeney Todd gets a 7.8 which rounds up to an 8"

The dark tones are oozing with depth, sucking in the light around as well as your attention.<br/><br/>More than several times my hearing was offended by the lack of rhymes and weird endings - they will hunt you all the way till the end. On the top of this, in the start I was profoundly scared of the fact that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter might not perform well as singers, and indeed occasionally you could cringe from a derailed chant, but I strongly need to warn you that for the biggest chunk of a play the thought of them not performing in the real musicals will be on the top of your head. It is truly a loss for live performances.<br/><br/>The story is smooth and gives everything that you might expect from a horror musical.

"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","0","22 September 2016"," The narrative could have been a bit sharper, but Burton more or less excels in everything else
","Benjamin Barker AKA Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) has been in exile for 15 years after he was accused of a crime that he did not commit by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Whilst in exile, Judge Turpin has assumed custody of Barker's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and worst still for Barker, Turpin also intends on marrying Johanna. Upon his return to London, Barker arrives with a new identity and forms a sinister partnership with pie-making widow Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). Todd sets himself up as the best barber in London, but revenge is really what is on his mind.....<br/><br/>First and foremost I have never seen the Broadway Musical that this film is based upon so my only point of reference is this Tim Burton and Stephen Sondheim collaboration and you know what? I kind of liked it...<br/><br/>At its heart we bear witness to a sort of anti-hero in the form of Barker/Todd - we see our protagonist robbed of 15 years of his life and worse still find him returning to London expecting to walk back into the arms of his wife and pick up his life more or less where he left it (albeit 15 years later). However, Judge Turpin has tarnished that aspect of Todd's life which, in effect, adds insult to injury as far as Todd is concerned. On the one hand this works as Todd is a believable anti-hero, but some of this hard work is undone when Todd opens his barber's shop and starts killing nearly everyone that sits in the barber's chair. It's impressive in the sense that Burton manages to balance many of these scenes by making them dark and menacing and surreal and amusing, but to me a lot of these things made me slightly lose touch with Todd and his cause (it seemed to initially be about one man gaining revenge against another, but in the middle of the film he seemed to become a serial killer in order to prevent a widow from going out of business). As I said all this was very entertaining and was an interesting sub-plot, but totally illogical when scrutinised.<br/><br/>Whilst there's little wrong with the basic story and whilst it does remain enjoyable, Sweeney Todd does tend to meander and go round the houses a bit (there are some scenes which go on for longer than necessary - the rivalry between Todd and Pirelli is one such example). The romance between Anthony and Johanna is a little over-staged - ""I feel you Johanna"" seemed to have been sung on about 3 separate occasions when one occasion probably would have sufficed.<br/><br/>Still I don't mean to be too harsh on this film as I did like it and Burton's visuals and dark style do provide the film with lots of gusto and energy; Depp and Bonham Carter are wonderful together, Baron Cohen has basically just added another character to his repertoire and Rickman is sublime as the villain of the piece. The only real weak spot in this picture lay with Jamie Campbell Bower who seems rather wooden and lacking in charisma in comparison to his co-stars. Naturally with this being a musical the singing performances are variable (although no-one is intolerably bad).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the dark plotting and black humour combine wonderfully here creating a slightly flawed film, but one with enough of Burton's magic to make it work."

","I can honestly appreciate the sick beauty of the film, the pervert story of good people falling down a dark and twisted life style, its most definitely worth the watch and was very refreshing from the normal bright and sunny happy endings we typically favor. Despite the grim color setting and story line, it's an enjoyable film for those who possess a dark humour. I found that it took a while to get to the good parts but as Ms Lovett says, all good things happen to those who wait and it was the ending that took the prize with me. I must admit the singing wasn't terrific, to be honest it gave me a headache at times but Jonny Depp has some great moments where I was like ''Whoah, that was a nice note''<br/><br/>The demon barber on fleet street might not be your typical watch, it sure wasn't mine, but if you give it a chance you just might be as pleasantly surprised as I was, I know I sure will be looking into films akin to this one.

","Unfortunately, I was unable to accept the two leads' performances as befitting the characters. They underact to ""Dull Surprise"" levels, especially Depp. Don't get me started on that last scene! Furthermore, he doesn't look old enough to be the father of a sixteen-year-old, and their hair and make-up look too Hot Topic for my taste. I call this ""But not too historical"" syndrome. Do audiences really not want to see how people dressed and did their hair in times past, or are wardrobe people lazy?<br/><br/>Most unforgivable is the fact that they cut sections of the musical that are a big part of why I love it, namely, Kiss Me, the Judge's song sequence and the beggar woman's pickup lines. Why does Tim Burton reduce Johanna's character but not Mrs. Lovett's? She's clearly misguided in all things, so I care more about the other women. I have a feeling the cuts were done to make the film under two hours, which is a terrible idea. Films that give themselves time are usually better.<br/><br/>HOWEVER! Depp and Bonham-Carter are the only egregious things about the movie! Everyone else is dressed roughly appropriately for the period, and fits my personal vision of their character well. Rickman as Judge Turpin, for example, is one of the greatest casting moves of all time to the point where I forgive his inability to sing. Laura Michelle Kelly is also great but underutilized. My only problem with the supporting cast is the focus on Timothy Spall's face in the scene where he and Turpin have just left the courthouse. <br/><br/>Finally, the film looks beautiful; I couldn't tell the backgrounds were mostly CG. But alas, Sweeney Todd needs engaging lead performances to work as a finished product."

After fifteen years he returns to London seeking revenge, which includes reopening his barber shop. The title could be more catchy as oppose to this child like fable appeal that it transcends. Directed by Tim Burton whose visual striking images are very similar to his superior film Sleepy Hollow. Viewers are treated to unnecessary graphic throats slashings, which become repetitious and it deflates the film. Another problem is the ongoing musical numbers that also give off the wrong impression with marketing and younger viewers. Johnny Depp plays the revenge ridden Todd while Helena Bonham Carter bakes pies with special ingredients. Alan Rickman plays the corrupt judge who barely avoids death early on. Jayne Wiseman plays the now grown daughter of Todd who is sent to an asylum when the judge feels that her affection is aimed elsewhere. Sacha Baron Cohen plays a victim who at first lends his voice to song. What all of these characters have in common is that nothing good is to become of them.

By the end was stunned. <br/><br/>The idea of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is great. Its not often that you watch a musical about a murderous barber. But what's a great idea without a plot? Fortunately, Burton knew what he was doing, and the plot was very well done. Sure, he had the help of the original Broadway musical, but either way it was done very well. <br/><br/>The characters are all well developed. They have their distinct character traits, but they're all very quirky and interesting, which adds to their personalities a lot. They're quite amusing to watch, and it makes the movie a lot more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The lighting is one of my favorite parts of it. It's dark and sets the tone of the movie immediately, and it carries through perfectly throughout the whole movie (save for one scene where it made sense to brighten the mood a bit). <br/><br/>The songs are all quite well done. The singing and music is all very pleasant to listen to and adds a nice charm to the movie. Some of the story is told through song, and luckily the lyrics are pretty easy to understand, so long as you have your volume turned up enough to hear it properly (duh). <br/><br/>Overall Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is amazing. With an incredible plot, great characters, good songs, and fantastic lighting it's hard to find anything I didn't like. It's a movie that proves that murder and humor can go hand-in-hand. Despite what I've heard, the violence isn't that bad. It's bloody sure, but it's not horrific or hard to watch or anything. but if you don't like blood then you probably shouldn't watch this movie, which is really unfortunate that you'll have to miss out. If you didn't like it then that's almost as unfortunate, because it really is a great movie. In the end, I would highly recommend you check out Sweeney Todd, it truly is a masterpiece in my eyes."

","Johhny Depp, it can't be denied, is a terrific actor (although sorry Johnny Depp fans, but William B. Davis is my favorite actor, he's better than Johnny Depp by a long shot). I think my favorite performance of Johnny Depp was in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""... but Depp is a victim of overused actor syndrome; Tim Burton uses him in nearly ALL his movies, always playing the brooding, depressed, gothy-type characters, always looking the EXACT SAME. It gets very annoying to want to see an original movie only to find that as usual, Tim Burton has hired Depp for the same type of roles again...<br/><br/>I wish I could say I liked this movie (the poster looked interesting), but I didn't even understand it... it was morbid and disturbing and dark, and don't get me wrong I like the dark humor and creepy movies and all that (I love Edward Scissorhands, Felidae, Carrie, etc.) but Sweeney Todd just goes WAY too far with it. I bought the DVD to watch with my little brother actually, because he loved Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice and Stephen King's IT, but he's autistic and it's hard to know which horror movies are appropriate for him. He requested this one and so I got to play babysitter for the day and show him this... he's seen R-Rated horror movies before and I thought this would be a safe bet considering he's even seen the uncut version of My Bloody Valentine (1981)... but Sweeny Todd terrified him and I fell asleep halfway through the movie. It wasn't scary, or funny or creative, just incredibly dark for the hell of it without any explanation as to why. I realize Burton is known as a director and creator of morbid-humor movies, but this? This was just a pointless waste of money to buy, I think I'll stick with The X-Files, Cold Case and old cheesy 80's slashers."

It's not that I think Rodgers & Hammerstein are bad, there contributions to the genre are legendary. Unfortunately, the genre in the 2000's have had to endure Disney's ""High School Musical"" franchise, and a lot of other stuff that wasn't really ever on my ""to see"" list.<br/><br/>However, Johnny Depp nails what could be Burton's darkest movie yet. Gothic London looks dirty and dark, making great settings for songs that are bleak with revenge and remorse. What little the plot is regarding the original ""Sweeny Todd"" story, the duet with the incredible Alan Rickman is the films highlight and to this day it's still stuck in my head. A fantastic job by Stephen Soundheim.<br/><br/>The only complaint's I have is that there are three or so songs I do not particularly enjoy. Even though I enjoyed Depp's performance, the characters motivation in this portrayal destroys opportunity for any further engrossing traits. If there's anything to say more about the picture, is that everyone is perfectly casted.

","My favorite genre of all genre is musical. It's rather difficult to make than any other genre. For me, intense scene without music is like a body without soul. But other scene that is deep and full of high- cinematography doesn't need music at all.<br/><br/>And musical movies give us all the intense scene with those musics and songs. This movie, actually, is very well-crafted. The iconic Gothic is the authentic art of Tim Burton hand. The song keep echoing in my mind. And then come an unexpected thriller scene in the movie, I said, beauty thriller. I feel the big appetite of cold revenge. Next, Johnny Depp, I can't make a comment for him, I mean he is just perfect. Very deep act, with mysterious personality for this movie.<br/><br/>I must say, it's very amusing. You know, when we watch musical movie, usually we get bored and left the cinema before the movie ends. But, not for this. The only weakness I see is in the end part of it. The resolution part is too fast, I mean it can be a little bit longer. It starts when the Gothic suddenly changes to very bright scene, in the beach. And when the song for beach scene end, suddenly the scene back to Gothic.<br/><br/>At last, it's okay, a movie that I like to watch again and again. Great!"

","INCLUDES SPOILERS<br/><br/>When I first heard the song ""Pretty Women"" from this movie, I loved it. When I saw who sang it, I flipped. Yes fellow fans; in this movie, John Christopher Depp the II sings! I was so shocked that I barely noticed all the blood. And anyway, most of it was shot in Johnny's face, so it was more funny then scary. The movie itself is actually really sad. People say it's scary, but if you look past all the blood, past Sweeney's (Depp) menacing look, and past Helena Bonham Carter's crazy hair, right down in that hidden plot, you might just cry at the end.<br/><br/>While a barber, Benjamin Barker, and his wife, Lucy, are out in the market with their 2 year-old daughter, Johanna, the powerful reigning magistrate of London, Judge Turpin, sees Lucy and falls madly in love. But when he sees Benjamin next to her, he realizes the maid is taken. Jealous of Benjamin, he sends him to prison for 15 years in Australia. Lucy is now his, but Lucy does not love him, so, in short, he rapes her.<br/><br/>Feeling helpless, Lucy drinks arsenic with Mrs. Lovett (Carter), a close friend, near her. Turpin is now left with Johanna.<br/><br/>15 years later, Benjamin is released. But in his anger, he gives himself a new, and menacing name; Sweeney Todd. Returning to London, he goes back into the barber business. He hopes his wife is still alright, and he will finally meet his daughter. But that fate is not to be. Mrs. Lovett tells him that Lucy killed herself with arsenic and that Turpin kidnapped Johanna and raised her as his own, keeping her locked up. Believing his wife is dead, and admitting that he may never meet his daughter, he felt it necessary to get revenge, by killing the Judge, but he can't. Later, a new barber comes in, intending to blackmail Sweeney. Sweeney responds by killing him. But what to do with the body? Mrs. Lovett reasons with Sweeney, saying you can't just toss people in a trunk, that they'd rot and start to stink, and then the police would come. She then suggests putting the meat from the blackmailer into her pies. The pies sell so well that she needs more meat. She asks Sweeney to help her by luring people into his barber shop and then killing them. Thinking there's no other reason to live, Sweeney agrees, hoping to rid the world of people like Turpin (in his opinion).<br/><br/>But is Lucy really dead, or did Mrs. Lovett lie to ""Romeo"" (Sweeney) about ""Juliet"" (Lucy)? BUH BUH BUMM (couldn't resist)."

","Apart from the ""A Little Priest"" scene, which was wasted, as the perverse humor that should have prevailed was completely missing, along with one of the stanzas, this was a gem of a movie. Depp's Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker although a bit one note and lacking in dimension was still compelling and who knew he could carry a tune? The duet he sang with Bonham Carter, in particular, was quite nicely done, in fact. I think a more boisterous and lusty rendering of Mrs. Lovett and an uplifting ending, with Anthony and Johanna escaping together, would have fared better and wouldn't have detracted from the overall Grand-Guignol theme. But, still, I enjoyed the film and most of the music, which is more than I can say about the majority of Broadway musical film adaptations."

","Sweeney Todd has been a notorious character in English urban myth. So notorious in fact, that he got a musical named after him and now a film as well. Sweeney Todd: the demon barber of Fleet Street is a horror/musical film that centres around a barber that goes by the name of Benjamin Barker. Falsely accused by a judge who was after his wife, he was sent away to Australia, but returns after fifteen years with the help of a sailor boy. The years in prison have changed him, or rather: they made him, no pun intended, barking mad. Benjamin Barker has changed from a loving husband and father into Sweeney Todd, an emotionally unstable man with no empathy, whose only goal is to take revenge on Judge Turpin; the man that took Todd's old life away. He rents his old shop above the pie shop of Mrs. Lovett, who recognises him and tells him what has happened in the years that passed: Judge Turpin has raped Sweeney's wife Lucy, after which she poisoned herself. Due to her mother's death, Sweeney's daughter Johanna was adopted by the judge and now lives in his keeping. Mr Todd takes up his old profession as a barber, but with only one goal: to lurk judge Turpin into his shop and slit his throat, which he wishes to accomplish with the help of Mrs. Lovett. Along the way, there are more throats to take care of, and the bodies somehow end up in Mrs. Lovett's meat pies. From the summary, it might already be clear that this film is not for everyone. There are some horror elements in there, and it is quite certain that everybody who greatly dislikes musical films could better get as far away from this one as possible. However, the film does manage to entertain because of the convincing characters, some catchy songs and quite a twist at the end. Did the plot line about humans chopped into meat pies convince you? No? That is because the plot itself isn't too strong. Of course, the film was based on an urban myth and therefore they couldn't leave plot points such as the meat pies stuffed with human limbs out, but it cannot be called truly convincing. The first body that disappears down the meat grinder still has some plausibility attached to it; Sweeney killed him because the man tried to blackmail him, and now they need to dispose of the body. Mrs. Lovett could use the meat, and there-fore they put him into the pastry. The people that follow were not killed for these convincing reasons, in fact, Todd's next victims were all killed so Sweeney can hush his lust for blood. This could be forgiven, were it not for the horribly fake blood squirting out of arteries. To be honest the blood appeared to be orange rather than red. After all of this, though, it must be said that the two cons stated above could very well be the only two. True, if you hate singing with a passion, this might not be the film for you. And yet, the singing itself cannot be blamed for this: everybody's singing abilities range from reasonable to great and the songs are catchy. Either way, the singing doesn't distract the viewer from the plot, which cannot be said for each musical film out there (looking at you, Les MisÃ©rables). The acting in itself could be called superb: Mr. Depp and Mrs. Bonham Carter have a certain chemistry that works out really well. Helena convinces as a woman with little empathy but deeply in love with someone who she knows is everything but stable. Johnny doesn't just impersonate a madman driven by nothing but revenge: he becomes said mad-man. This becomes rather clear in the scene in which Sweeney had his hands on the throat of Judge Turpin, only to lose him before he can slit his throat. He takes out his anger on Mrs. Lovett, who after all of this still stays with him and even tries to comfort him. The dÃ©cor, make-up and costumes only add to this: there is a sharp contrast between the almost candy-coloured past and hopes for the future Mrs. Lovett cherishes, and reality, which consists mainly of black and grey. As a plus, the dÃ©cor is often broken and rooms are empty. You only need to take a look at Sweeney's shop to find an example of this: it contains only the chair in which he kills his victims, and a mirror smashed to pieces. The unhealthy living conditions and the unhealthy motivations of the characters manifest itself in paleness and dark spots under their eyes. The film itself gives you a kind of eerie feeling, a bit as if you are descending into madness as well. For example, in one scene Sweeney bashes someone's head in with a pot filled with boiling tea. Immediately after, he and Mrs. Lovett happily waltz through her shop while singing about what different people will taste like once put into pies. All in all, this film is quite enjoyable, even though the special effects look rather fake at times and the plot itself is not always able to convince. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, together with the rest of quite an impressive cast, manage to keep the viewer interested with their amazing acting skills. The dÃ©cor, costumes and make-up only add to this. The singing is quite alright and should not hold people back from watching. Is this a film that will stick with you for a long time coming? No, it probably won't. Does it provide some quality entertainment for two hours? Yes, it certainly does. So if you enjoy films with singing and strong acting, and you won't be bothered by a weaker plot, this could very well be the right film for you."

","Benjamin Barker is sent abroad to a penal colony when a corrupt judge covets his lovely wife. Returning to London fifteen years later with a burning desire for revenge and a hatred of humanity, he reinvents himself as Sweeney Todd, a barber who likes to shave his customers perhaps a little too close ...<br/><br/>The legend of Sweeney Todd was born out of the Victorian penny dreadful novels - a gruesome grand guignol story of a maniacal barber who slits his customers' throats, and the charming Mrs Lovell who grinds the bodies into sausages and serves them up to the unwitting customers in her pie shop. For whatever reason, Stephen Sondheim decided to turn it into a musical, with mixed results. There aren't really any showstopping numbers and the score is a little forgettable, but the storybook does a good job of telling the tale and creates lots of memorable characters. As a fairly straight adaptation of the musical the movie has the same flaws and virtues, but where it really scores is in the fantastic production design by Dante Ferretti (The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, The Name Of The Rose), ace costume design by longtime Burton collaborator Colleen Atwood and the sweeping stylised photography throughout. Burton and his talented collaborators create a mesmerising warren of Cockney backstreets, washed out with grey filters, granite and cobbles, where everything from the silver streak in Depp's hair and the puffy purple makeup around Bonham Carter's eyes seems to fit perfectly. Whilst as a story and a musical it may have limitations, as a movie it never looks anything other than great, and the cast all give it some fine gusto (Depp seems to play the whole movie with his right eyebrow raised). There are two numbers in particular that work very well - the amusing A Little Priest, when Mrs Lovell hits upon her culinary masterstroke, and the cheerful By The Sea, where the dreamy bright colours contrast sharply with the drabness of Fleet Street, and Depp's catatonic bewilderment counterpoints his fiery misanthropy. The main problem however is the tone, which I don't quite understand. The story was always intended to be horrible fun, as over-the-top as possible, and yet both musical and film take it too seriously too much of the time. Burton's doesn't shy away from all those gruesome throat slashings, and Mrs Lovell's death by immolation is a Horrible Highlight, but the tone veers away constantly from comic to tragic, especially in the last half-hour, making the picture far too stodgy and grim. Compare it with Frank Oz' Little Shop Of Horrors, which is just as gruesomely evil but is hilarious throughout, and where the numbers are a constant wry commentary on the action. Sondheim is famously protective of his works, and whilst this is a good movie it's easy to see why - musical theatre is and always has been a spectacle, where the experience itself is enough for most people to accept bad music or dumb stories. A cinema audience is not so forgiving, and the subtle atmosphere a picture creates is often its most crucial asset. This is why Andrew Lloyd Webber has never made it big in the world of movies, and thank heaven above for that. All in all, this is an interesting flick whose only real limitation is its source material, but for all its blood and thunder it never really comes alive. Burton has made much better films though (Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow in particular), so if you've only seen this make sure to check out his rich back catalogue."

","funny. another name for this could be 'Capitalism a love story', because that's pretty much what this is about. it's a grim and morbid, but ultimately hilarious, satirical send up of the almighty dollar(or pound note). anything to make your business turn around and become a financial success. profits over humanity. funny funny funny.<br/><br/>aside from making a almost profound statement about humanity, this is also one of Hollywood's greatest entertainments and one of it's finest musicals. i love Sondheim's 'Night Music' and 'Company', and i hear his score for Alain Resnais 'Stavisky' is nothing less than brilliant. but this is the score i love the most because of it's wicked and subtle wit. not to mention great beauty.<br/><br/>Johhny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are truly memorable and brilliant here. these are two of the most memorable performances i've almost ever seen. there is so much power here. Alan Rickman is frightening as the evil judge. and Sascha Baron Cohen and the marvelous Timonthy Spall make up a (ha ha) delicious supporting cast. these dark, over powering performances are nicely contrasted with the cherub-like innocence of the children in this. Jamie Bower, Jane Wisener, and Eddie Sanders, seem like waifish, angelic babes in a ""innocence lost"" scenario that is deeply moving and heart-breaking. a horrifying statement about the terrors and corruption that befall children in this world.<br/><br/>as a matter of fact, this movie is probably okay for children to see. but absolutely not without adult supervision. it wholly deserves it's 'R' rating for some of the most graphic violence i've ever seen in a movie. the numerous throat slashings are ghastly and horrific and should not be seen by kids. but that's the dilemma the adult parent faces in their decision. this film has a deep statement to make about childhood and half of it's protagonist are children. there is also very little profanity and sex is only suggested. it is also such well conceived culture a kid can only become more sophisticated because of it. but parents should be warned that much of this is inappropriate for kids. not only is it too violent, but it features a gin guzzling ten year old.<br/><br/>this is a profound and amazing cinema experience. despite it's dark negativity, the viewer can only grow from it. it's truly one of cinema's very, best musicals. it's ""R"" rating isn't wrong it's just a paradox of sorts. it's unsuitable but yet for all audiences. that doesn't seem to make sense but it's true."

","Being a fan of Tim Burton's films I wanted to watch this despite not being a huge fan of musicals and having a phobia about cut throat razors. I'm glad I did, as it was an enjoyable film even if I did have to look away from the screen a few times. Johnny Depp plays Sweeny Todd, a barber who has returned to London after fifteen years of penal servitude. The only crime he had committed was to fall in love and be loved by a lady who was fancied by the local judge. He soon learns that his beloved took poison and his daughter is now the ward of the judge. Heading back to his old shop he finds the downstairs premises is now Mrs Lovett's Pie Shop. This woman, played by Helena Bonham-Carter boasts that her pies are the worst in London! He is determined that he will have his revenge on those people who have wronged him, but first he must get back to work as a barber. He is soon confronted by a former employee who recognises him and threatens to report him to the authorities for returning to England. Having killed this man Mrs Lovett comes up with the ideal way to dispose of the bodyÂ… her pies will no longer be the worst in London; she will need a regular supply of meat though! <br/><br/>This film was a lot of fun and rather dark, as one would expect from Tim Burton; it was also quite gruesome with buckets of blood being spilt. While the singing wasn't great and the songs weren't exactly what one will find oneself humming they weren't bad; the acting was good, as one would expect from this cast. As well as Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall were great; they played the judge and his odious beadleÂ… characters that made the murderous barber and the pie-maker seem positively saintly. The London of 'Sweeny Todd' never feels quite real; it looks more like the set you'd find in films made forty or fifty years ago, this combined with the singing gave it an unreal almost theatrical feel which I think added to my enjoyment.<br/><br/>Over all if you are an adult fan of Tim Burton or any of the stars this is a must see; it is not however suitable for children; it may be a musical but it has an '18' certificate for a reason!"

","'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' is perhaps Burton's darkest movie to date. He masterfully combines two genres: musical and horror, with a tablespoon of humour and makes what is a grizzly and yet fascinating experience for the viewer. It clearly ranks as one of the finest musicals of all time. Shot beautifully, using washed out colours, Gothic art direction and dark lighting, London is portrayed as gloomy, sick and depressing but darker than that are its inhabitants. The film is high on violence but for me the most disturbing scene was the rape. It was rather suggestive than graphic but the idea of raping a woman and putting it on show in a party while the public cheer on left a more horrific feel. The songs are very amusing and the cast do quite a good job at it. Coming to the performances, now who better to play Sweeney Todd than Johnny Depp? Depp is transcendent and he defines Todd. With a cold quiet intensity, rage and vulnerability and a hunger for blinding revenge is all displayed to excellence by Mr. Depp. Even though many were not happy with her interpretation, Helena Bonham Carter too does a stupendous job. Alan Rickman is no stranger to evil characters but all of them pale in comparison to Judge. Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall do an equally convincing job. The only flip side for me was the Johanna-Anthony love story which could have done without so much screen time but this is more than made up for. 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' only proves that Burton is still one of the best directors today and 'Sweeney Todd' is the cinematic experience one wouldn't want to miss."

I think i'll re-watch this later, on a bigger screen, with better lighting. That's what i get for watching things on my Ipod.."

","Dark shadowy streets and poorly-lit rooms introduce us to a gloomy Dickensian atmosphere which is maintained through most of the film. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is not a cheerful fellow. How could he be? Judge Turpin who once condemned him to prison has stolen his wife Lucy and their little daughter Johanna.<br/><br/>Mrs.Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter)who sells meat pies is one of his few friends. She has a spare room above her shop which she says would make a good barber shop. Some say Sweeney is the best barber in London. He probably is. Certainly better than Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen). So Sweeney sets up shop which meets with Mrs.Lovett's approval.<br/><br/>This horror musical is a story of revenge as Sweeney sets his sights on the Judge luring him to his barber's chair where a quick shave promises an opportunity to slit his throat. Mrs.Lovett enters unannounced and the opportunity is lost. Sweeney's fit of uncontrollable rage makes him more determined than ever as he plunges into despair on the point of madness.<br/><br/>Art decoration and costumes are award winners for this film as are the principal players for their perfect characterizations. Most of the dialogue is sung in this Sondheim musical. Half sung half spoken and with a Cockney accent is a triumph for the actors. ""My friends"" has a sinister appeal as Sweeney gloats over his shiny cut-throat razors; ""Johanna"" his daughter is captive in the Judge's house. ""While I'm around"" is one of my favourites.<br/><br/>At the depth of his madness Sweeney makes alterations to his barber's chair so that he can tip it backwards after murdering his victims. The bodies are directed to the basement where the human flesh can be put through a mincer and the bones discarded into the blazing furnace. The pie shop flourishes with its popular meaty pies. Mrs.Lovettsays it's a shame to waste the meat, it being quite expensive and hard to come by.<br/><br/>Some people might not appreciate the bloody mess as Sweeney hacks at the jugular veins of his victims. It is not a pretty sight. However I find the basement scene where the human mince disgorges from the mincer even more horrifying. Add to this the complaints from residents of the awful smells issuing from the premises and we get a fair picture of the situation.<br/><br/>There is some relief from the dreary atmosphere when Mrs.Lovett dreams of a day by the seaside. The screen is suddenly filled with sunshine and joyous colours so different from the world in which she lives.<br/><br/>This is a splendid production, well put together with every detail attended to. Some might argue that in certain scenes there is too much detail. But there can be no argument that the Sondheim musical has been transferred from the stage to the screen in the most admirable fashion."

","Tim Burton perplexes me. I should like him. He's dark and quirky with a childlike view of the world. But somethings usually missing with his films, an intangible thing that's hard to nail down. Sweeney Todd should have made me feel something, I should have cared. Stephen Sondheim's brilliant modern opera is heart wrenching, a Greek tragedy set in bleakest Victorian London. The characters are broad, yes, but still we should understand the nuances and subtleties. Burton's version doesn't allow us to do this. It doesn't let us in. The view is beautiful, filmed in a kind of dream reality where nothing looks quite right. The colors and CGI environment pulse with life, more compelling than the action itself. There is much music and singing, some very beautiful, but it never reaches any heights. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney and I'm always glad to see him. But, in this Burton makes him a cartoon of the character, sweeping a huge shock of white through his hair and directing him in a ridiculously subdued way. Bejamin Barker/Sweeney should grimace at Heaven, curse God with gusto, hate the world like no man ever has. Depp does none of these things. Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, a role originally written especially for Angela Lansbury, a role that requires equal passion, desperation...and pipes. These are both great actors who are miscast. Depp and Carter are too young, too pretty, too surface. Alan Rickman, way past stereotyping himself as a meanie, channels Potter's Snape throughout the film. Many character actors could have eaten this role up and it's a shame someone else wasn't given a chance. There are no bad performances here, just misplaced ones, too familiar to be unique. This is a gory story, but I grew annoyed at the tedious graphic view of...what happened to many of the victims. Not to have any spoilers, I will just say I didn't have to see it over, and over, and over. I got it with the first one. Blood is almost a character itself in this. Gushing, spurting, flowing in as many ways as it can, Buton goes too far with the Grand Guignol distracting us from the drama we should be immersed in. I love horror movies, but this should not be SUCH a horror movie. Ultimately I was as disappointed in this as I was in the way too over the top Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and excuse for toy merchandising, Planet of the Apes (which only made me love the original more). It's highly watchable, entertaining and worth seeing, just not what it could have been."

","This is strictly Tim Burton's take on the stage musical ""Sweeney Todd."" As such, it is almost surrealistic in its retelling of the legend of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Johnny Depp as Todd has returned to London after 15 years away, having been shanghaied so that the local judge (Alan Rickman) can have his way with Todd's comely young wife. Todd keeps to the shadows as he plots his revenge, with the aid of a pie maker, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Carter), who remembers and adores him. The two are soon turning into meat pies all who enter Sweeney's chair, as Todd broods on how to get his razor around the judge's throat. The songs are imaginatively staged and sung, and Depp is as usual completely immersed in his character. He's a razor-wielding, hollow-eyed maniac with a mission. The throat cuttings are plentiful and shown in extreme closeup. The bodies then fall head-first with a sickening thud onto the cellar floor three stories below. This is more intense and realistic violence than Burton exhibited in SLEEPY HOLLOW, so those of weak constitutions beware. And definitely keep the kiddies away!"

","The movie opens with what I can only describe as a classic Tim Burton style, as the camera zooms through the streets of Old London. With such a Burton ""signature"" you have to know that you're in for something of an unusual movie - and you get it. This is, in fact, a very odd combination of things. It's a musical about a demonic mass-murdering barber and somehow in the midst of it all it also has a few scenes that are actually quite funny - for humour I think right off of Mrs. Lovett's ""The Worst Pies In London"" near the start of the movie. Johnny Depp as the ""demon barber"" Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett are excellent and performed well together, and the supporting performances were probably topped by Timothy Spall's go as the Beadle. The story of Todd's quest for murderous revenge against the judge who stole his young wife from him years before moves along pretty nicely (although I have to admit that it took some effort for me to get through the first few scenes for some reason) and most of the songs are well performed. As for weaknesses, it seemed obvious to me for some reason who the old lady who kept popping up was, so that came as no particular surprise to me and in all honesty I thought Burton went a bit overboard with the bloodiness of the murder scenes - although it is Tim Burton we're talking about. There was also that strangely off putting (to me) opening couple of scenes that failed to pull me in, although in the end I'm glad I stuck with this. For the most part it was a lot of fun. 7/10"

","...though certainly not for all tastes, Tim ""Mars Attacks"" Burton's adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical showcases yet another twisted performance (and singing, no less!) from Johnny ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" Depp as the vengeful barber with a wicked set of razors. Depp's star power makes it small wonder that the woefully outnumbered female contingent on the IMDb liked this one even more than its stereotypically bloodthirsty male cohorts, with the exception of 45yo+ females who no doubt cringed at the graphic bloodletting and corpse-dumping.<br/><br/>Despite the complaints from many of his purist fans, Sondheim apparently approved of Burton's vision; I've never seen the stage production, and had no problem with the altering/dropping of various songs, any more than I did with the filmed versions of ""Rent"" or ""Little Shop of Horrors."" What works onstage doesn't always play as well on film.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is of a piece with his previous outings with Burton; one can hardly avoid being reminded of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and even ""Corpse Bride."" That he sings decently is reward enough, but it's his acting that brings the character to life (and death). Helena Bonham ""Frankenstein"" Carter rises to the challenge of Mrs. Lovett, the lady who aids and abets culinary legerdemain, and does some commendable singing of her own. Alan ""Die Hard"" Rickman assays his typical effete villain with ease (and some delightfully credible singing), while Timothy ""Gothic"" Spall feeds audience bloodlust with an equally slimy turn. Sacha Baron ""Borat"" Cohen is hilarious as Todd's first victim. Newcomers Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower don't fare as well as the subplot's young lovers; they sing quite beautifully, but Wisener's part is too one-dimensional and Bower is too androgynously fey to be believable. No matter; the show is still pretty much Depp and Carter's and they mostly shine, or at least as much as one can do so within the grimy shades of Dickensian London.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the style and vision is pure Burton, lovingly realized by the likes of Production Designer Dante ""Gangs of New York"" Ferretti, Art Director Gary ""Children of Men"" Freeman, and longtime Burton collaborator, Costumer Colleen ""Ed Wood"" Atwood. Dariusz ""Dark City"" Wolski's camera-work is evocative, eloquently limning Burton's dingy, squalid London while providing the necessary movement to keep things proceeding apace. Likewise, Burton stalwart Chris ""Wolfen"" Lebenzon's editing shaves scenes as tightly together as one of Todd's razors might.<br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws, though, one of the most prominent being Burton's insistence on showing us every last corpse hitting the killing floor of Mrs. Lovett's subterranean cookery. The welter of spurting arterial blood I could understand, but the continual crunching of victims onto stone like a sack of potatoes got old quick, and seemed like overkill. Your appetites may vary.<br/><br/>Still, a fine piece of work by Mr. Burton, etal., regardless of the limited appeal to general audiences. Recommended, though not for children, of course."

Its all a bit too much for me...that being said ST isn't all that bad. Its a rather beautiful film, the design and cinematography are superb. There is a dreary sheen that permeates every frame that is quite beautiful. There is something to be said about the gore in this film which is amazingly excessive and wonderful. Any cast with Johny Depp and Alan Rickman at the top of the bill is by definition amazing and they don't disappoint. Helena Bonham Carter and the always superb Sasha Baron Cohen are equity fantastic.

","Tim Burton has taken everything to the extreme with his adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". I saw the stage production back in 1996 when it came to Portland. Obviously, the movie version had to remove a few things, but they still did a really good job with it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is just great as Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker: with ghostly white makeup and jet black hair - except for a white streak - he looks like something out of a 1930s horror flick (many of which had the same setting as this movie). Equally menacing is Helena Bonham Carter as his partner-in-crime, pie maker Mrs. Lovett: looking almost exactly like her role as Bellatrix LaStrange in the Harry Potter movies, she's the perfect cross between scary and sexy. Alan Rickman -who seems to be channeling his role as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies - turns Judge Turpin into one nasty dude: it's hard not to wish that corrupt thug ill. Sacha Baron Cohen...well, although it's hard to imagine him as anyone other than Borat, he plays Adolfo Pirelli to a tee. Timothy Spall, as Turpin's assistant Beadle Bamford, creates the same kind of weaselly character that he played in the Harry Potter movies and ""Enchanted""; you gotta admire this character! <br/><br/>Yet another character - so to speak - is the setting. We see London as an ugly, dark, nearly pestilent place. All in all, this combination creates a very fine film. Not Burton's best in my opinion (I consider ""Ed Wood"" his best), but a true accomplishment. And remember: desperate times require desperate measures."

","Okay folks, I've been eying a movie for a while and that movie was Sweeney Todd. This film is Depp's and Burton's 6th collaboration together, the others include ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Sleepy Hallow"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Ed Wood"". Burton's style is always wacky and imaginative, and honestly...sometimes fails, say for instance Planet of the Apes and the Batman films. Although I still have yet to see a Burton-Depp film that I haven't appreciated, including this one. -Based on a Broadway play the film stars Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, and Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin. The setup is this: A man by the name of Benjamen Barker has everything in the world including a wife and child. A jealous judge falsely accuses Ben and he is exiled to Austrailia for 15 years. When Ben returns 15 years later as Sweeney Todd he wants revenge on everyone involved by slitting their throats and hiding their bodies in meat pies to be sold by Mrs. Lovett. -I quite enjoyed myself, but found Burton's style a little different.than usual. The film shows whimsy with a dark side, a really dark side. Even for a Burton film whose main character is a murderous barber bent on revenge, it can really creep you out. The songs are all really fun and charming, while the film itself carries a great storyline about how revenge effects one's life, a tragedy. Also Depp and Carter create quite a fun dynamic and Alan Rickman is a really messed up villain. Killing people is one thing, but the crap he does is just mean. If you don't mind pools of blood squirting everywhere, the film features fun songs with a great story. A dark (probably Burton's darkest) bordering charming and whimsical is a match made in heaven...or hell. Pick this one up on DVD the first day it comes out, definitely worth the twenty some bucks."

","A dark cityscape opens Sweeney Todd, Tim Burton's adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical, but a baby-faced sailor (Jamie Campbell Bower) seems not to notice the gloom. Dismissing all the glories he's seen in his travels, he cheerily decides that there's ""no place like London,"" in a voice chipper enough to force the sun to shine. But Sweeney Todd isn't that kind of musical. It needs a different kind of hero, and Bower is soon forced out of frame by the more troubled face of Johnny Depp, who sings, ""You are young. Life has been kind to you You will learn."" Life was once kind to Depp's Sweeney Todd. As a younger man, he was a successful barber with a beautiful wife and child. But the evil Judge Turpin (a perfectly cast Alan Rickman) decided to take Depp's family as his own, and had Depp arrested and deported. After more than a decade in exile, the newly bloodthirsty Depp returns to reclaim what's his, or failing that, punish those who took it away. He soon finds an ally in Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett, proprietor of a filthy bakery famed for ""the worst pies in London,"" which she conveniently makes below Depp's old shop.<br/><br/>The character of Sweeney Todd has been slicing up victimsand sometimes having them baked into pies by Mrs. Lovettin pulp literature, films, and plays since the 19th century. Inspired by a 1973 play by Christopher Bond, Sondheim's 1979 musical turned him into a pitiable monster whose thirst for revenge went beyond understandable to become sympathetic. Enveloping the tale in dark humor and lush, sometimes frighteningly romantic music, Sondheim's musical made Todd's story into an inspired, tuneful wallow in the darkest depths of human experience. Burton brings his signature visual style, and a pair of stock players for his stars, into this film adaptation, but he wisely follows Sondheim's lead, letting the music and spirit of the original piece show the way.<br/><br/>It goes to some pretty dark places. Though it took 28 years to make it to the screen, this musical about revenge and its repercussions seems fitting for our revenge-steeped times. Depp and Carter commit beastly deeds, but they keep their characters' humanity front and center. Even Rickman's villain projects a surprising vulnerability, and though all three stars have clearly been chosen for their acting skills rather than their singing voices, the earthiness of their vocal performances keeps the film grounded in the grit and grime of a world that grinds up the innocent and the guilty alike. Those who try to turn the crank themselves get the worst of it in the end, but even they deserve a chance to sing about the love and hope that brought them so low."

","I am not a fan of musicals, but I did enjoy Sweeney Todd. This was a project made for Tim Burton and his was easily the best director for the film.<br/><br/>The film is based on the Broadway musical which was based on the infamous killer (who may or may not existed). Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a barber who had lived happily in London with his wife and daughter. However, a evil judge had him arrested and sent him to Australia and took his wife and daughter away. Barker returns to London 15-years later, renamed himself Sweeney Todd and he was looking for revenge. When Sweeney returns he befriends Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who's pie business is failing. The come up with a working relationship where Sweeney becomes a barber and gets to fill his blood lust and Mrs. Lovett gets free meat to make tasty pies.<br/><br/>Burton's direction was great for this film, getting the Gothic feel which he is famous for, whilst adding a little humour. I prefer Burton when he makes more adult film then some of his family friendly one and when he is independence. It is also a little cartoon when it comes to the violence, obvious people do die in nasty ways, but the blood is bright red and it is a little overplayed. But I think it was needed because a gritty realist approach was not going to work. The casting was great. Helena Bonham Carter is an actress who I think is just great and I think that she was really good in this and was the best actor in the film. Johnny Depp is good, like he normally is and he does have a strong working relationship with Burton. I would admit that he isn't a strong singer, but he is better to say Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia (it is comedically bad). Depp's English accent also reminded me of Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. But he is still very good with many of his songs and general acting. Alan Rickman is always good as a villain and there is a promising young actor, Ed Sanders, who was great as a drunk street kid. There was also Timothy Spall who does he usual creepy guy performance and Sacha Baron Cohen who added a little comic relief, and is better then in most of this thing i.e. Ali G. There were some good songs and this film is a great bit of escapism.<br/><br/>Only one word of warning: this film is not for the faint hearted."

","As I have heard of this movie, I went to see it on the big screen not so much due to the story but foremost because of Johnny Depp whose latest performances have occurred to me as outstanding. His dark role in THE LIBERTINE, his moving depiction in FINDING NEVERLAND or his interesting portrayals in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN result in pretty successful movies. Therefore, for me, SWEENEY TODD was, I could say, a true vehicle for a celebrity. And I was not disappointed: Johnny Depp does a terrific job as Benjamin Barker - a riddle man, with almost a demon-like spell whose new shop trembles the London of his time. Yet, what else is there left in the film that one could find worth seeing? <br/><br/>It is true that SWEENEY TODD is a very macabre story, which is executed in an explicit way. It's for sure not a film for youngsters or sensitive people who easily get into changeable moods. Since there are lots of scenes when the main character simply cuts the throats of his customers and throws the bodies into the ""cellar kitchen"", it's naturally harmful and not easy to bear. How can the blood spouting from the throats be not disturbing and disgusting? Considering this aspect only, I certainly do find the film harmful. As I have discussed this aspect in many of my comments, I could again ask the same question: What is the idea of showing such terrible acts and, moreover, making fun of murder? However, if you look at this movie from a different perspective, then you will notice something captivating. Therefore, let me skip the moral side in the content and try to analyze SWEENEY TODD solely as the movie.<br/><br/>The film will stun you as a very well managed direction with marvelous cinematography, perfect camera-work, wonderful shots, breathtaking reconstruction of London and, to my great surprise, good musical features. If you consider the scenes in the streets of London, you realize that attention is being paid to every single detail. The mood supplied by cinematography and shots is unforgettable. As for musical, SWEENEY TODD can boast something many musicals lack nowadays - genuineness. Sometimes, musicals are filled with fake moments that discourage many people. Consequently, they claim to detest musicals. This one, however, is valuable. It has all the convincing themes a good musical should have: love, revenge, sorrow, a bit of sentimentality and a visual aspect enriched and embedded by music.<br/><br/>But the true advantage of the movie are many leading performances. Except for the aforementioned Johnny Depp, I very much liked Helena Bonham Carter in the role of Mrs Lovett, Alan Rickman as the villain Jugge Turnip (does he always have to play the villains?) and deliciously beautiful Jane Wisener in the role of Johanna. Who can forget the moment Jugde Turnip visits Mr Todd for the first time? The expression on the face of Johanna while Anthony sings ""I feel you...I'll steal you"" is also memorable. But, indeed there are also performances that leave much to be desired. I did not like Jamie Campbell Bower in the role of Anthony. He should have put more heart into his performance. It seems that he does not feel the role whatsoever!<br/><br/>All in all, what to think of SWEENEY TODD? After seeing the macabre and unpredictable ending, you may have mixed feelings about particular scenes and about the movie in general. What is it? a horror? a thriller? a dark comedy? or just a movie meant to shock and entertain at the same time? It is, for sure, a bloody revenge and a nightmare, perhaps, but a stunning one with a dark sense of humor. Strange mix, indeed but worth a look."

","Now, admittedly, I've never been one to neither seek out nor watch musicals. Nor Tim Burton films for that matter. But the revered auteur's take on the infamous legend of London's 19th century barber-cum-bourgeoisie-slayer Ben' Barker (a.k.a. Sweeney Todd), starring frequently used thesps Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter could'nt be avoided, even if tried. I think, though, that most would agree with me when I say that musicals are somewhat of a dieing breed in contemporary cinema, yes? Well, try telling that to Tim Burton, as the master of mise-en-scene appears to be on a personal mission not only to reinstate the genre into the heart of the mainstream but to firmly stamp his mark upon it. And with Sweeney Todd: the demon barber of Fleet Street, Burton's melodious mission would appear complete.<br/><br/>Adapted for the screen by John Logan (The Aviator, Gladiator) from the equally titled hit Broadway musical, this menacing yet witty tale revolves around Sweeney Todd (Depp) a once exiled barber who upon his long-overdue return to London (""there's no place like London"") embarks on a murderous path of personal reprisal and saaaaaaalvaaaaaaaation in an attempt to avenge the injustice surrounding his deport and the maltreatment of his family. Returning to his Fleet Street family home only to find that it's been converted into the worst pie shop in London, Todd teams up with Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) the owner of the rundown bistro who allows the blood-thirsty barber to open a private studio above the boiler room where he proceeds to lure disreputable aristocrats (""they alllll deserve to diiieeee"") for a swift, close and fatal shave.<br/><br/>Depp, in his 6th and arguably most challenging collaboration with Burton, was hardly a surprise choice for the role of the fluctuating, zany Todd. Good guy, bad guy, drug-lord, pirate, candy-maker, gangster, scissorhandthingy: there's no role Depp can't take on without rendering it idiosyncratic and believable, fresh and memorable. Add ""musical barber"" to that list, then. For Depp's charismatic, Oscar-nominated portrayal of the ferocious, pallid-faced Todd is awash with humour and horror, colour and darkness. There aren't many actors out there who would be able to embrace the demands of such an uncanny role which requires singing, shouting, prancing and dancing while sporting a face full of slap. And I know what you're thinking: ""what about Michael Jackson?"", well, sorry, but he isn't an actor. At least not a good one. But Depp is. And sing, shout, prance and dance he most certainly can. As can Bonham Carter who gives an impressive supporting performance as Todd's melodic, pastel-faced cockney counterpart. Alan Rickman and Sasha Baron Cohen also contribute with solid cameo performances. Although Rickman's singing does leave much to be desired <br/><br/>As with the bulk of Burton's previous sets, the decor is not only fitting but unmistakably excellent. Antiquated yet glossy, dark yet dazzling. Imagine a masterful blend between the dimness of Sleepy Hollow and Batman with the sheer charisma of Beetlejuice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Could this be Burton's masterpiece? Perhaps. Whatever it is, it looks simply wonderful. The lighting, locations, costumes, makeup and special effects compliment one another to such a credible extent that the diegetic world crafted by Burton and co. is to die for. Then there's Dariusz Wolski's razor-sharp photography. Working with Burton for the first time, Depp: the third, the Poll's choice of shots are largely incisive and erratic, fast yet operatic and bleed so effortlessly into the melodramatic and cartoon-like content of the sadistic plot. The musical set-pieces, though, are what underscore and, in all honesty, exemplify the film. The vast majority of dialogue is conveyed via song which will displease many mainstream spectators. But lure theatre enthusiasts from the foyers of Broadway and beyond who will most probably take to the style and pacing of the numerous, lyrically gritty and indisputably catchy routines. Imagine, if you will, Oliver on acid with a psychotic, super-human thirst for blue blood. No? Okay, well, see Sweeney Todd for yourself and conjure your own views and opinions regarding the lyrics, form and content of the melodies. I'm no expert. But what I do know is that Tim Burton has taken a dead-beat genre, sliced and diced it thoroughly, marinated it with his midest trademark traits and tossed in two of his favourite thesps to create an eccentric and bloody enjoyable cinematic recipe. Fancy a shave? A quick shave? A close shave? Sweeney's waiting."

","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborate yet again for a ghoulish masterpiece of entertaining film-making that dazzles and disturbs right from the get-go.<br/><br/>It's Victorian London and Depp is Benjamin Barker, a barber from the city wrongly exiled from England on a prison ship after the callous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes a fancy to his wife. Returning to London after fifteen years, Barker adopts the name Sweeney Todd. With the aid of Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), a beastly pie-maker, and his cut-throat razors, Todd embarks on a murderous, bloody rampage of revenge...<br/><br/>Fantastic cinematography that uses subtle shades of black and white and muted colours really adds an edge and creepy atmosphere to proceedings. It contrasts well with the literally buckets of red blood that come pouring forth from the throats of Todd's hapless victims.<br/><br/>The script, based on Stephen Sondheim's famous musical, has been adapted flawlessly for the film. There is some well-written characterisation with enough twists and turns apt for this kind of melodrama, and the well-performed songs possess enough wit and tragic irony to be effective.<br/><br/>Despite sporting the same accent he used for Captain Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, Depp nicely avoids comparisons with his signature role. He makes Todd dangerous yet sympathetic and we feel for him throughout, despite the fact he's basically a serial killer. Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's wife, is also excellent as pie-maker Mrs Lovett who has a grisly secret of her own. Her ultimate fate is terrifying, but there is little doubt she has it coming. Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as his henchman both turn in fine performances. It's nothing we haven't seen from either of them before, but they're still good. Sacha Baron-Cohen, of ""Borat"" fame, has a fine cameo as a rival barber and Jayne Wisener is pretty and enchanting as Todd's long-lost daughter Johanna. There's a girl who's going places.<br/><br/>A brilliant and lush Gothic treat, and an absolute must for Tim Burton fans."

","At last, the darkly funny, disturbing play comes to the bug screen. And who better to direct it then the master of mixing darkness with innocence, Tim Burton! And of course Johnny Depp is one of the few who could pull this role off with his own eccentric twists. Not to mention a wonderful performance by Helena! You may not enjoy this if you are easily disturbed or faint at the sight of blood (then you'll be sent to the emergency room should you watch this all the way through). The feel of the movie was perfect, and since when does Johnny Depp sing? Since this movie was made! Not only does he and Helena sing, but they sing very well, and do they ever know how to harmonize! Despite the fact that Perill is the guy from Borat, he does a great job! And of course the evil judge simply must be played by the same man who was Snape! Though I wouldn't suggest watching this with small children, or if you cant take violence, its still a really, really, really great film. Oh, and you may not want to eat pie while watching this."

","After a second viewing I enjoyed this a lot more, the first time around I was so caught off guard, it was a bit alienating. I hadn't expected the wall to wall classical musical theater that I got here, but for what it is, it works. Tim Burton does a good job of mixing in plenty of violence and black comedy, to keep the story moving along, but there are a few too many scenes that seem better designed for the stage than the screen.<br/><br/>I'm sure on stage signing in a solitary dilapidated building has a great emotional impact, on screen though it just gets kind of repetitive and boring. The songs translate best when at their are most onieric, whether Todd is fantasizing about running through the streets blades in hand or Mr. Lovett dreaming of their house by the sea, Burton's imagination is at it's most engaging and the film is too.<br/><br/>But aside from that it was good, it's a musical about a murderous barber slicing people's throats and his assistant baking them into meat pies. The film is at it's weakest when it goes for melodrama, I enjoyed it more than most musicals and I can see how fans of theater will get a definite kick out of it, but for me the campier ""Little Shop Of Horrors"" and ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" will always hold the gold standard for musical horror/comedy theater."

","Ah Sweeney Todd. Dark, menacing and brilliant. The streets of London are refulgent with greed, lust and death. The setting here is truly horrific, and Burton emphasises this, almost elevating the backdrop to the status of a main character. <br/><br/>The music carries it along nicely, the songs not sounding too repetitive. Of course this is down to the original brilliance of the Sondheim musical, making it a far more enjoyable watch than, let's say, last year's horrific 'Dreamgirls'. I will not say that the singing is perfect, and perhaps this is where the film loses that last star. Depp makes a stellar effort both acting and singing-wise and on the whole manages to pull it off with a sinister glow, whilst Helena Bonham Carter speaks and slurs her way through her lines. However her lack of musical talent is less pronounced due to her amazing acting ability and wonderful charm; she seemed to make poor singing ability fit her character, even if she was a lead in a musical. The most impressive musical talent was shown by Ed Sanders, playing the young boy Toby; he had a fantastic voice, along with high quality acting ability; he should go very far. <br/><br/>Campbell Bower and Wisener are also acceptable in their roles as the young lovers, but their story seems rather dull due to the lack of charm present in both young actors; I felt that it seemed as though that had been chosen purely on their singing ability.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall scared and entertained as usual, both inhabiting their natural roles as villain and slimy sidekick; there's a reason they're typecast: they're excellent in the part. <br/><br/>Sascha Baron Cohen also performed well, if only for a brief time. Here is a performance that proves he can pull-off a serious (-ish!) role with style and panache. <br/><br/>The gore, although plentiful, is of a very theatrical nature, and i found that it did not make me too squeamish. However, if you do have a weak stomach I would suggest that this is not the film for you. <br/><br/>Overall I felt that this was a stylish, powerful film that seemed to affect me more than many films these days, seemingly creating pathos for the titular character even whilst he was brutally slaughtering innocent people."

","This Tim Burton adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical is filled with the dark and twisted visions we have come to expect from the director, and this musical/horror is a rare example of the two genres working well together, largely because of a range of eccentric characters effectively interpreted by a highly competent cast.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp leads the way as Benjamin Barker, once a barber with a young family but now transformed into the brooding madman Todd by false imprisonment imposed on him by the reptilian Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) so that he can get his hands on Barker's beautiful wife. As Helen Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovett observes, the years ain't been kind to Barker and he is consumed by a rage against Turpin that, when frustrated in his attempted murder of the judge, he diverts toward any hapless soul who happens to sit in his chair. Rounding out the cast are Sacha Baron Cohen as a fake Italian barber who becomes Todd's first victim, Timothy Spall as Turpin's wonderfully odious sidekick, and a rather bland Jamie Campbell-Bower as Anthony, the young sailor who falls for Todd's daughter.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogue is sung by the actors, and none of them appear to have voice doubles judging by some of the vocal performances, but this somehow manages to strengthen the technique rather than weaken it. The tunes, for the most part, aren't exactly tuneful anyway but the sometimes lacklustre stretches are counter-pointed by some wonderful flourishes from Burton. Depp, having just about mastered the English accent, gives a towering performance. He is the film and, too a large degree, whether it stands or falls rests squarely on his shoulders. Depp is versatile enough to carry it off with aplomb, however, and develops a nice twisted chemistry with Bonham-Carter. The pair play well off of each other and the perverse family unit they form with young tearaway Toby (Ed Sanders) serves to emphasise where Todd's and Lovett's ambitions part company.<br/><br/>It has to be said that this film may prove to be something of an acquired taste. Musicals like this spend much of their time allowing characters to express feelings that couldn't be verbally expressed in a more straightforward narrative without losing credibility. Although I enjoyed it well enough while watching, I'm not sure I'd be particularly inclined to watch it again."

It is very refreshing to see a darker kind of comedy which works well. The film delivers very well on the blood, gore and guts meter in a surprisingly palatable way.

I felt that the music was a nice touch to all of the gore and the dark humor.

","Johnny Depp is Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. But he didn't start out that way. In fact he was a young, naive man with a pretty wife and a very young daughter. But something happened to destroy his whole world in Olde London, and that is the catalyst for the story told here.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett who owns the bake shop below Sweeney's barber shop. Things are tough, good meat is hard to get and expensive for her meat pies, so we find her struggling. It turns out that she and Sweeney are made for each other.<br/><br/>Good old, versatile Alan Rickman is Judge Turpin, who doesn't always have the best interests of the law in mind. His trusty sidekick is Timothy Spall as Beadle.<br/><br/>It is hard to say what audience this movie is for. My wife had no interest in seeing it, but I enjoyed it for the performances and the production values. There is lots of blood and gore, but much of it in a whimsical manner.<br/><br/>It is fairly well known that most of the actors, including Depp and Bonhan Carter, had never sung before in any official capacity (singing in the shower doesn't count!). The DVD has a very interesting 25 minute extra which in part discusses the process. I found Depp to have an outstanding stage singing style, but listening to Bonham Carter was not so pleasant.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The dishonest judge admired the young wife and had Sweeney arrested and put out to sea to die. The movie opens with him coming back to London after perhaps 15 to 18 years, with revenge on his mind. His plan was simple, to get the judge into his barber chair and slit his throat. But things didn't work out that way, the evil judge had Sweeney's now almost grown daughter held captive in his home. But Sweeney really turned demonic when someone recognized him and tried to blackmail him. That forced a killing that sparked a new enterprise. He would slit throats so that Mrs Lovett would have an ample supply of fresh meat for her pies. And they were a big hit with customers. But eventually both Sweney and Mrs Lovett met their own deaths."

","Ladies and gentlemen, clap your handsTim Burton has accomplished his darkest, sickest, sadistic, most twisted and perverse piece yet; and he's done it with a musical. Don't expect a lot of talking in ""Sweeney Todd"", because the actors sing most of the film. It opens with a ship arriving to London, and a sailor singing about how nothing compares to the city. But a man next to him, Sweeney Todd, thinks the opposite. Already on the city streets, he sings to the sailor: ""There was a barber and his wife"", as he tells a story. <br/><br/>It's a beautifully sad song; part of Stephen Sondheim's musical, expertly conducted in Burton's version by Paul Gemignani, with an orchestra that includes nothing more than strings: peaceful but scary strings. For a short time, 'peaceful and scary' appears to be an accurate description for what's going on, from the perfect opening sequence until the moment Sweeney meets Mrs. Lovett.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter plays her in a stupendous performance. A human interpretation of a character that accepts her reality before Sweeney comes into her life (she sings the funniest song of the film, telling him hers are the ugliest pies in town) and deals with the changes the barber brings to her routine, making sacrifices for a man she secretly loves. Still, Bonham Carter leaves room for some surprises.<br/><br/>Because when characters don't sing, John Logan's screenplay brings a subtle amount of black humor to the table and the necessary amount of character development. Of course ""Sweeney Todd"" is a classic revenge tale, but if it weren't for some scenes we wouldn't empathize so much with the main character. Besides his idiosyncrasy, we immediately recognize in Sweeney the scars of a truly wounded man.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp embodies the character from this contradiction; so he has moments of pure rage that the viewer may be shocked with or not, but there are times where we sense sadness in his face or a need for silence, loneliness and meditation. This is the key to his performance's success (not even his impressive singing talent), which works the most when he combines both sides. Like in a scene (a song) where Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett find a solution to their miseries (or something like that, you'll choose) and dance together; he with his razor she with her pie stick. The way Bonham Carter looks through the window during that song is pure marvel. <br/><br/>Sweeney is not the typical Burton outcast; it's more like a normal human being who died and is trying to see how it feels to be alive again.<br/><br/>To be honest, everyone works at a great level in ""Sweeney Todd"". For example, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are wickedly cruel, and (do believe it) they sing; a little kid called Ed Sanders is the best singer of the ensemble and a very convincing performer; the production design and the cinematography make London a place you want to hate as Sweeney does: an obscure, unpredictable colder than nowadays. <br/><br/>While Tim Burton is the craziest of them allA master of fantasies and of tone changing in the middle of them, the director this time sticks to the style and world he's chosen: he puts his own touches to Sweeney (the gray part of the hair); makes him see the light only once while making sure the makeup and costume generate a contrast that makes him look like a dead corpse on the beach or a prisoner, if you may; and ultimately leads him to his dark, sick, twisted, perverse and tragic end. Brilliant."

","I was very curious for the new Tim Burton film, as I am a great fan of his work. Although many critics claim that this is his best film yet, I have to disagree on this one. Don't get me wrong, the music is great, the scene and imaginary settings of London are great. You really got swept away in the dark, creepy, macabre fantasy-world created by the master himself. So I must say, if you liked Sleepy Hollow than you will like this one. The only thing that is a bit disappointing is the storyline. It's a likely predictable story, not filled with intrigues and mysteries like in Sleepy Hollow. The film is also more cruel and violent than Sleepy Hollow... (the red blood on the white face of Depp in Sleepy Hollow when he cuts in the corpses, speaks more to the imagination than the blood that splatters out of the sliced throats in Sweeney Todd) Yet the film is stunning in its own way. For a moment you can forget anything you thought you knew about film-making. If you can handle a bit of gore, than I say to anyone: go watch this movie. Let Sweeney's revenge, the scenery, the music and the great acting make you a voyeuristic actor yourself, in a dark alley nearby Fleet Street..."

","Only director Tim Burton could possibly contemplate producing a Gothic musical about a murderous, serial-killing barber. 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)' is one of the bloodiest movies that you'll see all year, but there's something about the juxtaposition of murder and music that makes his film utterly irresistible. The screenplay was adapted from Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical of the same name, which was based on the already-prevalent Sweeney Todd legend from the nineteenth century. Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a happy family man who is falsely arrested and deported to a penal colony in Australia after the lustful Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) covets his beautiful wife (Laura Michelle Kelly). After an arduous fifteen years, Barker  now named Sweeney Todd  escapes from imprisonment and returns to the dark, sinister streets of London, where he learns that his wife committed suicide and that the malevolent Turpin has claimed their daughter (Jayne Wisener) as his own. As he strikes up a peculiar romantic relationship with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of a meat pie store in the shop below him, Sweeney begins to plot a gloriously bloody vengeance.<br/><br/>The vast proportion of A-list actors, however Oscar-worthy their talents might be, fail miserably when asked to sing a single line, and so it comes as a surprise that the entire cast of 'Sweeney Todd' does an outstanding job. More than three-quarters of the screenplay is sung rather than spoken, and Depp and Bonham Carter, in particular, reveal themselves to have considerable musical talent {the singing voices you hear are all those of the actors you can see on screen}. Johnny Depp, with a prominent white streak through his stylish black hair, is superbly brooding as the titular character, and his uncontrolled rage during the sequences of bloody throat-slitting is both invigorating and rather terrifying. Also delivering excellent performances are the menacing Alan Rickman, a dangerous and unforgiving representation of corrupt power, the indispensable Timothy Spall, singularly grotesque and unforgettable, and Sacha Baron Cohen, a hilariously supercilious ""Italian"" barber of some repute. Of the younger actors, Ed Sanders is the most impressive by far, threatening the steal the limelight on more than a few occasions.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's primary trademark as a director is his incredible visual style. 'Sweeney Todd,' set in the dimly-lit streets of a crumbling and uninviting London, successfully evokes the style of David Lean's 'Oliver Twist (1948),' and other Charles Dickens cinematic adaptations. Sweeney's bloodshed is completely uninhibited, and, in a similarly-stylised move to Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill (2003-2004),' graphic spurts of intensely-red blood from the jugular vein are a common occurrence. The violence is extremely cartoonish rather than realistic, and Burton was adamant that such explicit acts of brutality must be included in the film's final product: ""Everything is so internal with Sweeney that {the blood} is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing."" The film's all-important soundtrack was sampled from Stephen Sondheim's stage version of the story {one of the few occasions in which Burton didn't employ the services of Danny Elfman}, and it is suitably thrilling and epic. As 'Sweeney Todd' arrived at its devastating tragic conclusion and the credits began to roll, my two friends alongside me  both possessing a staunch aversion towards musicals  announced their greatest enthusiasm for the film. If there's any loftier praise than that, then I really can't think what it is."

It's a fantastic musical/movie and it's a lust to hear and see. Mrs Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, is a great actress and singer who truly embodies Mrs. Lovett. Her struggle with her feelings for Mr. Todd are so greatly put together by her skills that you feel awkward all the time- and that's a good thing! It seems Depp and Burton, when working together, really can do no harm. However, it must be said that if you're not into musicals, this movie is probably not your thing. It's got little lines but a lot of songs, and great ones if I may say so.

But this is exactly what it pronounces, one doesn't hold a set of cut throat razors just to show off ones collection of silverware, here we see them used to full extravagance and malicious brutality, this musical, this movie, of the avenging demon is up close and very personal. There are no misconceptions: it's very sharp and it's unforgiving in the dealings of this grotesque and focused plan of action. Nothing is missed. Nothing is hidden. Nothing in what is seems when you enter the Barber of Fleet Street's establishment. You've been warned.<br/><br/>The narrative of song is superb, set with Tim Burton's trademark of the surreal and the dark and mysterious. We see a London in its down trodden glory of this Victorian age that once consisted of Jack the Ripper, Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species and the possibility of one Sweeny Todd; Man, myth or legend, whatever be the truth, it is in this film that we see, and hear, some great compositions. The storyline is given its sinister overtone with titles as ""No Place Like London"", ""The Worst Pies In London"", ""My Friends"", ""A Little Priest"" and ""Not While I'm Around"" to whet our palate and when the music stops let the turmoil of madness ring their Bow bells proper.<br/><br/>Not done to the extremes of the 1968 Oliver! where we see the streets burst into song and dance, this is a rendition of two very twisted souls and their dialogue that is sung, and spoken, to propel the dark forces of the malice content. Charming but at the same time very disturbing to hear words sung in the lines of ""My Friends"", those silver plated friends, and the work they shall do when slicing the necks of those most deserving, or as the case of ""A Little Priest"" undeserving. Often is the case with actor-turned-singer Mr. Depp does his best and with the right atmospehre and proper training pulls it off with his own blend of style and charisma. It could be worse; at least he wasn't painting his wagon whilst being born under a ""Wand'rin' Star"". Ouch!<br/><br/>With a cast such as Timothy Spall OBE (Officer of the Order of British Empire), strangely again playing a Cads heavy-man, and Alan Rickman and the simply delightful Helena Bonham Carter all playing their parts, and singing them too, with individual merit and prowess. This is a film that takes on the norm and has done itself proud to have turned a Stage Play into a highly recognisable art form such as the Movie Musical, daring and challenging to the same-old-same-old's out there, then again, if it wasn't it wouldn't be a Tim Burton movie, would it? You know what to expect, if you don't, then who knows, it may have been a very close shave"
"fariceislands","9","0","0","5 February 2008"," Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
","Long before Sondheim's musical premiered in 1979, the original stage version of this tale by George Dibdin Pitt (adapted from the 1846 penny-dreadful horror novel 'A String of Pearls' by Thomas Prest) opened at the Hoxton Theatre, London on March 1 1847. From the excellent opening titles, I knew this film was going to follow in the blood-soaked footsteps of it's Victorian predecessor. Tim Burton's dark, tragicomic imagination seems to gel so well with the theme, that he was the natural choice to meld Victorian melodrama and a classic of 20th century musical theatre. A grim and desperate Victorian London was fully realised from the outset - reflected and led by music and razor-sharp lyrics of Sondheim's now rightly famous musical play. I call this a musical play, because that is just what it is, the characters do not burst anachronistically into song at odd moments as in other mere musicals, here the genius of Sondheim is such that the characters engage in fully rounded exchanges - they just happen to be singing.<br/><br/>Action, music and song mesh seamlessly, always full of interest wit and revelation. From Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin to Sasha Baron Cohen's wonderful Perelli, the casting is excellent. Bonham-Carter proves that she fully deserved to be cast as Mrs Lovett, as she takes on the part created by Angela Landsbury and makes it fully her own - becoming by turns comic, sardonic, bittersweet and thoroughly nasty while never missing a note along the way.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, sounding like a cross between Antony Newley and David Bowie, clearly relished the challenge to show another facet of his talents, and as ever, succeeded spectacularly. He is an actor who always manages to find the innate humanity in the odd characters he tends to play. Here he shows Sweeney's decent from happy man to crazed avenger with the kind of heart rending subtly, which only serves to make his further trials at the hands of Fate even more tragic.<br/><br/>The only reason I am giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10, is that for me, I believe Burton missed a trick. Yes, Sweeney Todd is the Demon Barber, and yes the prosthetics were excellent, and okay, Burton said he did not want to back away from the gore, but when all is said and done, the graphic murder of minor characters was overdone. For me, if their violent deaths had been implied rather than shown, the ending would have been much more powerful and affecting. By the time of the climatic scene arrived, although redolent with Victorian morality and melodrama, I am afraid my senses were rather too soaked in 'Kensington Gore' (stage blood) to be as shocked and moved as I supposed Tim Burton intended. Thus a twinge of disappointment erupted in me as the credits rolled, as I realised it was the only bum note in an otherwise pitch-perfect movie experience. Such a shame - mind you, it won't stop me looking forward to the DVD....."

At this point you may be thinking ""so what?"" And I will return to this in a moment.<br/><br/>As a child brought up on musical theatre, I have fond memories of sitting with my father watching on video, a 1980's Broadway production of Sondheims Sweeney Todd and believe me, as awe inspiring as it may have been, it cannot hold a candle to Burtons retelling of of this gruesome, bloody and moving tale.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure that Depp would be up to the job, and indeed it did take me a few moments to overcome Jonny's Van Dyke/ David Bowie accent that gave new life to mister Todd, but I am a big fan of Mr.Depp and in no time at all I was engrossed in his performance.<br/><br/>Quality flows through this whole feature with an outstanding supporting cast, a wonderful score and an eyepoppingly lush and Gothic portrayal of Old London Town. I have heard those complaining about the quality of the singing, but I certainly didn't have an issue with it. As Sondhiem himself states, he writes for actors rather than singers. In short I loved this film...apart from one thing.<br/><br/>There is a reason that I have only given this masterpiece 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>If you don't know the show, the following will mean nothing to you, and if you do know the show, I still urge to to go and see it. It really is superb...but...<br/><br/>The lines at the top of this review are taken from the title song in Sondheims Sweeney Todd but for some bazaar reason, this, the most well known song from the show has all but vanished from from Burtons rendition and as a fan of the original, that drives me mental. I do not understand how or why, anyone in their right mind would do that. In fact Mr Burton, if you do read this, by all means feel free to enlighten me.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a bit like remaking Singing in the Rain without having the song of the same name in it. It would still work as a movie but you would have a whole lot of rather narked off people demanding their money back, and that is why I have given this movie an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Very, very odd.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening.<br/><br/>""What, happened then, well thats the play, and he wouldn't want us to give it away...Not Sweeney, not Sweeney Todd.

The missing ingredient in this film is Danny Elfman. Instead of one of his wonderful scores we have to put up with frankly awful Stephen Sondheim music, not helped by dreadful sound mixing, with the music too loud compared to the vocals.<br/><br/>This was the first film in a long time where I seriously considered leaving the cinema before the end of the film."

Not even the script was good,because Todd wasn't a psycho, and any killer kills with a reason or for revenge.<br/><br/>The end was the only thing that could save the movie but it was not surprising, not emotionally. Also it was very disgusting the thing with the pies.

","As a usual fan of Burton, I felt that this movie was his absolute worst. The singing, in my opinion, was terrible and the movie was way too gory. I was expecting it to be a movie full of blood (since Sweeney Todd was one of the first Serial Killer), but Burton went WAY overboard with it. It was good that Burton tried his hand at a musical, but he overshadowed it with his usual creepiness and giving his friends (Carter, Depp, etc) roles that were way over their heads. Carter actually impressed me, but Depp was terrible. He really can't sing. If you want to see a movie where you see more blood than a majority of horror movies and disturbing scenes in which you cringe, then see this movie. If you want to see theater, then go see another movie or a play."

The cast sings fairly well, despite the fact that the songs, like most of Sondheim's material, are simply terrible.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are no songs in the film that are as bad as ""Officer Krupke"" from West Side Story, which remains the Worst Song Ever Written.<br/><br/>Pretty much a waste of time."

"misha_kerogazov","1","3","8","4 June 2013"," Waste of talent (and my time)
","I knew that this movie was based on a stage play /musical and that it's sort of a horror movie before watching it, but even not being a fan of either, presence of Johnny Depp and direction of Tim Burton promised to make it a fun black humour comedy or may be not a comedy but still something quite entertaining. And it started this way and was still promising until about half way through the movie. Everything was making some sense, but then it was just like somebody completely shut off Tim Burton's imagination (and common sense) and everything went complete bonkers <br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT ***  I'm not sure about a stage play or a musical it's based on, but in the movie, Todd Sweeney (Johnny Depp) is a wronged man looking for revenge on the people who sent him in exile for the crime he didn't do and stole from him his beautiful wife and little daughter (very much similar to Count Monte Cristo as it seemed to me). But then it turns so much different. After our anti-hero fails to cut the throat of his arch-enemy, he and his friend in crime (Mrs Lovett) decide to kill just all people they can lure in his barber shop and then make meat pies from them. Why?? At this moment I was a bit stunned as I couldn't see a connection between looking for revenge and then settling for just killing anyone who needs a shave. It didn't make sense to me. Historically, Todd Sweeney was more of a serial killer than any kind of a hero, but if they gave us a story explaining his motives and showing that he was after all not a bad guy, then why they decided to make him so bad afterwords? Eventually, after killing tons of innocent people, he kills all his enemies as well, and his wife (who wasn't dead), and Mrs Lovett (who didn't tell him about his wife not being dead), and almost kills his daughter as well, but gets destructed and killed himself instead.<br/><br/>Verdict: Do not waste your time as it's probably the worst of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's collaboration."

","Before I go on, let me tell you that I love Tim Burton's movies. All of them. I just adore the man's visual style and humor. So it was a sure thing for me to see Sweeney Todd as soon as I could.<br/><br/>And MAN, was I disappointed! OK, I am not so much into musicals at all, and did not like Moulin Rouge or Chicago at all. But it's a Tim Burton Musical, so it HAS to be good, right ??<br/><br/>I am sad to say, that I was bored from the first until the last minute. I mean I get it, Bonham-Carter is Burton's Girl and Depp is his best buddy. But while I could live with Bonham-Carter (even though she's one too many times with white face and weird hair), Depp was totally miscast this time. The guy just can't sing and it felt as if he would not be all too happy with the role himself.<br/><br/>Same goes for Alan Rickman, one of my All-time favorite actors! Good man, but NOT for this role and please don't let him ""sing"" again either.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen though. He looked a bit like Borat in a grotesque disguise, but he was the only highlight for me. Can't sing either, but at least was funny.<br/><br/>If you generally enjoy Musicals on screen and like Burton's movies, you also might like this one. If you are like me, I suggest to see Sleepy Hollow again instead."
"cdelacroix1","6","3","8","25 December 2007"," Disappointing Musical
","I saw this movie today and had a generally mixed reaction. It's basically ""OK"" but the storyline doesn't really to me provide enough interest to sustain a full length motion picture. Also, although any new musical production is to me a cause for celebration, this one just doesn't come near to matching other modern musicals in quality or appeal.<br/><br/>Music and songs naturally make for a big part of the appeal of any musical like this. And I am simply delighted that the movie musical has gained something of a revival within the past half decade or so. However, with some exceptions, I just didn't really enjoy the music and songs  not nearly as much, anyway, as in other modern musicals, like Moulin Rouge, Phantom of the Opera, Chicago and Rent.<br/><br/>Casting and acting seem to me to be very solid throughout this movie, with two exceptions. One is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett. Carter was perfectly cast and I thought gave a wonderful, exceptionally strong performance. On the other hand, I really thought Jamie Campbell Bower was either unconvincingly cast as Anthony, or was given a scripting for Anthony that was unconvincing. Johanna after all finds her heart captured by an Anthony who is supposed to be a handsome, romantic man she sees from a window  and whose chief distinguishing features appear to be androgyny. I can believe in love-at-first-sight for a ""manly"" man; or in love-at-first-sight for a male lead known as a ""heart-throb""; or in love-at-second-sight for a ""metrosexual"" man whose character or personality, captures the heart of a lovely lady. But Johanna has only brief glimpses of Anthony in the street. She has no ""manly looks"" to go on; she has no special ""Errol Flynn"" appeals to go on; she has never met him, so can't fall in love based on his ""personality"". All in all, the response of Johanna to this Anthony is just not convincing in a musical like this.<br/><br/>The script contained other problems that to me undermined the storyline by giving us events that didn't seem consistent or credible. The movie is not in a ""realist"" genre, so I'm not at all interested in every little detail being somehow ""credible"". However, even in a musical, I need at least enough a to help me to a ""suspension of disbelief""; and at minimum, obviously inconsistent details don't need to be flaunted in my face. Alas, the script did exactly that every now and then. For example, early on, a charlatan is selling a ""miraculous elixir"" said to promote a lush head of hair. Sweeney challenges him to a contest in which he and the charlatan are both to give the fastest, cleanest shave. Up till that point, there's no slightest indication that the peddler is also a barber. And there's not the least excuse offered for a face-off in which facility in shaving is supposed to establish credibility, or lack thereof, for an elixir promoting fast hair growth elixir. Similarly, there's a point at which Sweeney's daughter tosses a key out a window to a stranger she's never met. Things like that leave me scratching my head, and it's hard to ""buy into"" a story I'm constantly scratching my heard over.<br/><br/>I did like some things: the sheer darkness of the conception, and of the settings, and of the humor  these things I really enjoyed. The ""life at the beach"" sequence was a funny and light-hearted sequence that provided a welcome parody of Sweeney's perpetual gravity.<br/><br/>All in all, although Sweeney Todd is to me ""OK"", on the whole it just doesn't make for a good musical."

","In all honesty, I've never been a huge fan of Tim Burton's work; so, maybe I'm not the best person to be reviewing this film? Either way, I do enjoy some of Burton's films. I've always thought Big Fish was colorful, Sleepy Hollow captured a great atmosphere, and the first two Batman flicks he made were great; but, I feel his other films slip into that, ""How awkward can I make this one?"" mentality. Sweeney Todd falls into that latter category of awkward, and stressed films. I saw it tonight (opening night), and I left with a headache. Too many actors who couldn't sing, and who were singing in ridiculously high pitches. The songs and music seemed to be forced into the film, rather than being used to propel and display the story as they do in most musicals. It was as if all of the actors decided to randomly make up tunes to sing their lines to. Lastly, I felt like the movie could have ended an hour sooner than it did; and, I don't mean that as an attack at the film. The story seemed shallow, and it seemed like the final outcome could have been reached an hour earlier than it was. All in all, Sweeney Todd seems like an attempt to please Burton's fans with a lot of macabre eye candy, rather than suitable context. Wait until it goes on DVD, unless you're really excited to see Johnny Depp not dressed as a pirate."

","I believe i may be a rarity, someone who didn't like Sweeny Todd, but the movie is in all, bad.<br/><br/>(NO SPOILERS YET) 1. Most of the actors are awful singers. This coupled with the music being very boring and uninteresting lead to large chunks of the movie being impossible to enjoy. (just a note, listen to Elton John, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, all British singers whose accents disappear when they sing, it just happens, but Depp and Carter force out bad cockney singing. The bad music got old really fast. I am not biased, I really liked Chicago, Cradle Will Rock and other musicals, but the music is bad and the singers worse.<br/><br/>2. The story is really, really dull. Leave it to Stephen Sondheim to make a mass murderer boring. Not to mention the daughter falling in love with the young man despite only seeing him that one time and not even talking to him. She wants to spend the rest of her life with some man she just met.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) 3. The Judge became more sympathetic than Todd. Its impossible for a person to sympathize with a man who murders innocent people for his own gain. But its easier to sympathize with a man who tried to redeem himself for driving Mrs. Todd insane by caring for, educating and protecting her Daughter, only to have his heart broken. Watching Todd kill the Judge just seemed wrong. Todd became a murderer of innocent people, its like siding with Gacy or Dahmer. If they had made a movie following the descent of a man into madness for his lost love or becoming obsessed with something (in his case revenge), it may have been a good movie. But Sweeny Todd does not explore any of that, the changes are cartoonishly simple and they clear out all psychology or character development to make way for that horrid music.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS END HERE) Redeeming Qualities: Every Scene with Sacha Baron Cohen and to a lesser extent the kid.<br/><br/>In all, the movie was boring. Even the gore (which looked foolishly like red paint) was not enough to make the movie entertaining. The characters were empty, the story was lame and predictable, and that singing, oh god that singing.<br/><br/>Also on a final note, I see a lot of mention of ""Darkly funny"" or ""Comic"". I laughed once maybe twice. The movie wasn't funny... at all."

It's the same problem I had with Burton's previous films, there's too much focus on art direction and not enough on the characters. Johnny Depp is a great actor, but he's useless in this and boring. He's not amusing and eccentric like he is in ""Charlie"".<br/><br/>The songs pretty much all fall flat as well.

"couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn","3","2","5","2 May 2008"," How to butcher a musical
","Let me start out by saying that I love Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman, based on each artists' body of work up until now. Despite this, I hated this film. This is the worst musical I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through in my life.<br/><br/>It would have worked well as a non-musical, but oh, the pain of listening to the actors sing... Singing is an entirely different process of expression in comparison to acting, especially if coming from certain acting methods. The lack of emotional conveyance through the actors' singing, due to their inexperience and timidness, make this a very bland and badly sung musical production. There is not enough irony, emotions, and insanity to make this enjoyable to watch. I do not believe Burton was successful in capturing the same spirit of the original production, which he intended to emulate.<br/><br/>When the musical burst onto the scene in 1979 and through the 80's, it was a revelation at the time due to its original concept. What new concept does Burton bring to the table by making a movie out of this musical? Nothing. Process is different, but the intended product is the same. There is no value added, other than the camera angles, of which Burton does not take full advantage.<br/><br/>His choices in shots and camera angles in this production actually work against him in that they accentuate the blandness of the production. I've always thought Burton's camera angles are average at best, and it shows here. Yes, he chooses some fancy shots, and yes, and he may be an innovator, but he doesn't understand drama in directing. All he appears to want to do in most of his films is put pretty pictures on the screen using technology and beautiful sets, while attempting to tell a good story. It works, sometimes, but not always.<br/><br/>One thing I did take away from watching this is that this film gave me an insight to Burton's film making, by questioning why he made this into a musical. According to him in the DVD special features, he was trying to convey his experience of watching this on Broadway into a movie. I take from this that he makes films because they are satisfying from a sensory perspective. It fits. There are no ambiguities, subtleties, layers, complexity in his films. What he wanted to say is laid out, bare, naked, to fully be understood at one level of understanding for all. A visual thinker; his goal with his films is to give us viewers an insight into his dreams, nightmares.<br/><br/>He loves working with actors with certain look/feel to them, because he is an assembler of sets, colors, actors, designs who puts together pieces to make people see his way. There aren't any difference, artistically, between a claymation figure and a Johnny Depp in a Tim Burton film. Because of this, I would liken him to an illustrator than a true artist--he wants viewers to see, but does not provide any deeper understanding and thought process. One exception to this is his film, Big Fish--which was a shocking, and brave venture beyond his comfort zone for the director. Since then, however, he has become more timid in his artistic choices, rather than grow from it.<br/><br/>As much as I am critical of his current approach to film making, I do love his original visions--there's nothing else quite like them.<br/><br/>Mr. Burton, would you quit with the remakes, and give us more originals?"

","I just finished watching Sweeney Todd with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. This is my all-time favorite Broadway show, and I had high expectations. I had seen the show on Broadway twice: once from the orchestra pit where my friend was playing in the 2nds, and once from 3rd row center.<br/><br/>Sadly, Tim Burton has really missed the target with his version. He made a fundamental mistake: with Stephen Sondheim's music, a director needs singers first and actors second. Sondheim is a powerful composer: he has a better sense of rhythm, of rhyme, and of words than any other composer out there; indeed, any musician needs to bring his ""A"" game to a Sondheim piece. I've played piano in 2 Sondheim musicals: ""Company,"" and ""A Little Night Music."" Both were some of the toughest music I've ever played. In ""Company,"" there is a song called ""Being Alive"" where the pianist is playing either 10 or 11 note chords at the song's climax, and the music is a fast moderato, and the chords are played as eighth notes. (I've always harbored the suspicion that Sondheim hates pianists.) Because of this fundamental lack, Johnny Depp - for all his acting talent - cannot bring the character to life. And therein is the single biggest shortcoming of the film: the audience is supposed to sympathize with Todd; we want him to succeed, even though that means murder. We realize that there is a no-win situation for Todd, but we care for his pain, and even though the outcome is inevitable, we agree to travel along with him to that outcome. We sympathize with the wronged man, and want to see the revenge take place. I never felt that with Depp.<br/><br/>And that's because it requires people that are completely comfortable with, and people that are completely confident of, their voices. Combine that with a tough score to begin with, and you will start to see where the limitations of Burton's new film will start to show themselves: Depp and Carter could not bring the emotion of Sondheim's score to the screen, and consequently, the movie falls flat, leaving you with little more than a horror film set to music. Nowhere will you see Todd's descent into madness as he realizes that his dream of revenge is taken away; nowhere do you see Mrs. Lovett's conniving and convincing. All you see are a brooding man and woman who seems to want him. When Todd snaps (""Epiphany"") you do not feel his pain, and during what is the show's funniest number, (A Little Priest"") Burton completely drops the ball, cutting many lines from the piece, and staging it in a very unfunny way: many of the laughs are lost amongst the singer's vocal limitations. Sad, that, because when I saw it on Broadway, the actor's had to project to the last row, yet still get the nuances in and had the audience rolling. If they could do that in a live theatre, they could certainly get that on the big screen. Burton actually misses the boat twice: once in ""A Little Priest,"" and once in ""More Hot Pies,"" which opens the second act, and is barely in this piece at all. One thing he did that I consider unforgivable is that he removed the vocal trill from the character of Johanna's piece ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird."" Hearing a soprano that's simply capable of singing one is wondrous; hearing one do it in performance is heavenly. Here it doesn't happen at all. Imagine my letdown when that part of the song passed, and no trill...<br/><br/>And that brings up another point with this particular musical- the singers are required to be strong singers. It's no wonder that the only two actors that were ever really able to bring the character of Todd to life were Len Cariou and George Hearn: both have a cavernous set of pipes, and the ability to sing the half-steps and chromaticisms this piece requires. A sad thought is that the only singer that had the vocal strength the part requires in the entire movie was the actor that played Toby- a 12 or 13 year old boy who is obviously a trained singer, and can bring that strength needed to make his big number (""Not While I'm Around"") the most worthwhile of the movie. Hell, using Sasha Baron Cohen as Pirelli the Barber is a sin: the part calls for an Irish tenor...<br/><br/>Lastly was the look of the film itself: simply desaturating the color 40 per cent or so does not a dark movie make; indeed, on Broadway, there was no desaturation at all, and they achieved a darker feel than the movie had. Additionally, there was the Broadway equivalent of a Greek Chorus in the play- They sang the Prologue and Epilogue. Sadly, they are not in the movie at all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have been awaiting this movie for many years. I had hoped that a quirky director like Burton might be able to bring the pathos, the empathy, and the underlying despair of the show to the screen. Alas, this did not happen. Perhaps that is the limitations of a director trying to direct his first musical. Fortunately, I still have the VHS tape of George Hearn and Angela Lansbury doing this show live in Los Angeles. That means I will still get to see it the way it should be done. If you can find a copy of that performance, see that first: you will at least then know how the show is supposed to play."

","A story involving revenge, 19th Century London (wonderfully reconstructed by Italian production designer Dante Ferretti), madness, cannibalism and repeated throat-cutting - is it any wonder Gothic maestro Tim Burton fell in love with Stephen Sondheim's politically incorrect musical right off the bat? In fact, who else but the visionary who gave us Batman and Sleepy Hollow could have done this gory tale justice? That said, is Sweeney Todd Burton's best film? Not quite. And it isn't his greatest collaboration with Johnny Depp either: both titles are still shared by the combined magic of Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. It does, however, rank a close second on either list: such is the visual, aural and emotional power of the tragic, violent love-story-cum-horror-movie.<br/><br/>The mood of the picture is elegantly set in the opening credits, made in typical Burton fashion: company logos (Dreamworks and Warner) set to dramatic music (no Danny Elfman, though: all the tunes heard in the movie are Sondheim's creation) and the camera following a productive process inside a building. Imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with added blood, and there's the intro, followed by Todd's (Johnny Depp) return to London after 15 years of incarceration. Not that he's very happy to be back: he calls the city ""a big black pit filled with people who are filled with sh*t"", a description that is hard to dismiss, given the bleak weather and bleaker houses. One of the latter used to contain Sweeney's barbershop, but is now the home of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who earns her living by making ""The Worst Meat Pies in London"". She recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, a successful barber who was imprisoned so that the sleazy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could freely seduce his wife and raise his daughter. Now, with the missus dead and the girl in Turpin's grasp, the grief-stricken man has only one thing on his mind: revenge, even if that means murdering innocent people along the road. From that simple idea stems a sinister plan, one that will appease Todd's lust for blood and improve his accomplice's business.<br/><br/>Given the director's previous trips in musical areas (The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride), one might expect a similar lightness of touch in Sweeney Todd. Nothing further from the truth: if there's one thing that makes Burton a genius, it's his ability to understand what works and what doesn't in a specific kind of movie. Back in 1989, he justified his take on the Dark Knight by saying: ""If you want to do it bright and light you either do Superman or Cotton Candy Man, you don't do Batman!"". His vision of the Demon Barber is backed by the same frankness: ""I had seen several stage productions where they toned down the blood, but you can't be politically correct with this: it's a story about a serial killer and they cook people in pies."". And there is no correctness in the feature: gallows humor of the blackest kind, implications of rape and child abuse, and gallons of blood - whereas Sleepy Hollow's decapitations were frequent but anemic, Sweeney Todd's succession of deaths doesn't hold back the red bodily fluid.<br/><br/>Of course, with such a subject, chances are viewers might fail to root for the twisted characters. Burton solves the problem thanks to the songs: in most musicals, they are merely a distraction from the plot; this time, they are integral to the story's human core, as they are used by the cast to convey a complex range of emotions that are hard to express with normal words. Every single actor (including Sacha Baron Cohen as an Italian barber) masters Sondheim's lyrics with unusual grace (then again, the author had the final word on the director's casting choices), and they all use the music to transcend the two-dimensional prison their characters would otherwise be locked up in. Rickman, in particular, gives Turpin an additional majestic feel besides the sheer menace he has carried around since Die Hard, while Bonham Carter proves she wasn't chosen because she is Burton's sweetheart: there's real passion and suffering beneath Mrs. Lovett's insanity, as a beautiful dream sequence (the only moment in the whole film to contain sunlight) testifies. But it is Depp who, as expected, delivers the most impressive performance, for which he won his first Golden Globe and received his third Academy Award nomination: ""barking mad"", as his partner describes him, while he sings ""My Friends"" (referred to the razors) and painfully tender in his rendition of ""Johanna"" (a song concerning Todd's daughter), he paints a layered, immensely compelling portrait of a man wronged for no reason and driven mad by loss. In addition, fans will probably love the Scissorhands joke (""At last, my arm is complete again!"").<br/><br/>Sure, some people might find the concept disgusting. Some will be turned off by the blood-letting. But by finding the humanity of the characters and using the musical numbers to tell the gory story of Sweeney Todd, Burton has made a spellbinding film that will, in due time, be considered a classic of the genre."
"diac228","5","2","5","28 January 2008"," Unlike musicals of the past, it doesn't try to lure in new fans--but definitely will satisfy all the old ones
","Tim Burton seems to prefer the dark, he was the child that wasn't afraid of the lack of lights, he embraced it. Over the span of his very successful career he excels in dark, grim tales that dances with an art style that has become a staple of his movies and eventually pop culture. He has a lot of hits (Batman, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Nightmare Before Christmas) and very few misses (Batman Returns, Corpse Bride). He turns his attention to musicals, a darkly comical one at that (who saw this coming?). Reuniting yet again with Johnny Depp and his off-screen girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter, Burton adapts the unique horror musical and puts his little spin on it. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough of a spin. While fans of the musical will be overwhelmed and absolutely delighted that the transition was extremely accurate and doesn't miss a beat, others and/or those who do not like Stephen Sondheim's murderous music aren't going to find much delight here. Tim Burton put his special touch, but doesn't expand upon it, which unlike in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Batman Returns; it prevents Sweeny Todd from being a fun movie.<br/><br/>Sweeny Todd follows the grim, angry, bitter, vengeful barber (Johnny Depp) that was banished away from his home, wife, (Laura Michelle Kelly) and child because of a jealous judge (Alan Rickman). Upon his return he changes his identity, finds a new friend (Helena Bonham Carter), and seeks the death of the man that stole a good portion of his life. There are no rainbows in this picture, in case you are wondering. Things take a nastier turn when his focus of murder begins to broaden. If there is a strong element in this movie, it's the casting. We have Oscar nominees, distinguished actors and actresses, unknown gems, and underrated talent running this show, and they range from Jack Sparrow to Borat to Hans Gruber to even Marla Singer. While their singing isn't the greatest, they possess the energy needed to run this musical. Notable performances include Johnny Depp, Carter, and of course, Rickman, who is always great as a villain.<br/><br/>The singing isn't as bad as the musical numbers though. Unlike classics like Grease, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Poppins, Sound of Music and even the modern-day gem Chicago, there isn't any song that stands out or plays in your head long after the credits start rolling. There is nobody to blame except the musical itself. As a matter of fact, the lack of entertaining content can be totally traced back to the musical itself; which offers a lot of gruesome details, scant singing, but not enough time to sit and absorb what's happening. In musicals, there should be a balance between song and dialogue and action. Sweeny Todd certainly has the endless plethora of songs, but rather lacks any fun or slick storytelling and dialogue between vocal jumps. Here Tim Butron can add in whatever he wants to enhance the play or at least make it remotely different.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Burton was a bit hesitant. To supporters of the musical, this is a blessing. Instead of notching his own vision, he instead uses his filming techniques and art styles to bring the musical to life, and it works to the highest degree. Sweeny Todd is one of the most visually impressive movies of 2007, and doesn't cut back on the gore at all. The harsh tone is perfectly set, and even when higher-contrast colors are used (in one pivotal scene), we never leave the bleak world of London created by Burton. But, with the musical being rather dull and totally predictable in the end, a little change couldn't hurt, right? Couldn't we spice up the movie with a bit more dark humor? Couldn't we get rid of some pointless musical interludes that have very little effect on the overall plot? Of all the times in which it would have been nice to see a little difference from the original source by the famed director, it happens when Burton wants to actually remain faithful. So, outside of the circle of Sweeny fans, we aren't going to find many followers.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Good musicals in film blend a lot of energy with kinetic action and decent songs. Sweeny Todd lacks the action, lacks a little energy and desire to dare, but did have enough music for sure. The exaggerating and usually-moody style of Burton was a perfect match for this musical; unfortunately the musical isn't that great to begin with. Then with Burton remaining totally, totally true, it fails to really captivate those not already familiar with the musical. The dark humor wasn't as scattered as one would hope, and it's a shame that the amazing talents of all the actors and actresses involved are overlooked by the controversial content and heavy dosage of blood spewing across the screen. It is visually stimulating, but not very rich. Will you enjoy this movie? If you enjoy the musical and an endless barrage of singing. Is it better than the classic musicals of past and present? Hardly. But who is at fault here? It is hard to point a finger, but maybe because I've set the bar higher than I should. After all, if I didn't like the musical, why would I ever expect to enjoy this? Expect blood, guts, and a glut of singing."
"portia-1","9","2","5","25 January 2008"," If they Academy does not give Depp the Oscar it will be a crying shame
","I was enthralled from the opening credits and the marvellous music. I did not know the story well and just sat back and enjoyed it. Burton has produced a masterpiece and yet the film is not nominated for any awards except best actor (and yet again Depp will be ignored?) what does this amazing actor have to do to win an Oscar. People say they don't matter, well they do when you are as talented as Johnny Depp; without doubt this is the best piece of work that he and Burton have ever done.<br/><br/>The bright colour scenes of Mrs Lubbock's dream are reminiscent of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in the way that Burton used bled colour to make it too bright in stark contrast to the Gothic, dimly lit London. The scene of the pie shop where she sings that her pies are so awful is art directed to perfection, showing the filth and vileness of her disgusting shop. You feel your stomach churning at the sight of the cockroaches as she sings and beats the pastry. The cast is superb nobody wrong for the role. How audience will receive this film is hard to say but if you like Burton's work you will adore this. I cannot wait to get it on DVD later this year to watch it again and again."
"grahamclarke","8","2","5","1 January 2008"," Very much to my surprise....
","I am one of those Sondheim devotees. ""Sweeney Todd"" is up there with my favorite Sondheim works. I've seen it a number of times on stage including some very fine productions. <br/><br/>I have never liked a single film I ever saw by Tim Burton, not one. I have always thought Johnny Depp the most overrated actor of his generation. In the light of this I was not at all pleased to find out that Tim Burton would be bringing Sweeney to the screen and with Depp in the title role. <br/><br/>I thought that I would give this movie a miss but my curiosity got the better of me. Despite my justified misgivings, the film simply works and surprisingly well at that. Burton's cinematic treatment comes closer to the core of the story than any stage production seems able to do. It does this at the expense of the music. In the theater the music dominates in all it's brilliance and beauty. In the movie with its under sung performances, the music serves its function without overshadowing the elements of story or the characters themselves. Depp (sounding much like David Bowie) and Bonham Carter, while vastly different from any Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett you've ever heard, do make it work by giving character driven performances rather than musically informed ones. Mrs. Lovett, indelibly stamped by Angela Lansbury's whackiness becomes far more real with Helen Bonham Carters more nuanced treatment which still manages to maintain a certain comic edge. <br/><br/>It might not be my ideal screen version; I still believe stronger voices are required, (Alan Rickman in particular barely makes it), but its a well made very forceful piece of cinema."
"jaredmobarak","8","2","5","28 December 2007"," May I have your attention, puh-lease!...Sweeney Todd
","Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is not your run-of-the-mill Broadway spectacle. This thing is dark, gory, and bleak to the end with little in the way of joy and hope seeping through. I had seen the staged production featuring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury a couple years back, so I was familiar with the story before sitting down to experience Tim Burton's vision. I guess by knowing Sondheim's other musical Into the Woods, he is accustomed to darker, off-kilter works, however, this one is way out there. A story that involves a falsely imprisoned barber returning to London in order to seek revenge on the judge that put him there, and subsequently stole his wife and daughter, by slitting throats and hiding the bodies in the city's best meat pies is not winning any feel-good awards. More a cult phenomenon than a huge Broadway success, I think it may find a new audience in theatres, if for nothing else but the inclusion of Johnny Depp. He alone will draw some viewers in, especially those that the trailer fooled into thinking it isn't wall-to-wall singing. Oh, and so I don't mislead you, when I say musical and non-stop singing, don't think you'll be toe-tapping on the way home. These songs won't be sticking in your head.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, Burton has knocked this one out of the park. The muted grays really help the bright red blood pop off the screen as well as make the ""fantasy"" dream sequence even funnier than it is by itself, allowing it to have such vibrant colors. This is London at its dingiest, grime-filled in every shot. Cinematically, all the framing is unique and never boring, especially in scenes where our two leads share a duet and we see them in fore and background, even through reflections on the straightedge razor. As for the bloodbesides the hokey, watered-down red streams coming from bare necksit is handled well. It's more realistic once the initial spurts are concludedturning into thick ooze on the floorbut I guess the fakeness helps add a little necessary humor to the otherwise depressing tale.<br/><br/>This film is by all accounts a Tim Burton enterprise. From the look and feel to the casting of his wife and Depp, this is a much-anticipated return to his earlier films for me. After his recent string of horrible remakes in Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I was almost ready to write him off. If not for the wonderful Big Fish in the middle of those, I might have been really apprehensive in going to see this, especially since it is pretty much a remake itself. Thankfully, besides it dragging a bit in the middle, (the play does too, though, so I don't fault Burton), and the storyline with Anthony and Joanna being so thin and almost thrown in haphazardly, the movie really surprised me with its humor and unabashed use of violence. I would have been very disappointed if he toned it down rather than amped it up as he does.<br/><br/>All the acting is surprisingly great too. Depp is fantastic and subtle in his portrayal of Benjamin Barker turned Sweeney Todd, hiding the pent-up aggression as best he can before finally needing at outlet of murder. He could have gone over-the-top with it, as he unfortunately did in Charlie, but instead reined it in and probably came off funnier as a result, specifically with the facial expressions in the fantasy scene and throughout. While I don't think he could have done the play on stage, I still think vocally he did a superb job. The rasp and the deep baritone fit perfectly and his depressed state adds to the tragic end soon to come. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and Timothy Spall are all good in their roles, nothing special, but totally fitting the aestheticif anything Carter and Spall may be a bit too creepy. The real supporting standouts, though, are young Ed Sanders as Toby and the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Petrelli, a rival barber. Cohen is a master of priceless voices and adds a nice layer to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is not a perfect film and definitely not one for the masses, but as far as a cult musical with gore, it does the job. If anything, I hope this means good things for Burton's cinematic future. He is at his best with dark tales like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman and should stay away from the remake machine. Always gorgeous to watch, this one has some substance to it as well. A perfect ending definitely helps make up for the missteps along the journey too."
"Safer101","6","2","5","27 December 2007"," A well-crafted though simple film
","Tim Burton provides us with another of his Gothic comedies, darker than most before and with a subtle humor that might pass you by if you're not listening carefully. Johnny Depp delivers a solid performance, though less lively than you might expect from his recent films. His role is simple, his mission clear and the life of the characters - and the movie, by extension - is in spite of Depp, rather than centered around him.<br/><br/>Though perhaps only personal taste, I found the music to be fairly conventional and the lyrics bland. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, the characters are frequently singing about things that you've probably already worked out yourself, leading to a double-dipping of plot elements as you see an event happen only to be reminded again by the next musical number. It doesn't help anything that a few of the songs themselves are repeated in the film.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, the characters morally extreme, and the events often coincidence-driven. If you're able to look past these elements, you'll find a dark and beautiful experience that will pull you into its black humor and bleak setting. That said, it stays well within the box Tim Burton has created for himself and probably won't win over many new fans."

","My wife and I saw this 12/21/2007 with a full audience. This movie involves highly-rated actors singing instead of highly-rate singers acting. As such, singing is fair-to-good, but the acting and drama is first rate. Dreamworks/Warner Bros. could not have picked a better director than Tim Burton, a quirky leader for a quirky musical.<br/><br/>The costumes and sets truly take you back to London as it was in 1785. My hats off to the art and set crew.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is wonderful as the obsessed barber of Fleet Street bent on revenge. Helena Bonham Carter is crazy good as the pining-for-Todd Mrs. Lovett. Indeed, I was strongly reminded of this choice of actors as a kind of Pirates of the Caribbean meets Harry Potter, with their heavy use of eye shadow, and the use of Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin (Snape for H.P. fans) and Timothy Spall as Beadle (Wormtail for H.P. fans). Truly, an Oscar-winning team if I ever saw one.<br/><br/>However, this film, true to the nature of the musical, is dark and bloody. Tim Burton takes Stephen Sondheim's musical and up's the gore to the Nth degree. This is not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>I hope that when the DVD of this film is released, the production will have the good sense to offer a ""sanitized"" play track on the disc so that my family doesn't have to see the blood over and over again."

","This was a great movie, from start to finish. Every character was fit to play their role even Timothy Spall (Wormtail from Harry Potter series) fit his role well, except for his musical parts which truly were outrageous. Johnny Depp, however, sang beautifully, it was unbelievable, he really made you immerse yourself into his character, and sometimes even feel bad for him. Tim Burton also prospered with this movie. The dark, and melodramatic mood is rightfully Tim Burton's strong points, and trust me, this movie contains a lot of darkness. Though humorous, I believe that the true genre of this film is drama. Many battles for love and vengeance take place, which are humorous, but dramatic all the while. The main fault with this movie was it was overly gory. So gory, that the audience could tell it was fake, which is good in a sense, yet still quite stomach quenching. Other than that, the movie was perfectly adapted from the revered musical. The storyline captivates, the characters move you to tears, the twists and turns thrust you left to right, and the music was tremendous. I highly suggest that you watch this movie.

The cast is pretty alright for a musical. Most doubt Depp but he does come in strong. He sure acts beyond his limit and he CAN sing! Can he sing good? YES! Carter has proved herself in both departments so she is very well fit. Rickman has done the same and Cohen shows of his amazing singing talents. The script by Logan is very well done with most of SS's music still intact. Although there is a fair share of song cuts, the soundtrack is very solid. Burton does bring justice to this film. Not that it needed it but he adds the covering to it which turns Todd into a greatly acted and visually grand film. The blood is also done right, it is never over used and stops when it should.

Some of the best play moments are in here including Sacha Barren Cohens turn as Perrelli the french barbists who hides a secret until he learns that a shave can be a little to close for comfort.<br/><br/>Kudos to Johnny Depp and Helen Boham Carter for portraying such devilish characters, and praise Alan Rickman and Timonthy Sprall who give a new word to evilness.

Did the kid sing his own part? Were any voices filled over? I want to know how anyone can complain about the singing in this movie. I have read that the take on the move is darker, less humor, than the original 1982 DVD (that I have) The only difference I saw between the original and the movie was two fewer deaths and the over all theme ""Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd..."" was cut, other than that the movie does qualify as operetta, that of 40% to 70% lyric of the movie sung, the program dependent on the words in the sung portions. It was a very dark comedy. It had the complete overall text and innuendos the play had, it just didn't have the audience laughing or the applause pauses and bows.<br/><br/>Very well done, I hope that Mr. Depp sings again in other movies. I also liked Mr Bower's, Miss Wisener's, Mr Sanders', Mr Spall's and Mr Rickman's singing, maybe Alan will sing in one of the Harry Potter movies before they end."

This movie has an amazing cast list, all of which come through. The best Burton/Depp movie ever made! <br/><br/>Update: I got the soundtrack for Christmas, I can't stop Listening to it! Epiphany has to be the best song in it. The emotion Depp puts into it is fantastic. His voice throughout the movie was amazing, though perhaps a tad too high.

","With a terrible libretto (if you could even call it that), thin uncaring characters, and pedantically predictable art-direction I'm amazed ANYONE could give this celluloid heap any more than a 4.<br/><br/>Though I never saw the original, it seems to me that the best assets of the intent of the story :: dark HUMOR :: were woefully snipped out... Leaving an over-produced, cheesy looking and sounding husk of an idea endlessly wailing for one's attentions.<br/><br/>Just because something is a musical does not mean that nearly every line must be sung. It shouldn't, and this one really shouldn't have. The golden-age of musicals is long dead, and this film put a definitively large and craggy bunch of nails into an aged coffin. I'd challenge anyone to find ONE memorable melody in this paint by numbers production.<br/><br/>I strongly feel that Tim Burton is best when he tries not to be too serious; and though Sondheim may have fans as a semi-witty lyricist (that's what he really is folks - a lyricist); let's be honest here: he's a TERRIBLE composer.<br/><br/>Save your time, your money - and even more-so - your ears."

","Guys, guys, guys. I'll be the first to admit I'm not an avid follower of the film industry and new very little about this movie before I saw it. In fact, I had no idea this was 100% a musical. I don't recall seeing any trailers and didn't read IMDb reviews before going. It was my wife's turn to pick a movie and this was the one. It was two of the most painful two hours of my life. The movie starts, the singing begins, and it never stops. I swear, at least 90% of the dialog is in song.<br/><br/>I'll also admit, I'm not a huge fan of Burton or Depp but I do like good guy movies. They've both done good movies, they've both done bad movies (this one included). I liked the ""old school"" Depp much better - Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Donnie Brasco, etc. I liked Pirates but didn't like Depp's character. Seems like the same old repetitive character (POTC, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc). The people who have seen and written reviews on this movie are obviously the brain washed Depp/Burton cool aid drinking fanatics. They would give 10 stars to a Depp/Burton Old Navy commercial.<br/><br/>So, the movie - an annoying combination of Edward Scissorhands meets Moulin Rouge. Although, Moulin Rouge sucked much less - at least it was in color.<br/><br/>Anyway, do your duty and see it if it gets you some points towards a kitchen pass but be forewarned what your getting into!!! 3 of 10 stars"

","I just saw Sweeney Todd, and seeing the message board, I realize that I could argue for hours about this movie. Most people seem to have loved it. I however, disagree. Though it was enjoyable, I don't think, for me, there's a version of Sweeney that couldn't be. I first saw the show at 11, and I fell in love. It is by far my favorite musical. Learning that Johnny Depp was the titular character wasn't even that disheartening. Today, I was very excited. I entered the theater with high expectations. I feel slightly cheated. I'll start from the beginning. The singing is superb. I especially love Johanna and Toby's voices. There were a few flaws (WHY OH WHY CAN'T JOHNNY SING DOWN THE OCTAVE?!?! AND WHY CAN'T HELENA USE HER CHEST VOICE?), I felt, all things considered, the voices were great. Next - casting. I felt that Johnny, though a given in almost any Burton film, just wasn't right. His pensive, pouty face was employed the vast majority of the movie, and someone needs to tell him that lowering your voice to a whisper and then randomly inserting ""Trekkie Monster""-esquire grunts does NOT equal instant drama. Next, Helena. Also a given, but i felt like she stole the show. She really, really was terrific. Antony, on the other hand, just was not built for the part. Wiry and bug-eyed, he did not fit the picture of a young sailor infatuate with love. Rickman, who I was looking forward to, proved to be frail and unconvincing (possibly brought on be the cut of ""Johanna""). The beadle was just right (though his singing could have been improved). Toby and Johanna, as previously stated, were terrific. And Sacha, fittingly dressed up like Princess Leia with a codpiece, was perfect. Burton, I felt, was not the right director. I simply hated the stylism. The blood looked like paint, not effective, more laughable. Many directorial choices were rather ridiculous. The fast motion pans of London early in the film looked exactly like an interactive DVD menu. Besides those main points, the set and costumes, makeup and hair added to the feel. Though it seems like I don't offer very much criticism, the amount I did give was important. Directing and main characters need to be perfect for me to enjoy a film. And though Sweeney, one of the hardest characters to master, can often be accepted as the way Depp portrayed him, I was expecting more. The black humor seemed a bit more fan service then actually clever. My final word: though impressed, I was disappointed that it turned into a Burton/Depp movie instead of what it was meant to be, a Sweeney movie."

"refresh_daemon","7","3","11","22 December 2007"," A gorgeous and cold monster's story
","Before I start writing about this film, I have to admit that I have a bias against musicals. Granted, this doesn't include all musicals and there are plenty that has slipped past my bias. I suppose the musicals that I have the greatest issues with are the ones that hold most dearly to the comedy offshoot tradition, including a number of classics.<br/><br/>That said, I have no problem with Sweeney Todd as a musical. The musical element isn't actually very compelling as I don't remember a single song from the show. What I do remember is the story and the visuals. First of all, this is clearly an excellent piece for Tim Burton to helm as his odd dark way of seeing things melts very well with the wicked version of London present in Sweeney Todd. From the very opening of the film, you know that you're in for a grisly tale.<br/><br/>Burton doesn't pull any punches and almost matter-of-factly treats the series of murders that occur with gross detail. Not a pleasant sight, but certainly in line with the spirit o the work. If you've seen previous Burton works, you'll immediately recognize the almost-Gothic tone that all of his works contain. In terms of production, the film is spectacularly lensed, marvelous in its grotesqueness. The acting and casting are right on the spot.<br/><br/>The story is rather simple, a man, falsely accused and sent away for a decade and a half by a lecherous judge returns and exacts his revenge. He was a barber before and now he's a barber again, but he does a little more bloodletting than he used to in the past. He's aided by a woman who sells the worst meat pies in London. And there's a side story about Todd's daughter and a sailor who loves her (and also happened to have rescued Todd at sea).<br/><br/>Broken down, this is a tale that focuses on how obsession with revenge leads to tragic consequences as well as a narrow field of vision where mistakes can be make. On top of the emptiness of the act. In some ways, it's similar to Park Chan-Wook's revenge trilogy, being visually stunning and focused on the problems of revenge.<br/><br/>I suppose, I have to admit, the mystery elements are telegraphed a little too early (if you want enough mysteries and revenge films), but I suppose it would remain well obfuscated for those less experienced with such genres. Although, I'm aware that the blood and guts are part of the story, I was very discomforted by the quantity of up-close dissections witnessed, but this is appropriate to its new medium.<br/><br/>One quibble that I had with the film was in no way its fault. For parts of the show, I kept having flashbacks to Kevin Smith's less than spectacular Jersey Girl, as the musical also appears in that film. And trust me, you don't want Jersey Girl in your head when you're watching another film. The other quibble that is a little more serious for me, is that it was very difficult for me to sympathize with Benjamin Barker. The only points where we see him as human is the little wistful moment at the beginning of the film that sets up his revenge and then at the end of the film when he realizes the cost of his obsession. Unfortunately, with so little humanizing, I could only see him as a monster and found myself unable to root for him. And since I couldn't sympathize with the central character, I found myself rather detached from the work and thus more aware of how the film was made. The spell failed to cast on me.<br/><br/>Ultimately, that weakness really threw the experience for me. As such, it's an extremely potent vision realized with all the powers of artistry, but for me, even a human monster's tale needs to connect with the human part of us. Failing this for me leaves Sweeney Todd a gorgeous but distant work. One that I admire but cannot love. It's good though and you might likely enjoy it more than me, if you can take all the blood, guts, revenge and violence. 7/10."
"jwardww","1","2","6","12 May 2013"," Sondheim's usual knish: overrated, leaden and tasteless
","No, despite Sondheim's ambition, this offering of empty calories will never make it to a gourmet menu. A humble barber loses his pretty partner and daughter. He seeks revenge on the world with a low-life malheureuse. The serial killing and cannibalism that follow seem emotionally out of place. You never feel Todd's motivation is authentic. His suffering is not really on the level of Job, Spartacus, Karl Childers or even the Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, like all of Sondheim, the emotional context here is about as authentic as one of the whinier episodes of Love American Style. The music is derivative and not really good, though the creator no doubt considered it to be ground-breaking. Rejected by his mom, Sondheim went after big-time approval from critics and audiences. The Former he usually gets from the parochial Miss Daisys of the New York Times. But the theaters staging his works usually end up empty. No one considers Sondheim a legend as much as Sondheim. When Follies was revived last year on Broadway, I overheard a priceless sales pitch on the half-price tickets line. The officious hawker was trying to convince a tourist to see it with the following guarded praise: ""It's really great, well anyway it's like a museum piece...well, in any case, the performances are certainly worth seeing."" And I said ""save your money and look for a real museum piece in a museum. You're too late for the real Follies, which at least had spectacle in their favor."" Sweeney avoids the endless kvetch-fest of Follies, but not a note of it rings true. Just one example to illustrate how emotion is just wallpaper to Sondheim: how on earth does Mrs. Lovett end up singing ""Not While I'm Around""? Schizophrenia? For it is the only thing of its kind in the whole show, so you can't believe it. Bizarre. That being said, the acting here is fine, even Sacha Cohen as the macassared mountebank . Too bad the actors had such mediocre material to work with. An interesting Sondheim anecdote: I was at the Met for a brilliant performance of an opera about another ne'er-do-well. I can't besmirch the composer by stating his name in the context of this debacle. Suffice it to say, the character he created, unlike Sondheim's, is richly ambiguous, not a stereotype, with interesting motivation and ingenious music. Sondheim was in the first row and at the curtain got up and scurried out without applauding in the midst of tumultuous appluse. Jealous much? My advice: write a musical about a Broadway songsmith with towering ambition and puny talent. That's a story I'd believe and I think this time he'd get it right."

","I guess I am glad that Tim Burton is alive and making films if only to keep Depp working and encourage him to take chances. I think it is even worth a ticket from time to time to watch the old boy do something weird that isn't intended as a joke. But Burton's work as a whole seems to be in a rut. He knows how to appear to take chances without actually doing so. <br/><br/>This time, we have large singing instead of small. Operatic blood instead of human-sized. Long shots instead of simple frames.<br/><br/>I may skip the next couple. Email me to tell me if Depp gets interesting again. <br/><br/>For me, all the cinematic effects, though large, are tired and ordinary. All the songs big empty balloons. What fascinates me is the love story between Burton and one of the most interesting women in film: Helena. She's earned a place in my imagination just on ""Wings"" and ""Fight,"" possibly ""Novocaine."" She matters as a template now and probably will for generations.<br/><br/>Its why it is so interesting the way we have her now: written in, made up and photographed by a man who plainly loves her as deeply as he knows  and shares that with us because the deepest he knows is how to make her real on screen. Its not just a love story we peer into, its one we participate in. <br/><br/>Hey, I guess I've talked myself into watching the next Burton project, huh?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"moonmonday","2","2","6","16 September 2008"," Astounding Wasted Potential
","I'm not a fan of most Broadway, which I suppose means that this will be discredited in the eyes of some; I especially find Sondheim's works to be often lacking in terms of composition, but the unique stage chemistry in the cast featuring Angela Lansbury -- shared with me years ago -- appealed for its undeniable charm. The story I found a bit too grotesque, but ultimately it was portrayed decently. However, when I heard of this film adaptation, I was less than enthused.<br/><br/>I will agree that Depp possesses inordinate charisma (and the camera seems intent on featuring either his handsome face or his shapely posterior), but it is mostly wasted here when he is given essentially one thing to do: stare into the distance wearing a sour expression. Helena Bonham Carter does perhaps the best of the cast as Mrs. Lovett; I find it difficult to dislike her in anything, due to her earnest approach and organic talent. These were both well cast but not particularly well-used, and both go to waste for most of the film.<br/><br/>Sacha Cohen was actually surprisingly good, and it's more the pity he was in the film so briefly. However, most of the rest of the cast phone in their performances or are so horrifyingly bad that they make the cartoonish killings seem cheery by comparison. Jamie Bower has an voice that speaks to the ear like nails on a chalkboard, and although Depp's is not that fantastic, he has the charisma to pull it off; Bower does not. The rest of the cast is forgettable, Alan Rickman as usual acting as Alan Rickman pretending to be someone else.<br/><br/>The music is hideous, although the lyrics occasionally shine. 'A Little Priest' is the only moment of the film that even approached amusement with its hilarious statements on society, with most of the other songs incorporating not only the same motifs, but parts taken from other numbers. There is far too much mishmash, so much so that it is reminiscent of the low-budget compilations hawked on late television.<br/><br/>The direction is regrettable. It's incredibly uneven and, at times, fairly uncomfortable too. Although it's clear that Burton wished for Depp to play Sweeney as a charismatic, sensually dangerous man, I question sexually-charged scenes between Depp and Rickman. Further, I noticed that it seemed everyone interacting with Todd seemed either to regard him as if they would like to bed him or be bedded by him; I'm not entirely sure about that motivation for virtually the entire cast.<br/><br/>The visuals are impacting, but they don't always make sense. The wardrobe department presents ludicrous costume after ludicrous costume, too many hideous leather monstrosities and one or two noteworthy and beautiful outfits. And for all of the reasons why her pie shop was failing, did it ever occur to her that people might be put off by a shopkeeper with the appearance of a wraith? Apparently not. It would be one thing if everyone had the same pallor and fashion sense, but they do not.<br/><br/>The story manages to plod along, things only happen in bursts and then grind to a halt, and very little makes any sense. The subplot between Anthony and Johanna is particularly painful, as it is not only poorly-acted but also receives no resolution whatsoever, despite it having hogged inordinate amounts of screen time already. The parallels between Anthony and Turpin, however, cannot be denied; a man who sees a girl and fancies himself in love with her after glimpsing her from afar? The assumption that we'll just go along with the two being 'in love' is too much to ask, and it would be challenging even for particularly good actors to pull off.<br/><br/>The most egregious fault of the film is that it overstays its welcome and does such a poor job of infusing a potentially riveting and oddly sympathetic tale with any energy or charm whatsoever. Depp's Todd is initially very identifiable and even desirable, but his single-note portrayal quickly wears thin. By the end, one cares little for what happens to him. In fact, the only character that moved me even slightly was Carter's Lovett, driven by terribly misguided love and sweet dreams but far beyond redemption.<br/><br/>For all those who complain about the violence, it's so completely ridiculous that it doesn't even bear taking seriously. The dummies tossed down the chute are clearly dummies, as much as I felt for watching. But cheap shots aside, the violence is extremely cartoony and not nearly as grotesque as some have claimed. In some scenes it's laughably ridiculous, and not a nervous laugh but one of comical disbelief.<br/><br/>The sound is where a musical should shine, but the sound was exactly where Sweeney Todd failed the hardest. When they're not singing, they're whispering and inaudible. When they are singing, they're incomprehensible. The accompaniment is uneven, but it generally drowns them out, so much so that one requires subtitles even with perfect hearing. It is also noteworthy that Depp seems to go back and forth between Todd's intended accent and that of Jack Sparrow, which is distracting to say the least.<br/><br/>Overall this film was poorly-acted, poorly-directed, and had very few shining moments. The music was never good, but the Lansbury cast at least transcended it with their stage charisma. However, none of the cast here, aside from Carter's earnest presentation in her downplayed role, were able to do much with their parts. It's not surprising, since at heart it isn't very good. Yet it disappoints since, in the hands of a better director and a few different actors, it might have been something very special.<br/><br/>As it was, it was only dismal and disheartening, depressing and misanthropic, with the faintest hint of black comedy occasionally at the edges. Although I'm not particularly a fan of the stage production, it's head and shoulders above this film. It can't help but be."

","To my astonishment, I actually found myself enjoying this round about the 80-minute mark! This is when Burton finally allows the gore to splatter with some velocity, and when the cast starts to sing while moving around and doing things. Up till then every time someone utters a note everything freezes dead and it's a cue to get up for popcorn/the crapper. What a remarkably tedious score - Phantom of Fleet St., someone please slit my throat. I haven't seen any Burton for years, so I couldn't tell you if he's been losing his sense of humor and composition over time or if this book caused him to lurch suddenly into the blahs. The performances (all well within the actors' pre-defined range of shtick) can be quite enjoyable when they're not drowning under oceans of song, but the source material keeps Timbo on a consistently short leash, and on top of everything else the CGI sucks."
"nena_lehmus","3","2","6","18 February 2008"," Boring Jack Sparrow copy singing CONSTANTLY!
","I am so amazed over these high ratings of this movie and I just have to say that it is the most overrated film I've ever seen! I saw that almost every newspaper in Sweden gave this movie top scores and therefor I just had to see it! However, I got really disappointed. The story seemed exciting and appealing and the photography was really good, but that was probably it...<br/><br/>There are two types of musicals. There's one where they sing nice songs now and then to illustrate a critical moment in the movie and that seems fit for just that moment, and then there is the other one. The other one where they sing CONSTANTLY. No matter what they are talking about or what happens on screen. This movie is one of these musicals. Those few moments when the talked like normal people, I actually found myself saying: ""Aren't they going to sing a comment about that meaningless small bird sitting in a tree?"" for example, and of course - they started singing about that damned bird.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp sure does have a nice voice to listen to and so does Helena Bonham Carter. This does not mean I enjoy hearing them sing for 90 minutes straight! The worst part of all was that you couldn't really hear what they were singing about either because the tempo was sooooo high! Their thousand word lyrics didn't even match the melody of the music! <br/><br/>Furthermore - I would like to comment Johnny Depps acting. I know that he has been praised a lot for his acting skills. I can agree that he is extremely talented in playing a crazy pirate or some kind of other figure in delirium who has a problem in pronouncing the letter S properly... They are all the same!!! This movie to me was awfully boring since the songs all sounded the same. It was like they sung without melody? This movie could easily have been around 30 minutes long or less if they; instead of singing a three minute aria about a young boys insight about getting the woman of his dreams (which he, by the way, only had seen for like a minute sitting in a window), they could just say ""Someday she will be mine."" We get the point anyway...<br/><br/>And beware for un-countable times when Johnny is holding up his barbers knife in the air in front of him. What's up with that?! One time is enough, but I think he does it like 10 times or something - and of course - always with a mediocre song to accompany him."
"intelearts","10","2","6","25 January 2008"," A Bloody Masterpiece
","This is Tim Burton's masterpiece: it is simply one of the best film adaptations of a musical ever and there is a sense that here Burton's dark vision finally cohere into something of a whole.<br/><br/>From the onset this is marvellous: London never looked grimmer, grimier, or more gruel and gruelling. The costumes deserve an Oscar - they add significantly to the production - as does the set and lighting - a fully realised vision of a Gothic Victorian London that comes to life - there are some beautiful detailing - the vegetables in the market are grey and Gothic - and it all works to place the characters in a setting of real significance.<br/><br/>Overall, the casting is flawless: Johnny Depp is dark, menacing, brooding, damaged, and coldly insane at both the loss of his wife, his deportation to Australia, and imbues a very real sense of revenge. He is well complemented by Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovall: a woman who really does know how to fail and obsess well; and Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin is lascivious, and evil. Timothy Spall gives a career best - I thought him even better here than Boys from the black Stuff, which is saying something - he weaves an intricate beadle, who knows his status depends on obsequious violence, and Sasha Baron Cohen is simply a turn to be enjoyed - and shows his very fine skill as giving credibility to pomposity.<br/><br/>Yes, it's dark. Yes, it's violent - but that's its tone. The Sondheim score is amazing - never did natural speech sound so good as music - and one sees why this and Pacific Overatures, along with Sunday in the Park, reinvented the genre. True, Depp doesn't have the voice to really excel as a singer - but he brings an acting skill that I would trade much better singers for.<br/><br/>The first hour is simply dazzling, we felt that it could have been 15-20 minutes shorter - what works on stage drags a little - but at no point does it lose its way in anyway.<br/><br/>It is bloody, visceral, and dark - but, as we would expect from Tim Burton, it's not disgusting or repellent.<br/><br/>Overall, it is no exaggeration to say that this is a very fine film, and an exceptional musical. With Hairspray and High School Musical is it possible we're seeing a revival? Sweeney is essential viewing, and I would not be surprised if it is a dark horse come awards time - stunning visuals, stunning acting, and stunningly sharp. Might make you want to give up shaving, or wanting pies, for a while though...<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"fairwave91480","5","2","6","6 January 2008"," Left with mixed emotions
","I saw this movie last night, and thought that the lead vocal performances were mildly sufficient. Despite this, I tremendously enjoyed the closer point of view that the film affords it's audience, especially during the more graphic scenes. Depp and Bonham-Carter acted their parts beautifully. As an actor, I performed in a professional stage production of this musical, which leads me to my chief complaint. Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I really missed the ensemble singing. It was such a let down when we never actually got to hear ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" in the opening moments. Granted, with fewer voices Sondheim's intricate music and tongue-twisting lyrics are much easier for those unfamiliar with the show to understand. Just some thoughts."
"kittykate06","8","2","6","29 December 2007"," You know what Sweeney Todd doesn't have enough of? Blood!
","Yet another movie that teams Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together -- with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter who seems to tag along with the team as well. Sweeney Todd is the film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical about a wrongly convicted barber coming back to London with a vengeance.<br/><br/>First off, being a musical, I had my doubts about the casting. But I was thoroughly impressed with Depp's vocal talent and range. I was less impressed with Carter's however, but she manages. Moving past their vocal limitations, the way they convey the mood of the song and exactly what they're saying is tremendous. It shows they are true actors, not just singers.<br/><br/>My only qualm about the movie was the first half-hour. First was Depp's entrance. It was hard to get past the idea of Jack Sparrow and it sure doesn't help that he uses the same accent and his first scene is on a ship. A black, ghostly one, at that. But after a while, I hardly even noticed it. The other dragger was the non-stop songs. Within the first half-hour, there had to be maybe ten songs with at least three lines of dialogue here or there. It was quite slow. However, once it got to the contest, it picked up pace fast.<br/><br/>Burton's directing style is superb with visuals that resonate long after the movie is over. He directs the actors perfectly in achieving a Gothic Victorian style.<br/><br/>This would be a great movie and one I would want everyone to see if it weren't for all that blood. The first half-hour is tame. But it's all downhill from there. One song consists of throat after throat after throat after throat being slit. But what really grabbed me is that it was so much that the people around me started laughing! This movie is not for the faint of heart. When Tim Burton says I want blood, he gets blood.<br/><br/>Other than that, a delightful, and quite a comical movie about a tragedy. And i cannot get that stupid song out of my head -- ""it's priest, have a little priest..."" It's bloody wonderful!"

","The Great Goth (Tim Burton) has gifted us with many fine films over the years; rare have been the disappointments. Still, there has, on occasion, been unevenness. To wit: SWEENEY TODD. While the pale black palette is picture perfect, the music in this musical is something less than it might have been; all of a single note, as it were. Better all around if this had been a straightforward drama, sans songs; or, better still, had it been lighter in tone (like the bulk of Burton's work). The bloodletting- in a musical, remember- should've been counterbalanced. That it isn't accounts in no small degree for the overall unevenness. Next: POE- THE MUSICAL, with Depp as the tortured author (who may have been an unwitting carrier of TB, which could explain the untimely deaths of all those he loved)..."

I did not see the Broadway show & tried not to know too much (although I couldn't help somehow knowing something).<br/><br/>I thought Helen Bonham Carter practically stole the show.

Has anyone ever seen Rickman play Anything but an evil character? He does it well, no doubt.<br/><br/>And, of course, the ""Beadle"" guy was loathsome. In fact, I didn't know the spelling of his name, so I heard it as ""Beetle."" Yes, I agree that Ed Sanders showed great talent.<br/><br/>Also agree that ""Johanna's"" voice was a bit too soprano - hard to understand at times. Although I suppose Burten was going for the ""nightingale"" thing.<br/><br/>Yes. Good flick. :)"
"lil_gatsby-1","6","2","6","27 December 2007"," Not fun enough.
","Disclaimer: I am unfamiliar with the stage play.<br/><br/>This movie just wasn't fun enough.<br/><br/>Only a fool would expect a feel-good, delightful romp. However, for a musical billed as a black comedy, there wasn't enough consistency to the comic relief, and the film spirals downward into a very depressing ending. There is no closure at all to mitigate the emotional damage of the movie's final scene, which manages to be both disturbingly violent and anti-climactic. I left the theater in a state of minor post-traumatic stress.<br/><br/>Also, the enormous quantities of blood looked like red paint - a disappointment which drained much of the ghastliness and humor out of the gory scenes. I'd expect they could have afforded more realistic-looking blood! <br/><br/>The good points? <br/><br/>The film looks great. The score is decent. The middle of the movie was enjoyable to watch, with great squeamish giggles in the pie shop, a few funny songs, a jump or two, and one or two of the death scenes were darkly hilarious. The song ""Pretty Women"" is tense and perfectly performed. In fact, all of the performances were entertaining, with the exception of the two very dull young lovers, who aren't really important anyway. Perhaps they ought to have been, but I could have easily not bothered with them.<br/><br/>The very good: Ed Sanders is an incredible talent. Laura Michelle Kelly played an interesting role, and I would have liked more of her; I felt her part was cut down.<br/><br/>Depp and Carter have good chemistry, but I expected as much. Also, Sasha Baron Cohen plays a guy with a funny accent, and Alan Rickman plays a creepy snob. Although both are fantastic in their roles, they're cast to type.<br/><br/>I like Johnny Depp quite a lot and I have for a long time. He did sing well in this film, and he's certainly a ""good actor"" - but it's not really a challenge for him to play a drunken madman now is it? Johnny, try something different for a change!"
"Jonny_Numb","9","2","6","25 December 2007"," Bloody Wonderful!
","First, I will get the most obvious (and redundant) sentiment out of the way: ""Sweeney Todd"" IS Tim Burton's best film since ""Ed Wood""; and, had ""Ed Wood"" never been made, ""Sweeney Todd"" would be his best filmperiod, bar none, no arguments. Sure, it's based on the long-running Stephen Sondheim musical, but this film version is Burton's own distinctive animala marriage of his trademark Gothic visuals paired with richly fleshed-out characterizations. Imagine Herschell Gordon Lewis with a budget and a proclivity for song, and you've got it.<br/><br/>I have always appreciated Burton's eye for distorting typical American facades (the Gothic carnival of ""Batman""; the eerie pastel caricature of suburbia in ""Edward Scissorhands""; the literal Candyland of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"")the man knows how to put his own distinctive stamp on a picture. However, many of the scripts he's chosen to helm come up short in character development (usually more comfortable to present the ""outside world"" as a string of shopworn clichés), save always for a protagonist who is some sort of socially maladjusted outcast. The result has been films that are aesthetically pleasing (certainly wonderful to look at) yet emotionally hollow.<br/><br/>Yet in the character of Sweeney Todd (played by Johnny Depp), Burton finds his greatest outcast alter-egonot only does Depp dissolve into the role, but as the film progresses, we see Burton's own socially awkward persona fade into the characterization, as well. What could have come off as nothing more than a filmed version of a popular musical instead becomes a complex character study of the motives that drive a man to madness; Todd inhabits a world so grey and dark that the upside of things is impossible to recognize (until it's too late).<br/><br/>That being said, the setup is rather simple: in flashback, we learn that Todd was happily married to Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), only to have her and his child, Johanna (Jane Wisener), stolen away by the lecherous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Silenced and hardened by 15 years of imprisonment under a bogus charge, Todd is released and returns to London with vengeance in mind (his first song is a misanthropic screed against the city that sets the tone for the remainder of the film). He quickly comes across Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the proprietor of a roach-infested meat pie emporium; their relationship develops into a mix of business and pleasure, as Todd's victims become the main ingredient in the pies. But never does Burton give Sweeney an exit into an easy love affair with Lovettin a great montage, she fantasizes about traveling the world with the earnings from her rejuvenated business, with a stoic, frowning Sweeney en tow.<br/><br/>Now, I have never been a big fan of movie musicalsin many cases, I have gone out of my way to avoid them. Songs from the Disney school have always struck me as redundant re-iterations of things the audience already knows, serving as little more than fodder the kids can sing to death on the car ride home (did any parent leave ""The Lion King"" unscathed by choruses of ""Hakuna Matata""?), while big-budget studio productions have always struck me as overblown and pretentious. Something daringly controversial (""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"") or conceptually innovative (the Burton-produced ""Nightmare Before Christmas"") can more easily earn my favor, and ""Sweeney Todd"" is impressive not because you'll be humming the songs on the way out of the theater, but because the music blends so seamlessly with the spoken dialoga way of further developing character and plot that puts us in within a jubilantly macabre world. Burton knows this terrain well, and frequently hits notes of pitch-perfect black humor when we least expect it. And just as surprising is a subplot involving a vagabond boy who falls for Sweeney's now-teenaged Johanna; what at first seems like padding eventually becomes the innocent-love counterpoint to the demon barber's own path of vengeance, desolation, and lost hope.<br/><br/>As with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" Burton favors the streets of Britain, and makes even the aristocratic areas gleam with squalorthe whole production looks like a postmodern Hammer flick, with blood spraying in a deep-red, exaggerated manner. ""Sweeney Todd"" also retains the director's own Gothic cutie-pie fashion nods (Depp often looks like a sinister variant on Edward Scissorhands, with Bonham Carter invoking a live-action manifestation of the Corpse Bride), and the characters' appearances actually complement their color-drained lives. And the performances...well, they're the stuff of genius, simply put.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd"" is not only Burton's second-best film, but one of the best of 2007.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"
"woot197","9","2","6","22 December 2007"," The Best Comedy/Horror/Musical of the Year!
","Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is definitely for those with an acquired taste. But for those who've acquired it, it's delicious.<br/><br/>To sum it up without spoiling, while the first few minutes of the film are slightly foreboding towards its success, it recovers splendidly and maintains captivation of the senses throughout until the slightly hodgepodge ending. But to maintain that captivation while spinning a yarn about brutally unmotivated murder and mass cannibalism in musical form is a triumph in itself.<br/><br/>To begin, the cast is perfectly diversified. This is a very character-driven show, and the faces of the characters seem to be made specifically for the parts they play. Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs. Lovett and Timothy Spall's Beadle are specific examples of how just by looking the part they make the audience love and hate them, respectively, just with their presence.<br/><br/>The acting is magnificent. Nothing is held back here. Gestures and lines are delivered beautifully, and the actors really seem to understand how certain idiosyncrasies play a vital part in portraying the comedy and tragedy of the script. Ed Sanders as Toby is a completely wonderful surprise in this context.<br/><br/>The costuming, make-up, and sets are superb. For the most part, the entire gloomy mood of the film and the inescapable essence of it are truly expressed through forms of skewed harlequin versions of black, white, and colorful leather-inspired outfits and settings, and pale, precise make-up to go along with it. This macabre tendency of Burton's is the main reason why hordes of silly, prototypical non-conformist adolescents will stream to the theatre in the first place, but it works here, and the audience will love it if they've been fond of other Burton productions. There is one particular scene which strays from this palette, but it creates the desired effect of contrasting happiness and hope for a future with the tragedy of the film.<br/><br/>Also, the special effects are gripping. It truly is hard to believe, even with the slightly unbelievable glossy-red tint to all that blood and gore, that Mr. Depp really isn't slitting the throats of his customers. Perfectly horrifying, and beautifully rendered.<br/><br/>The music, however, creates a slight problem for the film in the sense that there isn't enough of it, as many of the original songs of the Sondheim musical have been edited and cut for the sake of time or content. While most of the actors command adequate mastery over the notes, some songs leave a lot to be desired by the audience, and most of the lyrics are regrettably forgettable throughout.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, this film is not for everyone. Musicals of this nature in this day and age rarely are. But for those with a taste for the theatrical and are in the mood for something different, it is definitely a piece that is to be respected for both its qualities of escapism and literary depth, despite the certain liberties taken from the original stage script. Where the film succeeds it succeeds triumphantly and it viciously and risibly grips the audience into attention and emotion on multiple occasions. All in all, 9/10 stars."

"classicsoncall","7","1","2","4 April 2018"," ""It's man devouring man, my dear...""
","The movie comes with a graphic violence warning, so don't be surprised by the buckets of blood it produces over the course of the story. Johnny Depp portrays a barber-ian throat slasher in what's nominally a musical, a fact I wasn't aware of until I started watching it. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter make a perfectly gruesome couple that gets along exceedingly well until, you know, Mrs. Lovett has to fess up to being not quite truthful about the former Mrs. Benjamin Barker. When Sweeney Todd is described as the 'last word in barbering', his customers have no idea how true that is. And if you happen to survive your time in the chair, that last bump on the noggin is designed to take you out completely. Which is why Judge Turpin's (Alan Rickman) turn at getting the shaft seemed a bit incredible since he momentarily survived both experiences. This is not the kind of film everyone can enjoy because let's face it, murder and mayhem are not the best source of ingredients for your standard meat pie, but if you can handle Mrs. Lovett's secret recipe, you'll also take delight in her distinctive menu of pop tarts."

","Like Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are a match made in heaven. Period.<br/><br/>Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp)'s a barber who was sent on a penal transportation after a false charge was laid against him by Judge Turnip (Alan Rickman), who wants his wife. He's back to London after 15 years with one goal in mind-revenge.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is a tour-de-force. Oscar-worthy. He plays his character with such finesse, and it's just fantastic to watch him on-screen. The rest of the cast has also brought their A-game with them. Like all other Tim Burton movies, this movie is a technical marvel. The settings, the visuals, the atmosphere, the cinematography and all other technical aspects are flawless. Stephen Sondheim's score is wonderful too.<br/><br/>That brings me to the vocal performances of the cast- What I love about musicals is that, actors who are generally not professional singers, have to convey their emotion with singing, to the best of their ability, albeit not perfect at times. It's a real challenge for them, and I highly commend their hardwork. Every actor has sung convincingly in Sweeney Todd, there was hardly a falter in that department.<br/><br/>Not every musical gets it right. At times, the singing and the lines don't go together, and the end product sounds weird and a bit ""off"".This movie slightly suffers from that , with one scene, at the start, which I found very infuriating to watch. Apart from that, the rest of the movie is filled with fantastic dialogues and songs. There's another great opening credits scene, which we've come to expect from Tim Burton. The story isn't your average ""run of the mill"" revenge thriller. There are a few surprises awaiting at the end.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street is a MUST watch for everyone who doesn't find musicals weird.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Tim Burton and I have a rough past. I've admired some of his dark/quirky films that spark from the most creative of places (Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride), while I've thoroughly detested some of the others (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland). He's a director who's unique touch hasn't always hit the mark. But Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a career high point. It is his bloodiest, darkest film to date and it is nearly his best. If you've noticed, my soft spot for musicals continues.. I honestly can't explain. Adapting from Steven Sondheim's genius Broadway creation, Sweeny Todd comes alive. Johnny Depp is electric. His performance here is tied with his portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson as his all-time best. He was born to sing, quite frankly. All of the others shine from Carter, to Cohen to the late Alan Rickman. The lyrics shake you to the core and the imagery shocks you as it cascades in blood. Sweeney Todd is a cut above the rest (rimshot)."

","Reflections in a razor. After being falsely imprisoned for 15 years, Benjamin Barker, London's most efficient barber, returns to his Fleet St. haunts under an alias to exact revenge on the villainous judge who allegedly drove Barker's wife to suicide and now has designs on their grown daughter. Long-overdue film-adaptation of the 1979 Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler, itself derived from George Dibdin-Pitt's play, first filmed in 1928 and again with Tod Slaughter starring in 1936. This time, the material is served up as macabre, black comedy, with director Tim Burton giving the picture an icy-gray pallor--and not just on the actors' faces, but an overall chilly deadness which seems ingrained in the film itself. Glowering, mumbling Johnny Depp attempts a perpetual low-key in the lead--in fact, most of the performances are muted in general--but this works against the film's aim (one presumes) to be a darkly comic grotesquerie. Black-red blood is splashed and dashed about the screen quite stylishly, but the heart of the piece is never found. The hand-picked cast perform their songs more than adequately, yet they are unable to bring these characters to life. Production design and technical aspects first-rate, but exactly what audience was Burton hoping to capture? *1/2 from ****"

Helena Bonham Carter was very good in this movie and her and Johnny's chemistry is so amazing! When they sing together, I love it so much!!!

"Leofwine_draca","9","1","2","4 January 2017"," Tim Burton's best movie thus far
","Tim Burton's latest opus sees his favourite actor, Johnny Depp, essaying the role of the killer barber that Tod Slaughter made (in)famous back in the 1930s. Rather than being a straightforward adaptation of the penny-dreadful horror yarn, this is instead the film version of the Sondheim musical that enjoyed immense popularity back in the 1970s. With me so far? I was a little disappointed when I saw that Depp was, yet again, starring in the title role – can't Burton find another actor? The good news is that this is one of Depp's best turns, second only to his Ed Wood. He makes the role his own and, while he lacks the lip-smacking relish that Slaughter brought to the character, he nevertheless sets the stage alight.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect by any means. Then again, musical adaptations rarely are. I could do without the CGI depictions of the London environs, which are sometimes zoomed through as if the camera's on a motorbike. And did we really need yet another SCUMMY turn from Timothy Spall, who takes typecasting to a whole new level? Burton seems a little unsure of himself at first, what with the new genre and all, but he handles this well and the various musical numbers are all well-staged and well-sung.<br/><br/>More bonuses come from supporting cast members – a restrained Alan Rickman, a Gothic Helena Bonham Carter – and the fact that Burton brings the story slap-bang into the 21st with buckets of delicious gore. Yes, the unrestrained throat cuttings are surprisingly played for laughs, taking the proceedings to a Grand Guignol level. Especially good is the blood-soaked climax, which is almost Shakespearian in nature. Okay, so the sub-plot about star-crossed lovers is so familiar as to be utterly mundane and uninteresting, but for the most part, SWEENEY TODD is a step in the right direction: good, stylish, and proud."

This movie has illogical events and simply stupid behavior of individuals. As for the music, it is as if it was written by some Hollywood composer at least 30 years ago. And Johnny Deep instead of acting, under the Tim Burton's weak direction delivers this display of severe case of face paralysis. And yet, some real movie Experts from US Of A wanted to give him an Oscar, apparently for that screaming / howling of his; but fortunately, they settled him only with an totally unearned Golden Globe<br/><br/>If it was not for the good showcase of London of the nineteenth century, this almost absolutely boring musical would have earned the 1/10 rating"

","Such excellent players like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are ill-spent in this not better than fair movie. The best of it is the Victorian London atmosphere in interiors, exteriors and clothes, aristocratic and popular. The story in itself is somewhat abstruse. A corrupt judge is aroused by the beautiful wife of a barber and to be able to take hold of her has her husband imprisoned on a false accusation and sent to deportation. He comes back fifteen years later with a false identity and wants to take his revenge on the judge. The next episodes are grandguignolesque and somewhat incomprehensible filled with several murders of the barber's clients in the barber's shop he had installed in the first floor of a confectionery owned by a woman with whom he starts a love relationship. He cuts their throats while pretending to shave them. The victims' bodies are used by that woman to bake meat pies. Among other things, what is strange is that no friends or relatives ever turned up to query about those disappearances. The barber ends up by getting hold of the judge after attracting him to the barber shop on a false promise and he cuts his throat there. And from horrifying scene to horrifying scene everything turns out badly to the barber, his companion and even his wife that appears in the end and who he thought was dead a long time ago. He cuts her throat too since he didn't recognize her and thought she was the beggar in whom she had changed herself. Awful indeed."

","Stephen Sondheim's musical, Sweeney Todd: The demon barber of Fleet Street is remade yet again on screen in this new adaptation. This successful musical horror thriller is directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, Timothy Spall, and Alan Rickman.The film is set in a dark place called London in late Victorian time.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd shows the story of Benjamin Barker. Benjamin Barker is the best known barber in all of Victorian London. He is married to the gorgeous Lucy and they have an infant daughter, her name is Johanna. The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin. He falsely accuses Benjamin Barker for a crime he didn't commit. Benjamin is send to a prison in Australia for fifteen years. Judge Turpin rapes Lucy, after that she tries to poison herself by swallowing arsenic. Afterwards Turpin takes custody over Johanna whilst Benjamin is still imprisoned. After Benjamin's verdict is over he returns to London under the name of Sweeney Todd, trying to get his revenge on Turpin. He meets the widow Mrs. Lovett who is the owner of a meat pie shop at Fleet Street. She gives him his Barber's knifes and tells him everything Judge Turpin did. To get his revenge Sweeney Todd opens a barber shop above Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop and he slices the throat of the customers. Will he succeed in getting his revenge on Turpin?<br/><br/>The most used technique in this film is mise en scène, we thought this was really well used: the lighting changes in relation to the mood, the costumes fit the setting really well and the set design was nearly flawless because it really convinced us that it took place in the 19th century. Also the light and color were a great way of creating the mood, it helped to create a dark, sinister and most of all a gloomy atmosphere. On the other hand, the special effects were on the low side. The violence in the many killings was in our opinion badly done, mainly because of the blood. Not only when a person was stabbed or sliced did insane bleeding ensue, the blood itself and the way it came out looked fake as well with it's brown blackish color. Although this was probably used to amplify the mood and the effect of the killings itself it looked extremely fake.<br/><br/>Having said all of that the acting in the film was really good. The role of Sweeney Todd played by Johnny Depp and Mrs. Lovett played by Helena Bonham Carter were done amazingly in our opinion. While watching the film you really get the feeling that the characters brought to life by Tim Burton were both really insane, in their own way.<br/><br/>In general we thought it was an exciting and thrilling film but it would've been more fun if there was less singing, it didn't really allow you to fully enjoy the film. Turning a Broadway musical into a film is really tricky for filmmakers as there tends to be something that doesn't add up with the rest of the movie or makes it less enjoyable to watch. A really off putting thing in this film is the music. In the musical it's not all that weird for a character to start singing mid sentence however in a film this does not have the same effect. In a horror film it's important to have suspense throughout the film and we found that music and the singing really did not fit well with the horror theme of the film, the songs weren't all that good either. The singing of the actors was well done but the music itself wasn't. The plot was very interesting, but at some parts it didn't make much sense. It's very complicated to grasp the full picture. This was very confusing for us so we had to watch the film a few times to fully understand the characters themselves and their motives.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a very complicated film. We liked it because of the great acting and props but it's a shame that there was this much singing. Also, the plot was confusing which made it hard for us to understand. We do strongly recommend this film for people that like or are interested in musicals or horror films. But if you can't stand lots of blood, corpses, insane characters or just generally don't like Broadway musical-film remakes, this probably isn't the film for you."

This time around, he made a very bloody revenge story about a man who is arrested for a crime he did not commit, and plans to get revenge on the people involved with his incarceration.

In essence, it seems to fail at all of its stated aims - a horror film, a musical or a drama. It is downbeat, depressing, gratuitously tasteless (actually on occasion repulsive), one-paced and really quite dull. Given its star cast and Burton at the helm, it is definitely not the sum of its parts. As to the musical elements, all the ""songs"" sounded the same to me and none of them stayed in my memory after they finished. Most seemed to be simply a matter of the cast reciting the next few lines by singing them (no more than competently). It would have been a better movie without them. Regarding the cast, for once I can't even compliment Depp - whom I much admire - as he is trapped in one tedious groove throughout. The colourful turns by Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are the sole redeeming feature and justify one of the two stars I bestow! It looks great, of course; it's a Tim Burton movie."

It was technically black and white, and London had the appearance of a total wasteland. It didn't help the fact that this movie is just dark in itself. The plot is twisted and evil, the characters are either completely insane or cruel...The actual good guys in the story stick out so much that every time they showed up on screen, I thought, ""Wow. Finally, some relief."" Despite this, they were going through emotional and physical turmoil the entire time, and you never get on solid ground about how they turn out post-movie.<br/><br/>And the blood is just...horrific! You would think that they would at least relieve you and not show so much, but it never stops! Literally every scene is filled with so much gore that even a strong-stomach like myself had to look away. When it comes to things like these, I think about the many films when you know someone is about to be seriously injured or murdered, it doesn't show it, but rather just gives you the sounds. Hearing something like that gives you enough mental image as it is, but this movie crossed a serious line. If you are not a person who can handle blood, gore, and violence, go ahead and find another movie.<br/><br/>This film does not satisfy. It doesn't leave you happy, or pleased, or feeling like, Wow. That was a great movie! Let's watch it again. No, definitely not. It is depressing, violent, and never gives any hope of getting better. I regret watching it, and hoped I would have picked a animated, family-film than this disaster. Believe me when I say you shouldn't waste your time. Spend money on something more worthy, and save yourself the disturbing effects afterward.<br/><br/>2/10 simply because it was free on my part."
"MBunge","4","1","2","13 October 2010"," Seriously, how do you make Sweeney Todd and leave out ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd""?
","If there's one thing that this movie proves beyond any doubt it is this â€“ you can't make a musical with people who can't really sing.<br/><br/>Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's classic stage production, this film tells the story of Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp). A barber in London with a beautiful wife and baby girl, Barker is arrested on a trumped up charge and thrown out of the country by the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Years later, he returns home to be told his wife is dead and his daughter has been raised as Turpin's ward. Consumed with revenge, Barker renames himself Sweeney Todd and plots the judge's murder. When his initial attempt on the judge's life fails, Todd launches into a spree of killings in his Fleet Street barber shop with the bodies of his victims becoming the daily food source for the meat pie shop of his downstairs neighbor, accomplice and admirer Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). Turpin intends to marry Todd's daughter, but Johanna (Jayne Wisener) falls in love with a young sailor, Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower). Anthony conspires with Todd to free Johanna, but Todd wants to use them both to lure the judge back into his clutches.<br/><br/>The first and most important thing to say about this movie is that most of the actors in it can't really sing. They're not horrible, like drunk secretaries during karaoke night at the local bar or those freaks who show up at American Idol auditions, but they don't have anything like the pipes you need for this sort of music. Their voices are thin and cramped and shallow. Take Johnny Depp for example. He has his own rock band and listening to him in this film, you can easily imagine him being able to pull off your typical rock song. But musical theater, especially when it's the quality of Sweeney Todd, is a whole 'nother level and requires a great deal more talent and skill. Going back to American Idol, hearing Depp and Carter try and warble their way through some of Sweeney's excellent tunes is like hearing those lesser contestants on Idol try and fake their way through styles of music they're unfamiliar with and don't particularly like. In the whole cast, only Ed Sanders and Jamie Campbell Bower show off legitimate musical theater chops.<br/><br/>This film also commits one of the biggest and stupidest crimes in the history of big screen musical adaptations. It omits The Ballad of Sweeney Todd from the movie. It's simply one of the best songs in the whole show, and leaving it out is like doing Annie and leaving out ""Tomorrow"".<br/><br/>Visually, this may be the least interesting film Tim Burton has ever done. He gives London and its citizens a cartoonishly Gothic look, but the camera work and the way he shoots the songs, especially, are very pedestrian for a Burton movie. T here are only two or three instances in the whole film, such as when the bodies of Sweeney's victims thud against the stone floor of Mrs. Lovett's baking room, that show Burton's unique vision at all. It's almost as though he was unsure how to shoot the musical scenes and a sort of directorial paralysis spread throughout the entire film. The most Burtony section of the movie is a day dream sequence while Mrs. Lovett sings ""By the sea"", but the playful styling of that only emphasizes how ordinary everything else is.<br/><br/>In fairness to Burton, though, adapting Sweeney Todd to the silver screen is a big challenge. It's much more operatic than other musicals, with the characters actually singing the story for the most part in place of dialog. The songs are so important to the story and so intricate, I think they work better coming out of the mouth of someone standing on a stage instead of competing with all the visual imagery blaring at you from the screen.<br/><br/>Years ago, I saw a televised production of Sweeney Todd on Iowa Public Television starring Angela Lansbury and George Hearn. You might have to use the Google and go look for it on the Youtube or the eBay, but that fabulous production far outstrips this weak 2007 effort."
"horror_pop","Null","1","2","22 April 2010"," Sort of works, sort of doesn't
","Out of all Tim Burtons movies I've seen, Sweeney Todd has to be my least favorite. While everything works perfectly fine, such as the music, cinematography, and casting, there's something off about how all of these elements come together to create a film.<br/><br/>As surprised as I am to say this myself, almost every character in Sweeney Todd is unevenly portrayed. Johnny Depp gives a very bipolar, angsty portrayal of the titular character, appearing raving and bloodthirsty one minute and as a brooding teenager the next. Helena Bonham Carter is so monotonous in this film that she's a pain to watch (and listen to, because by God, her singing voice is nowhere near as good as what I was lead to believe. Neither was Depps's, but more on that later). Johanna, played by Jayne Wisener, gives the film some grace but her acting is sub-par and doesn't offer anything to the viewer. I can only conclude that the most memorable performances come not from our leading actors, but from the supporting cast, such as Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle. Even Sacha Baron Cohen was more engaging on screen than Depp, even though he has an unfortunately short amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with Sweeney Todd is the fact that it's a musical. Don't get me wrong, I adore musicals, but I also think that if a story could be told perfectly well without musical accompaniment, that's the way it should be done. I feel the music in Sweeney Todd distracts the viewer from the tragic story, and it would've been much more interesting if it were just a regular movie. As much as everyone I know loves to go on and on about everyone's singing in this film, I need to put myself out there and say that no one in the movie can actually sing. When I hear the term musical, I expect to see actors who can really sing out of the depths of their hearts, much like in Singin' In The Rain or Phantom of the Opera, because the story is mainly told through music. What I'm not expecting is someone to meekly speak their lines with occasional melody (cough cough, Depp), or whine them in a voice that tells the audience that they're definitely trying, but more practice is needed (cough cough, Bonham Carter). I was also annoyed as Hell at Ed Sanders, who played Tobias. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>Overall, Sweeney Todd isn't all bad. It's a fun, Gothic ride we've all come to expect from Tim Burton, who really is a wonderful director who has made amazing films. My final verdict is; yes, see this film. The music is beautiful, the visuals are stunning, and while the acting isn't the best, I've seen a whole lot worse. However, it isn't worth more than a single viewing. After that, all the little things really start to bother you and you've exhausted yourself in trying to enjoy the movie a second time."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","1","2","3 April 2010"," Another hit from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, this time a slasher musical!
","By the time this very dark musical came to the silver screen in 2007, I had seen most of the previous Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations, and had seen their last one before this, 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", in the theatre, but that didn't happen with this one. I first watched this film on DVD two years ago this month, unfamiliar with the play it's based on, and I thought it was pretty good, but had trouble really getting into it, which was too often the case for me with movies around that time. I wrote a review of it soon after seeing it for the first time, giving it a 7/10, but recently deleted that review, confident that a second viewing would be better, and I was right. After seeing it twice, both times on a rented DVD copy, I can rate it no lower than 8/10.<br/><br/>A man once known as Benjamin Barker returns to London in Victorian-era England after fifteen years of exile and hard labour for a crime he didn't commit. Now under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, he is obviously very bitter upon his return, and does not think much of the town! He soon enters a pie shop on Fleet Street, run by Mrs. Lovett, who tells him about the vacant room upstairs, which happens to be his old apartment! Mrs. Lovett also tells him that his wife is dead and his daughter is being held captive by the evil Judge Turpin, the man who sent him away! Sweeney opens a barber shop above Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, where he plans his revenge on Judge Turpin by luring him in and cutting his throat! He nearly succeeds, but not quite, and after this, the barber plans his revenge on the town by luring many customers into his shop and cutting their throats, hoping to get another chance to do it to Judge Turpin! <br/><br/>Since this is a Tim Burton project, it's no surprise that the visuals are dark and very pleasing to the eye, which is one of the things that make this film so good and memorable. There are also many outstanding performances, once again with Johnny Depp as the protagonist, plus another talented Burton recast, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, and other talented actors such as Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, controversial prankster Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli (a mean-spirited barber who abuses his child assistant, Tobias), and several others. Unlike most of Burton's movies, this is a musical, but the talented cast members generally have decent voices, even if they weren't known to sing in films before this. Some of the songs could have been better written, such as ""Poor Thing"", and ""My Friends"" (Sweeney Todd sings to his razor in this song), I didn't care much for Jayne Wisener's (Johanna, the main character's daughter) high-pitched singing voice, and I found that there was a little too much singing at times, but for the most part, the songs are very strong. There's also lots of tension throughout most of the film, and some humour, such as the ""Worst Pies In London"" part, and Pirelli's fraudulent elixir, which Mr. Todd says is ""p&#@."" <br/><br/>There are obviously those who strongly dislike Tim Burton's films in general, and if you're one of them, this version of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" probably wouldn't be an exception. His dark style is not for everybody. If you're a fan of the filmmaker and like his films in which Johnny Depp plays the lead role, there's a lot of the usual here, but unlike any of the duo's previous live action movies, this one is a musical, and you may or may not like that. I also can't forget to mention the throat cutting scenes. They don't start until after a while, but there are a bunch of them, and they tend to be very graphic. This is the reason for the R rating, but even many adults would find it hard to keep their eyes on the screen during these scenes. I'm glad I was warned about these parts before seeing the film! However, for those who can handle the gore and are not expecting a happy movie, this could be something good to watch."
"amwcsu","Null","1","2","12 March 2010"," A Gem...A True Classic!
","In a decade of lazily-made movie remakes crafted in the most disgusting manner, to the point of the audience rolling their eyes and giving out disgruntled sighs and comments not for the faint of heart, this is an exception. Movies now are nothing more than cash cows for rather evil studio execs producing eye-candy for the stupid and thoughtless! <br/><br/>In comes Sweeney Todd. I originally thought that this was another ridiculous millennial horror movie, that fails to keep interest complete with masochistic lunatics abound. But not this time. I was first greeted with a rather melodious introduction by a young sailor saying how glad he is to return home. Then Sweeney chimes in with his more cynical verse done to absolute perfection. In fact, everyone who sings that doesn't usually sing does their part to perfection. I am impressed! Very impressed! The songs enables you to feel the characters' emotions! The acting is done with amusement and whimsy, you actually sense the actors' enjoy being in character. Sweeney Todd is pure musical ecstasy and a study in human psychology/duality until the end. <br/><br/>Yes, the ending. It's one to be remembered. It's no longer child's play or the musical with whimsy it was at the beginning. Spoiler! Heads up! Sweeney in total ignorance kills his wife (who has gone mad because of his absence and from Judge Turpin's advances turning her into a beggar) throws her down into the cellar where men are turned into meat pies. Second, is the scene where Mrs. Lovett is tossed into the huge fiery oven and burned to a cinder and you the audience see her do so while screaming bloody murder. Nice! And the last but not least, the boy taken in by Lovett kills Todd in revenge for Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney is left bleeding to death cradling his wife in a fatal and silent reunion. <br/><br/>Sweeney is a wonderful film and a wonderful musical. The funny and odd thing is that its has a gross usage of the infamous CGI! Not may movies can hold up this standard. Let's hope Alice in Wonderland is another hit in the world of Gothic depiction."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","9","1","2","24 February 2010"," Great things -- terrible, but great
","I have about a fifty-fifty success rate on Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations; I've loved some of them, hated some. And I don't care for Steven Sondheim as a writer of musicals, while the reviews I saw for this film when it first came out were only mediocre. I say this in order to explain why -- thanks to a Johnny Depp retrospective at the National Film Theatre in London -- I've only just seen for the first time a film that premiered for the rest of the world a couple of years ago; and why I've been blown away by it.<br/><br/>This is a terrible story... and I mean that in its true, original sense. The only possible 'happy' ending, when all is played out, would be for all the characters to die -- death at least being an end, rather than living with what has happened -- and this is, more or less, what happens. In between comes betrayal, obsession, virtual incest (in what sort of relationship has the Judge stood to his 'ward' throughout her childhood?), warped affections, and industrial-scale murder; not to mention lashings of blood in a volume generally only deployed for comic effect. The outcome here is very far from humorous.<br/><br/>But it is not the blood that makes the film so terrible (and had me sitting almost throughout with both hands clutched tightly together and slippery with sweat). The true horror lies in its moral and emotional underpinnings, where even parental affections are not to be trusted -- ultimately, Todd appears to value his daughter more as bait for his revenge on the Judge than as a beloved child or even an innocent to be saved, while Mrs Lovett's protective feelings towards Toby cannot trump her sense of survival. And while she may be attracted to her former neighbour, right from the start of their relationship there are moments when she is afraid of him too...<br/><br/>The twists to the plot become evident to the audience at just about the right moment, namely slightly before the characters themselves realise; enough anticipation to create a dreadful dramatic irony. The overall effect is to deliver a massive, shell-shocking emotional kick: almost in its entirety the audience sat shattered throughout the length of the credits, only beginning to file out with lowered eyes and voices when the house lights finally came on. I'm not sure what we'd been expecting: black comedy perhaps, the sardonic glitz of ""Chicago"". This film is far closer in tone to Depp's Jack-the-Ripper vehicle, ""From Hell"" -- but it is much more effective than the latter both as a thriller and as a 'slasher' chill-maker. (At least one shot in the early scenes reminded me vividly of a corresponding momentary image in Todd Slaughter's hammed-up 1930s ""Sweeney Todd"", and the dockside locations are recognisably similar: accurate historical reproduction, or a brief homage from a cinematically-literate director to his predecessor?)<br/><br/>On a personal level, I've been going through a long fallow period when nothing I saw, not even re-watching classic movies, could seem to wake any kind of real response: ""Sweeney Todd"" has jolted me back into belief in the power of cinema again. Like Sweeney, I may have just waded through Hell, but I'm alive at last and from that, full of joy.<br/><br/>I still don't get on with Sondheim (as with ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"", the film version contains only one memorable song, by the standards of this lover of old musicals at least -- and it isn't the would-be traditional 'Joanna'); but frankly, you don't watch this for the soundtrack. The music is more in the nature of ambient effects. I was astonished to read that 80% of the dialogue in the film is actually sung, as I certainly wasn't conscious of this while watching.<br/><br/>It is true, I'm afraid, as the original critics pointed out, that Helena Bonham Carter's vocal delivery isn't really up to the role: when a grown woman's singing is in danger of being overpowered by a boy soprano in their numbers together, it's a sign that something's not right. Her breathy little voice was fine for the Corpse Bride's numbers with the equally hesitant Victor, and is adequate for most of what she is asked to do here, but there are moments when the contrast is not kind to her performance -- in her final duet with Sweeney especially, some vital plot material is inaudible. Johnny Depp, on the other hand, of whom I'd seen similar criticisms, sounded fine, and both are sufficiently effective actors (and the music, to my ear, sufficiently underwhelming) to bring their characters across regardless.<br/><br/>My real problem in this respect was with Jamie Campbell Bower in the unrewarding cardboard role of juvenile romantic interest: I actually assumed that his singing had been rather clumsily dubbed by another vocalist, so little relation did it bear to his speaking voice and so oddly detached it seemed from his lip movements. Both young lovers, alas, are little more than plot ciphers, and one feels that this part of the plot could really have been cut out of the film altogether to its improvement. The story and tragedy is that of the title character, and it is hard to care much about young Anthony.<br/><br/>For these issues, and for some very fake blood (were they worried about sickening the audience beyond bearing?), I'll knock off a point to score this film at 9/10; this is still a rating I give to few pictures of any era, and to very few indeed from the last forty years."

","A stellar ensemble delivers a cinematic delight as Director Tim Burton delivers his trademark unique twists to this traditional tale. The dark cinematography, and cartoon like CGI, creates a wonderfully chaotic, and grim 19th Century London. The music and lyrics are the work of veteran songs smith Stephen Sondheim, in a production where a significant part of the plot is sung through, which may put some people off. However I found it a joy to have a high quality musical score underwriting a good story, well told.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the eponymous role and is fast becoming the leading actor of his generation. His London accent is quite good, if alarmingly close to that of Jack Sparrow, from Pirates of the Caribbean. His charming, but deranged Barber is a wonderful creation, which he has much fun with. His Mistress is played by a sleazily over the top Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen has a marvellous cameo as a cod-Italian travelling snake oil salesman. Judge Turpin, the ""baddie"" is inevitably played by Alan Rickman who excels in a small role, ably assisted by the portly Timothy Spall, his sidekick.<br/><br/>Essentially a Musical Horror film, Burton revels in the blood drenched plot with plenty of humorous visual gags to assuage the slaughter which unfold before us. The macabre and gory detail might be too much in less experienced hands but the artificial dreamlike quality of the Cinematography steers the audience away from the verite which if portrayed in a realistic setting would have been very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>A fine effort from one of the most original and imaginative Directors working today."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is my favorite movie. And that says a lot, because I do NOT do well with blood and gore in movies! My cousin forced me to watch this movie with the promise that I would love it, and I was very reluctant, but in the end I gave in. I now own the DVD and have the entire score memorized. Thank you Sam!!! Johnny Depp. What a genius. He manages, with one baleful stare into the distance, to convey the rage, horror and unrest of a terribly wronged man. In the thirty second flashback in which his Benjamin Barker is seen, a simple, naive, yet happy husband and father is immediately established and understood. Depp's transformation into the revengeful Sweeney Todd is also complete, and his voice spills emotions as much as his razors spill blood. Depp's singing voice is quite powerful, and though he is no trained operatic by any means, his voice fits Todd perfectly.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs. Lovett is sheer genius, and I fail to understand why she did not get an Oscar nom for her performance. Her Mrs. Lovett is worldly-wise, practical, and yet underneath there is a romantic longing which is obvious to all but Todd. Carter delivers her lines with a perfect blend of dry humor, practicality, and sweet romanticism. One of her most powerful moments is when she has locked Toby in the bakehouse, and her eyes fill with tears as she goes to warn Todd. Carter's voice is not as powerful as Depp's, but she works within her range, and does a splendid job with several very difficult songs, including the hilarious ""Worst Pies in London"" and the dreamy ""By the Sea,"" which by the way is the single sequence in the movie set in sunshine.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall work perfectly together. Rickman has only to raise an eyebrow and speak in the softest voice, and he is a perfect, slick incarnation of evil. Spall's sniveling Beadle Bamford is the perfect sidekick to Rickman, and their song ""Ladies in Their Sensitivities"" is one of the best songs in the score.<br/><br/>The supporting actors - Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Ed Sanders, Jayne Weisner, and of course Sacha Baron Cohen - are all brilliant as well. Cohen's cameo is awesome and he lends some much needed visual comic relief, although both his Italian and English accents are almost incomprehensible. Jamie Campbell Bower's eyes simply radiate innocent love at first sight, and his Anthony sings sweetly and longingly of Johanna. Laura Michelle Kelly, a seasoned stage actress, does quite well in her dual roles as Lucy Barker and the beggar woman. Ed Sanders's acting and facial expressions can be wooden at times, but his voice is spot-on perfect for his role as Toby, and he does fantastically well with his songs. And I wish Jayne Weisner's role as Johanna could have been expanded a bit, as her voice is beautifully clear, pure and sweet, and her huge dark eyes perfectly convey her desperation to get away from her life under the thumb of Judge Turpin.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has done a fantastic job with this movie. He keeps the camera closely zoomed in on his characters, so as not to miss a single raw emotion. His Victorian London is filthy, smoggy, picture perfect, and he lets the blood flow as freely as the music. Which brings me to Steven Sondheim's score. Oh. My. Gosh. The score is the true star of the show. While most musical numbers are icing on the cake and aren't really necessary to the plot, the entire story of Sweeney Todd is given through music. Plot lines are explained, twists are made, and final secrets are revealed in songs with perfectly intertwined music and lyrics. You cannot separate the music from the script. The music is the script.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing. If you don't like blood, just avert your eyes, it's only in a few scenes. If you don't like Tim Burton, give him another chance. This is one of his best films, and he doesn't disappoint. Watch it!"

","I bought this movie without knowing what to expect from it. I'm a small fan of Johnny Depp as a performer, he has done some very strong rolls before so my expectations was high. Didn't get any better by the fact that Tim Burton stands as the director.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple and the oldest one there is: revenge. Yet it's told through half-musical, that is there are many parts where they sing instead of reading out dialogues. This gives the movie a whole other dimension and the portrait of the ""old London"" is a half twisted world of lunatics. It's just a brilliant and perfect setting.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a strong performance as Sweeney Todd but there are other strong actors as well. Alan Rickman per example delivers a perfect interpretation of the Judge Turpin while Helena Bonham Carter delivers a very strong roll as Mrs Lovett.<br/><br/>The music however is somehow hard to follow at certain points, especially when 2 sings against each other on different songs. Needless to say however that this occasions are few and add little confusion to the story.<br/><br/>All in all, Sweeney Todd is one of those movies you either lover, or hate. If you're in to Tim Burton, Johnny Depp or half-musicals I recommend this. if your not into I still recommend it because it's a very good movie well balanced between humour, love and tragedy."

","The story of the man Sweeny Todd is of vengeance and not of too much else, and of what little theme there is to convey, the film conveys it all in such a way so for a child to even understand it (maybe). We're shown how obsession rots the human psyche and soul through Sweeny, who is shown void of anything humane and thinks always of murdering the Judge who ruined his life so many years earlier before when the film starts. He becomes a sort of killing perfectionist who thinks only of killing so to satisfy his wants for personal vengeance, and can only sometimes subdue himself by 'practing'; and sometimes 'practing' so for there to be even a sort of montage, by the middle of the movie for instance. He befriends and makes an accomplice out from the women Mrs. Lovett, who owns a small shop inside of London; she sales in her store meat-pies which she describes as being 'the worst in all of London', and because of this, a bargain is made between the two. Sweeny will be allowed to commit terrible acts right above from the women so to allow for her to make meat-pies from the flesh of said victims of terrible acts.<br/><br/>Oh yeah...this is a musical too, right...yeah...who in the name of God could even make this sort of movie...oh...I see, and as such, Johnney Depp stars as Sweeny Todd (of course) and he dose do the character utter justice, in that you fully believe in his ability to kill ANY person and that he can even justify it all because of how it is human life has no real significance. As such, humans are depicted as meat piles, being cut up and fed to the masses, and during musical numbers even, though most often, the transition between the two seems invisible, in that you forget that singing is not common place during idle conversations. The songs even drip with the film's melancholy, so to not stray the story from it's brutal subject matter. <br/><br/>The film plays out like the fables told by the Brother's Gimm, though it is without any breed of wonder, and again, this movie seems simplistic as all hell, so for a child to even understand. It works as a sort of cautionary tale, told through darkness and graphic R-rated violence, warning of obsession and of revenge.<br/><br/>10/10"

","It's not that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a bad film as much as it is a bad Tim Burton film. The film looks good visually and is very ominous in its cinematography and use of a grotty and bleak location but most of this is what we come to expect from Burton and is nothing more than a sheen on a surface when broken down and thought about. Most of Burton's films that do not contain a certain amount of substance really rely on the visual; Sleepy Hollow and Mars Attacks! are two good examples with Batman, Batman Returns and Ed Wood being films that looked pretty ordinary but actually felt as if they were about something; about people and predicaments and coming through in the end. Sweeney Todd is one of the former; iffy, visually attractive efforts but 'not much else going on' films.<br/><br/>A few years prior to Sweeney Todd, Joel Schumacher made The Phantom of the Opera, another musical adaptation for the silver screen. There are connections between the two. Both are films about individuals whom have suffered in the past and have been scarred so badly, either physically or psychologically, they take it upon themselves to inhabit a certain 'space' in which they are able to remain, cut off from the outside world as they reflect their social misfit status. What's interesting about The Phantom and Sweeney Todd is their dwelling. Both the opera house and the barber shop offer members of the public a certain 'service'. At the time of The Phantom of the Opera, the opera house (along with the theatre) was very much a means of entertainment for a night out; a place that has since been associated with visitors whom are sophisticated or cultured.<br/><br/>A barbers shop on the other hand can be seen as a place in which the tenants go in order to save themselves a job. There is something nonchalant about a man going to a barbers to have someone else shave him; a certain amount of risk about entrusting another individual with something as potentially dangerous as a razor so close to one's face. In this sense, the spaces Todd and The Phantom inhabit are somewhat associated with the upper class or the nonchalant and are spaces the respected anti-heroes turn into places of horror and terror with their anger and hatred born out of their own social role as a misfit. I liked The Phantom of the Opera slightly more; it felt more heartfelt and revolved around a romance more so than it did a tale of revenge as seen in Sweeney Todd.<br/><br/>So if the unique selling point here is that Sweeney Todd is a revenge film, incorporating the genre of the musical and throwing in lashings of gore at the same time, does it work? The short answer is 'not really'. This hybridity of the musical, a casual and usually uplifting genre that falls into the non-realist sense combined with the gritty, realist revenge arc complete with lots of gore does not work here. The film sees Sweeney arrive back in London following years away after a conviction he was innocent of in the first place. This charge was related to the 'crime' of being in love with someone that someone else of a greater power was also in love with. That man is Judge Turpin (Rickman), the slimy Brit-cast baddie who has an equally slimy sidekick in Beadle, Timothy Spall doing what he did in the recent Harry Potter films to reasonably good effect once again, so we've seen it before.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Sweeney Todd is a follow on from his 'funny' mumbling character Captain Jack Sparrow but less Keith Richards and more Charlie Manson. Todd is a changed man after his stint away from England for punishment of being with this other woman but he's changed for the worse and it's not long before he gets the blood lust that will drive him to his inevitable show down with enemy Judge Turpin. The film is very basic in its idea and set up and a lot of it is music and songs but while there's nothing wrong with that, it's the little things that niggle. The shaving show down with Pirelli (Baron-Cohen), who is a negative Italian stereotype in himself, acts as an introduction to Todd's barber skills and no more. There is also a particularly unpleasant 'joke' involving his child assistant and his constantly cut fingers.<br/><br/>But Sweeney Todd is the sort of film that places young children in a position for the sake of laughs when one child is on the floor drunk later on and it just feels out of place. Amongst all the stereotypes and the using of Brits as the villains is an American playing Todd, complete with a white streak in his hair amongst a lot of black in a desperate attempt to visually show us there might be some good or 'light' in him amongst all the 'evil'. The sub narrative of Anthony (Campbell Bower) loving and chasing Johanna (Wisener) is daft and degrading, Johanna being relegated to the role of 'damsel in distress/locked in a tower' as her hero/lover stands, sings and watches her from below. Later, she is moved to an asylum of all places and that's the end of that mini-story.<br/><br/>Additionaly, why does Burton shoot his wife Bonham-Carter in an objective fashion as she pours out of a corset? Similarly to Len Wiseman and the Underworld films, we're not watching the film to see your wife presented in a provocative fashion. If people being killed and served as pies as later on two potential kid killers roam the sewers searching for a lost boy sounds like fun then you might enjoy Sweeney Todd but it is a rather daft and lifeless film directed by a man that you expect better from."
"thewarriorsfan666","10","1","2","2 November 2008"," In a perfect world Sweeney Todd would be remembered as Burton's masterpiece, his most amazing piece of work.
","With a malicious bent a mile wide and a malevolent bounce in its manic step, Sweeney Todd is defiantly sweeping, epic, and strange, which on paper might seem right up Tim Burton's alley, but in execution something far more intimate, beautiful even.<br/><br/>We first see Sweeney Todd (the always amazing Johnny Depp) on a ship with a young man named Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) as they make their way to London. We get a first glance of Depp's singing in this opening scene, and surprisingly hes very good. Hes got a rock solid voice, and his voice never cracks or slips. Sweeney has spent 15 long, arduous years in prison, wrongfully accused of killing his wife thanks to Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who kidnapped his only daughter and left Todd to suffer. He then meets Mrs. Lovett (the charming Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of ""worst meat pie shop in London"". Sweeney then sets in motion a plan to take revenge on Turpin.<br/><br/>Be warned, this is a MUSICAL, so expect a lot of singing and music numbers. Honestly, its what makes the movie all the more alluring. By intersecting the musical numbers with the usual Burton flourishes, the film is something different, but wholly Burton the whole way through. Its familiar in a fresh, unique way.<br/><br/>Whats also familiar, yet fresh, is his two stars, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, his apparent muses. This is Depp's 7th collaboration with the director, with this being Bonham's 5th. This is arguably the best for both (yes topping Edward Scissorhands and Big Fish), there's something so entrancing about this film its quite hard to place. Depp and Carter are both amazing, not only acting (which is a no brainer, of course) but in their singing as well. They belt out some great songs throughout the picture and I'm lightly tapping my toes as I type this.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't skimp on the gore, however, and blood fetishists will have fun watching Depp slice and dice unfortunate costumers that happen into his barbershop o' death. The film is relentless and Burton never holds back, ending in such shocking darkness that is far from the fairytale like ending in Scissorhands.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is considered the quintessential Burton film, Batman his most mainstream, Big Fish and Edward Scissorhands his most poetic, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory his most odd, Planet of the Apes and Mars Attacks! his most self-indulgent, Ed Wood his most ambitious, and Sleepy Hollow somewhere in the middle of it all. In a perfect world Sweeney Todd would be remembered as Burton's masterpiece, his most amazing piece of work.<br/><br/>With thrills and chills in equal measure, incredible supporting performances (including a knockout scene-stealer in Sasha Baron Cohen), great performances and singing on part of the entire cast (including a surprisingly great tenor in Alan Rickman), and surprisingly deep emotional core displayed by the passionate performances by Depp and Carter, Sweeney Todd is one of the most visually sweeping and thoroughly engrossing musical thrillers ever created. One could say its Tim Burton's best film in his long and fruitful career."

This must have been something on Broadway but there's no way it was this good, not without this stellar cast. I couldn't believe the sets either.

","Benjamin Barker, Sweeney Todd (Depp) returns to London to get revenge on Judge Turpin (Rickman) who sent him to prison and stole his wife.<br/><br/>Tim Burton brings his dark imagination to vivid life once again in this deeply disturbing and brutal musical horror, and is his darkest film to date.<br/><br/>With an opening shot of raw red blood dropping through machines during the credits, the tone for the film is set and Burton instantly dives deep into the darkness of London, with stunning imagery for the City, and a particularly excellent shot of the London Bridge, helps achieve the ultimate chill factor as Sweeney Todd enters.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) shows once again why he's the hottest actor around by giving an astounding Oscar nominated performance as barber Sweeney Todd. In his first singing role, Depp creates the right feel for the character, emotionally scared but vengeful to, and this is portrayed through an excellent choice of songs.<br/><br/>Bonham Carter (Fight Club) gives a good performance as Mrs Lovett and her songs give an upbeat mood to the dark tale, though the humour is slightly off putting.<br/><br/>Every actor sang their own songs and all were singing for their first time on screen, and all perform well and in particular Depp who arguably has the hardest and most songs to perform, but all are done so well. The songs are repeated which is slightly disappointing but nevertheless there isn't one bad song and each reflects what a dark narrative it is.<br/><br/>Based on the Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd tells a harrowing and disturbing tale of the barber who cuts people up and makes pies out of their bodies, and this alone is enough to chill you to the bone as we see the madness and the darkness of a man.<br/><br/>The graphic design behind the chair and the settings in general achieve the darkness and emphasise the moody atmosphere of the plot, and are brilliantly directed by Burton who uses a variety of techniques to get the true cutting edge, literally.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd isn't for the fainthearted as it is truly graphic and very bloody and the ideology of killing in that particular manner is very tense. This is a true horror, expertly (if somewhat bizarrely) directed in usual scrumptious and diverse fashion by Tim Burton, and acted exceptionally well by Depp with a great support cast, make the most graphic and horrific film of 2007, which is an essential watch, there is nothing out there like it."

","Yes, you read right, it is a MUSICAL and don't worry, this is a positive review. I adore musicals with a passion, but when I was in New York in the year 2005 (when I hadn't quite caught the musical bug yet), I noticed that Sweeney Todd was a musical and what did I think?: BAD IDEA (even though i had not heard the music). 2 years later, I am now a musical nut, so, I went to see this with high expectations and guess what? That 15 year old version of me, i could've gave him a slap. Sweeney Todd is FANTASTIC!!!!!! The visual tone of Tim Burton is supremely evident in this film. Most of the film is done in a grey-tone. One noticeable feature is that with flashbacks or fantasies, the colour tone is extremely bright and colourful. And amongst the grey-tone, the blood spurts out bright red! Johnny Depp plays this role to perfection as a man with his mind warped towards vengeance. I consider him as the perfect anti-hero. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as Mrs. Lovett (Sweeney's partner in crime). She plays the very beautiful, yet wilted English rose that is Mrs. Lovett. Now, to the section which peaks my interest: the music. One word for Stephen Sondheim: Genius. The music is absolutely wonderful. These are the kind of songs that you start humming along to. I love that nearly every two minutes of dialogue is surrounded by songs. That is what makes a musical amazing. and for the last section, the violence. The reason why the legend of Sweeney Todd is infamous. Let's just say if you don't have a strong stomach, don't watch it. I'm not a fan of horror movies, but the fact that it is a musical, that makes up for it.<br/><br/>So, to conclude, watch this film if you can because it is brilliant.<br/><br/>And this goes to show that the movie-musical is not a dying breed of genre. BRING ON THE MOVIE MUSICALS!!!!!! 10/10"
"Dillypogo","10","1","2","19 August 2008"," Sweeney Todd: Great performances, great songs, everything's great!
","Bloody. Gothic. Brilliant. These three words describe my favourite film, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street. Johnny Depp plays the barber of the title who swears bloody revenge on a judge (Alan Rickman) who wrongly imprisoned him for 14 years, taking his wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and daughter (Jayne Wisener) from him. As the bodies pile up, Todd's neighbour Mrs. Lovette (Helena Bonham Carter) comes up with the grisly idea of putting the bodies to good use and making them into meat pies to sell in her shop.<br/><br/>Depp and Carter give great and memorable performances along with the rest of the cast, but it's Sacha Baron Cohen who steals the show as Todd's humorous competition. Tim Burton's dark humour fits in well with the tone of the film and makes it even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The thing that makes a musical great is, of course, its songs and Stephen Sondheim's music doesn't let down. The lyrics are first-class and so memorable that you'll be humming along to them for days.<br/><br/>The 18+ certificate is well deserved due to the excessive throat slitting and blood spraying that comes in after about half an hour. Let me tell you, this film is not for the weak of stomach, but I have to say that the blood is necessary for this kind of film.<br/><br/>The songs are great, the dark humour fits in well and the cast give top-notch performances. I give Sweeney Todd 10/10."

Tim Burton) <br/><br/>Returning back to London after his wife and daughter had been stolen by Judge Turpin (Rickman), Benjamin Barker adopts the name of Sweeney Todd (Depp) and relocates his barber business to the top of Mrs. Lovett's (Carter) pie shop. Todd wants his revenge on the man who has now adopted his daughter (Wisener), and works with Mrs. Lovett on an evil plan. Todd will slice the throats of the unsuspecting public whilst giving them a shave. These bodies would then be turned into Mrs. Lovett's new meat pies. With this plan being successful, all Todd needs to do now, is try and convince the Judge to sit in his chair.<br/><br/>After the successful 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' remake and the magnificent 'Corpse Bride', Tim Burton introduces us to his next weird and wonderful movie. This time it's the dark tale of Sweeney Todd. All the usual ingredients of a Tim Burton movie are included here. The dark humour, the beautiful sets and the amazing acting talents of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are all found here. Add to this the fellow talent of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen, as well as the well written music; you got another hit from Burton. Each star surprisingly has a good singing voice and is able to perform excellent versions of their songs, with Johnny Depp sounding a lot like David Bowie. Timothy Spall doesn't provide a great voice as a person, but a perfect voice for the character. If you don't like musicals, this would probably not change you mind, but if you're a musical fan or a actual movie fan, then you should adore this.<br/><br/>He certainly does.

My expectations did not fall short; there is not a second of film that is not an artistic compositional masterpiece in its own right.<br/><br/>Being an ex-Johnny Depp fanatic, and presently a mere fan of his acting (save for Pirates 2 where it got just a little bit tedious), I felt that Johnny gave a great performance (especially in Mrs Lovett's imagination(the beach scene!)) and his singing was miles better than I predicted. In fact, I loved all of the acting- thanks to Atwood for once again casting Burton a great crew of actors.

"doctorsmoothlove","7","1","2","22 May 2008"," A worthwhile film in a neglected genre
","Cannibalism isn't strongly represented in cinematic history. Other than the Italian exploitation films of the 1980's, there are few examples of cannibalism in cinema. Perhaps with films like Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street the genre may gain popularity. I doubt it, but at least this film proves that cannibal films can be sophisticated without excessive violence and gore. While there is violence in the film, it mostly has a comedic effect and occasionally an intensifying one. It is also a great return to the horror genre for Burton, and he improves on the shortcomings he made in Sleepy Hollow. <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a daring film for Burton. He hadn't directed a musical before this film (unless one considers Corpse Bride a musical). He also hadn't directed a film where the protagonist is an anti-hero. Fortunately, Sweeney follows Burton's auteur traits. Todd is a lonely man who is disconnected from society. He resides in a realm of dimly lighted sets, and his attempts to reconcile with society are met with hostility, which further isolates him. The sets are darker colors and Gothic. There is also a scene involving a sharpened object extending from the protagonist's hand (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also has a scene like this). There are also high key lighting flashbacks to develop character back-stories. However, the ending is tragic, which is new for Burton too. <br/><br/>Burton has succeeded in creating a film which blends his quirky approach to dialog and plot succession with ideal music. The ""By the Sea"" sequence reminds me of Lydia's disinterested mannerisms in Beetlejuice. Even though Danny Elfman didn't compose the soundtrack, it is easy to envision ""The Worst Pies in London,"" ""My Friends,"" and especially ""A Little Priest,"" as Elfman songs. That isn't to say that Burton's films require Elfman's music, but his work adds an ethereal quality to Burton films. A complaint I have about the music is that Depp sounds too close to Jack Sparrow but this similarity isn't too bothersome. Helena Bonham Carter's singing voice surprised me. It sounds lower pitched it did than her role in Corpse Bride. Neither voice is memorable but the film makes up for it with superior acting. I'll not hesitate in saying that the ""By the Sea"" sequence is utterly hilarious given Depp's believable melancholy and Carter's sensationalized fixation with marrying him. <br/><br/>The characterization is thin, as in most Burton films but it is evident. Todd becomes insane in his quest for revenge, and Miss Lovett also falls into insanity with her unnatural attraction to Todd. Nevertheless, the secondary characters are not as developed as they were in earlier Burton films (Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or Ed Wood) which brings me to the only problem I have with the film: Anthony. His role in accompanying Todd to London has no explanation, nor does his interest in Johanna appear genuine. It seems as if Burton included it out of necessity to maintain the plot of the original musical. While his role is necessary in the progression of the film's plot, Anthony's character presents nothing extraordinary. Another method of Johanna's rescue would have sufficed. The other secondary characters also exhibit little change, but since the film is a musical, their lack of development isn't as impacting as it would otherwise be.<br/><br/>Burton should be praised for reviving an infrequently-explored sub-genre: the horror-musical. Another wide-release film of this sub-genre which comes to mind is Little Shop of Horrors. While Burton's film probably will not achieve the status that film has, it will still be enjoyed given the fact that it has so few competitors. A primary difference between the two is the nature of the music itself. Todd uses its music to propel its plot, while Little Shop of Horrors uses its music to satirize the plot. Both are effective, but Burton is a skilled enough director to not use multiple vocalists in the music he chose for the film. This is why so many musicals appear unconvincing. Choral tracks from the Broadway play are not present because they would remove the plausibility of the songs with regard to the serious tone of the film. It is also easier for the audience to blend the plot with the music because the actors are not trained vocalists. Todd sounds normal, so to him, singing is preferred communication, and not an unintended way of poking fun at the plot. This is most notable when Todd walks the street, unnoticed by pedestrians, while singing ""Epiphany."" This effect achieves verisimilitude in the same way that Oz's multiple vocalists achieve verisimilitude in Little Shop of Horrors. In both films, the audience can accept the music presented because both films successfully incorporate it for their respective purposes. <br/><br/>So, is Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Burton's best film? I don't think so. Ed Wood is my pick, but it is still a vastly entertaining movie which shows Burton's maturity as a director. Gone is the awkward happy ending of Sleepy Hollow. In its place is a realistic ending to a man's descent into madness. While the voice-acting is not the quality of the stage works, it is acceptable and bolstered with fantastic acting (again, see ""By the Sea""). I would recommend this film to any fan of Burton and anyone interested in musicals. It's a welcome change from Hairspray and occasionally as amusing as Little Shop of Horrors."
"brendon-kenny","8","1","2","19 May 2008"," Sweeney Todd... a Musical Horror that avoids being a horrific Musical
","<ul><li>This review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York - </li></ul><br/><br/>Tim Burton has taken the critically acclaimed Broadway and West-end Musical, sliced it, diced it, marinated it in claret, and baked it in rich black gravy to be served at a DVD retailers near you. But how does it taste? Set at the turn of the 19th century, Sweeney Todd is a tale of vengeance. 15 years after being wrongly imprisoned and shipped off to a penal colony, Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London to take his bloody revenge on the man that sent him away, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), and anybody else that gets in his way. He takes the alias Sweeney Todd, and reclaims his Fleet Street Barber Shop, which is conveniently located above Mrs.Lovett's Pie Kitchen. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) is so besotted by Barker/Todd that she overlooks his misdemeanours and helps to dispose of his victims by using them as pie filling.<br/><br/>From the crimson oozing flow of the opening credits, through the arterial sprays of Todd's cut-throat razors living up to their namesake, to the shattering skulls and crumpling corpses of victims that are catapulted off the barber's chair - Burton has set out to make this his most gory of films. The splatters of viscera are further accentuated against the black and white grubbiness of the characters and scenery. Aesthetically the film is distinctly Tim Burton, Gothic and twisted; this is the director at the top of his game. Fans will no doubt clock that the barber shop bears a striking resemblance to Edward Scissorhand's attic refuge, whilst his grimy smoke-smothered vision of London is astonishing, a nightmarish fairytale imagining that recalls the best bits of his Gotham City (Batman/Batman Returns) and his London in 'From Hell', but everything is so much more beautifully realised. The level of depth and detail in every shot, the costumes, props, and scenery are all flawless, an artistic vision that is stunning from the swooping opening shot right through to its gruesome end.<br/><br/>The same level of care and detail is applied to the pallid cast. Burton has stuck with Johnny Depp, his long term leading man, and his wife (Bonham-Carter), rather than opt for actors known for their singing credentials. In a musical where the songs are renowned for their range and complexity, this was a brave move, but one that has paid off. Depp has always served Burton well in the past, and he comes up trumps again, making Sweeney Todd truly iconic, and even doing a commendable job of the singing.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of musicals then the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is unlikely to win you over, but it's hardly the Sound of Music either  songs have been significantly trimmed down from the original theatrical versions, being used solely as a device to build character and relationships, and as a passionate extension of conversation. As such, the vocalists maintain their cockney accents, remaining faithful to their persona by building melody into their dialogue and even whilst hitting the high notes resist sounding like a 19th Century Lily Allen.<br/><br/>It's testament to how dark the film is to know that the big love song of the piece revolves around Todd's beloved razors ('My Friends') rather than the relationship he forms with Mrs.Lovett. They do share a touching duet when they settle on their Pie ingredients ('A Little Priest'), a song that forms a cannibalistic list of potential victims and the way they are likely to taste. It's the only scene where Todd softens enough to look Lovett in the eye, this is a man who is utterly consumed by his blood-lust and need for revenge. You may not like the murderous retches that they play, but it's difficult not to be captivated by their performances.<br/><br/>Thankfully the grisly content and tone is all off-set by a good level of humour throughout, Sacha Baron Cohen's (Ali-G, Borat) part as a flamboyant rival barber may be brief, but hilarious, Timothy Spall's presence as a sneering rat-faced aid to the Judge is bordering on cartoon-like, and Lovett's dream scenes of a rose-tinted future with Todd are certainly the most comical that Burton has committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>If Sweeney Todd wasn't a musical, then the plot and characters could be criticised for their simplicity for a film of this length. However, in this format, with the aesthetics and performances to back it up, it's clear that the narrative is perfectly structured, offering more intricacies than some of Burton's previous works (Sleepy Hollow for instance), and managing plenty of surprises in a tale familiar to many. It's easy to imagine Tim Burton having to be as driven and single-minded as his incarnation of Sweeney Todd, just to get this film made  as it runs the risk of being too gory for many fans of musicals, yet the musical credentials may put off fans of horror. But that's what makes Sweeney Todd so distinctive  it manages to pull off a Musical Horror Movie but avoids becoming a horrific musical. Above all, if you're a fan of Burton's work, or Depp's for that matter, then there's plenty for you to get your teeth into here. Bon Appetit!"
"jzappa","7","1","2","18 April 2008"," Thankfully Not Interchangeable With a Theater Production and Distinctly Cinematic, Atmospheric and Voyeuristic
","At this point, I feel Tim Burton has redeemed himself after Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's certainly his best movie by far in almost a decade. It has a spectacle-centeredness that is better tamed in this Burton film than his last few. And that's because it does something very surprisingly rare in movies, which is deliver truly, deeply, savagely satisfying revenge. Seeing the film being my first time experiencing the story of Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber, the film's story is a very pleasant surprise. Most bloody revenge films are anemic when it comes to the pay-off, like Carrie or The Prestige for instance. Burton does not disappoint in his handling of this material. Sweeney Todd gruesomely goes for broke. It does not hold back on the bloodletting. The blood's theatrical color in giallo style has an excitingly insatiable effect.<br/><br/>Being an adaptation of a Broadway musical, it thankfully doesn't detach me with the expected light and prancy demeanor. Its tone is very gritty, it's historical London atmosphere a masterpiece of art direction, and it does with an adaptation what I think is truly effective, which is stand on its own without the source material by making it inextricably cinematic. Dante Ferretti's Victorian London is, like his L.A. in De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a city of the consciousness, space tinted by disfigured perceptions. The musical numbers are very tightly directed, a lot of them very voyeuristic in a way that a stage production could not be.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is a very convincing one, further severing the tendency for Burton's films to have a detachment that makes them less compelling and more forgettable. He oozes dominance, a more imposing Depp than what we normally see him do. Alan Rickman matches his emboldening presence with another intriguingly infuriating villain."
"Elswet","10","1","2","16 April 2008"," Tragically Beautiful...Visceral.
","Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" encourages its viewers to lick their lips at the prospect of this work as the ideal treat, and perhaps we should. In the remaking of this story, going half way will bring nothing to the work; nothing to the world, and Burton seems to realize this, as he goes nowhere if not all the way. He not only walks up to the theoretical bell, but he rings it, unabashedly.<br/><br/>Hailed as the bloodiest musical in the history of the stage, it now becomes the bloodiest adaptation of a musical to film in history, and it isn't a joyful gambol. This is a dark telling of deeds driven by heartbreak, filled with a desperate chaos and (pardon the awful and probably often-used pun) bloody good meat pies. But fans of the work know all this from the start, and we feel endeared that Burton keeps the story close to the source; a fact which, for those hapless members of the viewing audience who have no prior exposure to this twisted historical story, promises no happy ending for our characters.<br/><br/>In all actuality, the audience receives a much better ending than a mere banal happiness could convey; no cavorting romps through fields of wildflowers for them! It receives the only ending possible because Burton does not attempt to rewrite history in his telling. Contributing along this twisted Memory Lane are beautiful darkling performances by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Ed Sanders, and Alan Rickman, with the demented silhouettes of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, and a diabolical (and slick) production style by Dante Ferretti. Each of these lovely elements comes together to allow Burton to conjure the visceral essence of a 19th century London reflected so aptly by Henry Mayhew's ""Labour and the London Poor,"" a serious influence over famous Dickensian works, which assumed the sad and often disgusting job of reporting on London's more seedy ""Cheep Side.""<br/><br/>The heart-beat of the story itself is so strong as to lend a palpable pulse to this work. The (anti-)heroes are forged of the heartbreak of life itself; its villains are made villainous by life itself, and they all waltz to the Death March played wistfully on the flute of that same life, which has forged their very beings. The acting is so poignant that it enrolls us as subscribers to this diabolical tale. And even as we gasp and cover our mouths in shock, there is the hint of a sardonic smile at the corner of our mouths, as the dark humor does not escape its target.<br/><br/>Burton lovingly creates this musical with a near lover's touch, with vocal performances which are intimately offered, softly whispered, lovingly delivered. These darkly delicious Sondheims are filled with despair paired with a desperate longing for a world untouched by the evils of man. They are plot-driven and carry the story, rather than interrupting it.<br/><br/>In reality, this film works as pseudo-history. It is not meant that we should take it as fact, but that it delivers the story without resorting to tongue-in-cheek camp. This is a completely beautiful balance; delicate and even fragrant, and Burton never fails to stop to point out its beauty in an incongruous way. This is a tragedy, in which Johnny Depp delivers a near-Biblical performance. The surprise is that instead of taking Helena Bonham Carter with him, she walks along beside him on her own tragic, but capable path.<br/><br/>All in all? I loved this work. It is darkly wonderful, and our two stars never missed a mark. This is suitable for watching on Friday/Saturday nights, but NOT by an audience any younger than 18 without fear of mandatory life-long therapy. But I love it.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Doylenf","6","1","2","11 April 2008"," Fascinating but definitely the sort of musical that is an acquired taste...
","Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B&W rather than drab color. Perhaps only the blood (of which there's plenty) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B&W, since this basically falls into the horror film category--with music.<br/><br/>Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple, except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs. Lovett, the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street. She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well. JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer--so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer. Performance wise, he's fine.<br/><br/>SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli, demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's ""Pinocchio"". ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd, as do most of the other members of the large cast.<br/><br/>ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting, and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start. All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing. Perhaps after a few more looks at the film, some of them will begin to stick.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals, although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting--even if the gushes look a bit fake. Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes, or so it seems, and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show. The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody, with rarely a glimpse of sunshine, and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes. We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning, no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined.<br/><br/>Summing up: Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best, nor is this Tim Burton's best film--but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult, very demanding roles."

"Monotreme02","7","1","2","14 February 2008"," A perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material
","The film is one of the greatest recent examples of a perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material. It is only fitting that Stephen Sondheim's dark, macabre, horrific musical be adapted to the screen by none other than Tim Burton, who if anything excels at the dark and the macabre. Although Burton's greatest cinematic preamble to Sweeney Todd is his equally dark and nearly equally gory Sleepy Hollow, incidentally also starring Johnny Depp, with its de-saturated colour palette and gloomy, shadowy, other-worldly atmosphere; the fact is that most of Burton's work belongs to a more childish, fantastical type of macabre. Most of his movies are rated PG, and although claiming to be a stranger to the genre, it's important to notice that some of these films also contain musical numbers. Although not directed by him, The Nightmare Before Christmas was a full-fledged musical, and the same goes for the similarly stop-animated Corpse Bride, this time directed by Burton himself. Even his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory contained a few musical numbers in the form of the Oompa Loompa songs, but one can truly look at Sweeney Todd as a confluence of many of Burton's previous themes and subjects, coming out in full force with guns blazing.<br/><br/>At the center of the film is Stephen Sondheim's musical work, which is so intensely complex and fantastically intricate it's even more of a wonder that it all works so well. Indeed, considering the immense complexity along with the dark, serious nature of the story and the ultimate tragedy of the tale, one can liken Sondheim's work far less to the classic Broadway musical revue and more to a full-fledged modern opera. With songs featuring multiple characters singing and overlapping one another only to occasionally synchronize to incredibly complicated note transitions, recurring themes, lines and elements throughout the entire work, recurring and winding sets of rhymes and rhythms, it is indeed an epic, complicated, majestically elaborate work that deserves credit on its own. And while Sondheim's full, 3-hour musical is more than worth a viewing (or at least a listen) in order to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the entire work, Burton's film adaptation adequately and delicately condenses the musical to make it work more as a film and less as a stage show and retains the complexity and beauty of the original musical work.<br/><br/>But this is also a Tim Burton film, and that also carries a series of characteristics and complexities unique to the director. Burton is indeed a wonder, a perfect example of a modern-day director who didn't break onto the scene through independent film but rather through the traditional studio system with which he has always managed to work with and prosper in. Burton's signature dark, macabre style comes in full force in the film in which sunlight is rarely glimpsed and the scenes are almost always drenched in a gray, de-saturated, colour-less palette  except when doused with the occasional blood splatter. Also in step with his previous works, the film retains an unreal, fantastical, otherworldly feeling to it. It is a highly stylized, darker, fantastical twist on our real-world reality, as much of Burton's films are. Frequent Burton collaborator and costume designer Colleen Atwood, along with extremely talented production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski do their utmost best to evoke the dark, macabre atmosphere the film revels in. The fantasy genre is almost cheating when it comes to costume and production design, because quite literally everything goes, but I'm sure those who work in the field get the most pleasure out of projects like Sweeney Todd in which their creative minds can truly go wild and create wondrous works evoking fantastical emotions. What's for sure is that like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton's films are unmistakable and instantly recognizable based on his unique visual style alone.<br/><br/>It is a wondrous and fulfilling experience to have your expectations met, and even exceeded. Everything was going for this film and it certainly didn't disappoint. A more than fitting addition to the Tim Burton canon, it is, on its own, a beautiful and exciting film; dramatically rewarding with its overtures of false imprisonment, evil, revenge and tragedy; its amazingly complex, operatic musical score and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim; top-notch performances from Burton's major players and a superb visual style and production value. Fans of the musical genre will rejoice to see such serious, dark, menacing subject matter getting the revue treatment  though the film knows just when to pepper itself with sly, appropriately black humour  and while those who dislike the genre may find the film's almost entirely-sung dialogue difficult to ignore, they may still find more than enough to enjoy in what is one of the most satisfying events of the year."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","5 February 2008"," How do I cut thy throat, let me count the ways
","Make no mistake about it. This movie is about cutting throats, in an entirely literal sense, in a most sordid, graphic depiction (endlessly repeating coda of razor-throat-blood). Any way you can image a throat cut, Tim Burton gives it to you. It's a little bit like how they show you the maximum number of ways you can shoot in gun in ""Shoot 'em up"" (2007).<br/><br/>There is a much bigger chance of people flocking to see this movie being Tim Burton fans than Stephen Sondheim fans. It is disappointing on both scores. In the case of Burton, partly to blame is perhaps the huge publicity this movie has received. Knowing quite well the main plot (as I am sure many in the audience do), I find the story unfolding in pretty much the same way I anticipated, lacking the little twists and sparkles that have become expected from Burton. As to the music of Sondheim, who is best known for ""A little night music"" (which I had the good fortune to see Jean Simmons perform on stage) and ""Into the wood"", the problem is in the cast being first-rate actors but not very much by way of singers.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that stands out in this movie, it's the black humour, some of which actually requires the audience to pay attention to catch. For example, landlady Mrs Lovett suggests that Sweeney Todd should perhaps kill the young sailor who volunteers to rescue his daughter, then almost in the same breath sighs how her motherly love instinct can be fulfilled if the rescued daughter is brought under her care.<br/><br/>To say that this movie is disappointing in some ways is nowhere near to saying that it is a complete write-off. In addition to the typical Burton Gothic cinematography, there is one brilliant sequence of complete contrast in ethereal landscape and images  Mrs Lovett's fantasy of a life of matrimonial bliss with Todd. The twist at the end, even if many can see it coming, is still to the movie makers' credit as it does contribute to enhancing the complexity of the characters.<br/><br/>Burton's regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter deliver as they are supposed to in the eccentric characters they portray. Sacha Baron Cohen who will be remembered by many as ""Borat"" since 2006 is such fun to watch in this movie that you hope there would be more of him. Alan Rickman plays the standard villain with his usual dependability. Depp won the Golden Globe Best Actor (comedy and mucical) award by looking grim, tragic and psychopathic. No doubt Depp is a deserving actor but I'm not sure if this is his most deserving performance."
"itsbaylis","9","1","2","27 January 2008"," I decided to write this after reading another comment
","One where someone talked about Tim Burton caving into the Hollywood thing of loads of blood and gore everywhere.<br/><br/>It immediately struck me that this person clearly had no idea of the stage musical. There HAS to be buckets of blood, that's kind of the point. It wasn't unnecessary in the same way the singing wasn't unnecessary, sure, you could have missed it out and still had the bare bones, but it just would not have been Sweeny Todd. I'm sorry this person was offended, or at least perturbed by all the blood, but it's like going to see Saving Private Ryan and complaining about the violence, or Pulp Fiction and the swearing, it's just part of it, and always has been.<br/><br/>Anyway, criticism of an ill thought out review aside, this film is brilliant. It isn't perfect, and there are small quibbles with it, but it's very very good. I was particularly impressed with the singing of all involved, and also the quality of the acting, with Timothy Spall in particular o great form as the creepy and thoroughly unpleasant Beadle Bamford. The direction was dark and slightly brooding, which one expects from Tim Burton, and worked very well with the story.<br/><br/>However, I think the most credit has to go to the source of the genius itself, Sondheim. The man wrote wonderful songs, not catchy, mark you, but brilliant. Dark, comedic, in a number of cases, and wonderfully fitting for the tale that many people insist is true but, alas, is not.<br/><br/>Oh, and Sacha Baron Cohen's suit is...indescribable.<br/><br/>To sum up, a wonderful, comedic and strictly necessary bloodbath, with wonderful songs, sung well, and surrounded by great acting."

","Oh Wow! When I first saw the trailers for Sweeney Todd, I had mixed feelings. I am a Depp fan, and although I have liked everything I've seen him in, I have avoided some of his movies for various reasons. I'm not necessarily a Tim Burton fan, but have enjoyed some of his work as well.<br/><br/>This movie drew me in a different way. I felt almost as if I HAD to see it, even though I didn't want to expose myself to the blood and gore that everyone was talking about. I went to the movie with only a skeletal knowledge of the storyline.<br/><br/>As I watched, the story and the characters really entranced me. I was surprised to look at my watch and see that 2/3 of the movie had passed with only 1 murder - and it wasn't nearly as bloody as I expected. That changed when Barker's chair became an assembly line for slit throats - with all the accompanying blood.<br/><br/>It's a very compelling story, Depp & Carter play their roles well. And Burton does a great job using Bower (as Anthony Hope) as the perfect counterpoint to the rest of what goes on in the movie.<br/><br/>My only complaint was a certain difficulty in understanding all of the lyrics of the songs given the dramatic music and the cockney accents used by the main characters. I guess I'll just have to watch it again and listen more carefully!"
"tnrcooper","9","1","2","21 January 2008"," Dark but very well done.
","I should preface my comment by noting that I had no knowledge of the basics of the musical other than that it involved a murdering barber. And boy, how he does murder. However, in reading a lot of the comments here, it seems many of the devoted fans of the musical seem not to realize that this movie was not made in their interests. Yes, it may be a little too dark, or the music is unsatisfying, or some of the performances may not match up to your expectations.....but this movie was not made for you. The vast majority of people who have seen this movie are not such devoted fans as you are. <br/><br/>Anyway, I found the movie very dark but really something of a morality tale. It is about the former Benjamin Barker who has returned to London after 15 years away, sent away by venal judge Turbin (Alan Rickman typically excellent, and at his sleazy best) on false charges. He comes back to London angry and sets up as a barber above a pie shop (run by a very good Helena Bonham Carter's pragmatically calculating Ms. Lovett). Depp is very good and delivers one of his better performances, comparable to his work in ""Ed Wood"". Bonham Carter also deserves recognition as an amoral but realistic small business owner. She knows her pies are not great but if people are willing to buy them, she will sell them. Sacha Baron Cohen is very good as a former cohort who now works in a rather seedy milieu. Timothy Spall, as in ""Secrets and Lies"", is very good as Beadle, Judge Turpin's homer. <br/><br/>The film is quite dark but is saved by its sense of humor and the dark amorality of Ms. Lovett and Sweeney's collaboration. It is very bloody and if you don't like blood, this might throw you. It is SO bloody, however, that the frequency of the appearance of blood may diminish its dramatic impact. But maybe not. Anyway, consider yourself warned. Todd is determined to get his revenge on Turpin and along the way there are many twists and turns, both in his efforts to reclaim his daughter and in his relationships with some of the key figures. <br/><br/>Burton is at his best with dark material-note his work with ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and his work on the first two Batman films. This film and Victorian London are shot in gorgeously moody black and London except for a whimsical sequence in which Ms. Lovett expresses her desires for stability with Sweeney. Cinematography is beautiful in this film and the darkness of the material is not understated. There is some material which is very dark and Burton does not shrink from it so that the dark nature of the film is not lightened at all. However, it is always leavened by the bone-dry humor which serves to remind us that...it's all just a joke.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film is a propos, I'll leave it at that. Just remember that this film is very bloody and if blood makes you a little weak in the knees, you will not want to see this film. But Burton, Depp, and Bonham Carter are really at the top of their games here."

","I have read a variety of different reviews about this film. It got decent reviews from critics, and overall decent reviews from viewers, but there have been a few scathing comments mixed in. I personally feel this movie was excellently done.<br/><br/>While Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are not the best singers out there, they make up for it with their superb acting. Depp was very good as Sweeney Todd, portraying the character with a perfect level of darkness, while managing humor several times (Pirelli's Miracle Elixir). Bonham Carter was very funny as Mrs. Lovett, but also strange and slightly desperate for Todd's love, which was great. Besides this, neither of them WAS too bad as a singer. Actually, I enjoyed Depp's singing. Bonham Carter's wasn't great, but it also wasn't painful. I think it's an ""acquired taste"". Also, Depp and Bonham Carter interacted well together on screen. Past experience together was a plus in this case.<br/><br/>The other characters (Judge Turpin, Beadle, Antony, Johanna, Toby) were also played by wonderful actors. Alan Rickman's Judge was threatening but also slightly weak for ""Pretty Women"". Timothy Spall's Beadle was sniveling, sneering, and extremely convincing. My mom even remarked that he looked like he truly belonged to the era. The younger three sides were actually the best singers in the cast. Jamie Campbell Bower has a great voice, possibly the best out of all of them. Jayne Wisener is a very pretty girl, and her voice is nice, but I think it's another ""acquired taste"". When I was watching the movie, her song ""Green Finch and Linnett Bird"" was tiresome and her voice was a little shaky. However, when I bought the soundtrack and listened to it, I found I loved her song, and it is one of my favorites. Ed Sanders was the most surprising talent in the cast. His Toby was sweet and earnest and yet scarred. I LOVE him during ""Not While I'm Around"". And I didn't even mention Sacha Baron Cohen's role as Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Two words ""Great casting."" Yes, a very good cast came together to make this movie.<br/><br/>I love the direction of the film, too. It wasn't at all choppy, very smoothly done. Great scenery. I love the way the colors were so dark, so the few colorful moments really stood out. The blood was good, just enough over-the-top so it wasn't too disgusting, but not too fake, either.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie. I would give it nine or ten stars if only the singing had been a little better. Then again, if Depp and Bonham Carter hadn't been cast, would the acting side of the movie been as good? I doubt it."
"kjewitt","9","1","2","20 January 2008"," Eyes Wide Shut for the gory bits
","I really don't like musicals, or violent films, or anything pseudo-Gothic, but I thought this was wonderful. The look of the film was sublime - nearly all black and white, just dashes of colour used with precisely-calculated economy. The music never takes over from the story - it's used to tell the story. Depp is very good, HBC is excellent - this part was made for her and I think Mrs Lovett is really a more interesting and complex character than ST himself. If HBC sang her own parts, she is also a decent singer. Everyone else(Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall) is good enough at singing to hold their own. I loved the way Old England is portrayed with such unremitting bleakness, as a place of corruption, human rights abuses and violent social conflict: ST's own story seems much more convincing (and his character more sympathetic) against this backdrop. Most of the light relief is provided by Sacha Baron-Cohen in a nice comic turn as Adolfo Pirelli.

","With an expected slightly underdeveloped storyline to keep up with the typical musical-theatrical movie guidelines, Sweeney Todd offers something more than the typical Chicago or Hairspray. The ability to capture the attention of an audience without the flashy advantages of dance numbers (Hairspray) and memorable music (Chicago) is noteworthy as Stephen Sondheim's vocally besieging score is tackled with flawless performance singing. Johnny Depp plays his expected introverted character who attempts to overcome his struggle with inner resentment. However, as the movie develops, so develops his character, bringing forth acting moments not yet seen from Depp. Helena Carter, despite the occasional under-pitched tone (which can be expected from any Sondheim score), acts the part in a way that could not be paralleled by any currently known actress. The two create a thrill ride for the audience, often times leaving a spectator at the edge of his/her seat. The sound quality was a 7/10, but the story is so simple to follow that an occasional missed word is not essential. The film emulated the creativity of Tim Burton, leaving no light un-gelled with a tinted moonlight tone, creating the perfect atmosphere for this Gothem-like town. Direction - A, Action - A+, Technical Aspects/Special Effects - A+, Storyline/Music - A+, Overall A+. 10/10. See this film."
"AdamantiumSheWolf","10","1","2","8 January 2008"," Bloody Excellent--You'll ""Lovett""!
","Having come into this film somewhat ""new blood"" (that is, fascinated by the legend as it stood, but knowing very little about the Broadway productions) I admit I may be biased towards preferring the film adaptation. But that I prefer it is not without reason, or rather, reasons, plural, which I intend to outline below. The setting, firstly was precisely as claustrophobic, as ""grim-and-gritty"" as it needed to be to convey what it was for most to live in that time and place. It made me as a viewer profoundly grateful I was merely a spectator to the horrors great and small, everyday and unexpected, of Burton's London. Oh, yes, there was more horror on view than merely that enacted in a bakeshop or a barber's chair, and viewers, I think were best able to ""get"" that sense through the staging. Besides which the countless little abuses sprinkled throughout (witness Toby in Pirelli's hands, or the imprisoned Johanna) did much to prove that this was not a happy time, and this is not *going to be* a happy film. The supporting cast was better suited than I expected, in truth. What more needs be said about the ratty little Beadle, or the slithery Judge? (Puns? Yes, but necessary ones!) Anthony read a little ""fey"" to me, but as he was not really the focus of the piece I could excuse his naiveté. (Besides which he reminded me visually of Ashton Kutcher, and *that* is its *own* kind of horror! <*shudder*>) But it is the film's two leads who truly shine. I admit I am *not* the biggest fan of the stage musical of this work, just because I found Lansbury's performance camp and grating to the point of absurdity. Bonham-Carter, by contrast, brought an effervescence and a sophistication to the role that suited both her and the part and was sorely lacking in previous adaptations. As I was saying to a friend of mine--there *is* a difference between upward-mobility-seeking lower-class and gutter trash, really there *is*! And Depp--Wow. I have no more words than that, but does his performance really require any more? He *TRULY* threw himself into this role and *infused* it with a torn, emotionally-battered *INTENSITY* (yes, ALLCAPS, it's THAT INTENSE!) that the role truly requires. The snarling and the posturing hid a broken man, and viewers were fortunate to be allowed through Depp's profoundly affecting performance to see both of those sides. Hearn (as again I wish to contrast the film with the stageplay) by contrast is blustery for the sake of it. Someone else described his acting as ""wooden,"" and to me his voice was *too* trained, ""rang"" too much as opposed to grated. (Plus, I *cannot* be intimidated by a man who reminds me so much of Fred Murtz--I just *can't*!) He had none of the same manic intensity, and was almost ""gleeful,"" but not in a way that spoke of madness. Hearn read too ""normal,"" too cheerful, and that is not who or what Sweeney Todd should be. I admit to closing my eyes to many of the throat-slittings, at least after I heard that first *sshhktt*-click-*thump* <*shudders violently*> and it is true I am no fan of violence for its own sake, nor of ""slasher films"" as they are generally perceived. However, as a necessary plot device and as an execution of vengeance, the killings read like a Greek tragedy, or like Titus Andronicus. While excessive, the violence is not ""extraneous,"" the deaths did serve a purpose. Thus, as a ""horror musical,"" this film will not suit everyone, and true some purists may be offended by omissions and changes Burton has made to a so-called ""masterwork of the American Stage."" But I personally feel as if just enough was ""shaved off"" for what is left to play out a taut, glorious, heart-wrenching, bloody revenge thriller. Appreciate it for the new, different, equally-enjoyable adaptation that it is. Some favorite moments: ""My Friends,"" ""Epiphany/A Little Priest,"" ""By the Sea"" and a good portion of the ""Final Scene"". Go, enjoy, and know you'll have a ""bloody good time""..."

","The story of Sweeney Todd is what Charles Dickens might have come up with had he used Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" as his source of inspiration. Of course, in a Dickens version, all those who found themselves on the wrong side of Todd's razor would be venal exploiters of the poor and working classes who clearly deserved the fate that befell them. In Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of the story, however, people of virtually all social categories and walks of life get tossed indiscriminately into the meat grinder, in as grim a spectacle of democratic equanimity as we've encountered in quite some time. For this is a tale of a man who allows the desire for vengeance to so completely overtake him that he quickly turns from being a righteous avenging angel seeking justice for himself and his loved ones to a maniacal serial murderer who kills for the sheer sake of killing (with a little culinary treat thrown in as a side benefit).<br/><br/>Benjamin Barker starts off as a good-natured barber living with his impossibly sweet wife and brand new baby daughter in 19th Century London. When a corrupt judge who has designs on Barker's wife throws the young man into prison on false charges, Barker transforms into a gloomy and bitter man, determined to exact his revenge on the individual who ruined his life, drove his wife to suicide and has made Barker's now-teenaged daughter an object of his unwanted, lascivious advances. On his arrival back in London once again a free man, Barker changes his name to Sweeney Todd and resumes business in the barber shop located above Mrs. Lovett's thoroughly unhygienic meat pie emporium where the cockroaches barely outnumber the raisins in the recipe. Eventually, the two entrepreneurs hit upon a scheme to systematically slice the throats of Todd's customers, then add the bodily remains to Mrs. Lovett's list of secret culinary ingredients.<br/><br/>With ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" director Tim Burton has finally found the material he was born to make. Dark as well as surrealistic, morbid as well as operatic, ""Sweeney Todd"" perfectly fits the Tim Burton style and temperament, and, indeed, the filmmaker has taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the property, allowing his imagination to run wild in the areas of art direction, set decoration, costume design and makeup. Yet, while this is a beautifully crafted film from a technical standpoint, Burton never allows the visuals to overshadow the storyline or the characters.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd"" is clearly not intended for all audiences. It is certainly a different kind of musical, pitch-dark and violent and with no real choreography to speak of. And any hopes for a sentimental, happily-ever-after resolution are washed away by the sanguinary nature of the scenario and a closing shot that is literally a tableaux steeped in blood. Yet, there is one element that makes it all connect with audiences, and that is Johnny Depp's performance. Depp could not have found a role more perfectly suited to his demeanor and talents than that of Sweeney Todd. Never before has his brooding intensity and expression of wild-eyed mania been used to more impressive effect than it is here. He makes a character whom it is often very hard to like into a person the audience can feel for and care about, no small feat in light of the many reprehensible actions he performs on screen. Depp also does a more-than-adequate job with Sondheim's challenging tunes, especially given the actor's clearly limited range as a singer.<br/><br/>Depp gets strong support from Helena Bonham Carter as his pasty-faced, death-hued partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett, while Sasha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman bring subtle shadings to their otherwise hiss-able villains."
"LittleMunchkin","9","1","2","7 January 2008"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again!
","In their sixth collaboration together, Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have continued to excel in their respective talents; directing and acting in odd stories that not many people can really easily put together.<br/><br/>Depp stars in this movie as Sweeney Todd, a man returning to London with revenge on his mind. He befriends Mrs. Lovett, played by the lovely Helena Bonham Carter, who makes ""the worst pies in London."" Mrs. Lovett informs Todd about what happened to his wife and daughter, and Todd decides to kill Judge Tupin, who caused the mess in the first place. While waiting for the judge, Todd murders clients, who then get baked into Mrs. Lovett's pies, and they become the sensation of London.<br/><br/>Burton uses his dark style again, and the setting of 19th century London is a perfect place for his dark pallet. The amount of blood used in the film caught me off guard at first, but it was so unreal that it made it bearable. Any realistic blood probably would have made the film more of a useless horror movie, rather than the great musical it was. Depp's gruff singing fit the tragic character that Todd is, and Bonham Carter did excellent singing as well. Overall, it was a great movie."
"Moviefanatic21","9","1","2","7 January 2008"," A Well Done and Exciting Film
","Just about everything, from the look of the movie to the actors' singing voices, is paid meticulous attention to. The result is a film both visually stunning and musically spectacular.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's style of directing shines through, and I believe that he is the only one who could bring such a potentially disturbing plot to life in a film. His Sweeney Todd is set in a very dark and dirty London, with equally dark and dirty characters. The protagonist is Sweeney Todd (previously known as Benjamin Barker), who is played powerfully by Johnny Depp. Though he does not sound like an operatic or Broadway singer, his voice has a rough edge to it that allows the audience to both feel Sweeney's rage and still enjoy his singing. His expressions, which show various shades of anger and depression are both tragic and humorous at times.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, who is hopelessly in love with Todd. While her voice is not the greatest in the film, Carter makes up for it with excellent acting. Alan Rickman plays Judge Turpin in a deliciously sinister way, and he literally sends chills up the spine. His character ruins Todd's family, and as a result he is the center for Todd's plans of revenge.<br/><br/>The film is mostly in black and white sepia type tones, with splashes of color every now and then (such as the character Signor Pirelli, played hilariously by Sacha Baron Cohen). It is very fast paced, so the audience member is never bored and feels as if he/she moves with the story to its conclusion. The blood (and there are buckets of it), appears often and absolutely gushes. To some, this may appear unnecessary, but I felt that it added an extra element of horror to the film, and even looked artistic at times.<br/><br/>One criticism that I have of it is the distance I felt from the subplot of Anthony and Johanna. These two young lovers are the innocence much needed in such a dark film, however I felt somewhat removed from their story. But this does not detract very much from the film, and their voices are superb. Another innocent character is Toby, played well by Ed Sanders, who also has an amazing voice.<br/><br/>It should be mentioned that the film is not for everyone. If blood makes you queasy and your eyes tend to roll when characters sing, this is not the film for you. Overall, however, I thought it was a fantastic film that should not be missed"
"rmilljunk","7","1","2","6 January 2008"," Shocking
","When I saw the original poster of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, before I knew it was Johnny Depp or Tim Burton, I thought to myself, ""I have no idea what it is but, hey, it looks interesting."" Finally I saw a trailer and I realized that it was Johnny Depp as a murderous barber and then I thought to myself, ""Wow, freaky. But still interesting"" and then Depp opened his mouth and started singing whilst wielding a sharp razor...my friend and I immediately busted out laughing in the theatre.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I like musicals, I thoroughly enjoy them. Nonetheless, that was a shock I didn't expect. I can't say that I anticipated this movie more than I anticipated say...Lord of the Rings perhaps, but I was definitely excited to see how this movie did.<br/><br/>As far is acting is concerned I expected a lot from Johnny Depp (there's no reason why I shouldn't) and for the most part, he met my expectations. I hear people constantly talking about how Helena Bonham Carter deserves an Oscar for her performance in this movie but I fail to see it. The movie is a dark and gray and her face is gray, and her voice is monotone through and through. So except for ONE sequence whenever she was on screen she sort of blended in with the environment and I faded out.<br/><br/>Music is obviously a big factor in musicals and while the music in Sweeney Todd wasn't necessarily bad, it wasn't very strong and that's big hit in a musical. Johnny Depp talk-sings through most of the movie; fans of the original on-stage musical disliked that because the original man who played Sweeney had a very operatic voice, but I liked it I personally thought it fit the character. There's a young boy in the movie, I forget his name, but he amazed me! When he started singing I was so shocked, I didn't know a little boy that size could possibly have vocal cords that strong. Also, the song between Sweeney and the Judge ""Pretty Women"" is one of my favorites and I thought it was well done. But save that one song, no songs TRULY excited me, rang in my head, or really stuck out.<br/><br/>Cinematography and directing was astounding as expected with Tim Burton. The dark tones and splashes of red have been used before but he pulled it off with flair. There's a song in this movie and during that sequence the cinematography changes to dreamy scenery with very bright colors that contrast with Depp's and Carter's pale Halloween-like faces. It's possibly my favorite part of the whole movie, that entire sequence is fantastic! <br/><br/>You can bet on seeing a bloody movie when you see this film. Bloody is actually an understatement, try the bloodiest movie I've ever seen. It's filled with sliced necks, crushing skulls, and grinding bodies and it's honestly nauseating. Some say that it's just necessary for the movie, and while they're mostly right I still believe certain things were unnecessary and could have been toned down.<br/><br/>One redeeming quality is the theme of the movie which is actually the main theme of the original musical which Tim Burton kept perfectly intact. That theme is: revenge is evil and it will consume and destroy everything including yourself. Still...after seeing the movie there were a couple scenes that I could have definitely been just fine without seeing entirely! Tim Burton and Johnny Depp actually made a mistake in my opinion, they made Sweeney Todd way too ""attractive"". His slicing executions eventually became so stylized, so choreographed, and so graceful that you almost anticipate his next killing RATHER than trying to yell out, ""Stop the madness!"" which is the whole point of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, enticing, thought provoking, and well made but there is still one problem. The ending left me feeling hollow (much like the characters themselves). I won't tell you the ending, but I'll tell you this: when I walk out of a movie I want to feel entertained...not drained. But then again, maybe that's what Burton intended."

","this movie was definitely in my top five for the year. it seemed like everything that needed to be done to make this a good film was done. i didn't not like a single moment in this entire movie I'm a huge Tim Burton fan. if i had to choose a favorite director it would have to be him and i would have to say that this is my favorite film that he has done. his ideas are brilliant and he truly has made a masterpiece out of this film.<br/><br/>Of course, when people like Tim Burton, the same people generally like Johny depp, and he did an excellent job in this movie. Sweeney Todd was not his best role to show off how good of an actor he is, but he played it perfectly. there just isn't enough emotion in the character itself to turn it into an actor's best role. i thought that depp did as good of a job as he could though to make it perfect.<br/><br/>Helena barnham carter also was fantastic. i thought that she should definitely be in the running for supporting actress. her character, Mrs. lovett, was a lot more complex than anyone else in the story and i think that she really stepped up to the plate to make this one of her best roles.<br/><br/>the story overall was incredible. a musical about a murderous barber who's girlfriend uses the body's to make pie?! and somehow it works. this movie is definitely not for the squeamish. i loved the violence. there was more blood in one murder scene than in most movies all together. the thing that really made me love this movie though was the music. i don't like musicals. plain and simple, but this is for sure an exception. the singing was very good all around, but the orchestra was incredible. the music was used so well throughout the different scenes i was in awe.<br/><br/>if you miss out on this movie i really feel bad for you. see it on the big screen wile you still can. worth every penny."

","Returning from a long time at sea Sweeney Todd returns to London looking for the family that was taken from him. When he finds his wife dead and daughter the ward of the Judge that framed him he plots revenge with the aid of Mrs Lovett, his landlady and the owner of a shop that sells meat pies.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's adaption of the Stephen Sondheim Musical is a ghoulish tour de force. This is a largely sung story that has been given the grand treatment by Burton and his crew. Coming on the heels of a very stripped down version that recently played Broadway where the actors played all the instruments and the whole story seemed to be being performed by inmates in a single room asylum, this is a big huge production where we are in all of the streets and back alleys of London. This is a throw back in size and scale to the musicals of old. The wide scale opening up of the play works wonders so that when we close in to Sweeney's and Mrs Lovett's small rooms we feel how trapped they are by circumstance and poverty. As a technical achievement the film is a masterpiece and one of the best things that Tim Burton has put together.<br/><br/>The cast is a mixed bag. Everyone is good but some people are better than others, with Helena Bonham Carter probably the weakest vocally as Mrs Lovett. Her physical performance is quite good, but vocally she can be quite shrill.Johnnie Depp is wonderful as Todd, but its clear that as good an actor and singer he is he couldn't do this on stage (I know one should not compare stage and screen but with this show its hard not to). The one person who amazed me was Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli a rival to Todd. He is pretty much note perfect in his performance.<br/><br/>If I have any real qualms with the film its the source material. I am not a Sondheim fan. I do like this musical, owing no doubt to ts ghoulish nature, but I've never loved. There are simply things in the show that didn't work for me on stage so didn't work for me here either. Even though I'm not fully enraptured of the films source, the film is certainly worth seeing, Though be warned the film is VERY bloody. The reason the film is rated R is because of the blood that is spilled.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for me and my reservations 8 out of 10 for everyone else"
"cattonine","9","1","2","6 January 2008"," Sit, sit you down, sit - and Attend The Tale...
","I've been obsessed with this musical for a few years now, and except for a couple of very minor quibbles, I was not disappointed. Tim Burton's visual style was an excellent complement to the story, and I absolutely loved the entire look of this film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter - while not possessing voices that would work in a stage version of the show - completely captured their characters, and their vocals had that conversational quality that Sondheim's lyrics demand. The entire cast, actually, sounded great - I was particularly impressed by Sacha Baron-Cohen and Alan Rickman. I did miss some of the music that was cut - but in all fairness, certain theatrical conventions wouldn't work as well on screen. I feel that the roles of Anthony, Johanna, and the Beggar Woman suffered the most from the cuts.<br/><br/>Spoilers coming...I'm about to get a bit more specific...<br/><br/>The connection between Anthony and Johanna seemed a bit rushed in the film, whereas it's more developed in the full stage version. And - this may be a little harder for me to judge; I was trying to see it with the freshest eyes possible - I'm not sure that there was quite enough of an ""A-ha!"" moment for the audience BEFORE the Beggar Woman is killed. We see a glimpse of her face, and I'm sure some realized it - whereas on stage, there are many musical cues and the staging is generally an anvil-sized clue - but I think the audience definitely needs to realize who she is BEFORE Sweeney does, not at the same time. I just think it's much more tragic and horrifying if we have that revelation - just a glimpse of hope that he'll truly see her...but then he's been so devoured by his own desire for revenge, that he's blind to everything else, and by the time he realizes what he's done, it's too late.<br/><br/>I wanted to hear ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" sung at the end - but why did I want to hear it? The final tableau is chilling, beautiful, tragic, and so quietly unsettling...in a stage performance the Herrmann-esquire strings come in, and the characters step out and address the audience to deliver the final moral. And it is a reminder - and a relief - that we've just seen a play. We don't get that reprieve here - and it was absolutely the right decision. Would that more films leave us wishing for just a few more minutes at the end."
"progresslandusa","7","1","2","2 January 2008"," Liked it despite Tim Burtons influence
","The source material (the original Broadway show) is so strong, that this still ranks high for me, despite Tim Burton's almost infallible ability to overpower any other influence in his films. The title really should be ""Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd"". Once again we are treated to a world that is ridiculously monochrome (with a few exceptions), not in an artful way, just in a monotonous way. The cartoonish way that Burton exaggerates his films is a real detriment to this one. The underlying story and themes are so so powerfully written, so well planned, but the emotional impact is almost always undermined by the fact that from the beginning we are conditioned to realize that this is all some sort of Gothic doodle from Burton's sketchbook. I don't mind a dark, dirty, vermin infested London, but in this film it was artificial and detracted from my investing in the characters. Ironic considering that the Broadway show obviously connects with the audience with much less in the way of budget, sets, etc... But all Burton's flash reminded me was that this is a director who loves to do his thing, and gets so wrapped up in his style and ideas, that he doesn't seem to step back and evaluate what effect it has on anything else.<br/><br/>Casting for example: The singing parts of Sweeney Todd and the Judge are both written for very deep voices (not a music major, forgive me), and their duets are just awesome when sung by those deep voices. But Tim Burton has to cast his favorite star, Johnny Depp, despite not being the type or having the voice. Nonetheless Johnny did a fine job (not great but fine), though he did play it a bit too introverted for my taste. There are some moments from the original soundtrack where for all his deep brooding, Sweeney Todd just breaks down, either shouting or crying and it's very very emotional. You are reminded that (spoiler here) this starts out as a story about a good man who has had his family taken from him. In these emotional moments, Depp's Sweeney just kind of mumbles to himself. There's almost no outward display of emotion except when he's killing someone. It would seem to suggest that for Burton (or Depp?) this story is really just about the violence. I would say Alan Rickman did the best job of the three leads, though writing wise, I would have liked them to show more of his lust for Joanna, and conversely Sweeney's real desire to get her back. Helena Bonham Carter was a far worse casting choice in my opinion. Again, she's doesn't fit the type and rather than playing Mrs. Lovett with the energy that the ultra fast lyrics suggest and require, she seems to be half falling asleep most of the time. In fact, as it's always been played, she's supposed to be the more twisted of the operation- Sweeney is out for revenge, but it's a revenge that the audience has seen the motivation for. Lovett is his accomplice, but really perpetuates most of the action. Carter throws some surprise and shock in there, which seems out of place, since it's so fleeting. Angela Lansbury played Lovett on Broadway, and any discomfort she showed was more about Sweeney's impetuousness, his impatience. She didn't have a problem with anything he did, only that she preferred to do things right and didn't want either of them caught.<br/><br/>Overall, my complaints come down to some creative choices made by the director and the actors, and of course who's going to agree with 100% of those? The script was very faithful to the Show, making only minor edits of songs and adding some dialog to make sure all the relevant info was there. I do wish the opening ballad was used, just cause it sets the story up so well and really has such cool lyrics."

I knew it was dark and a movie about a killer...but that was the extent of my knowledge. I was more than pleasantly surprised! Johnny Depp has a haunting voice and he makes Todd his own...as he does with every character he portrays. At first, I will admit, I felt like Jack Sparrow was cast as Todd...however that was all lost when I got sucked into the passion and terror that Burton and Depp brought to this film. Of course I couldn't forget the amazing performance from the soon-to-be Mrs. Burton - Ms. Helena Bohnam Carter. She was creepy, yet beautiful as Mrs. Lovett and did the role perfect justice! The whole ensemble complete with Baron Cohen and Rickman along with the very talented cast of youngsters completed this masterpiece of stage-to-cinema. Burton has done it again...and proves once again...that he is among the elite Hollywood directors of the last twenty years. Now that Scorsese has his Oscar...maybe it's time for the Academy to give Mr. Burton his dues."
"crawlfan-1","8","1","2","28 December 2007"," A near masterpiece of musical film
","Originally, I was going to give this movie a rating of 6/10, rather than 9, but a lot of things have made me reconsider. For one, the sets and visuals in this movie are downright amazing, and showed Tim Burton for the genius of cinema that he truly is.<br/><br/>However, I was going to give it a 6/10 for a few reasons. As an example, they removed my favorite song from the stage-play (""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd""), and the casting seems much like a 12 year old would arrange. Like Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd; he has a dark appeal to him and a sort of sinister voice when it comes to singing, but it seems that he was cast mainly because of how big of a name he is in Hollywood. Then there's the casting of Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall of the Harry Potter franchise. Showing that the both of them were cast in the same movie shows that Tim Burton wanted the same kind of feel of Professor Snape and Peter Pettigrew. Regardless of that, Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall pull off their roles much better than I had ever expected (As a matter of fact, Timothy Spall has become my favorite actor to play the role of the Beadle in the history of Sweeney Todd, and I regret he didn't have more opportunities to sing).<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter didn't quite live up to expectations, though. As a singer, she's pretty good. As an actress, she's great. But a great musical actress? No, not quite. Lovett is a character of comic relief, and you simply fall in love with her as the play progresses, but you don't in the movie. I kept feeling like I had to picture Patti LuPone in her place as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely well-crafted, as only Tim Burton could do. The blood seems a bit cheap and added-in, but the mood of the film is dark and, yes, somewhat frightening if you let it sink in as you watch it.<br/><br/>All in all, despite a few casting errors and how they cut out all the comedic wonders of ""A Little Priest"" and ""The Worst Pies in London"", there's so much in this movie that compensates for it, such as how it's the darkest adaptation of Sweeney Todd I've seen in my life, musical or not.<br/><br/>If you're squeamish, please avoid this movie.

I saw it three times last year on Broadway with Micheal Cerveris and Patti LuPone. Needless to say, Johnny had very big shoes to fill. His acting was wonderful - as was the entire cast's - and the overall quality of the production - sets, direction etc. - was flawless. The singing in the movie was less than stellar but the music covered well for the end notes that neither Johnny nor Ms. Carter could carry.<br/><br/>Some of the songs were cut or trimmed from the original score but they were not horribly missed with the possible exception of ""Kiss Me,"" which is important for establishing the relationship between Joanna and Anthony.<br/><br/>I especially loved the ""Joanna"" reprise sequence where Sweeney built his chair and they showed him offing many of his clients. Genius!<br/><br/>A truly delightful surprise!"
"musicofthenight123","10","1","2","28 December 2007"," I loved this movie!!!!!
","I saw Sweeney Todd in New York last summer with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone, so I knew the story and music. I'm a huge musical fan as well as a Johnny Depp fan, so ever since this movie was announced I was excited for it. I saw it opening night and I LOVED it!!!!! <br/><br/>The music is beautiful; the orchestra is amazing. I didn't know Johnny Depp could sing like that! The entire cast was great, nothing disappointed me at all. Definitely Tim Burton's best film so far. I've seen all of his other films and they're all great, but this one rises above them all.<br/><br/>Go see it! You won't be disappointed. Very moving, very powerful, simply beautiful!"
"mbaggesen","8","1","2","27 December 2007"," Tim Burton does Classical Greek Tragedy Musical
","This is the very good film and musical. But it is very bloody (and NOT a family film - It is ""R"" for a good reason. Keep the kids at home with a sitter for this film). If I had to see this film again, I would probably do so. The noir quality of Tim Burton's film is similar to elements from other movies he has directed.<br/><br/>I am convinced that Johnny Depp can truly do anything after seeing him in this role. The tone of his singing voice is excellent, as were the other performers. No spoilers here; just be prepared for the gore and no happy ending.<br/><br/>If I had any criticism at all, it would be that the advertising trailers do not clearly show it is a musical and I thought the movie ended a bit abruptly."
"shanfan_14","10","1","2","27 December 2007"," Expected much, got more
","Who else could play the roles that Depp has? The true actor--the chameleon--is so rare. Depp, Oldman, Norton...few others. People think ""actor"" equals the much-attended-to Clooney, Damon, Pitt, but what is their range, really? Could they become the Libertine one minute and Wonka the chocolatier the next? Never.<br/><br/>This was wonderful. Despite the warnings of excessive gore, I honestly didn't find that distraction in abundance. Yes, many people bit it, but those in mid-reverie, so to speak, didn't have time to bleed before they were slalomed off to the basement.<br/><br/>Normally, I don't seek out violence, but this wasn't gratuitous. It showed the decline of a good man into indifferent amorality, the meanwhile entertaining us with some humor, some pathos, and some darn good singing.<br/><br/>I loved the atmosphere because it was completely appropriate, here. Occasionally, I think Burton's a bit too dark (does he know what a comb looks like? Do any of his characters? Just asking...). Loved the way the sea of folk passed around Sweeney as he sang and then the scene returned to the loft.<br/><br/>Having not seen the play nor knowing much about it save the rudiments, I was totally taken aback by the ending.<br/><br/>Amazing work from everyone."

","This is like ""Saw: The Musical"".<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong -- I'm not squeamish.

Couldn't wait to see this movie.<br/><br/>Started to chuckle at ""The Worst Pies in London"" (which is a very funny song) -- but the laughter dried up when we were shown close-ups of cockroaches. Lots and lots of cockroaches scampering across Mrs. Lovett's filthy countertop. Too realistic.<br/><br/>Dark humor has to be done with a very deft hand. You can't show the murders too clearly. Yet Tim Burton shows us EVERY slit throat, arterial blood pumping and gushing all over the place. Then down the trapdoor it goes and SLAM! lands on its head. He shows this again and again and again....<br/><br/>Well, nobody felt like laughing after that.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is gloomy and glowering throughout. Not a good showcase for him. If you love Johnny Depp -- well, go rent a ""Pirates"" movie instead.<br/><br/>This is a very non-fun and depressing movie. And I think popcorn sales will be down.

"heszyfilm","2","21","156","12 December 2007"," Too Bloody
","I'm not against blood and violence in and of itself, but the amount of blood and the overly-long visual of the first kill in this movie were much more than necessary to contribute to the story. Gratuitous blood and violence is just disturbing and gory, and takes away from the movie. I had to look away several times. And I've had no problem with such movies as 'Saving Private Ryan,' with its considerable amount of death and dismemberment. Leaving detail and length of a killing to the imagination can be much more scary and conducive to setting a mood or developing a character, without just grossing out the audience. At the end of the movie during the screening I saw, the audience was just silent; probably in shock at the level of gore.<br/><br/>And this was unfortunate since the acting and singing were otherwise quite good, but instead of appreciating these positive aspects, I keep thinking about the gore. Lowering the blood level by 80% would probably have increased by vote to a 7 or 8."
"neil-488","1","2","7","5 November 2018"," Simple review for those who are and are not familiar with the Musical
","For those who are not familiar with the musical this movie is based on and wrote bad reviews of the story, get a clue. Listen to the musical. It is one of Stephen Sondheim's most brilliant works. This musical is like Gilbert and Sullivan brought into the present. If you are unfamiliar with Gilbert and Sullivan, get another clue and find a production of one of their brilliant musicals.<br/><br/>For those who are familiar with the musical Sweeney Todd, this is a movie is a disaster. There is very little in this movie to commend itself. A number of musical pieces are left out, some of the songs pivotal to the story. One of the Sondheim signatures is the imbroglio; counterpoint blending of two, three or four or more singers. These were left out and it leaves me to wonder if the producers thought that more than two would might be too much for the audience. If this was the case, then they should never had made the film in the first place.<br/><br/>The singing talent of the crew is pathetic. Burton likes to use Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter in many of his films, as he did in this one. This was a time when he should have found other talent. I know Johnny Depp can sing, but his performance and singing was vapid and the direction of him was a travesty. Helen Bonham Carter's performance was also vapid and she can't sing to save her life. A poor choice since singing is a prerequisite for this movie. The only bright spot in this film and cast was Sacha Baron Cohen and his song was cut in half. Not enough to justify the movie. Alan Rickman is good with a nice baritone voice, but leaving out Judge Turpin's Mea Culpa really lessens the overall performance.<br/><br/>After watching this film, it makes me wonder why Tim Burton made it. It lacks any of Tim Burton's genius. It makes me wonder if he did this by choice or was, somehow, made to do this. If he did it by choice, then the overwhelming question that rises in my mind is, why?"
"Oroncz","4","2","7","10 March 2008"," Tim Burton, the brush and the camera
","That was the first time I heard about Sweeney Todd, I loved it, the story and characters are beautiful and interesting and the heart of the story is important to tell.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is one of those directors you go to the cinema because of his name, but why is that exactly? Yes, he is a brilliant artist, illustrator and imaginative, but he just can't translate it well enough for motion pictures for my opinion.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a play, and it looks like it was shot live while the play was running, Tim Burton didn't put one effort in thinking how the camera should tell the story and that is a very important part in movie making to me. It is just not enough that Mr. Burton is good with the brush, and though he is good with it, he ceased to surprise me in his movies because artistically they all look the same, especially the opening sequences.<br/><br/>So in the end, I enjoyed the story of Sweeney, the acting of the unmatchable Johnny Depp, Alan Ricman and Helena Bonham Carter and I liked the soundtrack too, but I realized there would be no difference watching the play since the movie didn't provide MOVIE materials.<br/><br/>Shimeck scale - unsatisfying"
"pink_Nigel","3","2","7","27 January 2008"," The pieces don't fit together.
","For the record, I must first state that I am very keen on Tim Burton's work, I am very much of the opinion that prior to ""Sweeney Todd"" he hadn't made a film any less than thoroughly entertaining and worthy of repeated viewings. Not so this time.<br/><br/>I have a number of problems with this movie. The most obvious flaw here being that as a musical it should have a cast capable of singing. Nope, not a one of them can hold a tune. There's also the problem that Johnny Depp has forgotten he's not doing Jack Sparrow any more, and similarly Alan Rickman is still doing Severus Snape (though to be fair, the Todd/ Sparrow similarities aren't as obvious as the Ed Wood/Willy Wonka parallels, and Alan Rickman does do ""frustrated"" very well) - never mind the fact that Sacha Baron Cohen has only ever done one character.<br/><br/>As to the pieces not fitting together, Tim Burton has made a movie that looks exactly like a Tim Burton movie, all dark and almost monochromatic (save for the blood and Sacha baron Cohen's garish attire), and bolted roughly onto that is a brass-heavy score which just doesn't fit with the visuals. Why not use a similar technique to ""..Chocolate Factory"" of taking existing lyrics and fitting to a more suitable (yes, OK, I admit it, Danny Elfman-written) score? Well, except that for the most part the lyrics are trite and fail to sufficiently advance the plot...<br/><br/>So all in all, a movie that looks fabulous (except for the grating green screen sequence. Yes, green screen to give characters different lighting effects to each other and the background worked very nicely in ""..Chocolate Factory"", here it sticks out like an extremely sore thumb.) but is let down by pretty much every other element. The first Tim Burton movie that I shall not be watching again."
"moutonbear25","7","2","7","25 December 2007"," Weeny Sweeney
","When the ensemble harmonizes the unsettling baritone with the glass-shattering soprano parts of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" at the opening of the stage production, SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET, the tone is not only announced but adamantly affirmed. You are in store for a truly bizarre tale that is the epitome of madness and you are being introduced to man burnt by an unjust system, robbed of everything and everyone that ever meant anything to him, who has now returned for his due vengeance and has brought with him a very unhealthy bloodlust. It would seem that there could be no one better suited to translate this haunting story to film than master of the dark and champion of the disenfranchised, director, Tim Burton. Burton begins by hastily deciding to skip the ballad and go straight to what he knows best. Bright red blood drips down walls and slips between the gears of a giant meat grinder, Stephen Sondheim's potently explosive score driving everything forward. But just as the ballad foretells on stage of unbelievable vocal histrionics to come and amaze, Burton's decision to remove it in favour of score and visual gore confirms that he will be relying on what he knows in fear of the daunting music he has failed to grasp.<br/><br/>For a director who has built his entire reputation on his creative visual style, it is genuinely surprising to watch SWEENEY TODD unfold in such an unimaginative fashion. It does not seem so at first. In fact, it is quite a twisted treat to dive in to the cobblestone streets of yesterday's London, tainted blue and gray by cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, to a saturation point that makes the patrons appear as though they are just waiting, if not begging, for their dull lives to end. Who can blame them really? The light of day rarely seems to rise on London as it is constantly shrouded in heavy cloud. And while the camera hints at the scope of London by weaving from the picturesque rooftops to a dizzying maze of streets, it quickly ceases to a halt on one particular street corner, home to Todd's barbershop. Despite having so much room to move, Burton traps us here and allows the claustrophobia to set in. This is a fine way to make people uncomfortable but it also makes for some rather limited musical staging. Burton rushes through the musical numbers by slicing lines out (unfortunately some of the more hilarious ones) so that he can get to the action because he knows that their stunted staging slows the pace. Subsequently, he leaves us with nothing more than a bloody mess on the floor. <br/><br/>Further proving the unimportance of technical mastery in this musical is Burton's decision (with the perplexing blessing of Sondheim himself) to cast untrained singers in the demanding leads. The character of Sweeney Todd requires a voice so powerful and fierce that it resonates fear through the bodies of all who hear it. Johnny Depp surprises with how well he can handle the material but his capable performance never ignites the passion of a mad man. Meanwhile, Todd's counterpart in scheming evil, Mrs. Lovett, a woman so conniving and desperate that she will say or do anything to make sure her man is content and by her side, is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a woman whose voice is so weak that she is barely capable of communicating any of the colour in the character. Each actor carries the same drab expression on their face throughout the film as though they are bored or just completely unsure of themselves. They each have their moments but neither successfully demonstrates the depths of their treachery or the heights of their dark wit. As they watch each step, careful to avoid each other's toes, Burton guides their performances into characters with soulless shells that barely frighten each other, let alone the audience.<br/><br/>In his first (and hopefully last) musical outing, Burton breaks a golden musical rule. The musical numbers should never be rushed. That's why we're there Â– to appreciate the beauty of Sondheim's layered and dense masterpiece. Only that isn't why Burton is there. Clearly, Todd's penchant for slashing throats is what most fascinated the man at the helm of this horror story. And while the blood gushing out and splattering against the camera and the walls is both disgusting and exhilarating at the same time, it amounts to very little more than gorgeous torture porn. Who knew that SWEENEY TODD would be so maniacal that even the insane genius of Tim Burton could not fully comprehend the man himself?"
"zarembazwoman","Null","3","13","21 December 2007"," Miscasting
","This film is badly miscast. Helena Bonham Carter is too young to play Mrs. Lovett and Johnny Depp is too young to play Todd. Actually, Alan Rickman should be playing Todd and someone like Jane Lapotaire should be playing Mrs. Lovett. I can't believe that nobody seems to know the least bit about the original Broaday musical, in which Angela Lansbury played Lovett (later also played by Patti Lupone) and Len Cariou was Sweeney Todd. I suppose casting younger actors is supposed to be some way to pull in what the studios consider a saleable demographic or some other idiotic thing. This is a brilliant musical, one of the best Sondheim ever wrote, and miscasting like this makes me sick.<br/><br/>I thought Bonham Carter was completely wrong for the Harry Potter movie, too. But then, the casting for those films NEVER matches up with either the author's descriptions or my imaginings."

The violence in the movie is done so poorly because it is all done sequentially without build up and is pointless. The singing was awful and the only reason this movie is being praised is because Burton, Depp, and it being a musical.

","You know what makes a movie or a book great? When you can just float ""into the zone"" and not be aware of your surroundings anymore, you're just ""there"". I think you know what I mean. You're not an observer of the movie, you're in the movie, when it's really great. The text of a book is not read, it's happening in front of you in your mind.<br/><br/>You know what's not great about musicals? It's perfectly IMPOSSIBLE to get into any zone or get any flow. Even Disney for crying out loud finally understood what a totally destroying element it is to have musicals as a part of the plot in a movie. Moulin Rouge for example is just fine, because then the musicals are part of the plot, the plot is not acted through the musicals. Key Lines and scenes are not acted through singing. HUGE difference. <br/><br/>Smack, you get a knuckle sandwich in your face, because it gets so incredibly obvious that those people aren't characters, they are just actors singing about their made up feelings, in front of a side-scene. A sad man with a broken heart doesn't start dancing a tap dance, or starts up in a great vocal chorus with an orchestra cooperating with him in the background. <br/><br/>Newsflash: the orchestra in a movie is just there for helping the audience enhance the feelings, the characters are not supposed to themselves actually hear the music. Guess what, I only endured with the actors singing ""We will rock you"" in A Knight's Tale (which was a mediocre movie) because they: 1)only did it once 2)made fun of the whole ridiculous musical thing. Even when it was a musical scene making fun of musicals, I cringed, because they too stepped over the line by doing it. Don't make fun of musicals in movies, just ignore them, please.<br/><br/>Fictitious scene from Saving Private Ryan, musical version where you can rape any rules you normally have in films: Cptn Miller, singing: ""Storm the beach men!"" Private, singing: ""What? We can't hear you, the background orchestra is too loud!"" Musicals... Jesus. You get what I mean? What a joke genre. What a joke movie. I really like Tim Burton, I really do. What a waste of talent. I loved Edward Scissorhands, where your actors actually shut up and don't sing right out about their inner thoughts.<br/><br/>Stop encouraging him making this crap, so he thinks this is what he should do. Tell him this musical crap sucks, so he can go back to making actual movies in his own style.<br/><br/>You like musicals, you like Mamma Mia, or whatever, fine, I won't judge you. But stay in Broadway, stay in theaters. Let musicals be what they are on their own. Leave the frigging movie genre alone, because you are to movies what rap is to music. You think you're making music, but in reality, you can't sing."
"alexhornbye3","5","2","8","11 February 2008"," A cut below....
","It is fair to say that I have been waiting for a cinematic interpretation of this most brutal and glorious of musicals for the majority of my life. For nigh on thirty years I have been enthralled by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's marvelous vision and have often wondered why it had yet to be tackled in a film version, especially in recent years when the musical film has had a resurgence and renovation. It was with some excitement and also some reservation, then, when I discovered that (hooray!) a film version was in the works and (Hmmm... oh dear) that it would be directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I have no particular loathing for either director or actor and in the past they have produced some amazing work. However, for me Burton's star is in the descendant, having not appreciated his last three live actioners and perhaps thinking he has run out of vision. Depp is a contemporary icon; a compelling and interesting actor not afraid to mix Hollywood dash with the smaller and more thoughtful. But their pairing on this project threw too many negatives up for me before I had even seen the film that have unfortunately borne relevance now that I have.<br/><br/>Firstly, and vitally, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are miscast. I had my reservations over their age when they were announced and I just feel they are simply wrong for the time-line of the story. Depp looks no different in age from his 15 year incarceration except for some mad hair and a bit of pancake. ""No doubt the years have changed me..."" he reasons when finally confronted with the ruiner of his existence, Judge Turpin, but, no, they haven't actually.<br/><br/>Bonham Carter despite protesting her ""limited wind"" looks positively sprightly.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman is a good choice for the evil Judge, yet while all around him are fashioned as caricatures he looks like he is from a different film, with Vidal Sassoon fly-a-way hair and ruddy complexion. You never really get the sense that this is a depraved, nasty, vindictive man with a loose morality using the law to his own seedy, lascivious advantage.<br/><br/>Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen are decent in much reduced roles.<br/><br/>The newcomers fare better; Jamie Campbell Bower makes a fine, naive (yet somehow ambiguously sexual) Antony, and Jayne Wisener is sweet as Johanna.<br/><br/>Ed Sanders is too ""stage school"" and suffers the same as the leads by being too young. Toby is an outcast, a simpleton - the village idiot, if you will - not simply ""a young boy"".<br/><br/>In a reduced role Laura Michelle Kelly is underused.<br/><br/>Secondly, the direction. Tim Burton has hidden a musical in here somewhere, but you'll be hard pressed to find it. His direction and the editing leave you in no doubt that The Suits have told him to downplay it. There is no sense that Burton appreciates his source material or is even familiar with it and it becomes a film with some singing. There is no choreography between the musical pieces and the action, by which I don't mean full-out dancing (although, why not?) but at least some correlation between the score and the ensuing action. There were so may missed directorial moments, I found myself sighing audibly during potentially fantastic set pieces that never materialised. ""A Little Priest"" is the turning point for the whole production; the ""point of no return"" for the characters as Mrs Lovett devises a suitable means for disposal of Sweeney's victims. Burton shows the characters looking through their window. Thrilling! ""Seems an awful waste.."" she sings. I couldn't help but agree...<br/><br/>The singing is mediocre to say the least and most of it doesn't work. I don't care whether they can hit the notes or not, no-one is expecting Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras, but Depp and Bonham Carter fail to inject any character into their songs - their voices wet and weedy in turn. Depp goes from gruff pseudo-ominous spoken lines to singing like a novice choirboy, and Bonham Carter sounds barely interested. The transposing of Pirelli's numbers to suit Baron Cohen's lower range miss the whole point of the character completely. He's supposed to be a funny tenor. On the plus side, Jayne Wisener sings ""Green Finch..."" beautifully.<br/><br/>Also on the positive, the film looks gorgeous and 18th C London has been beautifully rendered. The condensation of the book works well and keeps the essence of the story, but it's almost as if they took too much out, whereas some judicious editing and better pacing could have fleshed the musical out more and given a sense of urgency and drama that the film as a whole sadly lacks."
"venimusrex","4","2","8","2 January 2008"," The Count of Johnny Cristo
","Let me begin by saying that I've never written a review before now. I was compelled to do so for this movie because I simply can't understand why it has such a high rating. Did no one else notice that this is a goth knock-off of The Count of Monte Cristo? Alright, so the mise-en-scene is great. It's got a classic Burton look and feel. But beyond the visuals of the film, it falls flat. While I enjoy the concept and dark humor of what the characters do, there's little to actually like about any of them. One could say the same of Daniel Day-Lewis' latest role in There Will Be Blood, but his characterization is so masterfully and undeniably inspired that the performance is none-the-less mesmerizing and enjoyable to watch. Whereas in Sweeney Todd, the usually charming Depp basically mopes about whenever he's not slitting throats. Sure, he looks great as always, but his choices are rather predictable. I can picture any number of actors playing this role simply by slapping some makeup, a wig, and leather boots on them. Even the sympathetic characters fail to conjure much emotion beyond annoyance. The worst character of all however is the music. (Unfortunate, seeing as this is a musical.) The score itself is enjoyable, but the lyrics are cheesy and dreadful. It's hard to care much for a song about bad pies. ""I Feel You Johanna"" sounds like something by John Cougar Mellencamp. The hooks in ""Pretty Women"" and ""Not While I'm Around"" are heavily reminiscent of several tunes from Willy Wonka (which has a good 7 years on Sondheim's musical.) Thinking back now, I did like the ending, but I was too far removed at that point to even appreciate it. All in all, this is just another movie musical that fails to achieve the magic of a live theater experience."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","8","22 December 2007"," Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street is based upon the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler. The film is set in a very poor, dirty and dark London, England where a man named Benjamin Barker is introduced to us. We find out that he once was a happy barber married to a beautiful wife and had a new baby daughter till all this was taken away from him by a corrupt judge named Judge Turpin who sentences Benjamin to jail for 15 years, so he can end up having his wife. The 15 years have passed and Benjamin is out of prison and now goes under the name Sweeney Todd. He then meets a woman named Mrs. Lovett who lets him stay in her upstairs room above her pie shop. Sweeney has plans for revenge against the judge and the town, so he starts up his barbershop business again only to lure clients in and then slit their throats. To dispose of the bodies he decides along with Mrs. Lovett to make them into meat pies and sell them. Sure enough the pies become a hit. Meanwhile, Sweeney wants his daughter back from Judge Turpin and with a young man who is in love with her they plan a way to get her back and Sweeney also plans to take on his revenge for the Judge and continue to keep the bodies piling high. All this of course is set to musical numbers which are sung by the main characters of the cast. I first found out about the stage play musical of Sweeney Todd in my high school drama class when a teacher was telling us the general plot about it and from that moment on the story intrigued me and having always had a love of musicals it was definitely a musical I wanted to see. Thankfully, I have now seen Tim Burton's adaptation of the musical for the screen and I was very impressed. The film's set, costumes and makeup all give the film the bleak and depressing look it needs while really setting the mood for the film and playing as a backdrop to the story. The story itself is full of catchy and well done songs and it is also filled with morbid humour, lots of blood, dead bodies and one of the most interesting, original and wickedly entertaining plots to come along in awhile. Morbid and dark films have also appealed to me probably because my love of the different and the strange and as I mentioned earlier I have also enjoyed musicals, so all the ingredients (no pun intended) were here for me to completely enjoy this film and I did. The film was completely unpredictable from start to finish and I had no idea in which the direction of the story was going, but by the end of the film I was very satisfied with how the film ended and played out. The original, dark and plain out genius story was further enhanced by great acting, music and a lot of style and mood created by the backdrops and Tim Burton's wonderful eye of the macabre and the visually beautiful yet disturbing imagery. The film plays out like any classic musical you can think of, only it's rare you get one this violent or gruesome. However that just added to my enjoyment of the film because the darker and more wild this film got the more my interest grew and it kept my attention for the duration of it's length. If you like horror movies and happen to not mind musicals then this will definitely be a film for you. For musical lovers who do not like horror or the macabre then you best look elsewhere, but for people who appreciate both you will have a downright good time with this film. Definitely one of the year's best."

","Director Tim Burton's latest, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" an adaptation of the hit 1979 Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim, ranks as yet another imaginative working from the man behind the camera of ""Beetlejuice"" (1988), the first two ""Batman"" movies, ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), and ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999). ""Sweeney Todd"" has many marvelous sights and sounds, and a production design that's Burton's best and most imaginative since ""Batman"" (1989). In Britain in the 19th century, the story concerns Benjamin Parker a.k.a. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, perfectly pale-faced), a barber who was once convicted on trumped-up charges and sent to prison and tortured for 15 years by the hard-nosed Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and has now returned to avenge himself. He later involves his lowly neighbor, the baker Mrs. Lovett (Mrs. Tim Burton Helena Bonham Carter, equally pale-faced), in his bloody scheme to exact vengeance. Of course, she is no angel herself, since she is something of a loon. And later on the in the story, is in fact revealed to be something of a cannibal, serving the cooked corpses of Britain's lowliest to unsuspecting customers as a way of disposing of Todd's victims. A young boy named Toby (Ed Sanders) also takes up residence with Todd and Mrs. Lovett, and becomes an unwitting accomplice in their bloody scheme. It's safe to say that even with the plentiful musical numbers and weirdo acting styles, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" doesn't mess around. Blood flows copiously in over half a dozen graphic throat-cuttings that are surely going to put a drain on Hollywood's blood-pellet supply. Although I'm not really that big a fan of his work, leading this sure-fire cast of course is Johnny Depp, a brilliantly skilled performer who does indeed project his voice nicely and thoroughly for the audience, even though his performance does contain shades of ye old Cpt. Jack Sparrow. We've never quite seen Depp like this, as a would-be Psycho-type slasher whose thirst for revenge extends far beyond his target, and into the brutal aristocratic society that keeps working-class people like him and Mrs. Lovett in almost constant poverty. This is Burton's second most marvelous-looking film to date. His production design invokes a strong sense of the time and brings back memories of his earlier ""Batman"" movies. I could say that ""Sweeney Todd"" is better-looking than those films, but I'd be lying to myself; I'd never be able to top my love of Burton's ""Batman."" But then, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" wouldn't be so bloody magnificent, now would it?<br/><br/>10/10"

","As one of my favorite musicals, I was looking forward to finally seeing ST on the big screen. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the movie fell flat for me. The music and direction were top-notch, but in the end it all falls on the title character -- in essence, Johnny Depp is no Sweeney Todd. With not much of a singing voice (he song-spoke many of his numbers), I kept thinking he was Jack Sparrow as a barber. Not much range for the man, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest abonimation is the omission of the title track for the show!!! Yes... the song ""Tale of Sweeney Todd"" is not in ""Sweeney Todd""! How would you like to see ""The Sound of Music"" without the title track???

The fact that this is anywhere near, never mind in, the top 250 movies of ALL TIME is an absolute scandal. <br/><br/>With it's 18 certificate and ludicrously high rating it can only point to the need to tighten restrictions to prevent love struck teenage girls from getting into unsuitable movies. Sure Johnny looks great in mascara but can that really justify an 8.3 rating to those of us over 15?<br/><br/>Let's not hear any talk about depth. This was based on a Broadway musical. The cinematography was fantastic and brooding but watching the 95 minutes of the movie felt like i was transported back to the Victorian age and was forced to live through the intervening 150 odd years just to get out of the theatre.<br/><br/>If anyone invents a time machine I'd like to propose that those who think like me chip in to send Tim Burton back to Victorian London.

"Overboard89","4","2","9","12 January 2008"," Overrated
","This movie was well made, the acting was good, and it exceeded my expectations. However, Sweeney Todd still is a pathetic excuse for a musical. Stephen Sondheim is a spectacular lyricist, but almost every tune in the show seriously lacks a melody. While the words of ""Have a Little Priest"" are remarkably witty, it is almost impossible to recall its melody after the show has concluded.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd was dark and filled with gore. It has a plot that lacks in substance - a demon barber slits throats and gives the bodies to a lady who cooks them into pies. The actors were not singers, but I give them credit for their wonderful attempt at singing Sondheim's complex tunes (not that anyone would notice if they were to sing them incorrectly).<br/><br/>If you like Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, or Stephen Sondheim, then I'm sure I can't change your mind. However, it is my opinion that this and all other Sondheim musicals are vastly overrated. This movie ignored any dark humor that was present in the stage play and took itself too seriously. Tim Burton makes interesting movies, but I would prefer the musical for obvious reasons. Neither the musical nor the movie is ""incredible,"" however, so I'd advise seeing the movie because it's cheaper. Save your money to see a real musical such as Phantom or Wicked."

","If you're expecting to see a richly stylish, surrealistically Gothic, uniquely artistic imagery and sets that distinguishes Tim Burton think again. There is about two minutes of such imagery and besides that the majority of the movie is gray, bland, lifeless, shot primarily in one room and uninteresting to look at. Not the Tim Burton spectacle you would expect.<br/><br/>For a very simple plot line the story still managed to be chaotic without a flow or structure. . Despite the erratic way the story was told it moved at a snails pace due to drawn out musical numbers. You may zone out as you mindlessly stare at the drawn-out singing that fails to thrust the story forward. The music is classic but subjectively enjoyable. It may appear to some, to be water-down, overly dramatic, and drawn out. Most of the movie is singing.<br/><br/>Kudos goes to the costumes, makeup and casting (Todd Sweeney's girlfriend, his daughter, and her young suitor) which brought some of Burton's unique artistry to being."

","I still can't figure out why this movie didn't strike a chord with me (sorry, horrid pun). I'm not much of a musicals fan, so maybe it's me, not the movie. Tim Burton's direction was spot on and he captured (or imagined) mid-19th century London perfectly. Depp is a great singer and the role was almost written for him. Helena Bonham Carter was fine (but not as good as Depp). Sasha Baron Cohen absolutely stole the two scenes he was in and he can sing pretty well, too. Scenery/decoration/technicals were all amazing.<br/><br/>So, where did it go wrong? That's a very good question. The music wasn't very good.

","I've never seen a director so horribly miss the entire point of the work that they're adapting. The beautiful Sondheim score, which is one of the greatest musical scores of all time, is destroyed. Most of the score is completely gone and the little music that it left is massacred by incompetent singing.<br/><br/>I don't mind the violence. Sweeney Todd should be violent, however, Burton doesn't seem to realize that the musical IS A COMEDY. It's a pitch black English comedy. The humor is gone, replaced by lame, goth, whispering. Depp is wrong for the role in every aspect. He looks wrong and his singing is wrong. Sweeney is supposed to be a large, scary man, with a deep, dark voice. HBC is also wrong for Lovett. Lovett, a role originated by the incredible Angela Lansbury, is supposed to be a funny, neurotic, warm, yet scary woman. Helena isn't any of this. In fact, her only acting choice seems to be to whisper. Her singing is also awful. Alan Rickman is perfect as Judge Turpin, though and is the film's only redeeming quality.<br/><br/>The film is also very ugly.

"the_only_warrior","4","1","3","10 September 2012"," There were MUCH better Sweeneys already released on DVD!
","I admit I had seen Sweeney Todd before, but I am yet to see it on stage. I saw the George Hearn/Patty Lapone filmed concert version (which has no set or props) and it was much more engrossing than this version.<br/><br/>When I heard about the movie, I was very excited to see it complete, but ultimately disappointed.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know - Sweeney Todd is a man falsely imprisoned (transported to Australia) by a judge who covets Sweeney's wife. When Sweeney finally escapes and returns after many years, he discovers his wife is dead and that the judge is indirectly responsible. Enraged, he plots to cold-bloodedly kill the judge - who, like everyone else, fails to recognize who he is after his long stint in prison. There is a LOT more to the plot, but technically any more would be a spoiler.<br/><br/>The movie creates a really good atmosphere at the beginning, but Sweeney's costume and hair really got to me right from the get-go. He is all of a sudden not a real person who blends into society, but some sort of weird freak. Like all of Tim Burton's heroes I dare-say.<br/><br/>Also, like Phantom (and I dare say Les Miserables will suffer the same fate) Sweeney, which is more of an opera than a musical, suffers from the lack of real singing.<br/><br/>People ask why this is a problem since this is a film with good actors? Singing affects the acting - the words come from singing and that is where the acting comes from. If people are struggling to just sing the music (if they are not musicians, or if their voices don't have the right range to sing the notes comfortably) there is going to be no emotion in the words, and that is what has happened with Sweeney. <br/><br/>I mean just compare the quality of this to Grease for example!<br/><br/>I would completely overlook that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter look a little bit too young for their roles, but they are saying really heavy stuff without emotion, really funny stuff without humor, because they are struggling with the music... pure and simple. And it's hard stuff to sing!<br/><br/>And because the whole movie is rather still (It is a real actors piece, not a song and dance musical), there is nothing else that they can do otherwise make up for it. So they look wrong... check! ... can't sing ... check! ... and they can't act the role properly ... check. They are miscast.<br/><br/>To be fair, all the acting falls flat, despite having some of my favourite actors involved. That said - I wonder how much Tim Burton is to blame as well for this! Even the smaller cast of unknowns (where they didn't need big names) aren't great either as actors or singers - but if they were, then they would certainly have upstaged the Hollywood stars. <br/><br/>Honestly, it's boring. I tried watching it more than once and my reaction hasn't changed. If I didn't know how good the musical was already, it may have put me off.<br/><br/>I can't speak for the Angela Lansbury film version from 1984 (which does have George Hearn and rave reviews), but I highly recommend the concert version. It still works on TV and will keep you watching for the full three hours (yes... even without the cuts!) <br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300536/"

","For one time Tim had a decent story with great twists, a amazing cast (with flavor of Potterverse & his only production where the pairing of Depp & Bonhamn isn't boring!) and an inspiring setting. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is killed by the score. I remember that Sondheim was excellent in ""Dick Tracy"" but here he falls miserably: no cues, no themes, not even poetic lyrics. It reminds me of Allen's musical ""Everyone says I love you"" where fine actors sang horrible songs! Thus, the entire movie was like a tour in a Russian wheel: fun when it's was speeched and very tedious when the songs came in. They completely stalled and blow up the narrative. <br/><br/>This huge failure from Sondheim is all the more seen in comparison to any other Gothic musical (see Loyd Webber's ""phantom of opera"") and of course Danny and his amazing and eternal work on ""Nightmare""!"

Sweeney Todd has one of my favorite scores and, quite frankly, some of the most incredible characters I've encountered in ages.<br/><br/>But Burton's version of the already twisted Sweeney Todd turns it into something more convoluted and awkward than the creepy subtlety of the original stage version.<br/><br/>In Burton's version, Anthony is changed from a normal boy who has good intentions into a stalker. Mrs. Lovett is changed from a plump, grandmotherly, caring woman who happens to make meat pies out of people to a madwoman who has an obsession with Mr. Todd. And Sweeney himself is transformed from a man who one could pass on the street without a second glance to a pale-faced growling man with red eyeliner and a white streak in his hair.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the computer-generated blood was far too much. Like I said before, subtlety and dark comedy was Sweeney's crown, but this movie has literally hacked that to pieces."

Everybody loves pie, isn't that so? There's no morale besides vengeance. Or perhaps payback by selling human flesh to the starving masses that have ignored you for too long. Sasha Baron Cohen as the con-artist con (ha!) barber is the perfect illustration of the movie's tone: comic, but woah, what a bastard. He's only in second place to the wannabe love interest feeding Gin to a kid. Or selling questionable meat pies, for that matter. Not to mention copious amounts of blood and murder and one-liners that will make you wonder whether your brains have been dislodged or, at the very least, whether Logan had just lost the love of his life or something when writing the lyrics.<br/><br/>Hells, this movie is dark.

Or weighted him or her down with cement blocks and thrown into the Thames? Certainly not your everyday film. Not a feel-good-movie. Pretty pictures, great music, fabulous direction and acting, but  Sorry, I still can't get over the absolute lack of optimism or pick-me-ups. Hells, the deaths aren't even satisfying in a ""Die Hard"" or ""Macbeth"" way. People die. Graphically, and with no purpose whatsoever apart from, well: Depp likes the colour of blood.

"dwpollar","4","1","3","30 March 2009"," Twisted and morbid dark-comedy musical...
","1st watched 3/26/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Tim Burton): Twisted and morbid dark-comedy musical about a barber, played by Johnny Depp, who's taken away from his family by an un-just judge. He changes his name and decides to have vengeance against this judge, somehow  someway! His vengeful ways get twisted about half-way thru in the movie after he opens a shop above a meat-pie baker, played by Helena Bonham Carter, and he starts taking out anyone that comes to his shop, The baker then starts profiting from his extra meat, if you know what I mean. This movie was a valiant effort by Tim Burton to try and bring to the screen this sad and demented musical. Depp is good as usual but he can't redeem the story and the character that he had to play. At first, he appears justified in his actions, but he kind of goes off the deep end. This is where the movie lost it's appeal, in my opinion. Burton probably didn't want to stray from the story but something should have been done to make us care a little more for the character. There is a side story about Todd's daughter, who is held prisoner by her step-father, played by Alan Rickman, and is adored by Todd's friend to the point of wanting to rescue her. As you can tell the real story here though is Todd's attempt to reconcile with his family but it's not really pursued very well and instead it's about him slicing as many necks as possible to benefit the baker below. Too much gruesomeness and not enough soul-searching. The songs are fine and the film looks good but again the story can't redeem the overall movie experience."

It's the good ones that have set the bar for the bad ones. I will say tho, that if this wasn't a musical, I might have liked Burton's take on the this story a bit better.<br/><br/>Where do I start? How about the horrendous vocals. I'm so tired of Hollywood thinking anyone can sing. Most certainly not Helena Bonham Carter. None of the actors, and I mean none, would have gotten a part in the theater version of this. Some could argue that Johnny Depp can sing but I doubt he'd make it to the top ten of American Idol. I really kept comparing the vocals to the Angela Lansbury stage version of the production. Neither Depp nor Carter even compare to the original stage recording. I guess it pays to sleep with the director.<br/><br/>There was nothing animated about this movie and the characters were as dead as what was cooking in their meat pies. I don't know that anyone should have their name next to Director because there's no directing going on in the movie, NADA. There is hardly any movement during the songs, it's almost awkwardly weird.<br/><br/>I hate when directors have this ""anything goes"" attitude. I've always had an open mind about Tim Burton, but him dishing out this version of Sweeney Todd and expecting anyone to enjoy it is like wrapping s**t in a bag and selling it to us for $10.50. Anyone who enjoys this movie may have little to no experience with musicals."

Thank you.), I even made my parents take me to see an in-the-round Broadway production when I was in high school that was quite awesome. But the movie, really, is far too pretty and sanitized--it just isn't grim enough. ""Sweeney Todd"" is like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as written by Charles Dickens. Not a Cure video. I feel this is largely because Depp & Bonham-Carter were both too young and pretty and sympathetic. Like that whole at-the-sea-quence that seemed to be mostly devoted to getting her dolled up in Gothic Lolita drag. (I mean, she looks fabulous. I love the tatty Victorian outfits. But Mrs. Lovett can not wear a smoky eye and a push-up bra!) And they eliminated my favorite number, where the villain flogs himself while singing hymns and ogling his lovely ward through the peephole.<br/><br/>All I could think was this: ""Dammit, if they'd gotten Tom Waits and Marianne Faithful, this would be the greatest film in history."" Think of it. Marianne's half-""screw you,"" half-rueful ""Worst Pies in London"" (And, on her, the smudged mascara and the hoisted tits would work.) matched only by the chilling glory that would be Waits' ""Epiphany"" number. (Depp was good and all, but I know Waits' ""Care for a shave?"" would make the blood freeze in your veins. Remember his ace performance as Renfield in the otherwise kinda excruciating ""Dracula?""). And, oh, their cannibalism duet would be so gravelly and witty and perfectly paced. I can see and hear it all so clearly in my mind and, thus, this version--while nice and all--frustrates me even more.

But I decided to hold out until my beloved Sacha Baron Cohen showed up (I'm a big fan of the guy), just to see him, and then the plot started to kick in, and slowly but surely I found myself having to admit I was being entertained (apart from Cohen's appearance, the mid-movie song about the various professions was another high point).

","Although some have tried to argue that he was an actual person, it seems likely that the story of a throat-cutting barber Sweeney Todd arose first as an urban myth that was developed into an 1846 story titled THE STRING OF PEARLS by writer Thomas Prest. A year later the story was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.<br/><br/>In the 1970s composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim adapted a version of the story to the musical stage. SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept every award available, box office fell short of expectation and the show ended with a run of 557 performances. Fortunately for us all, however, it has endured--first on the stage, then in concert, and now appearing as a film by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>The story, of course, is famous. Barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London after having been falsely imprisoned many years ago. When he seeks his family he is told his wife is dead, his daughter Joanna (Jayne Wisener) a prisoner of the lecherous judge (Alan Rickman) who sentenced him. Mad for revenge and criminally twisted, Barker takes the name Sweeney Todd and is soon slitting throats right and left--first by necessity but ultimately for the pleasure of it. He soon associates with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who finds a handy way of disposing of the bodies: she bakes them into meat pies and soon has a thriving business.<br/><br/>Given his penchant for the Gothic, Burton would seem the perfect choice to helm a film version--and does so beautifully, especially in terms of design. This is the underbelly of Victorian, fog-shrouded London, rendered in dark tones with the occasional splash of red blood. The art design is nothing short of brilliant; the cinematography is all that you could wish. At the same time, however, there is something very slightly amiss: although it has its own fascination, the film simply isn't as funny as it should be. It is hard to say precisely why this is so, but it seems to me that the cause is two-fold: it lacks the satirical edge of the original and it has a slightly obvious quality. Instead of being innovative, SWEENEY TODD is simply Tim Burton as we already know him, and none of it comes as a surprise.<br/><br/>The DVD release is quite handsome, with a huge number of extras and bonuses that are sure to please. Recommended, and sure to find status as a cult classic.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

But the devious Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) has eyes for his beautiful wife Lucy. And so, one day, Turpin orders Barker arrested, framing him for a crime he did not commit, and sends him away. Turpin tries to woo Lucy, but as we learn, she does not accept his advances, and he soon performs a treacherous act on her, driving her to poison herself. He takes Barker and Lucy's young daughter Johanna as his ward.<br/><br/>Then, years later, Barker returns, discovered at sea, after having presumably escaped his hellish imprisonment. Saved by a young sailer, he takes on the alias of ""Sweeney Todd"", and returns to London to take his revenge. He soon meets Mrs. Lovett, whom has started a less-than-sanitary pie emporium in the same building his shop once stood. Once she realizes who he is, she quickly takes a liking to him, and joins his cause. And together, they will take sweet vengeance on Turpin.<br/><br/>And so is the plot of ""Sweeney Todd."" But what would any review of this film be without mention of the beautiful musical numbers that occupy the film? The music is simply spectacular. And while Depp's portrayal of the character may differ from past actors, he makes the character something more. In every line he sings, you can feel a seething anger and sadness. He doesn't simply belt out lyrics, he almost oozes them at times, making the music and singing seem as natural as talking. Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Mrs. Lovett, also does a rather well-done job, giving her character a little silliness and serious all at once, almost like a giddy girl with a crush... which he character almost is. Alan Rickman, whose singing is limited, does a good job, supplying some genuine darkness... and yet, some sympathy as well at times. The other actors, including Timothy Spall (as the grotesque Beadle Bamford), Sacha Baron Cohen (as Pirelli) and Jamie Campbell Bower (as Anthony, the sailer who discovers Todd) all deliver amazing performances, as well as any others I have not mentioned.<br/><br/>And now, of Tim Burton's direction. I have always been a fan of his, since I first saw his take of the first two ""Batman"" films when I was a child. His other works have influenced me in various ways, and I feel he is one of the best visual storytellers out there today. He uses this to his advantage in ""Sweeney Todd"" in spades. The films at times feels like a living art gallery, soaked with a dark beauty that words cannot describe. I suppose you could call this ""classic Burton."" But then again, that could be taken wrongly. Of his films that I have seen, this feels almost like the most mature. Some have criticized Burton for falling into the somewhat-infamous ""style over substance"" category in the past, but I think with this film, he balances the story and visuals with a cunning and masterful hand that many filmmakers couldn't. After all, this film is a musical (based on Sondheim's classic), and can't be handled like just any film. But at the same time, it could be tempting to be carried away, and Burton steers clear of this. Honestly... I feel Burton is talented enough that he could film a piece of celery sitting on an ottoman for 90 minutes, and it would be spectacular to watch.<br/><br/>And so, here is to ""Sweeney Todd"", an amazing piece of cinematic art that must be seen, heard and felt to be believed. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates heart, soul and film.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"spudmonkeysteve","9","1","3","6 April 2008"," Tim Burton at his darkest
","Tim Burton has outdone himself here, this film groans with the hallmarks of this visually eloquent director who is not afraid to push the envelope. Sweeney Todd takes Burton's distinctive and unashamedly individual style and blends it seamlessly with Stephen Sondheim's chilling score to create something truly unique. Burton effectively washes all colour from the screen giving the appearance of utter bleakness to the streets of London to the extent that when the blood starts to flow it is even more shocking because its rich, vibrant crimson brightens up its desolate surroundings. Burton really manages to capture a brutal elegance and beauty that compliments the contradictory nature of a musical about a murderous barber. Depp is extremely well suited to the role of Sweeney Todd, perfectly embodying this tortured and damaged character. He attacks the role with a snarl on his face and a growl in his voice and provides surprisingly good vocals for his songs, though I can't help feeling that his accent is rather too close to the voice he used for Jack Sparrow. This is a small criticism, however, of an otherwise outstanding turn from Depp. The rest of the cast are perfectly matched with their roles and there is not a weak link in the entire movie so my recommendation is watch, enjoy and, above all, sing along because there's no place like London."
"christian_gil88","8","1","3","2 April 2008"," Depp is a 'cut' above the rest ....
","From the very beginning of this film you are drawn inexorably into a world of shadows, of hate, of revenge and injustice. The photography is appropriately dark and menacing (Gotham City is, by comparison, positively cheery!) The two principal characters are taken by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Both are excellent, although arguably a little too young for their roles. Alan Rickman, glorious to watch as ever, is the evil Judge Turpin. Perhaps the real surprise for many is that they all sing  well, too! Depp plays the title role of a brooding, introverted and embittered man who, being cheated initially of the revenge he seeks on one man (Turpin) is more than willing to hit out at the entire world, with the connivance of Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter). Depp accentuates the quiet introvert bit so his outbursts of rage are all the more effective, when they come. The rest of the cast are admirable. 14 year old Ed Sanders takes the role of Toby. Perhaps younger than usually cast in this role (he has three important numbers to sing, including the hit 'Not while I'm around') - he's just perfect for the part. Timothy Spall once more plays a grimy, unpleasant character (The Beadle is very unpleasant!) to great effect. Sacha Baron Cohen, perhaps best known for his 'Borat' character, is fine as the fake Italian hairdresser, who tries to blackmail Todd, thereby becoming the first to receive 'a very close shave'! Whilst in no way displacing the two televised versions (on DVD) of the stage musical (one from 1982 with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, the other a concert performance in 2001, with Patti Lupone and George Hearn) this is a magnificent movie. Sondheim's score is somewhat abbreviated (the opening chorus is omitted altogether) and the blood and gore is perhaps a little too generously applied, but Director Tim Burton is clearly in his element here. This is not a 'musical' in the generally accepted sense  it is a 'music drama' or musical thriller  and very thrilling it is, too. I've seen it twice  and I shall look forward to seeing it again  a fine piece of work."
"yatest","6","1","3","30 March 2008"," Should be called ""Swee To""
","Burton's film probably should have been called ""Swee To"" since he left out about half of the songs/music. His choice of songs to delete or truncate does not seem inspired--leaving out ""Ah Miss"" arguably one of the best songs/arrangements in all musical theater. And Depp and Carter should have killed off Ed Sanders, the kid who plays Toby--the kid has got real Broadway pipes and serious acting chops--he makes the rest of cast look pretty mediocre. Sander's apparently thought he was in a serious musical. Burton, Depp and Carter were making Edward Scissorhands with music. Depp and Carter look, or rather sound like they were channeling Liz Taylor (A Little Night Music) for their musical inspiration--not off-key but just a little thin and reedy compared to Sanders."

","Probably the only musical i have enjoyed. Depp and Carter make the movie alive, i also enjoyed Rickman's performance. Tim Burton has outdone himself, and made a fascinating movie, that has been in development for 25 years. I think if Depp had not singed himself, then the movie would not have been this amazing. Johnny Depp an Helena Bonham Carter, also the other characters were splendid,and i hope to see them in more musicals or movies, which have some singing in it. Probably the only part i did not enjoy, was when Sweeney was killed, but the entire message of this movie was clear and very enjoyable<br/><br/>I recommend this film without a doubt to anyone!"
"andrewgobel","10","1","3","18 March 2008"," Sweeney Todd: Razor Sharp
","I'm sure I will receive all kinds of crap for the perfect ten rating, but let me give you a bit of my preferential background. I just turned 20, but I can remember catching creepy Edward Scissorhands while channel surfing as a little guy. I recall renting Sleepy Hollow to watch on Halloween when that was released on DVD. Despite my age, one of my favorite pastimes after a long day is watching cartoons, and Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride always seem to be at the top of that crooked Tim-Burtonesque DVD pile. Watching movies is one of my favorite pastimes and Burton as a writer and/or director always shows me what I'd love to see, but couldn't have imagined myself. <br/><br/>That said, Sweeney Todd is my favorite of his films to date, and thus, one of my favorite films period. I adore music, and the adapted soundtrack is eerily melodic with every dark twist on the Broadway score. I have only seen Internet clips of the musical but I swear this music is genius on both the orchestral and vocal fronts. Speaking of which, Johnny Depp's voice was impressive, distinct and impassioned, albeit unpolished. If a viewer can't catch important dialog and character development amidst the lyrics of the songs, they won't like this movie as much as me. Some viewers would love this movie after a second watch and a second listen. Every lyric and every note is consistent with its mood in the scene and its meaning in the story. If I was acquainted with any blind people, I would definitely recommend this movie to them. I don't mean this as a joke. I just mean it's extremely complete, aurally.<br/><br/>The second enjoyment this movie delivered in spades for me was visual. The makeup, the costumes, the sets, the lighting, the props, and above all, I think, the cast are all very pleasing on the eye. If you think I'm just listing random qualities of a motion picture, make note of these things when you watch again. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street doesn't leave me wanting to see more. They're all there, and they're all fine-tuned. I love it.<br/><br/>But as it boils down, you like the story or you don't. You like the actors and actresses or you don't. You like the music or you find it cheesy or annoying. Steer clear if you are bothered by bloody violence! Because of my personal preferences in movies, however, this one was a 10 on all fronts. I am not familiar with any of the legends this character was inspired by, nor the Broadway musical his story was based on, but nobody could have demonized Sweeney like Depp. I expect people will either love or hate this movie. <br/><br/>If you think I'm being bombastic in this review, I want you to know it was hard for me to put a 10/10 before the critics of the IMDb, and I want them to know why. I actually loved this movie that much."
"VivaLaGloria18","10","1","3","26 February 2008"," A Beautiful and tragic tale, well worth seeing!
","I and my sister have been devoted fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for years. For their amazing talent and skill in the film industry. We went to see this film expecting a masterpiece and we got much more. It's a beautiful story that takes you through a Gothic adventure in the Tim Burton style we have all grown to love. The characters are charming and delightful, The music is captivating and dark with a tint of morbid happiness. In the same Tim Burton spirit of 'Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Corpse Bride' and 'Charlie and the chocolate factory', the film is dark with a happy tinge and with a wonderful and true undertone of how revenge can take over a person.<br/><br/>Benjermin Barker is a man who was cheated out of his happy life and returns as the vengeful and murderous Sweeney Todd bent on killing all those involved in his downfall. In the beginning you can sympathize and understand where he's coming from. As the film progresses he becomes obsessed with killing and is more then willing to kill anyone and anything that proves a threat to him and his plan. you are still able to sympathize through the whole movie because in everyone there lurks a Sweeney that wants revenge on those who wronged them.<br/><br/>The violence in this is so stylized and artistic it's not gory or unsettling. It's done in a way that is entertaining.<br/><br/>The directing as you would expect from Tim Burton is wonderful. The dark and the Gothic set is just beautiful and breath taking. Costume design is also wonderful. Cinematography is so amazing, to amazing for words really.<br/><br/>In my opinion anyone 13 and over can see this film. My 10 year old sister went to see it with me though she didn't see any of the murders. I'm 15.<br/><br/>I'm not a fangirl if any are interested in knowing i think Johnny Depp is talented, brilliant, SERIOUS actor. Personally i do not find him ''Hott'' or ''Sexy'' he's a human being and i think that 14 year old fangirls don't seem to get that. (And no he didn't become my 2nd favorite actor after Pirate's Of the Caribbean he is because of 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Secret Window' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street') Overall this movie is is cinematic masterpiece that takes you on a journey you won't soon forget. A definite must see."
"Chris_Docker","6","1","3","5 February 2008"," You wouldn't (I hope) watch a movie on a 3"" screen - why watch musical theatre in the cinema, sung by people who can't
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make a lot of good films together. ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""  I loved them all. Sweeney Todd displays another impressive blend of their talents. And I hated it. Let me tell you why.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong  it's a very good movie. Very cleverly done. But for all the hundreds of thousands that enjoy it, there will be some that find it nauseous, pointless, superficial, and much better left undone. In case you are likely to be one of those people, let me tell you enough about it to save wasting your money and a couple of hours you could better spend doing something else. Like watching the rain or staring into space.<br/><br/>Firstly, Sweeney Todd is a musical. This is very important, because the trailer makes a hash of telling you what it is. Is it a fairy tale? A horror story? Something weird with a song or two? No, it's a full blown stage musical  one of those where they sing nearly all the words rather than having dialogue and songs.<br/><br/>There's nothing more I enjoy than a good trip to the West End of London or New York's Broadway. There's the excitement of the legendary venue, and they will have the cream of the crop of performers who can sing extremely well, act enough to project stage presence, and dance as well if required. By the time the show gets to the provinces, the good singers have usually been replaced with people who can yell. Not a massive problem perhaps if you are doing Rocky Horror or Sound of Music  shows with good singalong ditties. But if I have to focus on the raucous attempts of a second rate 'singer' for over two hours, invest a second rate plot with meaning it barely deserves, and feel my wallet suffer for something that is neither art nor entertainment: then I get fidgety.<br/><br/>Like the similar travesty, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sweeney Todd forces me to endure something that could be palatable in a top theatre and is execrable on film. And it gets worse: Hunchback used people who had good singing experience  Sweeney has a failed pop singer who can act. Let's add the director's girlfriend/spouse. She can't sing either, but close-ups of her expressive face will help to take the heat off Johnny. Watch out for the Depp kiss. ""I was being paid by my boyfriend to kiss his best friend,"" she told reporters.<br/><br/>As it's a 'musical', let's add a couple of people who really can sing and stick them in minor roles. With all the big names, we won't see or hear them very much. It's a minor love story while Bonham Carter slavishly follows Demon Barber Johnny so he can work out his frustration at losing his first love. Johnny works out his frustration very well  by slitting throats. Not just his intended, but many others, for practice and pies. It's all done to more ridiculous warbling, so is more about adding colour than horror.<br/><br/>The one bit I enjoyed was Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, a competitor barber. He was doing what he is best at  being funny. Now if they had left Depp and Carter to do what they are best at, decided whether the sets and lighting were meant to be realistic or fantasy, and left the venerable Mr Sondheim writing musicals for the stage . . .<br/><br/>It could have been good. I could have enjoyed it instead of wishing it would hurry up and end.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't give it one star because I recognise that both existing fans of the stage show and would be fans are going to love it. It appeals to the people who want a stage show with a bit of an adult theme, dressed up with top stars (Depp's performance is stellar). And to many more who no doubt see something I don't. So now you know what it is, you've probably read all the glowing reports, and you can decide whether you might like it or not."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","3","3 February 2008"," Simply The Year's Best
","This is without a doubt the best movie of 2007 and I am astonished that it hasn't been nominated for Best Picture. In fact, I think it's a travesty of justice. Yes, Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd / Benjamin Barker) is nominated and deservedly so, Depp is riveting here. But am I alone in being incredulous that director Tim Burton is not also nominated? The supporting cast is excellent too.<br/><br/>Admittedly Burton had pretty wonderful source material in the Stephen Sondheim musical, but his translation to the screen is masterful. The evocation of Dickensian London, the gloomy, almost overwhelming design (I hate to use Gothic yet again, but I guess that's what it is), the casting, the realization on screen of this story, is just perfection. I love it. To quickly summarize the story, Benjamin Barker was shunted off to the Australian penal colonies by a corrupt judge who desired his pretty wife and now holds his daughter captive. Returning some 15 years later as one Sweeney Todd, Barker swears revenge and with the help of his landlady, Mrs Lovett, starts dispatching the undeserving upper crust of London. Barber Barker slits their throats, Lovett makes them into tasty pies. <br/><br/>I have always been a bit of a sucker for musicals, because I think when well done they are a sublime form of pure entertainment. But this works on a whole different level. No singing and dancing in the rain here, but drama, passion, blood lust, revenge and wit. This is more opera than musical. My daughter, who is a musical theatre student and a bit of a Sondheim fan, told me they left out one of the best songs, but I can't say I noticed. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is terrific in this role. His esoteric career choices (I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the other night, and it would be hard to get further from Sweeney Todd than that) show him to be a truly great and disciplined actor. He can create convincing characters and rise above his movie star status. Much has already been said about his singing, but I think it's just fine for the movie. No, it wouldn't work on stage, but this isn't the stage, that's the point. This is a movie, an entirely different medium, he doesn't need to be able to project his voice into the upper dress circle . Yes, he does sound like David Bowie as many reviewers have noted - which is interesting given that he comes from Kentucky and David Bowie is from Brixton - but Depp is a much better singer than Bowie is an actor. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs Lovett) could perhaps have done with some more singing lessons. She just about gets away with it, because she's a convincing actress, (I could well see her making Priest Pies), but I have to admit I couldn't hear all her words, and words are the essence of Sondheim. That is my only criticism really. Ed Sanders, the young actor who plays Toby, is very good and sings beautifully, Alan Rickman, long one of my favourite actors, gives another great performance as the nasty judge, and Timothy Spall is perfectly cast as Beadle Bamford. Also very good, is scene stealing Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, Todd's first victim. A lovely over-the-top performance, which made me view him in a whole new light (I'd only seen him before as Borat.) <br/><br/>It's stylishly gory, highly dramatic, and very gripping. I saw it twice in the space of a couple of weeks and gained even more from second viewing. It will definitely join my DVD library. This is a film which will stand the test of time in a year of pretty indifferent material. I am at a loss as to why it's not been nominated for Best Picture."
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","31 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Sweeney Todd
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was slated to have been released end of next month. Then came the relatively strong opening in the West late last year, followed by nominations and wins in the Golden Globes, that it has now been bumped up for release this week, prior to the 3-way fight that the Asian movies will put up in the upcoming Lunar New Year week. I thought it was a no-brainer having to release this early as Johnny Depp is already a household name here thanks to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and here he dons eye shadow and retains the bad teeth to play the titular character.<br/><br/>One can imagine the troubles that a beautiful wife may bring, especially when people in positions of power find it easy to abuse that authority in order to covert her. Benjamin Parker (Depp), as he was originally known, was a naive young barber with a beautiful wife and kid, but corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) felt some strong stirring in his loins, enough to banish Parker for years, and taking a leaf out of Mask of Zorro's villain Don Rafael Montero, adopts Parker's child Johanna, only with plans to make the beautiful girl his wife when she comes of age (shades of Kim Ki-duk's The Bow too).<br/><br/>So Parker returns with bad attitude and probably bad breath as well, to sing his way (you do know it's a musical, don't you?) into implementing his scheme of revenge on those who had trespassed him, and does so with the help of a lousy pie baker Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). He slices and dices with his collection of silver blades, while she bakes and she cooks using ingredients on the cheap, and regular on supply, with a unique taste to boot.<br/><br/>Based on the West End musical by Stephen Sondheim, this film adaptation by director Tim Burton have re-teamed his virtual cast from Corpse Bride with Depp and Carter in the lead roles of Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett, complete with pale skin and a Gothic wardrobe. They are no strangers to Burton, with Depp having collaborated with Burton since the days of Edward Scissorhands, which puts him in good steed as he now wields the barber blades, and 5 more films thereafter. Helena Bonham Carter, well, is his fiancée, so nuff said about that too. Together they share familiar chemistry already established, and chew up scenes especially when they sing their duets, and you'll feel somewhat sad for Mrs Lovett as she pines for Todd's love, which isn't forthcoming as he's so obsessed with trying to find opportunity to get close to Judge Turpin and exact his revenge.<br/><br/>Tim Burton seemed to have been influenced a bit by the Asian ketchup director Chang Cheh, as blood get spilled by the bucketloads in similar style, and this time, done in very tongue- in-cheek manner with the spurts shooting quite exaggeratedly sky high and the drips emulating volumes from a waterfall. But there's no denying that it is wonderfully photographed, and is something you'd come to expect each time you watch a Burton film, complete with dark humour, and plenty of dark elements and themes. Being a musical, the songs are top notch, and the lyrics really classy, bringing out the emotions felt by the characters without unnecessary pomp, getting straight to the point.<br/><br/>In fact, everyone in the movie, right down to the supporting cast like Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall had lines to sing, and I'm quite surprised to see (and hear) Alan Rickman's piece, together with Depp's, which was, though short, quite wonderful. Alas, and I think I'm getting quite anal here and hopefully I arrest this problem soon, the romance between Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) and Johanna (Jayne Wisener) seemed a little too contrived and emotionally empty, and I rather disliked the way their love developed, or left hanging - even though we could've guessed the likely outcome, Burton decided to end the movie in the best possible way it could without dwelling too much on the obvious. Which means the final act zooms past a tad too fast after a deliberate, measured build up.<br/><br/>Oh, and watch out too for Sacha ""Borat"" Baron Cohen in a small supporting role as Italian tout Pirrelli who sells magical hair elixirs, which was well worth its moments. But if there's one thing I'd take away from the movie, is that to beware the barber's blade. Somehow Eastern Promises had started it, and now Sweeny Todd highlights the dangers. Hope it stays in movieland, and not inspire anyone out there who'd think they're the fastest, cleanest shave in town! Recommended for the songs, which lifted the ho-hum story."
"coffeechill","10","1","3","29 January 2008"," The film that may do to pies what Psycho did to motel rooms...
","In the late 70's, Stephen Sondheim's gruesome masterpiece ""Sweeney Todd"" debuted on Broadway. It polarised its audience in a way that few musicals ever had before, nor ever have done since. With such rich source material, it would be hard to make a bad film version of such a landmark of the musical theatre. On the other hand, it would be equally as difficult to make a film version that italicises everything that made the stage version such a masterwork. Congratulations Tim Burton, you've performed the latter. The story, well-known to most thespians, tells the tale of Sweeney Todd (Depp), loving husband and doting father, transported for a crime he didn't commit by a sinister and ambitious Judge (Rickman). He returns to London to enact his own brand of revenge on the Judge and anyone else standing in his way. Along the way he partners up with Mrs. Nellie Lovett, his land-lady and owner of the meat pie shop (Bonham Carter) who suggests that people would make good edibles, marking one of the films turning points where she and Sweeney undertake a delightfully demented dance over the thrill of wondering what different people taste like. With a plot line as unsavoury as this does the film still stand up as a tasty morsel? You bet it does. By the way, there's blood. Lots of it. And singing. Lots of it too. Got it? Good. It is extremely rare to find anyone so closely matched to the source material as Burton is to Todd. It almost feels like this film was made to be directed by him. His Gothic, twisted sense of humour closely parallels the humour prevalent in Christopher Bond's story and the subtle innuendos implied in Sondheims lyrics. Likewise, his colour palette of mainly black, white and red, juxtaposed with the blindingly vibrant colours of the dream sequences create a feast for the eyes that is as satisfying as that of the ears. Equally as perfectly suited to the film is Johnny Depp, who plays Sweeney as a simmering cauldron of hatred and contempt for his fellow man. His is a character who has suffered so much and encourages so much pathos from the audience, that, in a sense, it makes it easier to digest his evil deeds. He's practically emotionless. It's almost as if he dares the viewer to explore his tortured soul through his cold, dead eyes. Equally as affecting is Carter, who's Mrs. Lovett is anything but the incarnation of either an Angela Lansbury or a Patti LuPone (both women who have played the role on Broadway). Carter finds the humour in every moment and her dry delivery of some of the films witty one-liners offer the perfect ying to Todd's yang. While Sweeney's motive is revenge, her motive is love: A love for Sweeney that is never reciprocated and a desire for a family. It is her heart that beats in sync with the heart of the film. She's spellbinding. Rickman does what Rickman does best, playing the twisted Judge, replete with his rumbling bass voice, while Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the highlights of the film in a small cameo as Adolfo Pirelli. Vocally, as well as physically, each performance is perfectly-pitched. For a musical so often in the repertoire of the highest-ranking opera houses in the world, it is hard to imagine Depp or Carter being able to out-sing some of the vocal giants that have played their roles. They don't. But they both act the roles so well it's hardly at the forefront of the mind. In the true style of Sondheim, the songs become like internal monologues, giving us an insight into the characters thought processes. Not one bit of this film feels stagy. The songs are interwoven so seamlessly through the dialogue that you hardly notice it's a musical. Rarely has a film understood exactly what the original author had intended, yet Sweeney achieves this admirably. Sondheim, himself, gave this film his tick of approval. Throughout his career, Burton has been at the forefront of innovation. Taking us to places beyond the average filmmaker. Not unlike Nellie Lovett, another enterprising salesperson, Tim Burton manages to lure us into his world and make us buy what he's selling. Let's be clear, Sweeney Todd is a difficult sell. The Depp fan-boys won't like the singing and the Depp fan-girls won't like the blood. It's too campy for the horror genre, and too horrific for the campy genre. But it's a masterpiece. Consider it sold."
"Terrell-4","8","1","3","27 January 2008"," Grand guignol at its best...meaning razors, slit throats, dripping red stuff and enough black humor to fill a cemetery
","""They all deserve to die. Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, tell you why. Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett, there are two kinds of men and only two. There's the one staying put in his proper place and one with his foot in the other one's face. Look at me, Mrs Lovett! Look at you! No, we all deserve to die. Even you, Mrs Lovett, even I!"" <br/><br/>If you had any doubt, that's Sweeney Todd, and he puts his philosophy to work. Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, is Stephen Sondheim's re-telling of a barber driven mad. His wife and child were taken from him by a corrupt judge, who used and destroyed the wife and kept the child, who now is a young woman. Sweeney was transported, but he managed years later to return to London. While he plans his revenge on the judge he takes his revenge on humanity. He slits the throats of those he shaves. He's fortunate in meeting Mrs. Lovett, who makes a poor living making and selling awful meat pies, the main ingredient of which is pussycat. Now with Sweeney providing a constant source of fresh meat, her pies become best sellers. Sweeney finds his daughter, but retribution is inevitable. Now, twenty- eight years after Sweeney's Broadway debut, Tim Burton, with Sondheim's encouragement, has made a movie of the show. <br/><br/>A tragedy of revenge, as some critics have said? I'm not so sure about that...there's too much lip-smacking by Burton and Sondheim, as well as by the audience (at least the audience I was a part of) over the gore. But Sweeney Todd certainly is tops as a superb example of an engrossing, cynically humorous, fast-paced, wonderfully acted piece of flinch-inducing Grand Guignol. I enjoyed every minute of it, even while I was squinting my eyes to avoid most of the neck slitting. Even as graphic as the slicing and blood spurting was, there was something so over the top about those scenes that perhaps I'm just a softy. (But note how Sondheim mixes together the beautiful song of longing, ""Johanna,"" with the impersonal series of throats being slit. It's startling to hear and see, and the beauty of the song nearly makes us complicit in Sweeney's on-camera blood-letting. On the stage it was even more riveting. It's a brilliant, lengthy set piece.) <br/><br/>All the actors, I thought, did a fine job doing their own singing. Sondheim said recently in the NYTimes that he agreed completely with the decision to cast the actors first for their acting abilities and then for their singing skills, not the other way. Bonham Carter has taken some criticism, but I think she does a perfectly fine job. She has a light voice without much power behind it...but she certainly did an excellent job with her meat pies song and her by the sea song. Her characterization of the character was excellent, I thought. Fortunately, playing Mrs. Lovett isn't a zero sum gain; I think it's perfectly reasonable to enjoy what Bonham Carter does with the role while loving the ghastly comic turn Angela Lansbury gave Mrs. Lovett on stage. It would hard to think of better actors for doing such revolting jobs as degenerates than Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as the beadle. For me, where the movie starts to slacken a bit is toward the end, when Sondheim tries to bring a sense of real tragedy to the story. That has been a problem, as far as I'm concerned, with the stage production as well as the movie. Too obvious, too ""sincere"" for me. Still, without the final revelations there wouldn't be a story at all. <br/><br/>I saw the stage show shortly after it opened on Broadway, then again when a touring company brought it to St. Louis. My reaction then was the same as with nearly all Sondheim shows I've seen...too mannered, too overly intellectual, too clever. Then I listen to the recordings of the songs from his shows and I change my mind. Burton's movie (over which Sondheim had control over how the songs would be presented and over any cuts) seems to me to have resulted in a much more affective presentation, due to the style, the cuts and the trims, than the stage show. <br/><br/>And it seems to me that Johnny Depp has established himself as the most interesting and versatile American actor of his generation, probably the most talented, too. I cannot conceive of Di Caprio, Cruise, Pitt, etc., etc., being able to carry this part, much less even taking the chance and agreeing to play it."
"vinsond21","8","1","3","24 January 2008"," Tim Burton takes on a Broadway masterpiece
","Tim Burton is one of my favorite movie directors, Stephen Sondheim is my favorite Broadway composer/lyricist, while Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are among my favorite actors. So you can imagine how eagerly i was awaiting to enjoy this version of Sweeney Todd, the Broadway masterpiece, on the big screen. Well, was it up to my expectations? The first time i saw this movie, i was expecting too much because i was already so familiar with the stage version. However, the second time i saw it, i appreciated it a lot more. I had another chance to examine the movie's strengths, which there are indeed. The look is classically graphic, while the orchestrations involve Paul Gemignani and Jonathan Tunick - two experts on works by Sondheim. Yes, some numbers were unnecessarily cut off or shortened, including No Place Like London and Ah Miss!, both of which would have nicely added a softer, more humanistic, touch to the otherwise relentlessly gloomy proceedings. The By the Sea number was also sadly shortened and poorly edited. Although A Little Priest was not my favorite number of the musical, it was the best presented in the movie despite it also having been shortened. The acting is overall really superb, even if Helena Bonham Carter was a little too subdued as Mrs Lovett, although that makes you really feel for her character. But then, Mrs Lovett is supposed to be vile, and unlike Angela Lansbury's stage incarnation who spits her words out while chirpily enjoying manipulating Sweeney Todd, here Bonham Carter tries to sing melodically and as a result, she deprives the character of the oomph befitting a lead role. Nevertheless, she is still deliciously good, while Johnny Depp is amazing. The film is superbly edited too. And the way the blood in the movie spurts and gushes out is really reminiscent of the horror movies of old, which Burton and Depp supposedly love."

","I' ve seen it twice in one week and it is gloriously funny and dark, too. I love how the humor and darkness play off each other. The film is visually stunning and I cannot believe it did not receive more Oscar nods! Mr. Depp, not only are you the sexiest demon to stalk a victim but you can sing as well. Who knew? Not I, scandal. When are singing of your daughter and slicing throats at the same time is beyond funny. You have the most lovely tone with that song, as well as a lovely expression on your handsome face. Not at all conducive to the task at hand. But it it a marvelous scene. Go see it now, run to the theatre! Peace,Love,Later. Mr. Tracy Hamblen"
"TonesH","7","1","3","24 January 2008"," You can't go wrong with Sondheim
","At the start I'd just like to say that I am completely biased about Sondheim. I think that there is very little that you can do to stuff up a musical written by him, and in many ways the less you do with it the more the music gets to shine. I think, however, from the perspective of cinema, Tim Burton is very well suited to directing this film because of his penchant for darkness, and his over-the-top style. So though I have not always thought that Tim Burton was the best of directors, I think this is incredibly good.<br/><br/>The music itself was excellent, and I really didn't mind the cut-down length of some of the songs. As for the singing overall, I think it feel, but only slightly, into the trap of most Burton pictures, which is having the music so loud it drowns out the singing. In other Tim Burton musicals like Willie Wonka and Corpse Bride I could hardly hear the words, and I couldn't follow what was going on. With this the balance was a bit off, but only slightly. Besides that all the actors, particularly the young boy, did a very good job. As for the other actors, well, the best thing about opera (or light opera), rather than musicals, is that a good singing voice comes second to emotion. So the quality of the action greatly forgives the very good, but not great singing. What did, and always does, grate me is how digitised the voices were. Even in serious operatic performances I prefer a few missed notes. In this, of course, there were none. And this somewhat detracts from the emotion; an angry man should not hit every note. A more frenzied singing style would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>I have not much to add with the cinematography itself, or with the direction. I thought the beach scene in the dream was very funny indeed, and that is indicative of Tim Burton's great mix of humour and horror throughout. One thing that I thought, though, was that the scenery dragged a bit towards the end. I got a bit sick of seeing the same old set, so by the time we got to the finale in the basement I felt a little bored. But still, not much.<br/><br/>The acting, however, is where this movie shines. The stars are all first-class actors. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman are all some of my perennial favourites. But the supporting cast was even better. Timothy Spall is his usual fantastic self, and Sasha Baron Cohen was absolutely hilarious. But Ed Sanders was the real stand-out performance. It was just as eye-catching as Jack Wild's performance as the Artful Dodger in Oliver. <br/><br/>In the end I think that this was a really fantastic movie, and I recommend it to everyone!"
"dmcmillan01","6","1","3","23 January 2008"," A little too much Tim Burtonish.
","A movie with strong performances by Alan Rickman and Johnny Depp. A lukewarm one by Helena Bonham Carter. But the real stars were the sets and costumes. However, the mood of the film was too strongly flavored by the spice of Tim Burton. For Burton fans, it's a great film. For those of us who have seen two other films of this story, and numerous stage versions, it was rather difficult to adjust to so much of Burton's influence. <br/><br/>If one dosn't mind the really horribly bloody gore through out the second half of the film, then ya might enjoy it more than I did. Funny thing is, there wasn't all that blood in any of the other venues I saw it in and it came across just as scary. Or even more so. It's said that the less you see a monster, the more frightening it becomes.<br/><br/>DotyinCA"
"skd-21","7","1","3","23 January 2008"," Blood, some blood, a bit more blood and some singing...
","Sweeny Todd is a musical. I know that may seem an obvious statement to make given the years it has been on Broadway (and my school theatre when I was 13) but I think some people in the audience hadn't quite realised that. It reminded me of the time I went to see the South Park film a group of kids kept tutting all the way through when the songs started. Singing a story is a bit too high-brow for some people.<br/><br/>Another obvious statement to make is that this is a Tim Burton film. So naturally it has to have Johnny Depp in it, which is fortuitous as he makes the perfect Sweeny Todd - anger, despair, hatred with a very small slice of humour on the side of the glass. And it also has to have Helena Bonham Carter too, and again, she's perfectly cast as the loopy, rampantly amorous Mrs. Lovett.<br/><br/>Other fantastic performances grace the film. The excellent Sasha Baron Cohen plays 'Signor Adolfo Pirelli', a rival to Sweeny Todd. His performance is flawless and his foreign accent so much more convincing than 'Talladaga Nights'. One of my favourite actors, Alan Rickman alongside Timothy Spall, who must be best buddies by now from Harry Potter, cast a perfect target as the menacing and corrupt duo who destroyed Sweeny Todd's former life.<br/><br/>And then back to Burton. Sure, it's a Burton film and by now, we should all know what to expect. He doesn't let you down. The scenes are sinister and dark, the sets are brutal and unforgiving and the images of London and its surroundings are relentlessly depressing. Even when Sweeny whips out his blade and carves his victims across the neck, Burton makes sure we bare the brunt of the shock with oodles of oozing blood. The Mrs. Lovett dream sequence about marrying Sweeny is just classic Burton in every aspect.<br/><br/>The only things that let this film down is the score, and the singing. Yes, Sondheim's music is renown, but the film lacks the punch of one or two blockbusting and memorable songs - something that could bring a climax or two to a scene, and really illustrate the emotion in the characters. And unlike a musical like Moulin Rouge, Depp, Carter, Spall, Rickman and even Cohen, are not the strongest of singers by any means necessary - a fact that really stands out when child actor Ed Saunders, playing Toby, opens his gob and starts a duet with Carter, blowing her off set.<br/><br/>But you can get over this because the film is so visually stunning, and to be honest, you'd rather have Depp in this role with a so-so singing voice than seeing someone else who can sing cock the whole character up.<br/><br/>2010 is the estimated release date for one of Burton's next projects - Alice in Wonderland. Hopefully, it'll be as warped and disturbing as Sweeny Todd's world. Although, obviously with less blood..."

The music is incredible of course- Sondheim is a genius!<br/><br/>The film is a mixture of comedy at times- the fantasy sequence, tragedy, anger, and music of course.<br/><br/>The ending is actually great- him dying in the arms of his former wife.<br/><br/>I adored the whole film- I even bought the entire soundtrack.<br/><br/>It should be seen!!"

","I had previously seen the musical Sweeney Todd on stage and I absolutely loved it. The dark element was thick on stage and the actors were amazing singers as well. Once I heard that it was going to be a major movie I didn't think that it could be improved upon. Happily, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd was a refreshing take on an already amazingly dark story. The movie magic only enhanced the storyline instead of detracting from it as it has in so many other films. The cast was incredibly selected, the perfect people were cast for the perfect parts. I especially liked the fact that two Harry Potter villains in Alan Rickman (HP:Severus Snape/ST:Judge Turpin) and Timothy Spall (HP:Peter Pettigrew/ST:Beadle Bamford) ended up being two amazing Sweeney Todd villains as well. Not to mention, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter couldn't have played Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett better.<br/><br/>Aside from the acting, Stephen Sondheim worked his magic with an already great Sweeney Todd score and it was incredible. Two thumbs up and an excellent 10 from me, this version of Sweeney Todd is an absolute must-see. Be ready for blood!"
"ejev","9","1","3","21 January 2008"," Bloody good
","I looked forward to seeing this film for several reasons - Burton, Depp, Rickman, Bonham-Carter and Sondheim. I was a bit worried though, as I have a limited capacity for bloody scenes. I did cheat and read the play before going, just so I knew when to expect a slashing, as opposed to shaving, blade. That being said, I was very impressed with the film - appropriately and richly dark and foreboding, details in every shot that put you in both the time and place, and an easy comfort with the musical score. Sondheim is not easy to sing, and everyone did very well, with surprisingly good voices all around. We've seen the crazy in Helena Bonham Carter in Harry Potter, but this is a toned down version that shows a nasty turn of mind and potential for mayhem bubbling underneath. Johnny Depp is always good at the slightly out-of-mainline-society character. Alan Rickman is equally practiced at smoothly evil or at least nasty characters, but here the hint of niceness and charm makes him even scarier. And in the end, the bloody scenes were quite bearable, while at the same time so close to being over-the-top that you got a sense of the madness in Sweeney Todd's mind."
"do_d_bacon_dance","10","1","3","21 January 2008"," Burton does it again!! Awesome!
","I was genuinely surprised to read a bad review of this film on IMDb. Its is witty, dark, twisted and everything a Tim Burton film should be. I will admit when the first scene began i was unsure of Depp's ability to sing, but despite him not having the strongest voice in the world he pulls it off. His decent into vengeful madness is fantastic, i was literally on the edge of my seat. Johnny Depp although a great and likable actor has the skills to make anyone feel uneasy, he uses this perfectly in this film, playing a clearly demented 'evil' soul but also appealing to the audience. Even after some brutal murder scenes i still found him to be an enjoyable character with whom i could sympathise. Helena Bonham Carter is great as well, her desire for Todd seems genuine and her unrequited love for him it both amusing and at some times verging on sad.<br/><br/>The gore is excessive, but theatrical and over the top, anyone who knows Burton films will understand why this is so. If you are feint-hearted you may feel a little bit sicked by the huge body count! The graphic nature of some of the scene certainly narrows down the genre of the film, horror/musicals are quite rare but if your a fan of one or the other there is something for everyone to get their teeth into! All of the actors play there roles perfectly, the music (although not performed by the greatest voices in Hollywood) is enjoyable. Basically you'll laugh, you'll squirm and who knows you might even cry! But you should definitely enjoy!"
"alicecbr","10","1","3","21 January 2008"," Depp brings humor, fury and horror all in one package
","You have to be an excellent actor to portray all of these emotions simultaneously. The darkness of a Dickens novel is portrayed all too well in this satire on the hideously inhuman practices of 'upper-class' London society with their bacchanalia coinciding with the return of Charles II. Of course, I am biased since Alan Rickman and Johnny Depp are my 2 favorite actors. (Someone who goes to London strictly for the purpose of seeing AR in ""Anthony and Cleopatra"" HAS to be a fan.) Neither betrayed my faith. I of course long for a movie that will show characters to be both good and bad, as we all are. This opera, for such it was, colors their characters in shades of black and white (or peach, for the beautiful wife that is attacked by the judge). The music is lyrical with words that would put Gilbert and Sullivan to shame. I suggest you buy the score to truly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Will it win an Oscar? It should, but the subject matter may prevent it, since corruption in government is now SOP, not something exceptional that the media might uncover. Our corollary for this in the U.S. is all the (mostly) minority 'criminals' being freed as they are found by DNA tests to be innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted. Like the king sending Bathsheba's husband to war so that he can marry Bathsheba, so the judge 'convicts' Depp of a made up crime (although debts themselves were enough to have you jailed back then).<br/><br/>Was the blood necessary to the plot? Yes, since murder isn't clean, it is appropriate to show it for what it is. Just as we brought the Vietnam War to a halt because the media, THEN knowing its duty, showed us the ugly blood and guts of war and we the public responded in revulsion.......so this movie shows you what is TRULY being done. And, as is the case with vigilantes, injustice is the result, as the innocent are carried away on a river of blood along with the guilty."
"MOscarbradley","8","1","3","21 January 2008"," Warts and all, this may be the best movie musical since ""Cabaret""
","Twice before the cinema has massacred Mr Sondheim. In 1966 Richard Lester brought ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and chopped it up like ""The Knack"" on speed. In the seventies, Hal Prince, (great on Broadway but something of a dodo in the cinema), made a version of ""A Little Night Music"" that was so wooden it could have been a Davenport. So was it any wonder my heart sank when I heard that Tim Burton, that most idiosyncratic of directors, was to film ""Sweeney Todd"", arguably Sondheim's greatest, and certainly his most ambitious, work with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter in the leading roles. (Neither player has a reputation for singing and Burton has been producing more misses than hits recently).<br/><br/>So first the good news; it is so much better than I had dared hope. This is no slavish reproduction of the stage show but a fairly radical reinterpretation for the cinema and that means not just tightening things up but cutting songs as well. Purists may balk and as a purist, on occasions, I did but there is so much here that is true to the spirit of Sondheim's original that, more often than not, inwardly I wanted to cheer. Burton, for the most part, has pulled it off.<br/><br/>The bad news is that it is not the masterpiece it might have been. It isn't the penchant for blood, of which there is a lot, or the Hammer horror trappings. After all, it is the tale of Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street, so what do you expect! Rather it's that Burton loses his grip in crucial moments. The climax feels rushed and overdone; he totally misses the comedy of 'A Little Priest', the one occasion where the musical-comedy should far outweigh the darker elements. And then there is the casting. This may be the greatest of all movie musicals, (and it is probably the best movie musical since ""Cabaret""), in which neither of the leading players can sing and since ""Sweeney Todd"", in its original state, is close to being an opera, that is something of a handicap.<br/><br/>And yet Depp, Bonham-Carter and Alan Rickman, (as Judge Turpin), perform brilliantly. Despite their lack of a musical training they know exactly what is required of them; for a good deal of the time I was oblivious to the fact that they weren't singing all that well because they were acting so superbly. Depp just gets better with every picture; that he has now added a full-blown musical to his CV speaks volumes of his versatility. (OK, so he's not Len Cariou but he's a damned fine actor). Bonham-Carter, too, has probably never been better on screen. Her Mrs Lovett is sexy, sympathetic and a monster almost simultaneously. As for Alan Rickman, he completely resists his natural urge to ham it up making Turpin a genuinely chilling and odious villain.<br/><br/>It also looks wonderful with Dante Ferretti's splendid set design and Dariusz Wolski's sepia-toned cinematography adding depths it never had on the stage. Perhaps it's failings have more to do with Burton's ambition; his attempts at doing things differently, in deviating from the original score on occasions, in cutting out the flannel and keeping to the basic fundamentals of the plot. Maybe in the end he simply bit off more than he could chew. And yet so much of it is magnificent that you are inclined to overlook its flaws. Yes, warts and all, this may be the best screen musical since ""Cabaret"". Whoever would have thought it?"
"jondcole","10","1","3","20 January 2008"," Fan-gory-tastic!
","After a couple of 'off' years in many respects, Tim Burton has returned to the full on darkness that made his name. Him and Johnny Depp are a team made in heaven... or perhaps a darkly lit hell? Who knows. I love Tim's vision. Depp's performance is brilliant. His 'cockney-london' singing voice is reminiscent of David Bowie... maybe that was intentional? But, Depp is so in the role you don't care. He's intense and focused. Depp is easily the best actor of his generation. HE becomes the role. The supporting cast a great. Bonham-Carter is just nuts. Probably more disturbed than Sweeney. The 18 Cert is odd. There are worse horrors with a lesser rating. I guess its more to do with the dubious morales and cannibalism? The gore is straight out of Hammer. The OTT Thick red blood just looks fantastic. It's part gore, part artistic. Musically... for me, it was great to see an almost old school 'musical' being made. And by that I mean, big sets, OTT characters and one song followed by another almost straight away as part of the narrative and not as a filler to the story/pop-song type thing. The songs, some hit, some miss, but overall it's so well balanced and performed. It'll be criminal if Depp isn't in the running or winning the Oscar this time round."
"LemonyShepard","10","1","3","20 January 2008"," ""Bloody"" Brilliant...get it?
","It's been a well-known fact for years that the Burton/Depp duo is like Pixar: it simply can't go wrong. To prove this, Tim decided to cast Johnny in something that neither have tackled before: a Tony-award winning Sondheim musical.<br/><br/>Yes, I said it. Burton and Depp in a musical.<br/><br/>Ah, but what would a Burton movie be if it didn't have a nice, stylistic twist to it? The musical is Sweeney Todd, the story of a wrongfully imprisoned man who wants revenge on the man who ruined his life, Judge Turpin (played by Alan Rickman). Now, Turpin not only raped his suicidal wife (Laura Michelle Kelly), but then kidnapped his daughter (beautiful newbie Jayne Wisener). After Sweeney is found by a young sailor named Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), he returns to London to try and kill the wicked judge. He returns to his barbershop to find the frantic, yet lovely Mrs. Lovett (played wonderfully by Helena Bonham Carter) who agrees to help his on his vengeful mission.<br/><br/>The story deals with things that you wouldn't normally expect from a musical (rape, kidnappings, bloody killings, torture, cannibalism) and is a far departure from the Disney Channel atmosphere of Hairspray. However, this doesn't make the movie any less good. In fact, it could be the one movie that would make men like musicals! The blood effects aren't incredibly realistic, but is very stylistic instead. While most of the atmosphere in Sweeney is that of black and white, the bright intensity of the red blood is still incredibly shocking.<br/><br/>Depp is a better singer than I thought he would've been. Carter is phenomenal in every possible way as Lovett. Sanders, Wisener, and Bower are each fantastic, as are Rickman, Spall, and Cohen. Casting was brilliant with this movie.<br/><br/>It gets slow only on rare occasions, only to set up another fantastic musical sequence or bloody throat-slitting. Undeniably Burton, Sweeney Todd is a fantastic saga for fans of dark, thrilling horror movies or extravagant Broadway musicals!"

","There is nothing better than seeing a good musical on the big screen and Sweeney Todd does not disappoint.<br/><br/>All the usual Tim Burton boxes are ticked - dark gloomy atmosphere, eccentric characters, Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. The only box left un-ticked is Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>I'm one of the few people who cannot see the attraction with Johnny Depp, I never bought into the Captain Jack hype or liked his version of Willy Wonka but Sweeney Todd is the first film I have seen Johnny Depp in and have been completely immersed in his performance. His singing, whilst very good, is not on par with other Hollywood stars such as Hugh Jackman or Ewan McGregor but his performance cannot be faulted he embodies Sweeney to the point that you forget that it Johnny Depp playing a character. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast - Alan Rickman plays his usual villain - only this time he sings, Sacha Baron Cohan plays his usual crazed European - only this time he sings, Timothy Spall plays his usual villain lackey - only this time he sings, whilst clearly all playing roles they are famous for are good additions to the production, Sacha Baron Cohan getting a few good laughs,especially with a surprise accent related revelation!<br/><br/>It is Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Sanders who steal the show. Helena is perfectly cast, regardless of her relationship with the director and all the big dramatic songs are left for young Sanders who will be compared to the Artful Dodger and for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>There is a little sub-plot involving Sweeney's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wiesner) and a young sailor Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) but they get rather short changed and are given little to do.<br/><br/>The songs are all fittingly dark set against the geographically incorrect but appropriately gloomy London. Although none of the songs have the catchiness you would expect from musicals they are clever - special mention must go to Worst Pies in London, A Little Priest (personal favourite) and Pirelli's Miracle Elixir.<br/><br/>The film looks gorgeous, with the colour all faded it illuminates the blood, and to be frank there is a lot of blood. The film is quite violent but once you get over the first initial graphically killing you accept the over-dramatic blood splattering. <br/><br/>Overall I would give the film 9/10. It is a very enjoyable film which doesn't have a happy cast sing-a-long ala Hairspray at the end which fits in perfectly with the films gloomy tone. It loses a point for the wasted romantic sub-plot between Johanna and Anthony - Johanna getting the award for worst singer and song in the whole movie with Green Finch and Linnett Bird.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended for all fans of Tim Burton, musicals and dare I say it, even the legions of Johnny Depp fans through out the world - although this one is still not a convert."

","I have heard the soundtrack album of this musical since probably 20 years ago. This was the first I have heard of Stephen Sondheim and his music. After all that time, I have never had the chance of watching Sweeney Todd on stage. So when I heard that Tim Burton is going to have a go at this musical, I just had to go see it. I haven't heard the music for such a long time already, that I was afraid I would have already totally forgotten it.<br/><br/>Anyway, my schedule was very tight, so I think I was a little late for the beginning of the movie, however when I entered and heard Anthony sing:<br/><br/>""I have sailed the world beheld its wonders from the Dardanells, to the mountains of Peru, But there's no place like London!...""<br/><br/>Everything came rushing back. The music was indeed very familiar to me still. Now what is left is to put the music with the visuals...<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter take on the roles made immortal by Len Cariou and the legendary Angela Lansbury. Honestly, their makeup looked very familiar, as if Edward Scissorhands meets Beatrix Lestrange (of the Harry Potter 5 movie). Talking about Harry Potter, the antagonist roles of the evil Judge Turpin and his Beadle were played by Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall (who both played bad guys Prof. Snape and Pettigrew in HP movies). No doubt everyone in the main cast played their role with relish and gusto. This would include Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Pirelli, Todd's rival barber. The younger secondary characters Anthony and Joanna (Todd's daughter) were played by newcomers and this fact is quite sorrily evident.<br/><br/>This is the story of Benjamin Barker, a gentle and naive barber, who lost his wife, child and his freedom because of the jealous lusty desires of a decrepit Judge Turpin. After 15 years in prison, he sails back to London. He joins up with Mrs. Lovett, who now occupies his old house, baking the ""worst pies in London."" Together, Barker, now going under the name of Sweeney Todd, begins his plans to exact violent revenge on his enemy Judge.<br/><br/>When I saw how the story unfolded, and all the bloody details, I wondered about how Stephen Sondheim can use this type of scenario and still manage to give us such melodious and beautiful songs, such as ""Joanna"" and ""Pretty Women"" which were ironically sung to accompany throat-slashing scenes. This musical is also the original source of the the famous ballad ""Not While I'm Around"". Its place in the story is quite haunting, considering the big effect of this song's message on the ending of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is really in his element here. We know him for his visions of the Gothic and the macabre, and this play is so rich of this type of imagery. He was born to make this film as it is right up his alley. He handles the witty and naughty ""A Little Priest"" and the humorous yet sad ""By the Sea"" masterfully as well.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a film for the faint of heart. No wonder it is a rated R-18 film. Even if it were to be expected by someone familiar with the play's storyline, the sheer volume of the blood shed and the manner in which it was shed can still churn the stomach of the weak-livered. This is most certainly one of the bloodiest movies I have seen, matching the bloodbaths in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Braveheart."""

At the same time, the judge has a new captive, who is the love interest of Todd's young comrade.<br/><br/>I have had my doubts about Tim Burton in recent years. He was always amazing and had a good way to mix the dark, Gothic themes with wackiness. All through the 1980s and 90s he was unstoppable. Then, ""Planet of the Apes"" came out and was a knife through my heart. After this, he was hit and miss. ""Big Fish"" was great while ""Corpse Bride"" was bland. Now, with ""Sweeney Todd"", Burton finds his groove: the dark blossoms here under his command.<br/><br/>If you don't like musicals, you won't like this film. There really isn't much dialog in the film at all. And if you don't like blood, you may not like this film, because there's plenty of it. And I have to give Burton credit for the use of computer animation here: the blood is very fake, as are several shots of the streets of London. But he presents them in a way where I feel he tried to make them look how they look, rather than presenting rubbish and calling it art. So I didn't mind.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp shines, and this is a nice role for Alan Rickman. I think Sacha Baron Cohen was especially notable, being humorous but also coming across very professional. And the singing was quite good. I mean, it was actually quite good. And the songs were a good mix of Broadway and dark humor... much better than the same old point of view from ""Rent"".<br/><br/>I recently watched a BBC production of ""Sweeney Todd"", and the differences are striking. The BBC had a darker, more nihilistic Todd, whereas this one was more vengeance oriented (and there was more of a love story). I like how they varied, and they co-exist nicely -- being so different, one is not ""better"" than the other, just a different angle. I strongly suggest both are watched by people who love the story.<br/><br/>I don't see this being a film I would watch often, as it is a musical and one must be fairly involved to follow the story (at least for the first few viewings). But it is exceptional, and I think Burton was the right man for the job."
"charchuk","9","1","3","8 January 2008"," A misanthropic masterpiece
","The third act was what really elevated it, for me, from another Burton near-miss of style over substance into a full-fledged Gothic masterpiece. I was worried that the film might end on a happy note, eschewing the tone of the film and following the format of Burton's recent family-friendly flicks, but it went for the throat, ending in an utterly brutal, unforgiving, and damn near misanthropic way. This is only complimented by the relatively light musical numbers, which contrasted perfectly with the dark subject matter to give the film a delightful warped sense of humour, something emphasized fantastically with the wonderfully bizarre and imaginative ""By the Sea"" montage. The singing is not overtly fantastic, but it adds to the actors' performance much better than over-the-top opera singing ever could. And, of course, the film is designed beautifully. This is an out-and-out masterpiece, coming from a man who had seemingly forgotten the meaning of that word."

","A dark and very bloody film by the entertaining Tim Burton, ""Sweeney Todd"" not only delivers the goods story, acting, and direction/cinematography - wise, but also musically, like all good musicals should.<br/><br/>""Sweeney Todd"" isn't for everyone by a long shot, but it does have a lot for people to like. It has dark, or what surprisingly shows up in a moment that's dark, humor that always hits it's mark. It also has dazzling Gothic sets (even though Tim Burton has abused them heavily in his films, this time it just fit too well), and a dark story reminiscent of an Edgar Allen Poe novella, with great songs that any Musical lover could enjoy on one degree or another. Surprisingly, this fits well as a great musical, even next many classics.<br/><br/>That's something to get to, also. There is more singing in this movie than most any other musical you'll see. with a whopping 95% of the movie sung, if you don't like musicals, chances are you'll dislike this pic, to say the least. But if you can get past that, you will thoroughly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>One more thing to hit on is the gore. This is an extreme amount of gore, but it is colored in a bright red so it isn't realistic, but it serves its more metaphorical purpose.<br/><br/>Over all, this film is musically epic, dramatically tragic, and well executed and highly recommended to anyone for at least on try, even if it doesn't look like your kind of film.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Entertainment: ***** (out of 5)"
"dunmore_ego","8","1","3","7 January 2008"," Slashing Singing Scissorhands
","Edward Scissorhands is all grown up! Never more apparent than when Johnny Depp (as the eponymous demon barber, Sweeney Todd) holds aloft a gleaming razor and boldly affirms in song: ""At last! My right arm is complete again!"" <br/><br/>Violent, gruesome, blackly hilarious, deliriously entertaining, director Tim Burton's vision of *Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street* is a wild cry of bloodlust put to song.<br/><br/>The tale of *Sweeney Todd* is apocryphal at best, but it makes for a grand murderous musical: a naïve London barber, Benjamin Barker (Depp, *sans* eye-liner) with a wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and young child, is deported by a lustful judge (Alan Rickman) on false charges, so that the judge could carnalize the barber's wife and raise the barber's child to young womanhood (Jayne Wisener), with intent to have carnal relations with *her* also. After years in exile, the barber returns, wearing more eye-liner than Twisted Sister, more Aquanet than C.C. DeVille, with a new alias, Sweeney Todd. Opening a homicidal barber's shop above a flagging meat pie shop, owned by Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter, looking more Edward Scissorhands than even Johnny Depp), Sweeney turns the corpses he makes into the pies she bakes; his single-minded goal - to get his deporting Judge in the barber's chair and give him the closest of shaves (wink bloody wink).<br/><br/>As Sweeney sails into London harbor, he croaks his first pessimistic lines (*No Place Like London*): ""There's a hole in the world like a great black pit / And it's filled with people who are filled with sh_t! / And its morals aren't worth what a pig can spit"" Then he spends the movie proving it.<br/><br/>The most urgent question asked of this production is: ""So can Johnny Depp sing?"" Yes, of course he can. So too can everyone else in the cast. A production of this size would not allow less-than-exemplary performances to make the finished cut. What do people expect they're going to hear? Breaking voices and flat notes? Alan Rickman's Judge is probably the ""Oliver Reed"" of the bunch, falling back on the untrained singer's ""talking/singing"" technique.<br/><br/>Screenplayed by John Logan, Steven Sondheim's numbers are edited for Hollywood-movie-length and, though none could be regarded as ""classics,"" are generally snappy enough to move the story along briskly; the only reprise that garnered repose being *Johanna*, the daughter's theme  every time someone started puling ""Johaaaaana!"" my eyelids grew heavy.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen  back after *Borat*  slam-dunks his hilarious cameo to the canvas as a rival barber, Signor Adolfo Pirelli, who unwittingly exposes Sweeney's barbering talents in public, whereupon the Judge's liege, Beadle Bamford (deliciously lecherous Timothy Spall), books a shave for the judge at Sweeney's new establishment. Narrowly missing his throat-cutting opportunity with the Judge, Sweeney falls into insanity, installing a tilt-a-chair that drops his arterially-spurting victims down a chute and onto their heads  hard - in the concrete basement of Mrs. Lovett's Pie Shoppe.<br/><br/>Mrs. Lovett only has raccoon eyes for Sweeney, who only has sunken eyes for his razors and there is a smart overlapping of vocals where they are both singing the same line, her to him, and him to his razors in *My Friends*: ""Come let me hold you / Now, with a sigh, you grow warm in my hand / My friend! / My clever friend..."" <br/><br/>Another smart double-vocal is when the Judge is in the chair and sharing thoughts with Sweeney over *Pretty Women*: though they sing the words in unison, Sweeney is remembering his lost wife, while the Judge is perversely thinking of his underage charge and Sweeney's daughter, Johanna. ""Sitting in the window or / Standing on the stair / Something in them cheers the air. / Pretty women."" <br/><br/>In a surprising turn of fortune, the more Mrs. Lovett grinds and bakes Sweeney's unfortunate customers into her meat pies, the more successful the pie shop becomes. Still, her grinding machine could do a better job, as their young apprentice finds fingers and feet aplenty garnishing the upper crust of his pastry. Nonetheless, I must admit that seeing the grand meat pie again (a novelty food indigenous to British and Australian shores) made me hanker for one, no matter *what* flesh was ground into it!) <br/><br/>It was pleasantly surprising to see that Burton never stayed his hand when it came to brutality. *Sweeney* earns its R rating decisively, with many a spurting carotid being accompanied by joyous song. That's what makes it so funny! <br/><br/>The film is unnaturally leached of all color except blood-red, and the set design and cinematography are impeccably Burton.<br/><br/>There is a subplot of a young sailor (Jamie Campbell Bower) rescuing Johanna from the clutches of the Judge, and there are tale twists where we hold our breath that Sweeney is going to do something regretful  and parts where Sweeney DOES in fact do something regretful - all winding to an inevitable climax that merely proves the philosophy of both protagonists in the story, Judge and Sweeney alike: that all men have done something in their lives for which they deserve to die.<br/><br/>""There's a hole in the world like a great black pit / And it's filled with people who are filled with sh_t!"" <br/><br/>Mmm! I feel like a feet pie!"

","I should first say that I'm biased against musicals.<br/><br/>That said, I thought this movie was good for a musical. It kept my interest, even while reaffirming my belief that musicals are quite pointless.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the film was the opening credits. The style of the passing cityscape had a look very similar to the introduction of a video game, Thief: The Dark Project. I have always liked the look and style of the layered 2-D buildings.<br/><br/>The movie was very well made, with only one technical issue. In some shots, which unfortunately become more frequent near the end, the image is noticeably grainy compared to the majority of the film. This could be intentional, but it looks sort of like they filmed most of the film in 70mm, and the grainy shots in 35mm, or some other lower-quality stock.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this was an average film, but an entertaining musical. Very funny, in a dark way. Good thing I had a gift card."
"TheTwistedLiver","8","1","3","6 January 2008"," Burton wins again.
","As a Tim Burton fan going back to seeing ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" in the theaters, I have followed Tim Burton's career and seen all his films. He is a true talent and ""Sweeney Todd"" did not disappoint. In Victorian England, Sweeney Todd returns to his home of London after being falsely imprisoned for fifteen years by the dastardly Alan Rickman, to find his wife ostensibly dead and his daughter imprisoned. He seeks revenge and quickly decides to take it out on all of London, not just the man who did him wrong, this was an interesting twist. The tone, as one could imagine, is very dark and Gothic, what Burton does best, but what makes Burton stand out amongst almost everyone else is that his visual style is accompanied by a very brilliant and dark sense of humor. The combination of these two things, together with fine acting performances, the boy who played Toby was outstanding, truly made this a haunting, surreal, dreamlike film that was well worth the price of admission. Who doesn't love Tim Burton's take on London? Dark, dirty, foggy and man those meat pies!"
"nickkarner","7","1","3","4 January 2008"," Excellent and Brilliant, with a few undeniable flaws
","I'm a self-professed Sondheim fanatic. I have seen nearly all of the shows he has ever written and own all of his recordings, including songs for shows that have almost NEVER been performed, (i.e. Saturday Night, The Frogs). I was lucky enough to see Todd onstage twice in Repertory and then ultimately seeing the newest Broadway version with Patti Lupone and Michael Cerveris. Although I'm no one special, I think I can at least safely step away from my own love for Sondheim and be completely honest and truthful about the screen version of Todd. I'm not writing this to praise or bash the movie. I've seen it twice now and believe I can accurately and fairly assess its short comings and its triumphs. A lot of my own personal predictions came true. I knew(and everyone else did considering Burton got Dante Ferretti to design) that the sets would be fantastic. Also, the costumes and cinematography were excellent on all levels. That being said, let's get down to it. I knew Depp wouldn't be able to sing it full out like Hearn, Cariou, or Cerveris, because hell, he smokes like a fiend and he's just not a trained singer. And for those who don't know it, Sondheim music is not only extremely difficult to sing, I also do musicals and at some auditions they won't allow you to try out with Sondheim music! The one thing that Depp had going for him was that he is brilliant actor. And he used that to his advantage. AND, as an added bonus, he CAN SING! Sure, its not pretty, and die hard fans' hearts sink just a tad when he doesn't hit those awesome notes that Sondheim has written, but who cares? If he can't hit it, at least he's acting the crap out of the material, that, I have to admit is enough for me. Helena, Helena, Helena...how I loved thee in Fight Club, Big Fish, Wings of the Dove, etc...but it just didn't work. I'm being absolutely honest here. I think I know exactly how she decided to work the part. She realized that Lansbury's performance is VERY big and VERY in your face. So she tried to humanize the character AND make it more subtle. LOVE her, but big mistake. The problem is, her weird, breathy sing-song voice was at times a tad annoying, but more importantly, I think it was actually negating the very essence of her character. The things that she does in the movie are unspeakable, yet she feels like such a weak character compared to the force of nature as written. I just didn't like her singing. Sorry to say it, wanted to very badly, but I just think that Burton shouldn't have let her do it. When I found out it could have been Annette Bening or Toni Collette, it just kills me. Especially Toni Collette, who was excellent in The Wild Party. Alan Rickman, for a role VERY much reduced in the movie version, is solid. No great singer, but haven't we heard that before concerning this movie? Echo...echo... Anyhoo, he was fine, but for me, it was Timothy Spall who stole his thunder. Big fan of his Mike Leigh work, and is he not just the nastiest, greasiest mofo on the block? Just so nasty and awesome! Perfectly embodied the character. Casting Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli luckily served two purposes. Uno, it gave him a great part that he played with aplomb(we even get to hear his real voice! which is a rarity, since I don't count his Ali G voice as being completely real when he does it), and the other purpose is to lift the film up, not that it sags, but people need a lift after such a brooding opening hour, so it helps. The young lovers are cute. Anthony is far too pretty and really doesn't make me think he wants Johanna. I think she was good. The kid who played Toby could sing, but man was he stiff. I mean, really, sell it kid! Sell it! But for me, I will forever be indebted to Tim Burton. He did it right. He remained faithful and even improved on some things. He did an awesome job and I hope he's nominated."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","3","27 December 2007"," ""Sweeney"" and Burton form a beautiful marriage
","If there is anyone that can do justice to Stephen Sondheim's sadistic musical on the silver screen, it is Tim Burton. ""Sweeney Todd,"" the director's latest, is an all around marvel of a film and Burton's most award-worthy project in a long time.<br/><br/>""Sweeney"" stars Burton favorite Johnny Depp as the vengeful demon barber and of course Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, accompanies him as the strangely romantic accomplice, Mrs. Lovett. All that needs to be said about the plot is that it is based on vengeance, there is little dialogue not done in musical verse and it is very, very dark, insanely so.<br/><br/>Depp delivers as the crazed, murderous Barber with a performance that after about thirty seconds could make anyone forget he uses the same exact accent for Jack Sparrow. Even his singing voice reaches levels that provide a dark yet beautiful quality for his deeply disturbed character. Bonham-Carter is not the best singer, but she gives the role an eerily humorous quality that works nicely. All the supporting roles prove excellent including Alan Rickman as Todd's nemesis, Timothy Spall as Rickman's despicable assistant and even ""Borat"" star Sacha Baren Cohen proves his ability to impersonate another nationality in the role of an Italian rival barber.<br/><br/>From beginning to end the direction is superb and with Tim Burton's stamps all over it. The art direction, cinematography and costumes are all incredible and add a quality to the musical that the stage simply cannot. The dark palette (which accentuates the blood that Burton is clearly a big fan of) with specific color choice in parts truly brings out the strange beauty that Sondheim's music brings to this chilling tale.<br/><br/>If you don't have a sensitive gag reflex, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a worthy film for anyone with the maturity to sit down and appreciate the nuance and the beauty of very dark tragedy. It is definitely not a film to watch when you want to be highly entertained, but it is an incredible story that is in the best of hands if one is ready to view it."
"dizozza","10","1","3","27 December 2007"," More film and music comments... Sweeney Todd from 30 years ago...
","30 years ago? This story is older than that. There's no place like London...<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, the story made a quantum leap to LIFE... the characters became alive from their relatable drives and passions. It's probably the songs, but maybe something more from the ... poetics? Imagine a new movie delivering this level of musical intensity. (I probably wouldn't recognize it until 30 years later.) ..anyway...<br/><br/>The CONTEXT in which a standard song like Pretty Women is delivered adds to it another dimension, both hilarious and intense.<br/><br/>Following the what, the coitis interruptus at the barber chair between the barber and his customer, there's the rage, then the waltz, then the great montage, one of my favorite musical moments, which begins with a reprise of the song, Johanna, as an intro to a new song and a series of throat slicings, followed by the re-opening of the pie shop...<br/><br/>I'll bet Ms. Bonham Carter has a nasal Broadway vocal somewhere in her. Anyway, she's so cute and scary... the whole cast is that ...<br/><br/>The film is a great addition to the basic great score which includes a miraculous book. I am a fan of REAL TIME... Many shattering events follow from the song, ""No One's Going to Harm You"" to the ending credits, and they basically happen in REAL TIME...<br/><br/>Allan Rickman is remarkable, a great vulnerable foil for Johnny Depp, who appears as someone already familiar to many of us.<br/><br/>Sasha Borat Cohen still needs to play Saddam Hossain...<br/><br/>The film magnificently delivers the orchestral strains of the score.<br/><br/>The voices work well. Good sound blend! This film successfully layers a new level of creativity upon the other layers.<br/><br/>It's a good new film from Warner Brothers! Congratulations Mr. Burton and Mr. Sondheim!"

"kelseymaryy","10","1","3","24 December 2007"," How many times can I say amazing?
","A lot, apparently. This movie was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend going to see it. It was so good. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have made, I think 6 or 7 movies together and this one was just GREAT. <br/><br/>It's a very dark story, about a man who's suffered loss to get vengeance on the people who had caused him that loss. It's an amazing musical with awesome songs, Helena Bonham Carter also had a lead role, and her songs were the hardest. Very fast and she was always doing something during them. Very complicated, she even said about them.<br/><br/>For some who don't know the story, Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a happily married father who works as a barber, he's thrown in jail and turns into Sweeney Todd. He comes back, to find his family gone and wants them back. He meets up with Mrs.Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who is a very unsuccesful baker. They team up, he gets revenge on the people who had helped put him away, and Mrs.Lovett and him find something to do with all of them, they get her more business, and are very sly. And, you know AMAZING.<br/><br/>It's rated R, because you constantly see Sweeney Todd slashing people's throats, mature themes, etc. But I highly recommend going to see it, it's an amazing story, amazing musical. Sweeney Todd has already been nominated for 4 Golden Globes. Including Best Actor (Depp) Best Actress (Bonham Carter), and Best Movie, I don't remember the 4th one, though.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is a very good actor, one of the greatest I've ever seen in any movie, he can take on any character with no problem at all, Helena Bonham Carter, as well. There are many great actors in this movie, them, including Alan Rickman, and the man who played Borat. <br/><br/>This movie, all I can say is AMAZING, go see it. You will NOT be disappointed."

","Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd His skin was pale and his eye was odd He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again<br/><br/>The long-awaited adaptation of ""Sweeney Todd"" from stage to screen has finally arrived and Tim Burton is reaping rave reviews, Christmas cheer and the joy of the birth of his first child with longtime girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter. With an already extensive body of work, Burton has most certainly completed his largest project to date and not only is it his magnum opus, it is Oscar bait as well.<br/><br/>Returning for his and Burton's sixth collaboration, Johnny Depp shoulders the role of the title character, a barber of good repute whose beautiful wife Lucy is stolen away by the conniving Judge Turpin (Rickman). Returning to London from a 15-year exile, the woeful and bitter Benjamin Barker (Depp) assumes the moniker of Sweeney Todd and in cahoots with the wily Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) begins slicing men's throats en masse with his prized razors. He soon discovers that his daughter Johanna (Wisener) is a virtual prisoner in Turpin's home and is determined to exact his revenge, all the while providing the main ingredient for Mrs. Lovett's re-popularized meat pies.<br/><br/>Depp looks like Beethoven on crank (or Edward Scissorhands if he'd gotten a perm) and Bonham Carter is a Raggedy Ann doll from hell. Both give admirable performances but singing-wise, they're sub-par. Yes, yes, I know that Depp never got a single singing lesson and coached himself and he's to be commended. Bonham Carter did get singing lessons and even studied baking to prepare for her performance as Mrs. Lovett but she still manages to do nothing more than carry a tune, and that's my assessment of most of the other castmates as well. I found myself more than once thinking, ""No, no, noSING, DAMMIT!"" To hear these songs sung by the 1979 original Broadway cast has Depp and Bonham Carter PALING in comparison to the likes of Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The only voices that rise slightly above mediocre are Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (""Johanna"") and Ed Sanders as Toby (""Not While I'm Around""). Broadway material most of these people are NOT, especially when trying to bring to life the music of Stephen Sondheim but their acting makes up for it, thank goodness. <br/><br/>Of course, most of the youth who will flock to the cineplex are fans of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and they won't be disappointed. Depp faithfully emotes with utmost excellence and gives Sweeney a snarling intensity worthy of another Oscar nod. Bonham Carter brings a certain sweet psychosis to our dearest Mrs. Lovett and Alan Rickman makes us smile as well as squirm with his portrayal of the perverted Judge Turpin. My personal favorite is Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant Signor Pirelli  he'll get many chuckles as well as ovations with his overwrought Italian accent and surprising operatics.<br/><br/>For those who are fans of Tim Burton's dark and Gothic vision, you will salivate over his version of 19th-century London. He paints a fantastically dank and dirty metropolis awash in smoke, fog and pestilence. Renowned costume designer Colleen Atwood (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands) joins Burton's crew once again, draping Depp in frills, thrills and leather and appareling Bonham Carter in playfully daring couture. Hair and makeup are superb and the violent nature of the story has not been sugarcoated in the least  ""Sweeney"" is fully saturated in gore, blood literally spraying from people's throats and corpses plunging into the dungeon-like basement of the pie shop with a sickening thud. <br/><br/>On a scale of one to ten, ""Sweeney Todd"" rates an 8. Had it not been for the notably average vocals, it'd be a real scream in my book."

I also am not that big of fan of Tim Burton, I have seen several of is movies and have only liked Sleepy Hollow and Frankenwiennie. I started watching the film and new it was a musical, but I can't stand it when most of the movie is sung. I had to turn the caption on because I couldn't hear some of the dialog. I watched an hour of it, and it's not like I turned it off 5 minutes into the movie, I just couldn't get into it. I thought this was one of the worst roles for Johnny Depp, of coarse thats my opinion. To me he no matter how hard he tries, is not not a villain.

","This film is ruined by the fact it is a musical. The actors CAN'T SING! Their horrible attempts at singing make me want to gouge out my eardrums. Most everything else about the film is great. The actors do a good/great job playing their parts. The story is very fairytale-ish but it works well enough to keep the viewer's attention until the very entertaining climax. Sacha Baren Cohen is annoying but thankfully doesn't last long. The imagery is dark and foreboding and the special affects really enhance the gruesomeness of the violent scenes and the hilarity of the comedic/dream scenes. If only there were no pathetic lyrics and no bad singing.<br/><br/>Tim Burton clearly does not know how to direct a musical. He directs it like he does any of his other films which is not appropriate for a musical. It is awkward to have characters walking around like normal just to spontaneously break out into song. It feels like he took a normal film and spliced/dubbed in musical numbers. Successful musicals do not present things directly like normal films. They hint at stuff allegorically. In this way the singing/dancing is removed from reality and the viewer understands that it is there to emphasize a certain aspect of the plot. Two good examples of this are ""Chicago"" and ""All that Jazz"" where the song & dance numbers are presented as sort of dreams or delusions but still serve to explain certain feelings/motivations of the characters."
"tubby1","7","1","4","18 May 2008"," Darkly dramatic but without depth.
","Unfortunately, I felt that Sweeney Todd proceeded from one-musical piece to another without the necessary development. Although music can, to some extent embody emotions better than the written word, in this instance, it gave one insight but not enough depth.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is certainly dramatic enough to maintain interest but I felt unfulfilled by its drive towards the climatic end. The music at times is overly long, which could of been better utilised through dialogue. However, the acting is excellent with Johnny Depp, Helen Bonham Carter, Allan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen all producing fine performances.<br/><br/>The films dark story, excellent production design and dramatical musical score do portray the black emotional core of Sweeney Todd, and it has its periods of excellence, but it does not have sufficient substance come the end."

","Tim Burton's dark adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical stars Johnny Depp as the titular character Sweeney Todd.

He returns and reopens his barber shop and ""shaves the heads of gentleman never seen again."" His accomplice in crime is the over amorous Mrs. Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter), who makes meat pies out Sweeney's victims.

I thought he did a wonderful job considering he's not a singer! Helena Bonham Carter did an amazing job as well, she was PERFECT for the part.

","This movie is a marvel!!! It is a visual orgy of beauty; and the core of Burton's soul is embedded on the film. It is most probably the most beautiful film I have ever seen. The music and script, which is based on the original Broadway play, (John Logan screenplay and Stephen Sondheim musical) is at times brilliant and at times a little corky; and this is just about the only negative thing I can say about this masterpiece. The film is more like an operetta than a musical. I loved evil Johnny!!! He can offer so much as a villain, I really hope to see him in more films like this. The make up and clothes are taken right out of my darkest dreams. Johnny and Helena , who have previously worked together in Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" look like they jumped right out from their ""Corpse Bride"" animated characters and took human form. They were both an absolute pleasure to watch. I left the theatre with a smile on my face and a ""blue"" in my soul. Mr Burton did it again. He has bewitched me. Mr Tim, I love you I love you I love you!!! And for those who frown on the idea of watching a musical . Think again. I'll tell you only this: ""Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". All musicals! All remarkable! Plus, don't forget one of the best movies of all times ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" ;) Sweeney Todd is a masterpiece. The Photography is ridiculously good. The sets are out of this world, the camera work is ingenious the editing is excellent and the direction of this film is done by a deity! I am going to watch it over and over and over again . . ."

","I'm very thrilled about this movie, I hadn't watched anything so entertaining for a very long time.<br/><br/>Opposing to what some people say, the drawbacks from the original story in this movie is exactly what was needed. Todd being simply a mindless murder (a.k.a 'The bad guy') just doesn't keep you entertained. This movie goes a bit deeper, trying to explore the mind of the murder, leaving space for one's own thought, not artificially trying to put on assumptions.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is definitely my favorite movie of Year 2007. I am no big fan of either Burton or Depp, but this movie just takes you away with it's style. I'm am not even fan of musicals, but putting melody in the conversations just makes it a tad more interesting and entertaining.<br/><br/>I hope people would more often rate movies as a piece of filmography, not conformity to some actor's usual roles, or the accordance to original story. I, as a person who hadn't heard anything about Sweeney Todd before, and watched this movie not because Depp is staring, think it's great, entertaining, thoughtful and even funny."

I'm not the biggest musical fan but I thought this would be okay with Burton and Depp involved. But I was finding the whole thing really frustrating for the first twenty or thirty minutes. People were walking out and I have since heard that people in other screenings were also. I stuck with it though and it did get better. The film looks amazing with it's typical Burtonesque look and Depp and Carter are on the ball as usual. The big thing for me though is that if you're going to make a film from a musical show you should at least put a few more words in to carry the story along. I know there'll be some pompous Pratt thinking I didn't get it. I did but it was all just a bit flat. It felt like it was missing something. I just thought I would throw this in because the reviews are on a whole over the top (blinded by past and cast) If you like musicals you will find it good,not amazing and if you don't avoid it like the plague."

","Sweeny Todd is Tim Burton's latest Gothic thriller and as much as I adore Tim Burton's individuality this movie did not make me come out saying it was another amazing triumph for Burton. <br/><br/>The movie started off a slow and in the first few minutes (the titles) the blood looked like candle wax, nothing scary whatsoever about candle wax is there? Depp's singing is amazing, his crispness whilst singing fits perfectly with Todd and his killer mind/status. Throughout the story line flips between Johannas starting love and Todd's killing, so there is a kind of sweet versus sour set to the movie. Set at an age 18 this would not scare a 15 year old. I usually find thrillers terrifying and my mate had to force me to go see Sweeny Todd but I don't think this is a great movie. Burton's individuality for movie making shines through all the way in the movie but this movie could have been a lot better. <br/><br/>See the movie and tell me what you think, I felt a bit disappointed and I wait for Burton's next movie. Musicals are great but maybe not quite Burton's style. Bohem Carter also does a great job in this movie, she is meant to be scary but you just end up loving her, the style and the way she talks is just adorable. <br/><br/>This is my view of the movie, this is not official."

","The darkest, bloodiest, and most disturbing musical I've ever seen, that's one thing for sure. This is the musical material that suits best for Tim Burton. The musical and the surrounding sets are really blending well. It creates an experience only Tim Burton can offer. This is what ""The Phantom of the Opera"" should have looks like, but unfortunately didn't because it falls into Schumacher hands.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws. Tim Burton trimmed down 3 hours musical into 2 hours. The result is obvious in here. Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) in this movie is nothing more than an additional character, while the relationship between Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) in the beginning is never well explained. Even Sweeney Todd motives in this movie besides revenge were not well explains. If he knows that Johanna still alive, why it seems like he never try to find her? <br/><br/>But despite the flaws, there something great in the movie that makes me want to watch it again. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. For a person who doesn't like musical, this movie might pretty hard to digest. For a person who can not stand gore, this musical might be to violence for their taste. But if you are a musical lover that still can stand with the gore, this movie is the one to see."

","As far as the musical ""Sweeney Todd"" goes, they're getting closer to perfection in committing the play to movie memory. Unfortunately, they still have a long way to go.<br/><br/>This Tim Burton rendition cuts closer to the full vision than the 1982 TV film of the stage play starring Angela Lansbury, especially in casting a Johanna who doesn't look and sound like she found her way out of a production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Raggedy Anne,"" but it's still extremely minimal. Some songs have been cut out entirely; the title song has merely been freed of lyric.<br/><br/>The biggest sin of all here is the loss of lyrics from ""A Little Priest,"" including a complete removal of the ""fiddle player/piccolo player"" and ""financier"" bits. The song should be at least 7 minutes and 20 seconds long! Jamie Campbell Bower is a weak voice, as is Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>But Johnny Depp (shockingly) and Alan Rickman (not so shockingly) survive the day, as well as a very young actor playing Toby and nailing some of the most difficult songs ever written for musical theatre. The slasher violence is fantastic, and the production design lacks nothing.<br/><br/>However, as John Logan was almost as happy with a razor as Sweeney, the film still misses the mark. It should be a ten-star production."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","4","28 December 2007"," ""You'll drip rubies....""
","I have a definite problem with musicals. I have always had a hard time accepting characters suddenly bursting into song in movies, particularly in sad or glum situations which are not exactly very conducive to singing. Tim Burton achieved astonishing success in this area, even with non-musical fans like myself, with the brilliant Nightmare Before Christmas which, interestingly enough, is generally called ""Tim Burton's..."" despite the fact that he produced but didn't direct. But clearly, the movie exists in Tim Burton's unique and distinctive imagination. <br/><br/>Tim Burton's latest started off a little disappointing to me. I've been living in China for a year and am now home for the holidays, and this was one of the first movies I saw in the theater in the last 11 months, so I actually knew nothing at all about the movie as I walked in. All I knew was that Johnny Depp was in it and Burton directed, and that was enough for me. I was a little put off when I learned that it was a musical, indeed the first few musical numbers were a little tiring for me, but that was soon to change.<br/><br/>During the first 30 minutes, I was sure that Burton was trying to recreate his past success of setting musical films in his dark but charming worlds. After an hour, I started to think that he had really lost touch with his audience. At least I hoped so, as Depp sang his way through one throat-slitting after another. After an hour and a half, the charm of the story began to really set in, and by the closing scene, I was sure that this is yet another Burton/Depp classic. I was humming the songs to myself as I left the theater.<br/><br/>That all being said, the film is a technical masterpiece. Victorian London is re-created in stunning realism, although I like to think that even during the worst times of the industrial revolution London was never THAT dark and dirty. There are times when the plot is a bit confusing, but it's never unclear that the story covers a significant period of time and skillfully weaves several story lines together. <br/><br/>There will more than likely be a time during the movie when you will think that the copious amounts of spraying blood out of slit throats is just a little too much, as I did - - - well, I don't really know where to go with that. It's easy to say that the rest of the movies justifies the violence, or that this is typical of Tim Burton's style in this context, but something different happens here. <br/><br/>I spent almost the entire film in a state of disappointment and almost waiting for the end, but by the time the film ended everything had changed for me. It's unusual that a film doesn't become entirely appealing to me until literally the last show of the movie, but something like that happens here. Give this one a chance. Die hard fans are sure to be delighted no matter what, but the rest of you may need to have a little more of an open mind, even more than usual with Tim Burton films. I have a feeling that Burton earned a whole new breed of fans with Big Fish, and those are the people I'm talking to. This one might be best enjoyed more than once."
"the_Poppuns","5","3","26","21 December 2007"," Harry Potter and the Demon Barber of Fleet Street
","That's one of the alternate titles for the film I thought of while my mind drifted in the theater. Another was 'Everyone Says I Hate You'. Now obviously Sweeney Todd hates a few people but the real reason I came up with that is I was reminded of the Woody Allen musical from the 90s. In that film Mr. Allen wanted to make a musical where normal people with normal voices would just burst into song as if musicals happened in real life. Well that was the point in that film but Sweeney Todd is meant to be a proper musical but generally speaking it's cast can't sing. Now let me be specific Johnny Depp can actually sing. He has a very lovely voice, but I don't think Sweeney Todd should have a lovely voice. It should be forceful, vengeful, angry, not pretty. (I'm no musical expert but I felt like his voice was just the wrong range. Too high.) Helena Bonham Carter is a weak singer too and I even believe that the sound mixers pumped up the accompaniment at times to drown them out a little. Sacha Baron Cohen can sing but he only really sings one song. Alan Rickman has an icky speaking voice so it just makes you wonder why Tim Burton hired these people. Okay I know. He likes them, they're his friends, whatever. But I wish someone else had gotten their hands on this musical and cast people who could sing. Jamie Bower can sing but his acting amounted to a perpetual stink-eye.<br/><br/>I had a bad feeling from the beginning about this one but I kept hearing how great it was and now that I've seen it I just think people don't want to say anything bad about Johnny Depp. I don't either but there are so many other actors in Hollywood that could have played this role that it makes me long for the movie I could have seen. On top of that I didn't buy him as an angry vengeful guy. He's too nice. It comes through. Every time he squished up his face because he was singing/angry he just looked like a bunny.<br/><br/>On top of all that, it's too Tim Burton. I know he has his own style but because this was pre-existing material I would have liked it to look a little less typical Burton. One thing that I thought looked absolutely awful was the 'Clash of the Titans' vintage blood. When a character is killed in that film and the blood comes out it looks like spaghetti sauce. They got the same stuff for this film it seems. So all the people complaining about the blood in this film must eat their pasta plain. My one excuse for such sad looking blood was that it was some kind of throwback to the Hammer horror films, and it did seem like they were trying to make a Hammer musical but it was too dark and drained of all color for that. The attempts at humor didn't come off as dark comedy to me. It just strayed into silliness. So really I put it all on Tim Burton. I don't know what happened because I usually enjoy his films quite a bit. The one shining light was the little boy (Ed Sanders) who can sing and act.<br/><br/>I have seen the DVD of the stage version of this musical with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury. So I'm going to say that it really didn't help me to enjoy this film. If you haven't seen that, I'd say see this film first, if you're interested, then go back and watch that. They changed a lot from what I can remember. But if you've seen the musical previously I can't imagine that you'd be very happy with this version. The other thing is that there have been many musical this year with great singing in them. So if this one gets recognized when those others should, that'll be very disappointing.<br/><br/>I certainly hope people don't bring little kids to this because Johnny Depp's in it. Because even though it's pasta sauce and CGI meat, there's still a unhealthy dose of it."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Horror-musical about the one and only Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) who slashes throats as a barber and sends the flesh downstairs to Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) so that she can make her meat pies. All of this so that Sweeney can seek vengeance against the man (Alan Rickman) who stole his wife and child. I've yet to see a review who mentioned the 1936 Tod Slaughter film but I'll do so right now. There's no question this is a better version but in the end I've never hated a film that I loved so much. There's so much brilliance in this film that it's a shame I didn't enjoy it more but the first thirty-minutes were somewhat brutal for me. I really wasn't enjoying any of the songs nor was I enjoying any of the build up of the characters. I thought the songs were rather weak and the film took way too long to get to the build up, which finally happens when Sacha Baron Cohen's character hits the screen. This is when the story of the vengeance starts to unfold and this is when Burton and the cast really starts to shine. I'm not sure what it was but this is when the film took off for me and Depp really started to shine in what has to be one of his greatest performances. Yes, he's not much of a singer but I think he actually did great during the songs that deal with anger. When Depp let his voice go in anguish screams I thought the songs were very powerful. Carter can't sing that well either but I think the songwriters and Burton did a nice job of hiding this by giving her songs some nice comic touching, which the actress nailed perfectly. The ending of the film is highly dramatic is quite beautiful as is most of the visuals in the film. I hate CGI but thought Burton used it very well here in this fantasy world. I was also shocked at how bloody and violent this film was with all the throat slashings. Burton lets the blood flow very deep so I'm shocked so many people were going to see the film. Perhaps a second viewing will let me enjoy the start of the film more but there's still plenty of stuff here to love but I couldn't help wish that I had loved all of it."

","This movie is a bizarre experience for a viewer who is familiar with the music, including the vocals. While the actors have been able to master the timing (no small thing) of the music, they simply aren't singers. Thus Mrs. Lovett sounds like a breathy 3rd grader: HBC simply hasn't the breath support to project a mature sound. It was like some freaky form of synesthesia, switching from sound to visual. I had to almost block out that in which I had always delighted: the power of the music and the verbal gymnastics. Yes, too, the script was significantly dumbed down. I can't imagine how brilliant Tim B must be to make all of these decisions. His usual fascination with gadgets and design were fascinating, and Colleen Atwood's costumes were amazing. And, in the end, the compromises in vocal talent and narrative were simply too much of an impediment for me to appreciate the movie with true abandon. Besides, the audience was really dumb---the inability to grasp 98% of the word play depressed one. (And this was in Harvard Square). One was fully aware of not being in a Broadway audience, alas. These were Tim Burton, not Sondheim, people."

","""Sweeney Todd""<br/><br/>A film directed by Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays lead.<br/><br/>The two main reasons that got me to see the movie -- and my god any crusty plot -- would make me see it again if those two conditions were applied. Johnny Depp remains to be a stunning actor that is only boosted by my hero Tim Burton. Tim Burton knows how to direct. There were a couple of angles that hindered me from fully appreciating the movie that laid out before me but I shall only show two.<br/><br/>1) Character Development You see hardly any development from the fellow criminal Mrs. Lovett besides the fact that she's madly in love with Mr. Todd. The development you do see mostly comes from Mr. Todd's part and it's constant repetition of how ""there once was a barber and his pretty wife yada yada..."" You never hear how he came to be rich, how he fell in love with his wife, or any real connection between his wife in the fist place. I felt more love between Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd than Mr. Todd and his wife which was the real reason of what really drove him to his insane killing sprees. There's a lot more complaining in the character development but I'll switch to another area of weakness.<br/><br/>2) Ending The picture was quite nice really... the way he held onto his dead cat-lady-esquire wife as his throat gushed with blood was very emotional. From the director's angle. But w-t-f. How is the audience supposed to know he **loved** his wife that much? Sure the killing of people in revenge was a symbol, but what was their life before that? I really wanted to cry at that scene. I just couldn't... I felt the tears welling on my face but they couldn't fall... they just couldn't. The director really took a gamble with the beautiful end. Burton was forced to making it so glorious and meaningful so we can forget his daughtaur. Geez what a twit. A lovable twit. Bless him, really. <br/><br/>All my 7 stars go to Johnny Depp's acting and Tim Burton's eerie film making."
"jamhorner","7","1","5","28 December 2007"," A Close Shave
","I enjoy Tim Burton for a few reasons, mostly concerning his style of view, he is very Gothic and dark and his newest movie Sweeny Todd is no exception. It has the very same tone and coloring as Sleepy Hollow and the same musical numbers as Corpse Bride or Nightmare before Christmas. The story tells of a barber whose wife is stolen by the town's judge, while he was sentenced and banished. Upon returning back to the town, he seeks revenge on the judge and befriends a woman who makes horrible meat pies. But he later starts killing just for fun. This movie has the Burton feel that I was looking for, the makeup, including blood, was excellent, as well as wardrobe, the acting was okay and so was the musical numbers and the murders were very.awkward. I enjoyed this film, not the best Tim Burton can do, but a great film nonetheless.<br/><br/>To kick it off, the art direction, as well as the makeup and wardrobe were outstanding! Like I said, this movie had the standard Burton feel of being dark and gloomy, with many shades of grey and white. There were some musty tones and some bright sunny tones, just like Sleepy Hollow. The architecture of some of the houses did not have the Burton feel like crooked framework, weird designs and awkward shaped trees. The makeup was amazing! Each person had the pale-faced look with dark shadows under the eyes, they had that really Gothic look but at the same time they accomplished the feel of 18th or 19th century look. The wardrobes in this film were really good, better than Sleepy Hollow, and they seemed more complex in look. The three costumes I really enjoyed is Mrs. Lovett's, Judge Turpin's and Pirelli's. This movie has to win something for Best Costuming if not Art Direction.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, as was the musical numbers. Depp's performance as Sweeney Todd was pretty good and seemed like a sober Jack Sparrow, however, I did not think that his full acting abilities were met in this film, but it still was pretty great. Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Mrs. Lovett, was, sad to say, better than Johnny. She really brought depth and feel to her character. Her character also seemed to have the better one-liners too. There were great performances by Timothy Spall, Laura Michelle Kelley, Ed Sanders and Jamie Bower. Alan Richman had a small part, but for a small part, he seemed pretty good, a bit too ""light"" though. Sacha Baron Cohen, actually seemed creepy and disturbed, but I can't pass up the fact that he is Borat. The musical numbers were.interesting. The lyrics were very well written and the way that each is played out was great, but the actors and actresses who sand seemed as though they were trying not to laugh. I don't think that Depp, Cohen or Richman can sing, or Spall. But the manner in which they carried out, I enjoyed.<br/><br/>The horror in this film was very Burton-like. However, this movie does not have any ""jump-out"" scares but rather the goriness and the implied horror approach. Gore: Tim Burton has a nack for gory movies and this movie is no exception, with extremely bloody throat slitting, blood letting and neck breaking, this movie accomplishes its fair share of red colors. The blood is his ""trademark"" blood, from Sleepy Hollow, as in, thick, red and viscous, rather than what blood should look like. The implied horror is there, especially when it involves its own musical number and the meat pies. Another great example of implied horror is the whole idea of a tragic hero turned murder, almost poetic in the sense of a man who lost everything. But other than that, it is not as scary as some of Burton's other work.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a pretty good movie; it has everything that a horror musical should have; gore, implied horror, murder, music and Tim Burton. Even though the character could have put a bit more effort in this film, they did a pretty great job with what they had. This film was a very interesting film and something different for Tim Burton. I honestly think that this film was not as big of a hype as many people and web-sites made it, but it did not let my faith in Tim Burton disappear, but it wasn't an epic musical. I would recommend this movie to horror fans, but with a warning that the musical number can be a bit distracting. As for musical buffs, the gore might steer you away from this film. As for me, I enjoyed it because I'm well rounded and it really gave me a close shave."

","I'm in the minority, but I actually didn't like it as much as I was expecting to. It was good and well-done, but I went into it expecting the amazing movie that I'd heard so much about and left feeling disappointed. Maybe if I were to see it again I might appreciate it more. It's hard to finger exactly what disappointed me, but I guess it was just that everything could have been done better, at least to me. In one review I read it stated that the show had been cut from over three hours to just over two without losing anything. I disagree. I felt that a lot of characterization was lost and that everything moved very, very fast. I know Helena Bonham Carter legitimately won the part of Mrs. Lovett, and she was very good, but I couldn't ignore that nagging feeling that other actresses might have been better. And I love, love, love Johnny Depp, but I couldn't help but feel his performance was a little...one note. Yes, it once again displays his chameleon talent and yes he nailed the part, but there wasn't that much to nail. There are several scenes where he's very good, but several where he gets easily overshadowed by others on screen. He also hardly speaks, Mrs. Lovett had a bigger part than him. Judge Turpin's lecherousness could have been fleshed out a lot more. <br/><br/>On the whole, it was very good, the style was great, the actors as an ensemble were great, but I guess to me, once I start examining the separate parts, it suffers.<br/><br/>I still say it is definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure I would name it the best movie of the year."
"Jawsphobia","Null","1","5","25 December 2007"," more fun going there than getting there
","The Tim Burton signature style is in place and there is a lot of wit on display though not much laughter in the audience. This is likely as good a movie as could be made of Sweeney Todd, however. I was restless during the daughter/ward's light little song at the window and eager to see the partnership formulate between Barber and Cook, a moment which feels long in coming when it arrives. I miss the a few chorus bits from the play, including the title which puts one in the mind frame of opera and also the lyrics ""God that's good"" although the scene and song associated with it remain. It seems they just made a choice to let individuals do the singing and eliminate any chorus. The movie is more about a kind of dark, giddy anticipation of fun nastiness until the tragedy of ""idiot plot"" elements is revealed, what the late Gene Siskel used to call the questions that might reasonably have been asked which would have stopped the movie in its tracks. Despite the fact that the material both celebrates rage and revenge while at the same time preaching indirectly that it is married to indiscriminate evil. . . the film is diverting. It hasn't got the sweet or underdog core of Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, but it is fun. If you hate musicals it may not turn you and it's not as kitchy fun as Grease or Little Shop; it's in the middle, slamming the elite while selling them tickets for years and giving them a close shave."
"saintnikolas","6","1","5","22 December 2007"," good adaptation, but a little stagey
","Tim Burton and his collaborators did a fine job translating the essence of the Stephen Sondheim's stage musical to the big screen. The grim story and haunting music seem tailormade for Burton, and the casting was dead-on, from Johnny Depp as the revenge-bent barber, to the trio of young unknowns in the supporting cast. <br/><br/>My main gripe is that the adaption doesn't really advance visually from the stage production. As in the play, there are only a couple of sets, but given the drab color palette, relatively ordinary shot compositions, and somewhat banal character design (Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter are made up like stereotypical Burton goths), the aesthetics never truly transcend their stage roots. The adaption succeeds because the source material is rendered faithfully and skillfully, but as a movie it still feels a bit like a filmed play. With a more expansive set design, and perhaps a few inspired twists and innovations with the characters and musical arrangements, the movie could have taken the play to a more cinematically expressive level. Nonetheless, it works as an effective (and bloodier) version of the play, while exposing a new generation of fans to Sondheim's eerie and clever songs."

"mockturtle","7","1","6","26 December 2007"," Quite good, but not in comparison to the stage version.
","1 - I can see how if you don't know Sondheim or this show how this film could blow your mind, and then you get to go see the DVD of the Hearn/Lansbury and find out it's even better (they should advertise that DVD). That said I have many quibbles, but one big point: they should have dropped ""By The Sea"" and included ""Kiss Me"" because without it A) You only see the lovers as a distraction and nuisance B) You miss out on the character of Johanna. Surprise surprise for people that have seen the movie and not the play, Johanna is an interesting character! Actually, a good production of this show will imply that she is as damaged in her own way as her parents. Cut lyrics: ""Are you discussing or fussing/Or simply dreaming?/Are you crowing?/Are you screaming?"" Then they show she's a hysteric at another point, and then she kills someone but I won't ruin that. But with the movie treating them as a nuisance and plot device there is a big hole.<br/><br/>2  Cutting the Judge's song was regrettable, but I was more disappointed in Timothy Spall's shallow Mad Hatter take on the Beadle. It really has made me appreciate the recent Broadway revival performance by Alexander Gemignani that much more, he really made that character pop. I've never seen Tobias as a boy before, he's usually an idiot man-child, it was interesting but restrictive.<br/><br/>3  Having Sweeney as a tenor (and a rock tenor at that) created an imbalance, everybody except the Judge had a thin, reedy voice, I felt like I might get a nosebleed. Bonham-Carter's voice especially did not live up to the large orchestrations behind it, the discrepancy during ""The Worst Pies in London"" was very jarring.<br/><br/>4  By the Sea  yes it was funny, and I especially appreciated the opening image with a Seurat homage in the background, but you already had Pirelli for comic relief and we needed more character for Johanna instead. Also, again, they cut the best lyrics: By the sea, in our nest, we could share our kippers/With the odd payin' guest from the weekend trippers,/Have a nice sunny suite for the guest to rest in,/Now and then, you could do the guest in! <br/><br/>5  I would have liked Depp's accent more if anyone else had the same one.<br/><br/>6  the endingwhy would you choose to go out with a whimper instead of a bang? <br/><br/>7  positive things: The theater was packed, so kudos. The extreme gore that wasn't even a requirement was delightful, I was very impressed that instead of sugar coating it and allowing us to become complicit he instead made their actions more repellent and distanced us from the two of them at every occasion, especially with Sweeney, it was a brave choice. As I said above, these are quibbles, I'm glad they made the movie and that it's a success."
"judywalker2","6","1","6","25 December 2007"," Agree, Good but
","I admit never seeing the play Sweeney Todd so I guess I was a bit naive going into this film; I thought the play was a comedy and so I thought the movie would be the same- murder and mayhem with humor. Sadly this isn't. Yes Johnny Depp is his usual good, somber self and Helena Bonham Carter matches him and get the few laughs there are. But the movie leaves you as cold and the many slit throat bodies that pile up and it gets very tiresome very quickly. In fact what could have been a great love story, Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney and his former wife, Anthony and Johanna is reduced to slick blood and blank stares. Tim Burton is too much in love with his one sided view of Johnny Depp. He needs to look a little deeper and he should have looked a little deeper into this story as well. Then he could have made a great movie and we could sure use one this year."

I'll admit it is a great looking film with great actors and it is always nice to see a Broadway musical on film, but there is just something there that kept me from coming away with a ""WOW"" as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Maybe it's knowing the show so well and what a big scope of a thing it is on-stage and then to find it all in the cramped quarters of a movie screen with all the choral music missing. Some of those sounds and harmonies are just as haunting as the show itself.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, it is great to have it added to the list of adapted Broadway musicals and Tim Burton was the perfect choice to do this kind of film, but........."

","I know my 14-year old daughter won't agree with me on this score cause she loves Johnny Depp. I saw a double feature this day - first ""P.S. I Love You,"" which I thought was great and then this movie. I only give a 3 because I give Johnny credit for his singing.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely disgusting. I felt like I was going to puke during parts of it. I cannot understand how a movie like this can be nominated for awards, but ""Chuckie"" and ""Freddy"" movies are not. To say it's dark and morbid is an understatement. Plus, I got so sick of the same scenes over and over again and the mass killings as I said made me sick to my stomach. I told my husband I'd rather watch ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and then remembered that Johnny Depp got brutally murdered in that movie. Well, I guess he decided in this movie to become ""Freddy."" Teenagers will most likely love this movie, but if they're the least bit squeamish, send them to the other movie, which deals with death beautifully.<br/><br/>Also, I must comment because Gerard Butler played ""Phantom"" in ""The Phantom of the Opera."" That was a much better movie than this one. The acting was better, the killings weren't disgusting, and Gerard Butler sang amazingly. I've heard comments that he didn't, but I believe his vocals were much more emotional than anything in this movie.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm a huge Gerard Butler fan. But that's because he can play any part from ""300"" to ""Phantom"" to a love story. He doesn't get stuck playing for the same director in the same dark part (Captain Jack notwithstanding). Johnny Depp makes the same choking sound when he's eating meat pies as when he played the choking part in ""Edward Scissorhands.""<br/><br/>Laura"

","I can't comment on the actual movie as I refuse to go to see it as the trailer and raves by gratuitous gore-lovers have put me off completely when I had originally expected to see it. I liked earlier Burton work and most especially anything with Johnny Depp and I was hoping this movie would raise the level of the dreadful Sondheim music which I tried to listen to years ago and gave up on as it was just so boring. But then it's rare for me to appreciate anything this self-satisfied composer Sondheim has produced with the one exception of In the Park with George which was a clever idea and nicely presented visually even though the music was as usual simply awful.<br/><br/>I worked for years in the Fleet Street vicinity so was very well aware of this famous old story. It would have been good to see a movie based on it - but not when it's covered in gratuitous gruesome gore and disturbing scenes which according to the write-ups it is. I would guess even Sondheim managed a few laughs in his stage musical and the gore wasn't meant to be quite so gratuitous? So my one star indicates absolute disappointment."

","Film version of the play. Based on fact it tells the story of a man (Johnny Depp) who is jailed (for no good reason) for 15 years. It was done by slimy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) because he wanted his wife and child. 15 years later he returns, adopts the name Sweeney Todd and sets out for vengeance. He's helped by Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who uses the meat from his victims to put into her meat pies which become VERY popular.<br/><br/>I saw the play back in 1980 with Angela Landsbury and George Hearn. I remember loving it and the acting was superb. This version just doesn't match up--it can't! Tim Burton correctly shoots it in seriously drained color and he gets a superb performance by Depp and young Ed Sanders (as Toby). Everybody can sing too. Also the murders are shown with blood gushing out--once onto the camera lens! Still it's impossible to take them seriously. Still this has its drawbacks. Carter is terrible--she can sing but her acting is pretty dreadful. Rickman has done the evil act once too often--and it shows. Also it's depressing! It wears you down running on for two full hours. Some songs were cut out too--I really miss ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". So--it's not a disaster but it could have been so much better with a different leading lady and not cutting ANY of the songs. Depp really puts this film across though--for him alone I give this a 7."
"davidmvining","10","0","1","22 June 2020"," Burton and Sondheim
","I absolutely love this movie in all its macabre glory. I love Sondheim's music. I love the look of the film from costumes to set design to the special effects. I love the performances. I love the story. I love how everything weaves together in a complete package. And, on top of it, while the movie seems to wallow in nihilism, it actually ends up being a rebuke of nihilism as empty and self-destructive, which is a nice bit of irony to top it all off.<br/><br/>Benjamin Barker was a naïve young barber with an attractive and virtuous wife and a young daughter. The evil Judge Turpin coveted Lucy Barker, threw Benjamin in prison and sent to Australia, and took on Johanna, the daughter as his ward when Lucy refused his advances. Fifteen years later, Barker arrives back in London with a new, darker look and a new name, Sweeney Todd, with a single objective: revenge.<br/><br/>If I had to boil down the central point of this story to a single word, it would be corruption. Corruption of purpose, of the law, and, most importantly, the soul. There are very few innocents in this depiction of 19th century London, and those few left are attacked mercilessly until they break or are corrupted themselves. The central figure, Sweeney Todd himself, describes his former self as an innocent before the corrupt Judge Turpin threw him in jail, the experience of which corrupted him. Todd's singular purpose of vengeance blinds him to everything else around him. He barely sees the baker Mrs. Lovett, unless she's helping him in his quest. The only people he seems to have a clear eye towards are those who can help him or those who are impeding him. Turpin and his manservant Beadle Bamford are his main focus. The carnival barker of a barber Adolfo Pirelli goes from a way to attract attention to an impediment that must be dealt with. Even his daughter, the young woman he hasn't seen she was a babe, means nothing to him. She is just another tool in getting Judge Turpin to sit in Todd's chair for a very close shave.<br/><br/>So, our main character wallows completely in vengeance with no view of anything else, but what does it bring him and does the movie itself approve? First of all, his thirst for blood is most completely described in the number ""Try a Little Priest"" where, after being thwarted in his quest by Turpin leaving his shop, Todd commiserates with Mrs. Lovett and they both come up with a mutually beneficial solution. He can take his anger out on London and humanity by killing men left and right, and she'll have meat for her meat pies, pulling herself out of the situation of making the worst pies in London. They're both nearly giddy with the prospect of killing all types of people, no matter their station or vocation, but the very next number is of Todd slicing all of these throats and the music isn't nearly as joyful. It's actually a lament for his lost daughter where an interesting set of contrasts play out at the same time. The first is between Todd's actions and his words. He's bemoaning the loss of his little girl while killing people. The other is that it's actually a duet with Anthony, the young idealist who came off the boat with Todd who has fallen in love with Johanna after a single sighting and who is actually trolling the streets of London looking for her. What would make Todd happy at this time? The blood that spurts all over him does nothing to him, he barely feels it, but he says he yearns for this lost daughter. And yet, he never makes a single move himself to find her, free her, or reunite with her. He's so corrupted that he won't actually do anything to try and help her.<br/><br/>The anti-Todd in the film is little Tobias, a young urchin that formerly worked for the Italian Pirelli. He's wide-eyed, naïve, and eager to help Mrs. Lovett who, after the mysterious disappearance of Pirelli, took him in and saved him from another stint in the workhouse. He's blind to the evil going on around him, but he begins to sense that something is wrong, mostly emanating from Todd, a feeling that he confides with Mrs. Lovett. The irony is, of course, that Mrs. Lovett did more to direct Todd's evil outward that Todd did himself, so Tobias is caught in a trap. The resolution of the film, where Todd bares his neck for the child he knows stands behind him, is the exact right ending for both characters. Todd, realizing how blind he had been as he holds his wife's dead body in his arms, gives up everything, and Tobias takes the razor across his former master's throat, ending and evil rein of terror.<br/><br/>What really helps carry the movie all the way through is Steven Sondheim's music. From ""No Place Like London"" to ""Final Scene"" the music is literate, witty, and adept. It's all very good music, so to say. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter land somewhere between fine and subjects of nepotism in their renditions, but the rest are very good, mostly because most of the rest have been pulled from the actual musical world. The numbers are staged on a very small visual scale, usually a person or two in a small room and only occasionally breaking out of that paradigm (like when Todd moves around the streets unseen by anyone in ""Epiphany""). I think it helps the film that there's no dancing or large numbers, helping us focus more tightly on the characters as though the songs were just extensions of dialogue rather than excuses to show off musical skill.<br/><br/>I do not think that Tim Burton has made a better film. The look of the film, the sound of it, the execution of every scene is damn near perfect. It's one of those movies where director and material matched up perfectly to bring out the best in both. I absolutely love this film."

","25 December 2007. Less than either Moulin Rouge (2001) and Chicago (2002) but more than Evita (1996), Sweeny Todd incorporated dialogue in much less quantity than most musicals except for Evita which was exclusively sung. This dark musical fused dark humor in the beginning and was photographed in dank and black colors. Sweeney Todd based on the musical of the same name, did not take as much advantage of the theatrical film format as did Mouline Rouge or Chicago and many sequences seemed more like a Broadway production. Except for the subject matter and its R-Rating presentation of blood and gore, this musical while entertaining, compelling didn't forge new ground. The beginning of Sweeny Todd was reminiscent of Mouline Rouge in many ways...the look, the presentation, the setting. The songs themselves while eerily appealing had by the end much of the same tone, same flavor, same blend of sound unlike other musicals. Johnny Depp was exciting and compelling to watch, his expressions, his performance delivery. Perhaps, this musical is one for our times, reflective in an age of death, war, and torture. It is also a reflects on the demise and moral ambiguity of revenge and its descent into the furnace of hell. It is the the naiveté of the youth and the unfortunate abuse of youth that has made some of the have to grow up and take up responsibility far too early. Whether or not this strong social message is sufficient to survive time to maintain this musicals status as a great musical remains to be seen. Otherwise, it will descend itself into a period piece as a good but not classic movie. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter is one of the most versatile actresses in the business - - - but I still came away from this film disappointed. Carter, I thought, was good but miscast; Mrs. Lovett, I think, works best as an older character. Angela Lansbury, after all, was Stephen Sondheim's and Hal Prince's personal choice to play Mrs. Lovett on Broadway, and there are hints in the libretto as well, such as "" . . . a woman alone, with limited wind. . . "", that strongly point to an older Mrs. Lovett.
Depp, I felt, was not so much miscast as misdirected. His Sweeney is a humourless man, which deprives many of the songs of the flashes of savage fun that George Hearn brought to the part. (""A Little Priest"" and ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"" are the most obvious examples.)
I saw Lansbury and Len Cariou in the original Broadway production (damn, I wish I still had the Playbill!), and my opinions are certainly coloured by having seen the stage version and the Lansbury/Hearn film first, but still - - - despite being a thoroughly effective production, with some screen effects that do improve on the original, this film remains a distant second to Broadway."

","""I'll steaaaal youuu Johaaaaanaaaa"" *slashes an innocent man's throats* ""Johaaaaanaaaaaa"" *stabs neck with razor*! The unusual blend of yearning for love and slicing necks vengefully, yet oddly it works. Based on the infamous musical, an English barber returns to London after being exiled to seek revenge on a Judge who took his love away from him. How does one cure vengeance you might ask? Well, murder customers with a razor and process their cold bloody corpses into meat pies. Simple really, duhhhh. To recreate the Victorian melodramatic musical, you need someone who can visually entice you with gothic imagery. Someone who can balance gore and whimsical musicality. Obviously one candidate for the mighty task: Tim Burton. His notorious gothic and dark fantastical mind was perfect in adapting the musical. He is able to recreate specific stages that both replicated the musical production and created an entirely new cinematic edge. Whether it be Sweeney melodramatically singing to his razor blades or Mrs Lovett picturing her perfect life whilst grinding corpses, it all works as a surreal nightmare. Excessively gory which, again, sets itself apart from others. Depp and Bonham Carter both had strong vocals and gave committed performances that separated this from your typical cheesy musical, particularly the former's singing ability which really suited the role of Sweeney. A hint of 'Oliver Twist' with all the ""Laaaandaaaan!"" accents and a splash of ""Sleepy Hollow"" for the veil of darkness that shrouds Victorian London. The songs were enigmatic, particularly various renditions of the same song, however weren't really memorable. The second act unfortunately dragged due to the extensive melodrama and thin plot. Then the ending was far too rushed and concluded abruptly. Yet somehow, somewhere...it's one of the stronger entries in the genre (and I hate musicals). Dark, moody and edgy, serve me up a famous Mrs Lovett meat pie now because I'm taking a bite!"

That being said the problems I had with it was that we see several actors who play the same roles they have always played.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has slipped so much into doing different roles that he ends up playing the same characters over and over. You almost wonder if Sweeney Todd, Jack Sparrow, and The Mad Hatter are supposed to be related to each other. Helena Bonham Carter is in the same boat. They also aren't singers and had Burton gotten actual singers/actors then the soundtrack would have been so much better.<br/><br/>It is worth a watch, and it's enjoyable, but it does have it's flaws."
"blacey113","9","0","2","10 June 2012"," Worth-a-watch? Most definitely, for three reasons this film shouldn't be missed.
","Firstly, the stylised, sepulchral, pulsating city that Burton creates. Secondly, the startling performances of both the Hollywood favourites and the London stage and screen veterans couldn't provide a better accompaniment of inhabitants. And because of the beauty and thought that went into providing such visually striking images throughout make this an astounding piece of cinematography. OH, unless you're not = strong stomached or not so good with blood in which case it can definitely be missed, definitely, definitely... steer clear.<br/><br/>My Full Review Burton, Depp and Carter are The Usual suspects (sorry, no that's 61) and in many ways this is the ""usual"", typically unusual Burton film. Sweeney Todd is a perfect partner for the dark director – a twisted killer with an arterial fetish, a macabre grimy setting and an unrequited sexually frustrated relationship to boot. It is then, not surprising that the trio found success with this breathtaking (pun intended) hair-raising (again intended) film.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is an opera (scored by Stephen Sondheim), for those less aware imagine a musical is Facebook – an opera is Twitter (a place where it becomes necessary to sing every single thought and comment you may have in any situation. At the risk of sounding ignorant, opera is somewhat archaic, and certainly not a common feature of Hollywood films. Burton's success in this aspect is mixed. Generally, the focus on character and not on notes made for compelling viewing and the operatic epicism created incredibly potent moments within the piece – particularly from Sweeney (Johnny Depp) in his contemptful, malice filled belters. However other moments were undermined by this ludicrous gravity."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an amazing movie adapted from the famous Broadway musical about the story of Benjamin Barker, a man who was unjustly accused and sent to jail for 15 years. When he returns, he learns that his wife, Lucy, poisoned herself to death and that the evil Judge Turpin has kidnapped his daughter Joanna. Seeking for revenge against the whole world,Benjamin Barker, now under the new name of Sweeney Todd, opens up a barber shop where he uses his razors to assassin all the people who sit down on the barber's chair. Meanwhile, a woman who used to work at a pie shop, Mrs. Lovett, is his assistant, using the dead bodies to make meat pies for her customers. By first reading such a plot, the story may seem really appalling and ruthless. However, the movie brings meaning to the world, and highlights the roles of family, unjustness, good and evil, and harm in society.<br/><br/>In this movie, directed by the imagination of Tim Burton, also director of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland, two of my favourite movies, Johnny Depp plays the role of Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd, and Helena Bonham Carter plays the role of Mrs. Lovett. Alan Rickman also stars as the evil Judge Turpin. The acting in this movie is superb by all the stars. Johnny Depp delivers an amazing, incredible role as Sweeney Todd that drives the audience deep into the mind of Sweeney as he acts upon the people he encounters. I absolutely loved his performance! Helena Bonham Carter also delivered a stunning performance as Mrs. Lovett, and I love how she portrayed her character.<br/><br/>The soundtrack in this movie was gorgeous; the songs were all powerful and carried meaning to them.<br/><br/>Even though the movie was based on a musical, I feel that the ending was too tragic to be a perfect movie. Even if Sweeney Todd killed so many people, I didn't want him to die at the end of the film. I was hoping that perhaps he would change his perspective and turn on a new leaf. And to see Mrs. Lovett die as well when she was so loyal to Sweeney Todd was also not a pleasant ending. However, even though I would have preferred a better ending, the ending itself touches upon the different morals portrayed throughout the film.<br/><br/>I would agree that the movie is a little too violent. However, based on the descriptions I read, I actually was expecting it to be worse, but after watching the film, I can say it was not as bad as I expected it to be. However, there are some gruesome scenes that maybe shouldn't have been portrayed in such gruesome detail.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an amazing movie/musical adaptation! I absolutely loved it! 9/10!"

The grisly concept is one which has stuck in my mind throughout the years and if there was a team that could deliver an adaptation of a musical then surely it would be Burton and Depp.<br/><br/>There's no denying the wonderful settings, in fact everything that could be categorised 'mise en scene' is exemplary. It is a visual feast. However, and call me narrow minded, but the music just irritates me and I've been unable to get past that. 2 bars into each song I found it impossible not to sigh at mediocrity of each number.

I just don't know and would be happy to have someone explain it to me. I would love to see a breakdown of the film's popularity by sex and age. I have to think that a lot of the film's critics are just too reluctant to post negative views in the face of all the ten star reviews.<br/><br/>Certainly Johnny Depp is a very good actor and Tim Burton a talented film-maker.

"destroy-apathy","5","0","1","28 January 2011"," Didn't disappoint quite as much as I thought it would
","What Happened: Johnny Depp's Benjamin Barker returns to London under the alias of Sweeney Todd after a life in exile. He intends to exact revenge on the crooked judge Turpin who raped his wife and was the reason that He was sent away. Teaming up with Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs Lovett, he supplies the fresh meat that she needs to liven up her pie shop.<br/><br/>Themes/Message: Although it was mostly spectacle, it did have some thematic points. Mrs Lovett and Todd represent the skilled working classes: a baker and a hairdresser; both representing entrepreneurial sensibilities and have to work for a living. In the period in which the film is set, anybody well-off enough to pay for their shave must be part of the middle classes, most clearly embodied by Todd's original inspiration for this killing spree, judge Turpin. Therefore Todd has no qualms with dispatching these individuals to the meat grinder, whilst biding his time for the judge himself. The song when they hatched the plan was inspired by seeing these social types (Lawyers, Vicars, Bankers, etc) outside on the streets, walking around as if greater than the common man.<br/><br/>What it did particularly well: Once it got going, the spectacle of some of the scenes was entertaining. Bonham-Carter's character, I actually really like, which quite surprised me.<br/><br/>Where it may have fallen short, unimpressed or didn't quite reach potential: Couldn't help going in biased against the Depp-Carter-Burton triangle after severely disliking Alice and Willy Wonka. This prejudice was not helped by the sterile opening and Depp's first song, which was the most uncinematic of a pretty uncinematic bunch of musical numbers. Although there were a couple of good numbers, most were too static and seemed forced. Considering I had just seen Princess and the Frog where these things were so fluid, I was pretty disappointed on the whole.<br/><br/>Performance of the film: Sacha Baron Cohen as the fraudulently uber-Italian rival barber<br/><br/>Scene of the film: The introduction of Sacha Baron Cohen as the rival barber was the point that injected life into the film, which it managed to maintain up until the final act where it unravels a little.<br/><br/>Most outstanding or memorable feature: The couple of songs that it got right were great (they were just few)<br/><br/>More musings and discussion at Twitter - @destroyapathy"

"TheLittleSongbird","9","0","2","28 October 2010"," This unique take on the Broadway musical is to die for!
","For starters I like Tim Burton. He has been hit and miss this decade(Planet of the Apes being his worst), but when he is good(Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Ed Wood, Vincent, Beetle Juice and Big Fish) he is good. While not my personal favourite of his films, Sweeney Todd was very well done. Is it as good as the Broadway musical? No, the Broadway musical is a true masterpiece so this movie had a lot to live up to. And is it as good as the 80s stage version with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury? Personally, again I think not. These aside, Burton's take is one of his better works not only this decade but in his career.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a very unique film and very deftly realised. Few musicals have tackled such a dark theme or have boasted such a distinctive look, but this works extremely well. Burton directs wonderfully, and the script is deliciously macabre. The production design won an Oscar, and deservedly so, as it is astounding with all the palette of blacks and greys that contrast perfectly with Sweeney's cut-throat razor. Likewise with the music, Stephen Sondheim's songs and score are simply magnificent though I was disappointed at the omission of Sweeney's ballad which is superlative. The story is just as macabre as the script with a suitably grotesque and over-the-top last act and the murders are very, very bloody.<br/><br/>Last but not least the acting. What can I say? Nothing wrong as far as I can see. Johnny Depp is a wonderful and charismatic presence, and Helen Bonham Carter matches him perfectly as Mrs Lovett. Neither are trained vocalists, but they get into their songs with gusto and also tackle cockney accents and do an above-average job there too. Plus Alan Rickman's(who I love) Judge Terpin is the epitome of evil. All in all, an atmospheric and deliciously dark film and one of Burton's best. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

I love the concept itself of mocking musicals by making them gore (though it's not your original idea so I can't even attribute this to you). But listening to it being applied, what a pain! I acknowledge that Johnny Depp is good singer. The talent of any of your actors is the issue. It's just a pain because musical-style songs are boring. Almost always the same melody and it's the one which predominates here. So damned boring melody I couldn't listen to it and hence missed half the lines. And in fact, I am not even sure your intention was to mock musicals. But don't worry Tim, I still love you. Visually it was a pleasure. And this tale about the blindness of revenge is good by itself, black as I like. I am sure you could have done a great job of it without songs, but I will put this error on a need to explore.

","All of the movies by Tim Burton that I have seen have either been so quirky and bizarre that they were entertaining (or in the case of his 1994 masterpiece ""Ed Wood,"" brilliant) or so quirky and bizarre that they were over-the-top and too unusual to sincerely enjoy. Here, he makes a film that is both. For up to two-thirds of its running time ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a bizarre, humorous, and oddly delightful gem by Hollywood's most creative and innovatory auteur. And then the movie, which is based on a musical, takes a drastic swing into the really bizarre with an over-the-top third act that seems alien to the nature of the previous two acts, leaving me as a critic and reviewer feeling a little mixed about my reactions.<br/><br/>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make a superb team and they prove that once again in this movie, for both are undeniably the right choice for their roles. Depp is Sweeney Todd, a seemingly lifeless barber seeking revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who prostituted his wife, kidnapped his daughter, and exiled him. Now Mr. Todd, brandishing his glimmering razors, with help from a Gothic baker (Helana Bonham-Carter) and a few others, makes plans to give Rickman a shave...<br/><br/>A really deep one.<br/><br/>What's most likable about the first two-thirds of the movie is that it seems to revive a genre that has been neglected by Hollywood: the musical. There are numerous surprisingly well-written and interesting songs. The filmmakers and cast have done a superb job at telling an entire story using mostly musical numbers. What's more, there is also a very interesting chemistry between Johnny Depp and the always enthralling Helena Bonham-Carter. In the midst of these songs, there are also some moments where Depp practices the shaving technique he plans to use on Rickman, in which he sticks the razor deep into his victim's neck and lets the unnervingly bright red blood spray in torrents.<br/><br/>Well, these work in their isolated moments. I liked the first hour and a half of the movie. But then, in the third act, when it deviated from this course and became really just a bizarre slasher flick with cannibalism mingled in, the movie started to distance itself from me as an audience member. I know that it is based on a musical play and that it is probably just being faithful to its source material. However, that is a clear indication that I probably would not enjoy the last third of the play, either.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spend too many words riffing on ""Sweeney Todd"" because I did not hate the movie; I just can't honestly recommend it because of how it loses its way toward the end. Before that, it is very interesting, beautifully-photographed, well-directed, has many good numbers, and solid performances. But as a critic, it is my task to communicate my personal opinion; how I saw it. And I must treat you as my friend and give you my honest analysis. In the end, I thought it was a hit-and-miss. On the pass/fail scale, it's teetering on the negative end. Too bad, because I was really rooting for it most of the way."
"btzarevski","7","0","2","5 July 2010"," Tough one; Depp may just save it
","OK, I've written a few reviews for IMDb but this may just be the toughest one yet. Basically, the plot follows the story of wrongfully convicted Benjamin Barker, returning to London under the assumed name of Sweeney Todd to exact revenge for his conviction. I will leave it at that so as not to give much away because the plot of the movie is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>I am a HUGE fan of Depp and while I thought a musical may be stretching things a bit I decided to see what one of my favorite actors has done with the role. I suppose one benefit I had was that I hadn't seen the Broadway production the film is based on so I can thus judge it as it is. I found Depp to be positively chilling. The menace and danger he exudes are obviously necessary to portray Benjamin Barker adequately however only an actor as good as Depp can deliver such traits with a sense of style. Helen Bonham Carter also throws in a good performance as Mrs. Lovett and in fact most of the supporting cast do a good job...apart maybe from Sacha Baron Cohen with whom for some reason I couldn't quite get Borat and Ali G out of my mind whenever he came on screen which, thankfully, was for a short time.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is intriguing and gripping however, as this is a musical the stand out feature should be the music and I'm afraid in this instance it isn't. I may not be the biggest fan of musicals but I have seen and enjoyed a few but I'm afraid the music here just doesn't satisfy. I didn't have much of a problem with the singing; actually I thought that was pretty good, it was the lyrics and the musical choices that I found inadequate. Nonetheless, it is not the best musical but it is far from being a terrible one; it is fair.<br/><br/>The film is very gory especially at the end and at some stage you just think to yourself ""enough already!"". It is overly gory and the same effect of obsession and menace in Barker/Todd could have been achieved with a lot less blood. The level of gore is about the only definite negative point on this movie.<br/><br/>Depp yet again shines brightest and proves once again why he should be considered one of the best and most versatile actors! His performance for me dragged the movie/musical out of mediocrity but another kudos should go to Burton's wonderful portrayal of Fleet Street and London as dark and sinister with characters to match.<br/><br/>This is turning into a rather lengthy post so I will wrap up now. As I said in the title this is a tough one. From a musical point of view this is average, however, Depp's performance and the plot do elevate this movie slightly and as such, instead of 5/10 I will give it 7. I would recommend this movie unless you have a problem with bloody, graphic scenes though also note not to expect much of the music. See it for the plot and for Depp and Carter's chillingly good performances.<br/><br/>Oh, just one final thought, there are many reviewers here giving this movie 1/10 yet the overall rating is still an impressive and accurate 7.7/10. This should tell you that people who didn't like it are in the small minority. Heck, if Roger Ebert can give this movie 4/4 it is definitely worth a see!"

The young couple were irritating and ultimately forgettable, as they are in the original, usually (I have yet to see even a stage production where I feel anything other than contempt for they young lovers), but generally the performances were lovely.<br/><br/>Still, I'd recommend seeing a stage version of Sweeney Todd.

I love the old musicals with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, and all the other great musical stars of the golden age of the Hollywood musical motion picture in the 40s and 50s.

I really don't like these movies with people singing and dancing in the middle of city that is filmed in the city. There are exceptions, of course, like ""West Side Story"" and ""On The Town"". Musicals are not meant to be realistic. You can see that in all the great Arthur Freed musicals. But every musical now has people singing and dancing on location in the big city which looks so stupid. This is where this movie towers above them all. <br/><br/>But what I don't like about this movie is the mediocre singing of all the actors. Why not have really great singing actors do the parts? There are so many really great singing actors that could have made a name for themselves in the movies and the studio could have more stars to build up and make money of. Instead Warners and Burton chose to have very well known actors sing badly. <br/><br/>The songs were really good and really well integrated into the plot. I never felt like the story stopped when they burst out in song. But you need people that can sing or else everything falls apart. The producers and Burton should have made the same decision that the producers and director of ""My Fair Lady"" did when they decided to dub Audrey Hepburn in the singing because they felt that Hepburn didn't have the voice necessary. I have heard the temp track of Hepburn singing one of the songs and she sounded better than either Helena Bonham Carter or Johnny Depp. She was even musical. Carter and Depp were not.<br/><br/>Being such a fan of both Burton and Depp I was very disappointed and I was very glad that I didn't buy the movie. Since the singing was such an integral part of the movie it ruined the whole experience of what could have been a really great movie."

","Maybe horror and musical genre don't go together too well after all. Maybe that's the reason why this film never really dragged me in. But one thing is for sure: If you're neither a horror movie nor a strong musical fan but prefer drama, Johnny Depps performance as well as those of his fellow actors are not enough to make the film work for you.<br/><br/>Actually the singing is fine - for example compared to the also amateur performances of the male actors in ""Mamma Mia"" - but dramatic effects are just not played out and cut short - possibly due to the genre approach - which results in a loss for the story.<br/><br/>I guess we are to observe that Sweeney is so full of revenge and hatred that his personality is corrupted, especially after his first attempt on the judge fails. Being Sweeney now and no longer Benjamin he cannot even see what might be still to rescue of the bits and pieces of his former life and destroys the rest of it as profoundly as he can. Only a coincidence prevents him from even killing his own daughter, not recognizing her, while her rescue is undertaken by his friend who is only scarcely supported by Sweeney for Sweeney is much too busy taking revenge. Finally he is judged himself, leaving lots of dramatic story ends loose.<br/><br/>It's always difficult to identify and feel with a character who doesn't deserve it anymore - we are to understand him as being a tragical one, but even that doesn't fully work because he is just too dead hearted to be tragical. Maybe the whole thing would work better the other way round: Getting to know Sweeney at first without knowing anything of his past, which would be revealed only step by step while the story goes."

"funkyfry","5","0","1","6 April 2009"," not what it could have been
","I'd like to imagine how good this movie could have been, say if it had been done in the 1980s. But at this point in his career Tim Burton is more slick than he is audacious, and Sondheim's musical has been around for so long that it's not really anything fresh. Certainly the performances in this film pale in comparison to the filmed play that I saw with Angela Lansbury in the role that Helena Bonham Carter plays in this film. Where Carter is all twitchy mannerisms and never appears for a second as a real human being, Lansbury played the role like a lark and ended up making it more disturbing as a result.<br/><br/>Carter and Johnny Depp look less like 19th Century malcontents than they do like they just dressed up to go to a Morrisey or Cure concert. Jamie Campbell Bower looks like he would last approximately 30 seconds on a ship. Totally miscast, although he seems an interesting actor perhaps in some other role. The only really bright spots on the cast were Alan Rickman (unsurprisingly) and Sacha Baron Cohen (quite surprisingly). Rickman is always great at these kind of oily characters, and he gives the judge an air of vanity that's quite disgusting. Cohen did a good job as the egotistical rival barber Pirelli.<br/><br/>The music itself wasn't always well served in this film. I don't know if it was just the DVD or how the film was made, but I kept having to turn the music down because it would get too loud and then turn the TV back up to hear the often whispered dialog. Some of the most memorable songs were cut out for this film too, for no real reason that I can see. I'm not a huge Sondheim fan -- the only song in this show that I really like is ""By the Sea"" or whatever it's called, and if I had to suffer through ""Johanna"" one more time in my entire life it'll make me want to slit my own throat.<br/><br/>Depp and Carter are called upon to hold the film together and for me they failed. Carter has no charm and Depp seems to just brood for the whole film. They look silly sitting there in the park with so much white makeup on their faces. Generally this film could have benefited from more of a contrast instead of putting everything in such muted tones. That's how a lot of movies are these days though, they get carried away with digital color filters.<br/><br/>This is basically a vanity project that was probably more fun to make than it was to watch."

The lyrics don't come off the page. Her interpretation of the character is dreary, downtrodden, mousy. Whether this is her idea or the director's I don't know, but the effect is to make the production unrelentingly bleak. <br/><br/>The Broadway Mrs. Lovett provided a small amount of comic dottiness that helped ameliorate the inherent bleakness of the play.

"sbwinter2","4","0","1","11 November 2008"," Movie killed some of the best parts of the production
","I have been a huge Burton fan and an equally huge Depp fan - as well as have really liked Helena Bonham Carter. I also saw the Doyle production of Sweeney Todd five times - three times on Broadway and twice on tour (family in the cast), and I grew to love this show more and more every time I saw it.<br/><br/>I was really bothered as to how much Burton snuffed the life from this story. Mrs. Lovett is supposed to relay much of the humor that is needed to contrast the harsh actions and final tragedy. Carter's Lovett was completely humorless for the most part - not even any sarcasm. ""Worst Pies in London"" is a very funny song, but not in this movie. It was boring; she was boring and even looked bored throughout most of rest of the movie. Her acting is so off, I have trouble watching what was one of my favorite songs in the stage production. She even blew her many potentially humorous lines. She comes off as flat and lifeless instead of quirky and colorful. The song ""A Little Priest"" is supposed to be a goofy exchange between Lovett and Todd, but the movie shows it without emotion. They are making jokes and no one is laughing (not even the movie watchers).<br/><br/>Depp suffered from something I saw the Sweeney actor go through on Broadway. In the beginning, he was just angry throughout the whole show - angry, angry, angry. When I saw the show months later, and then months later again, I began to see degrees and types of anger manifest. Sweeney now had more depth, and he was so much more interesting to watch. Since Depp didn't have months and months to play the character over and over, I suppose I can't hold his lack of depth against him, and most people would probably never notice this anyway unless they saw the Broadway show more than once. Depp was a much more subdued Sweeney, but that is consistent with how subdued all of the characters are in the movie.<br/><br/>Last, the movie was harmfully bloody. The Broadway show used symbolism, lighting, sound and staging to show killing and death. This was all you needed. We knew he was killing people without blood spurting everywhere and close-ups. I understand a movie can be more real, but there is no use for showing so much detail on how the people die. In fact, it ruins the emotional build of Sweeney's tragedy that climaxes at the end. In the Broadway show, you are drawn in, and after the tragedy is revealed, you feel its impact. In the movie, you are so numb from all the gore that you remain numb for the ending. And if you don't feel for the tragic ending, what was the point of watching the story? <br/><br/>I know many people really liked the movie (although it seemed that what some people really liked the best had more to do with the genius of Sondheim). It is too bad that now others won't have an opportunity to see how great this story could be and has been told. At least you can still get the original stage production on DVD."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","1","27 October 2008"," Surprisingly good but I had some problems with this movie.
","First of all I love Tim Burton and the dark style he always manages to put in his movies but I feel that he somewhat overdid it this time, which perhaps is not as much Burton's fault but more the story's.<br/><br/>For me the main problem with this movie was its story and then particularly its characters. There just is no good character within this movie. All of the characters are evil in a way. Sweeney Todd is supposed to be the main 'hero' but he isn't much of a likable character, since he's a person who slices innocent people's throats. There isn't really a person to sympathize for within this movie. It's like you're watching all bad people, which in a way also somewhat makes this a depressing movie to watch. I know this certain darkness suits Tim Burton well and is part of his trademark style but I just feel he overdid it this time and it doesn't work out as well as it does in most of his other movies.<br/><br/>He perhaps also overdid things with the movie its visuals. The movie is so stylish and done mostly in gray and black & white tints that the movie looks fake at times, as if it came straight out of a computer. The fairytale like feeling and dark Gothic atmosphere Tim Burton is so well known for is mostly missing within this movie and perhaps Burton too much tried to make this movie like an old horror movie from the black & white era. Also some of the computer effects within this movie feel pointless, mostly because of the reason that they look like they come straight out of playstation game cut scene. It's pointless and it doesn't add anything to the movie. It instead only lets the movie look even more artificial and fake then it already does.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the movie turned out to be in a way also better than expected really. I mean a dark violent musical? Sounds like a real odd and bad thing on paper but it's a movie that works out surprisingly well and knows to combine it's violence, images and musical moments nicely, even though I wasn't that impressed by its musical moments and not a too big fan of the movie its visuals. The story did worked out well and surprisingly, despite of its earlier mentioned flaw of not really featuring any likable characters.<br/><br/>I must also say that out of all the Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborations, this is probably the least. Why? Because Johnny Depp doesn't really feel like Johnny Depp in this movie. Perhaps it's because of the style of the movie or all of the make-up he has to act underneath but there are only a handful of great Johnny Depp moments within the movie. It's as if most of the time he is restrained, which is probably also due to the fact that he has a lot of singing to do in this movie. Sacha Baron Cohen on the other hand was really great and perfectly cast. In a way he plays more of Johnny Depp type of role than Jonny Depp played within this movie. Cohen's role is quite small though but nevertheless memorable and entertaining. Alan Rickman is also fine and so is Tim Burton's girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter, who always perfectly fits into his movies and style in particular.<br/><br/>So, it's a movie that works out surprising well and I can also recommend it but this doesn't take away I had some problems with the movie its style and main characters.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"98nurdinm-1","8","0","1","14 October 2008"," Burton's Epiphany
","Tim Burton has, despite his frequent insistence on his dislike for the genre, always been a director of musicals. You only need to look at the animated films of ""Corpse Bride"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" to see his unique take on show stopping numbers, and in his other films there are often moments of musical tomfoolery, such as in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" or ""Mars Attacks!"" The difference between these films and something like, say ""The Sound Of Music"" is pretty obvious. Burton is a dark, Gothic auteur whose own brand of black comedy and love of ghoulish storytelling is now legendary in its own right.<br/><br/>So ""Sweeney Todd"" was perfect for him. In fact there is no other living film director who comes to mind who would have been as perfect a director of the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's perhaps most celebrated musical (though its more of a light opera than anything else - not in its subject matter, but in the amount of dialogue and songs). The actual show just oozes Burton in its horror story qualities, and you have the chance to bring more gore to the proceedings being much more up close and personal than in the theatre. Yet Buron never goes OTT with this gore, unlike some very unfortunate film franchises that are circulating today. It is INTENTIONAL gore, and though it may shock you when you first experience it (it comes in rather late into the movie) you quickly get over the surprise and begin to enjoy it in a rather unnerving way.<br/><br/>There are other reasons for this other than Burton's handling. Depp and Bonham Carter are brilliant in their roles. Neither are strong singers, yet they perform their songs with such intensity it would be hard to believe they have not performed this on the stage themselves. Depp has added another memorable character to his vastly growing CV of kooks, and Bonham Carter's credibility has once again shot up above the Merchant Ivory costume dramas she was first discovered in. The supporting cast work very well too, though the love story between Todd's daughter and his sailor friend does suffer from the necessity of cutting for time. <br/><br/>It helps that the music is extraordinary too. Though Sondheim has not been as successful in the UK as he has been in the States, its incredibly difficult to grasp just why this show was not more popular over here. The songs segue beautifully into each other , always with a dark undertone lurking somewhere, even in the lighter pieces (and there are one or two). A new production will no doubt be planned in the near future - and if not, why not? <br/><br/>Burton has returned back to his roots after a few films that, though brilliant, were very family orientated. This is a film for grown ups, a fable for grown ups, and Burton does very well indeed with these fables. <br/><br/>8/10"

","First off, I am a huge fan of both the theater and Tim Burton. And I think Mr.Burton did Sweeney Todd justice. The film was so visually amazing, I could not take my eyes off of the screen. Johnny Depp is not the most strongest of singers but I believe his ""rough"" voice worked for the character well. I hate blood and gore and the likes but the way Tim Burton did it, it was almost humorous and didn't really bother me so much. I think the story was told right (especially with the use of the flashbacks). I'm a dork and watch this movie any chance I get. The movie never gets old and I'm always finding something new in the set, especially, because the attention to detail was amazing.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","5 October 2008"," A fine dark musical with a touch of levity
","Tim Burton's interpretation of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" tells the story of a murderous barber out for revenge on the judge who sent him away for a crime he didn't commit in order to steal his wife and child. The story is based on an anonymously published 'penny dreadful' from 1846-47 titled ""The String of Pearls"".<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one which includes a couple of Burton regulars, namely Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter. I'm not crazy about Depp's singing but I thought that Carter was perfect for the part. Alan Rickman & Timothy Spall were well cast in villainous roles though their singing is rather limited. Also of note, Sacha Baron Cohen has an interesting minor role as a rival barber. As for the other actors, such as Jamie Campbell Bower & Jayne Wisener, their singing abilities suggest more of a musical background than the stars.<br/><br/>The story is an interesting revenge tale that deftly mixes dark comedy and tragedy. Burton was unsparing with the blood and produced a body count matching most horror flicks. I found the music to be hit or miss, though that seems to be mostly due to a lack of refinement on the part of most of the actors. I wouldn't say that any of the singing was bad but there were certainly at least a few songs that were unremarkable. On the flip side of the coin, there were also a few particularly memorable songs as well, such as Mrs. Lovett's wistful rendition of ""By the Sea"".<br/><br/>Burton's direction is distinctive as always and he manages to capture the setting and spirit of the story admirably. The musical elements may be imperfect but the entire package makes for an attractive, memorable film. Certainly recommended for fans of musicals and it should also serve as a pretty good introduction for those who think that musicals are 'uncool'."

","Like always, I don't understand the rave reviews for this movie.<br/><br/>It was hardly anything special. Yes, the acting was amazing. And yes, the style was great. But anything worth giving this movie a perfect rating over stops there.<br/><br/>When I (was forced to) watch The Phantom of the Opera, I couldn't stop thinking: ""I have scars, but do I make a lame musical about it?"" With Sweeney Todd, it was: ""Revenge is a bad thing, we have seen that in a hundred movies already, why another one?"" I don't get why movies simply can't just think of some lesser-used moral to center a movie around. (Or the original opera/musical, for that matter.) A moral that people can use. Have you ever honestly thought about killing someone for revenge? If so, you're by far the minority, and I seriously doubt a movie about a barber is going to change your mind.<br/><br/>My second complaint was the blood. I'm all for over-the-top unrealistic style of blood splatter, but this just didn't impress me. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to laugh at it in this movie, or if the makers actually wanted me to take it seriously. It was just one of the most pathetic attempts at the style I have seen in a movie yet.<br/><br/>Finally, I was bored to tears during the first hour. Nothing happens. I about turned it off because the singing was so annoying and typicalI felt like I was sitting through The Phantom of the Opera all over again.<br/><br/>Overall, just a typical revenge movie. Nothing more, nothing less. I'd take Death Sentencewhich has the same moral, but much more entertainingover this any day, however.<br/><br/>5/10"

The movie is nothing but a pointless bloodbath set to bad songs. The story isn't a comedy, but some viewers treated it as though it were. There were some tragic moments in the movie but no surprises at all. I just don't think that this type of story should be a musical. I like Johnny Depp generally, but not very much in this movie. He never seems to play any adult roles. I always thought the best movies that I had seen him in were What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Edward Scissorhands. But neither one of those roles were very adult either. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies were big successful movies, but again not for adults in my opinion.

","Though I have never liked musicals, I was rather enjoying this. With one glaring exception, the volume difference between the music and the spoken word. It seems that in the last 5 or 6 years, movie soundtracks seem to be overpowering dialog. In some cases, the actors may be speaking under their breath, making it difficult to understand. This can often be fixed by turning up our volume controls. Other movies blast the music so loud that we must adjust our volume controls down, then back up to hear the faint dialog.<br/><br/>This is such a movie. I spent so much time adjusting the volume down for the blaring music and then back up for the faint speech. It was so frustrating that it effected my enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>A million dollar idea would be a volume regulator (unless it already exists that I don't know about).

How wrong was I? Bearing in mind that this is a musical, only one song in the movie manages to carry any communication at all. From start to finish, the soundtrack emulates a monotonous grandmother humming an unidentifiable tune. There is no memorable tune, melody or chorus and I found it very difficult to determine what was being said in the songs. Had I not known the story I would have been totally lost.<br/><br/>On the up side, Burton's London was quite convincing in a Hollywood kind of way but then that is his forte. The Cockney accents were fair and the actors performances tremendous considering what they were working with. Alan Rickman was sadly wasted, Timothy Spall looked fantastic but his dialogue let him down.<br/><br/>A musical horror is hard to pull off but Rocky Horror Show and Little Shop Of Horrors managed it. The reason - good songs that explained what was going on and got the viewer involved in the story. There was also a good balance of dialogue and song. In Sweeney Tod the balance falls in favour of the songs but since the songs are weak, this is a negative attribute.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe this film is rated 8 out of 10. I can't be the only viewer to feel this way?"
"Isaac5855","8","0","1","23 June 2008"," Sondheim purists may scoff, but it's a solid adaptation of his Masterpiece
","SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET is the dark and dazzling 2007 film adaptation of the landmark 1979 Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim that won nine Tony Awards. Not for the faint of heart, Tim Burton, the master of dark and demented (BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), found this source material that seems tailor-made for his directorial sensibilities and mounted a deliciously entertaining film that should please most Sondheim purists and possibly motivate newcomers to the piece to seek out the original stage musical. For the uninitiated, this is the story of Benjamin Barker, a barber who was wrongfully imprisoned many years ago by the evil Judge Turpin, who was responsible for the ""death"" of Barker's wife, Lucy and the kidnapping of his daughter, Johanna, who returns to his old stomping grounds, a grimy London alley called Fleet Street to exact revenge on the Judge. Enter Mrs. Lovett, the slovenly owner of a dirty meat pie shop, whose infatuation with Barker and the desire to improve her business, sparks a most fascinating business partnership. This musical shocked theater audiences in 1979 and in the hands of ghoul master Burton, is no less shocking today. Burton employs his accustomed darkness to the already twisted material, making the story even creepierthe film allows Burton to expand portions of the story that were only touched upon on stage, particularly the back story of Benjamin, Lucy, and the Judge which makes the return of the clearly demented Todd much more plausible. Presenting the story on film also allows Burton to put another character center stagethe blood. There is blood everywhere here, as it should be, making the savagery of what Todd and Mrs. Lovett are doing even more sickeningly fascinating than it was on stage. Needless to say, expansions in some areas of the story require sacrifices in others and the main sacrifice Burton had to make here was with Sondheim's gargantuan scorea great deal of the original score has been cut from the film, which is missed at times, but the theatrical aspects of the score had to be altered for a film adaptation. The famous ""Ballad"" which occurs throughout the show, would have hampered the telling of the story on screen. The film features impressive art direction and cinematography (I can't remember ever seeing blood so red) and the cast is first rate. Johnny Depp's Oscar nominated turn as Sweeney Todd is nothing short of brilliant, a deeply internalized performance that was definitely developed from the inside out. As for Depp's singing, I had my doubts when I first heard he had been cast in this role, but it works for the movie screenhis number ""Epiphany"" is breathtaking. Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs.Lovett is much darker than Angela Lansbury's interpretation of the character on the Broadway but is just as effective. Mention should also be made of Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall's Beadle, and Sascha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, a competitor of Todd's who recognizes him from the old days. A hauntingly impressive adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim masterpiece that does it justice."

Todd is the former Benjamin Barker, a barber who's been exiled from nineteenth-century London by a corrupt judge, who then swooped in and took Barker's wife from him for good measure. Fifteen years later, Barker, now known as Todd, returns to the city, but his wife Lucy, raped and driven mad by the judge (Alan Rickman) has killed herself, and Todd's daughter Johanna is the judge's ward.<br/><br/>Todd opens a barber shop above a bakery owned by a Mrs. Lovett, who's soon encouraging Todd to exact his revenge. They hatch the perfect plan: She needs meat, he needs revenge, so they work in concert, since Todd's moral compass has spun off its magnetic axis. Everyone wins! The movie was directed by Tim Burton, and his imprint is noticeable right from the start, with a rivulet of blood coursing through well-worn machine gears over the title cards. When you think of Tim Burton, you think of stylish, don't you, not placid, or heavily plot driven, or over-the-top action. You think of the visual images, the freewheeling, indelibly intriguing imagination that brought you Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and the Corpse Bride. Here, Burton is incredibly successful; the set pieces are magnificent, as is his use of color. When Todd slashes a throat, vibrant reds attack the screen in stark contrast to the staid, mostly black backgrounds (and the pallid complexions of the Londoners, of course).<br/><br/>Prior to the film's release, there was more than a little bit of nervousness about the casting of Johnny Depp, a longtime Burton collaborator. This was to be an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim stage presentation, a version of the old tale that - surprise - required actual singing. Could Johnny Depp lend enough gravitas to the dark role of Sweeney Todd? Sure, as far as actual acting went, but could he even carry a tune? Turns out he can, although I wouldn't sign him to any recording contracts. He's an okay singer; let's leave it at that. But he's fantastic, naturally, as the demonic barber - who, let's be frank, looks like Edward Scissorhands' dad or perverted uncle.<br/><br/>Also proving to be a decent singer was Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. I don't know what it is about Bonham Carter, but she almost always looks like she's playing a strung-out crack addict. Must be the saucer eyes and the paleness. At any rate, she's a real treat, as usual, as the wicked, duplicitous Gothic baker of unique meat pies.<br/><br/>The movie is 116 minutes long, but if you cut out the musical numbers you'd be left with perhaps 45 minutes. True, many plot points are expressed via song, but it's not long before those songs feel forced, inauthentic, and superfluous. Granted, the songs themselves are thematically downbeat, not of the happy-joy variety, and granted, they're there to move the plot along, rather than inhibit it, but therein lay a problem. When the actors sang, they sang loudly. When they were merely speaking, they spoke softly. And this wasn't like 1940s musicals, where the songs are telegraphed ahead of time; the actors would go from talking to SINGING to talking to SINGING and I spent much of those 116 minutes adjusting the volume. Seriously - the dialog is so softly spoken it's very difficult to hear, even if the sound's turned up, and what's more, the characters all have nearly unintelligible (to me) Cockney accents that drop vowels, consonants, punctuation, you name it. I needed subtitles.<br/><br/>So although the movie didn't quite do it for me, I can appreciate what it was trying to accomplish. Indeed, judging from the many accolades it received, it was quite successful. If you're looking for an ultraviolent horror show filled with singing, you will not be disappointed, although I can't imagine there'd be much competition for that dubious honor."

","I knew very little about the story before watching this but even from the beginning I knew that I would not be disappointed. From the moment we meet first meet the bitter and angry Sweeney Todd to the dramatic climax. The cast itself was an excellent mixture of known and unknown actors/actresses who all played their roles to perfection and of course the delightful Johnny Depp who shows us why he's such a sought after actor not only can he act, he can sing as well! Not just Johnny though but all the actors did an amazing job of singing and acting Alan Rickman, Helene Boham Carter, Timothy Spall, and even Sacha Baron Cohen! The story itself is a wonderful dark macabre story, the underscore music fitted perfectly with dark undertones of the story along with delightfully wicked dark humour. The chemistry between Helene's character (Mrs Lovett) and Sweeney Todd (Depp) was fantastic to watch as she fell deeper and deeper in love with him even willing to lie to him about his wife being alive - she did tell him his wife poisoned herself but neglected to mention that she was still alive albeit a bit loopy. Rickman and Spall did a excellent job of playing the evil judge and the cruel corrupted Beadle, all through out the story you could sympathise with Sweeney and I wanted him to kill the nasty pair because they were just simply vile evil creatures. I even found myself cheering when he finally did kill them but takes a rather sad, tragic and ironic twist at the end where after Sweeney murders the mad beggar woman he orders Mrs Lovett to open the oven door and in the firelight he sees that it was his wife that he had murdered. Driven insane with rage he turns on the woman who loves him Mrs Lovett and kills her in the worse possible way by burning her alive in the oven and shutting the door. Beside himself with grief he clings to his wife's dead body not noticing the small boy that Mrs Lovett took in who sneaks up behind him slits his throat with his own razor his blood poring over his dead wife's body the boy leaves the underground bakehouse. <br/><br/>This is an excellent film I would gladly watch again and again.<br/><br/>Jumana"

","Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is without doubt one of the best films ever made. it is very difficult to create a film with the same magic and beauty as the musical itself. this film successfully portrays every single character in such a brilliant and unforgettable way! i had very high expectations of this film from the start, because of it being a Tim Burton production. the music is set so wonderfully; it flows very well, and all though much of the songs are cut short, they still convey the same magic as the musical. and what can i say of the acting!! Johnny Depp (the best actor of all time), Helena Boham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall.... the cast is absolutely amazing! each character adds a certain spark to the film and keeps the plot going. from the singing to the slicing of the throats, every actor leaves a wonderful mark in movie history. this gory, humorous and unforgettable film is definitely a must have... you will be dancing to ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixer"" or ""Epiphany"" constantly! (I know i did). Bravo to yet another marvelous film by Mr. Burton!"
"fwomp","8","0","1","27 May 2008"," A Little Comedy Helps The Medicine Go Down
","Moving a musical from Broadway to the silver screen is not a simple thing. The abhorrent musical RENT is a prime example. Although Rent had its place on stage, it suffered with its transition to film due to a shoddy script and even shoddier sets and acting. And although SWEENEY TODD has a similar history, it holds up much better. <br/><br/>The first successful element of Sweeney Todd is that it has some really fine actors attached to it, as well as director Tim Burton (CORPSE BRIDE), the master of dark themes. Not surprising to any, Mr. Burton has brought along Johnny Depp (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) whom Mr. Burton has apparently set up as his muse. Since 1990, the two have been practically inseparable, and this has turned out to be advantageous to movie audiences. They work very well together and know each others ins-and-outs. Sweeney Todd also benefited from the dastardly work of Alan Rickman (HARRY POTTER) as the devilishly evil Judge Turpin. Rickman has been a favorite of mine since 1988 when he starred alongside Bruce Willis in the first DIE HARD film. Another surprising bonus was that of Timothy Spall (ENCHANTED) who plays Beadle, the twisted sidekick to Judge Turpin. Although Mr. Spall can't sing very well, he did act the part of Beadle with exceptional creepiness. Then we come to Mr. Burton's other muse, his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (WALLACE & GROMIT) who plays the female lead of Ms. Lovett. Mrs. Carter is to be commended for her singing abilities, and she apparently took this film very seriously, going so far as to take a barrage of singing and voice lessons in preparation. The sad part about her role is that I found her singing better than her acting. I could easily have seen someone with more acting and singing abilities in her role (for instance Renee Zellweger). But I must give credit where it is due, and I found her acting portions acceptable if a bit flat.<br/><br/>The second success is obvious: the music. Stephen Sondheim's score really reached down and pulled this film up a notch. I particularly enjoyed the music and lyrics during the song ""A Little Priest"" in which Sweeney Todd (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter) look out over the London streets and sing about what certain businessmen or people taste like. I found this to be a good section of the film because it incorporated solid acting, a great song, and some darn funny lines/chorus', something not easily achieved in cinema nowadays. <br/><br/>The third success is both a positive and a possible negative: the bloodshed. Similar to a Frank Miller graphic, Sweeney Todd is shown in a black-and-white, sepia-toned fashion while the blood of Sweeney's victims is given the royal red treatment (and there's plenty a-gushin' on-screen, too). Although this adds a flare of color to an otherwise dingy look, it also went a bit over-the-top on several occasions. I have to note here, too, the sickening 'thud' sound that the bodies make when they are disposed of down Sweeney Toddy's chute and onto the hard cobbles below. This might turn many viewers off so just beware.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, Mr. Burton is well-known for his dark themes, and I dare say that this is probably the darkest of them all. But the infusion of some much needed comedy helps this one go down a tad easier. Kind of like eating one of Mrs. Lovett's pies and then drinking a nice ale after.<br/><br/>Bon appétit!"

","This is like some sort of weird little Gothic love fairytale, and it's actually not the nu-crapola I expected previously, being quite an endearing tale. Johnny Depp isn't a good singer, but he makes up for that with stunning theatrics, the same way he did as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates films. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is great, too, and the supporting cast make for quite an entertaining viewing.<br/><br/>The main problem with Sweeney Todd is just that it feels pretty campy and jovial compared to its subject matter, and it would've been a much better movie if the aforementioned camp had been turned down a few notches. Regardless, this is a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to people who aren't afraid of musicals."
"TEgnoto89","6","0","2","10 May 2008"," Flawed, but not a bad flick
","I wrote a review of Sweeney Todd immediately after I saw it, and ranted about how embarrassingly terrible it was.<br/><br/>Well, I've since changed my opinion. The film is flawed in several ways, but not nearly as bad as I initially thought.<br/><br/>Depp and Carter do an excellent job in their roles as Sweeney and Lovett, however, I stand by my initial statement as far as their vocals go - they're just not good enough, particularly Carter's. I would think that with his millions of dollars, Depp would have been able to get at least some basics in musical theatre singing. Carter's performance of ""worst pies in London"" bothered me more than anything in the film. Not only weak vocally, it lacked the energy that it was written to have. But excellent acting on not only Depp and Carter's part, but Rickman and Spall do an excellent job in their roles as Judge Turpin and the Beadle as well.<br/><br/>Anthony and Toby (Bower and Sanders) were not good. Anthony was also very weak vocally, and Toby was just too young and inexperienced to really live his role. I would much rather have seen Toby played by an older, yet petite tenor.<br/><br/>Cohen was funny and charming as Pirelli, though I think he would have been better off incorporating more of his ""mock"" opera voice - that's the way the part was written to be sung! It's not supposed to be particularly pretty.<br/><br/>So while the film was lacking on the vocal end (Sondheim is not for singers that don't know their stuff!), the solid performances on the acting end come close to making up for the vox.<br/><br/>Oh, and some scenes were overtly gory. It got distracting. And while I understand Burton's cutting of the opening ""ballad of sweeney todd"", It would have been nice to hear it at the end."

"snape_is_dishy","6","0","1","7 May 2008"," Sweeney Todd, school newspaper review.
","Tim Burton describes his latest musical masterpiece as ""The Sound of Musicwith blood"" although Mrs.Lovett is certainly no Maria. As you might have heard, or rather must have heard, it stars Johnny Depp as Sweeny Todd, a naive barber turned demonic people carver, who is hell bent on reaping revenge on Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) for stealing his wife, imprisoning his daughter Johanna and shipping him off to Australia for 15 years for no apparent reason. It sounds harsh, but it makes one great movie and it might even turn you on to musicals, but beware, it'll put you off pies for life.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, who cooks, as she says herself (or rather sings), ""the worst pies in London"". That is of course, until she partners up with Todd to change her recipes to something a little meatier than 'pussy cats 'n' toast', with their delightful new creations portrayed in 'A little Priest', although they won't be winning a Michelin star any time soon. This is the song where the different occupations correlate to the different flavours of pie such as ""shepherds pie peppered with actual shepherd on top."" Personally I think I'll stick to beef.<br/><br/>Apart from anything else, we find out that she is madly in love with Sweeny, and one of the most hilarious scenes in the film is her rendition of 'By the Sea' in which we see her delve into a stylistic world of bathing suits and marriage vows, all the while oblivious to the look of utter despair on Todd's face.<br/><br/>I've heard about unsuspecting film-goers who for some insane reason did not realise that this was a musical. (Sorry, but how could you not know it was a musical?) Some even walked out, not able to take the singing anymore! But I ask you this. For anyone who has seen the film, do you think it would be as good without the music? There has been some speculation as to why 'The Ballad Of Sweeny Todd' was not included in the final film, and for all you Broadway fans who missed it, let me tell you that if you were such a fan you'd have noticed it integrated into 'There's no place like London', the first song which exhibits Depp's previously unheard gritty rock style singing voice that has won him such acclaim.<br/><br/>The film was adapted from Steven Sondheim's Broadway masterpiece, and he was on hand to make sure every song was conveyed in the right way. If you are planning to see this film and are not particularly partial to a bit of horror, then once the killing sprees start and Sweeny gets a little liberal with his 'friends' the switchblades, watch out for the barbers chair chute, which provides you with a less than lovely sound upon each delivery of 'meat' for pie time after a 20ft drop. Let's just say it's not a pretty sight."

The only people I liked listening to were Cohen (Pirelli, and utterly unlike Borat) and Sanders (Toby the boy). Everything visual in this production is marvelous...although I do wish the blood looked more like blood. The acting...I don't know acting well enough to fault it anywhere. Helena Bonham Carter...well,she's just draws one in, wanting to see what she'll do next. Considering this is her first singing role, wow. Her voice keeps the movie from falling flat. A quick check on Wikipedia reveals that about half the songs from the musical were cut for the movie.

Crafted brilliant for the way it appeals to a viewer from everything from the dark sets and the graphic special effects really skew one's view of the world. To top it off this was at one time a stage play in London, and the music and singing during the film makes it seem about as real as Broadway could be. Burton once again delivers in his zany and creepy ways by showing the crazy and odd shaped makeup faces of his characters. And the bloody scenes and use of a lot of red show that Tim is really paying homage to old classic horror films.<br/><br/>The story theme is really revenge based set in London on a street called Fleet Street.

","It sounded like a good idea. Considering his reputation, one would think that Tim Burton would be the perfect for the film adaption of a musical starring a serial killer. And while the film stays true to the themes of Stephen Sondheim's brilliant work, it lacks the energy of its operatic predecessor. Ultimately, this film is a terrible bore.<br/><br/>First off, did Helena Bonham Carter honestly think she good fill the shoes of Angela Lansbury? Apparently not, because she doesn't even make the effort. The wonderful thing about Lansbury's performance was that shat her endearing energetic performance actually made the character lovable in a twisted sort of way. Carter's Mrs. Lovett is subdued and dronish, mumbling her way the movie barely cracking a smile. Ultimately she eliminates everything appealing about the character.<br/><br/>As for Johnny Depp, as talented as he is, this definitely was not his best performance. He too lacks his predecessor's energy, although it seems to work better for him. It was interesting to see Depp's first foray into the singing world, and while his was impressive for a beginner, he still can't measure up to George Hearn.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin would have been brilliant, but overzealous attempts to demonize his character ultimately come across. He character is already obviously depraved, as shown by his role the plot. But Burton sees fit to portray him as a horny, porn-obsessed, pervert which ultimately makes him seem rather ridiculous. One particular scene involving the judge sentencing an eight year old boy to be hanged comes across as completely ludicrous. It was either a silly attempt to emphasize the characters cruelty, or a joke in extremely poor taste. Either way, it makes it very hard to take the character seriously.<br/><br/>In the end, while this film is certainly dark, it falls short of the standard set by Sondheim. It fails to be entertaining, replacing cherry but twisted character with mumbling zombies with hollowed out eyes."

"fotn777","10","0","1","20 April 2008"," Serial Killer Barber of Fleet Street
","A musical of dark comedy filled with blood and gore whose cast is led by an actor who has never sung before. Feeling skeptical? Sound like the makings of a disaster? Well, rest assured that SWEENEY TODD THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET also known simply as Sweeney Todd does deliver its goods. Under the masterful direction of Tim Burton (""Corpse Bride"", ""Planet of the Apes""), it is a musical that is both dark and humorous, horrific and artistic.<br/><br/>PLOT <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd actually has a fairly simple general plot. The movie recounts a tale of vengeance and insanity as Sweeney Todd embarks down a bloody path of revenge against the corrupted Judge Turpin who has wronged him. However, this character piece begins to increase in complexity as the various sub-plots of the characters' emotional involvement and plans begin to unfold such as the romantic love story between young sailor, Anthony Hope and the beautiful captive, Johanna Barker. It is pleasing to note that Sweeney Todd does succeed in that aspect as its complexity does not make the movie mind-boggling and incomprehensible. Instead, its complexity merely adds a depth to the movie which brings it to life. <br/><br/>CHARACTER <br/><br/>The cast of characters that inhabit the world of the movie is a cast of fascinating, intriguing and downright insane characters. Leading the cast with murderous intent is Sweeney Todd, the demon barber himself who kills with shaving tools. Johnny Depp once again displays his versatility and ingenuity, bringing Sweeney Todd to life as a vengeful soul, born of unfortunate circumstance. Acting as his love interest is Helena Bonham Carter in the role of Mrs Lovett, her skills pulling the audience in to empathize with her in her unrequited love of Todd and her life as a colourful woman buried in the darkness of poverty. Also, playing opposite Todd as the villainous Judge Turpin with a skewed perception on justice is Alan Rickman, breathing a soul into a character that could have been a one-dimensional monster. And, the rest of the cast is no less brilliant in their portrayal of their characters that allow the audience to feel with and for the characters. However, I personally feel that the characters of Johanna Barker, portrayed by Jayne Wisener, and Anthony Hope, portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower, were not given enough screen time to capture the audience's heart which rendered their tragic romance story a little less emotionally involved than it should have been. Thus, it fails to become a moving element of the movie, merely remaining as just another a sub-plot. <br/><br/>MUSIC<br/><br/>Setting the mood for the movie is the songs which have been composed by the talented Stephen Soundheim, whose creativity shines clearly in this movie. The score for the movie is excellent, its dramatic undertones complementing the movie in every way without drawing the audience's attention away from it. His love for the radical leaps off the screen in his dark but witty lyrics on Mrs Lovett's 'meat pies' in 'A Little Priest' to the disturbing intensity of Todd's crumbling sanity in 'Epiphany'. <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is an excellent movie with amazing emotional depth and complexity. However, it may not be very suitable for the general audience as it deals with somewhat disturbing content like cannibalism, senseless murder and corruption. And, audience's of a younger age group is advised to watch this movie with a parent as it can be terrifying and emotionally disturbing. Aside from that with a mixture of contradicting elements that work surprisingly well, Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street has undeniably found a place in the movie archive as a dark musical that will remain unforgettable."

I did see a musical starring Depp called ""Cry-Baby"" which was almost like ""Grease,"" but it wasn't that good.<br/><br/>The film has some essence of Alexandre Dumas' book ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" and the fairy tale ""Rapunzel"". Only in ""The Count"", Edmond wasn't psychotic like Sweeney. Also unlike Edmond, Sweeney did not found a hidden treasure and became rich. In the story, Benjamin Barker had a good job, a lovely wife and an adorable baby girl Johanna. But the love Benjamin had for his wife inspires jealousy and lust in Judge Turpin, and has Barker deported to Australia on a trumped-up charge; of course I think it's kangaroo court and that's illegal. Then he raped Lucy...O.M.G! the man's a f**kin', raping sex fiend! Poor Lucy then poisoned herself in despair and Johanna became Turpin's ward. Then, many years later Barker, now calling himself Sweeney Todd, returns illegally to England with the help of a young sailor named Anthony. He visits the pie shop of Mrs. Lovett an old friend who recognizes him and tells him what happened to Lucy and Johanna. Then she takes him up to the room he used to rent above her shop, where she has hidden his razors under a floorboard. He's profoundly happy to have them back and decides to reopen his barbershop. <br/><br/>As for essence from the ""Rapunzel"" story, Johanna's like Rapunzel and Anthony's like the handsome prince. I thought how it's set up was so great. She sings her song about being locked up. Then a beggar woman gives Anthony her name after he ask her. His song's lyrics respond to what she sang, I thought it's perfectly balanced and very intelligent writing. And it's also written not to be taken literally but to be romantic and promise her his thoughts and heart are with her.<br/><br/>So after watching the film two times, I give and a 10/10; despite the gore of course. But I do love a good musical soundtrack."

","This one surprised me a little, because I expected it to be good, but it is far far better than my expectations. Nothing to complain about at all, I liked it all especially the excellent music and I appreciate Tim Burton using some old school blood spraying. One of the best Sweeney Todd movies, and I like them all. Johnny Deep is sensational as aways, and now we learn he can sing. Pretty good actually. You gotta love Tim Burton going for all the blood and gore in this adaptation from the successful play. It's worth your while to checkout all the Sweeney Tood movies, because they are all the same basic story, but as with this version, there is enough difference to make viewing them all a must-see."

","Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have collaborated numerous times. Yet never (and I mean NEVER) has Depp been so dark, so evil than within this character. Tim Burton is a genius. Everything on screen almost resembles the character of Sweeney Todd in a way. Much like the German Expressionalism of Gegores Melies and Robert Wiene, he uses the sets to convey just how distorted and ruined the character really is. Not to be ignored is Helena Bonham Carter, whose voice and screen presence are so C-R-E-E-P-Y it's amazing! The film (like the musical) was borderline opera. The little dialog between songs was quite witty.<br/><br/>However, this does not save the film from the fact that it was a little too dark. The notions and themes behind the musical were blended quite nicely into film format, but at a price. Personally, I found the movie too disturbing, and found myself hiding behind a pillow for most of it's duration.<br/><br/>Despite the darkness of it all, despite the gallons and gallons of vivid fake blood, Sweeney Todd is triumphant. It has a beautiful score, incredible acting, and of course, Tim Burton in the director's chair.<br/><br/>What more could we ask for?"
"native_girl333","9","0","1","13 April 2008"," ""How about a shave?""
","Tim Burton has done it again! Sweeney Todd is brutal and filled with dark humor and great acting. Johnny Depp is on fire! Benjamin Barker (fantastic Johnny Depp) was thrown to the jail because he had something that another one desired. Now he is back and full of vengeance. Together with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) Sweeney Todd plans a horrendous plot to have his revenge on Judge Turpin (brilliant Alan Rickman). Are you brave enough to sit to the chair of our lust-for-blood barber? The music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are exquisite. Combined with Burtons imaginative world and great story-telling the movie is one of the enjoyable musical there is. Burton draws beautiful, horror-romantic pictures that will not leave the audience cold. The songs like ""Johanna"", ""Pretty Women"" and ""By the Sea"" makes you want to sing along with Sweeney and others. Particularly ""Johanna"" is very beautiful and touching ballad performed by pretty Jamie Campbell Bower. Great performances are the key. In addition of Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman shines through this dark and dreary movie. Timothy Spall is Beadle, a sleazy little accomplish of Judge Turpin. The appearance of Sacha Baron Cohen is delightful and funny! <br/><br/>Costume design is the handwriting of Colleen Atwood. Costumes play an important part in the film. Atwood shapes the spirit of Burton and has created very working and variable combination.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is morbid and macabre but still you can find a little sympathy for our murderer. Burton knows that if you can't be together alive you can be together in death. Surprisingly comforting and beautiful thought."

","I had to admit that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street was one of the best musicals that I had seen in the past couple of years. It really showed me the great talent that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter possessed. I only have a small amount of musicals in my personal DVD collection and would not mind adding Sweeney Todd to it. Revenge could drive any man to do any number of items, but the individual would have to understand the control of it. If revenge is not controlled, it would take over and then come back to haunt the individual later on in life. Revenge could give an individual a sense of relief and have the means to kill too. I am going to stay away from meat pies and be very careful of whom I have chosen as a dance partner."

"kaaber-2","8","0","2","12 April 2008"," strange choices impede perfection
","I may be unfair because I've seen the play in production five times and seen the DVD version of the Broadway (with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn) production at least thirty, and for that reason alone, I may be averse to any little deviation from the play proper, but I lament first and foremost the cutting of the epic chorus (""Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd"") which sets the mood so eminently. Burton could have done it on the soundtrack only, if he didn't want the singers in the show. Apart from that cut, I miss the small recap duet between Anthony and Johanna just before disaster strikes near the end of the play.<br/><br/>But mainly, the voices are unsuited for the production. I remember seeing a masterclass with Sondheim once in which a couple of his songs were performed first by singers and then by actors, and the actors clearly stole the show, so it's not a matter of Depp and Bonham-Carter not being able to sing the difficult Sondheim-stuff. Their acting is brilliant. It's a matter of them singing practically all the songs as though their windpipes had been slit, without energy at all, reminiscent of a latter-day Billie Holiday, heavily sedated. This sort of marred my pleasure at the movie which is otherwise a visual treat and Burton (as you'd expect) going over every conceivable top in all-out carnage.<br/><br/>Usually I'm in favor of film rather than theater, and - as I started out by saying - I may be prejudiced by my familiarity with the play, but what worked so well for the play was its Brechtian epic theater style: the actors showed their characters rather than actually played them. In the film, we get great acting, but it's at the expense of the story telling itself. We lose sight of the merciless plot grinding its characters to dust.<br/><br/>In short: the play really scared me, the movie did not. But it's a pretty lush production, all the same."
"petersj-2","Null","0","2","11 April 2008"," well made but its a pity about Mrs L
","I really looked forward to this movie. I love the score and I love Mr Depp. Sondheims score is a demanding one for any singer and I must say thats the disappointing thing in the movie because apart from young Ed Sanders as Toby very few of the cast are up to it. The scene with Helena B Carter as Mrs L with Saders is an eye opener. He sings his socks off and Carter is not in his league. Carter is pretty ordinary not awful but it just is not the tour de force we got from Lansbury or Patti Lupone in the concert version. The problem is that there are much better actors than Carter and she has very little presence and at times walks through the role looking very uncomfortable. Depp makes a solid fist at the role but you cannot help longing for a gutsy performer like George Hearn. Its odd that they snub the Broadway stars today just as they did in the old days. How wonderful it would be to see the roles and performances kept forever on celluloid. How wonderful it would have been to have some of the original stars preserved on film. Oh well. Its a good film but not a great one."

The dark, grim portrayal of the ghetto of London in the early 19th century post- industrial revolution period. Of course, this time being the pinnacle of poverty and crime in Europe, nobody giving a rip about anyone else and are willing to do anything in order to survive. The portrayal of that in this movie is what hit me hardest.<br/><br/>Of course there is no denying Johnny Depp's excellent performance as the ""Demon Barber"". I could not possibly picture anyone else playing that role.His singing and dark personality makes him one with the character and blows the audience away single handedly! Though lets not forget the great, creepy Mrs. Helena Bonham Carter. What a fantastic job of exerting every side of her character, the darkness, cleverness, kindness, and romantic are all portrayed excellently.<br/><br/>The blood and singing gets a little tiresome 3/4 into the movie, you start to wonder why they must show Sweenet Todd slitting throats and blood squirting blood two feet across the room so many times and why there cant be more dialouge and less singing. None the less, a dark masterfully done piece of work that deserves the attention of the public. The Depp/Burton combination is once again shown to be the most powerful in the business.

She looked like she was on thorazine throughout the entire movie. Her affect was flat as a pancake. Her singing was also flat lacking almost any inflection whatsoever. I understand that these people are not Broadway caliber singers but it really wasn't noticeable because the acting for the most part was so strong. It just always seems that there is one character in any of these adaptations that just can't live up to the part.

For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou/George Hearn, and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd, the Tim Burton (screenplay reduction by Josh Logan) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form. Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd, in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice, and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark, squalid and seedy London. Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle, Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby. The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics.<br/><br/>For this viewer, however, the most successful version of this 'opera' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs. Lovett on record. This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version, and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home, go see it!

"capcanuk","2","0","3","31 March 2008"," An excellent ""adaptation"", but lacks the real heart of the original
","I went into this film with great trepidation. I know this musical like the back of my hand. So it took me a few weeks to get into the right mind-set, telling myself over and over ""this is an adaptation, not the original"".<br/><br/>And I NEEDED it. The changes that Burton has brought to the play are significant, and the performances are enthusiastic but definitely weak on the musical side.<br/><br/>The choice of Johnny Depp as Todd was, while interesting and at least partially understandable as one of Burton's little ""fetish casting"" tricks, not the wisest choice. He pulled of a good dramatic performance. With one small problem: Sweeney Todd is not a stage play, it's a musical. his voice is weak, it lacks everything essential to a good Sweeney. Not withstanding my complaint on this issue, he STILL pulled off quite a coup when one considers the fact that he is not a trained singer in the slightest.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter had the same problem as Mr. Depp. While the role of Mrs. Lovett is not quite as demanding vocally as that of Todd, Bonham Carter's wispy voice just did not suit what musical meat there was.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast suffered the same fate. Voices lacking in dramatic power trying desperately to put the weight where it was needed and failing.<br/><br/>The one issue which I think is unforgivable, however, was Burton's insistence on removing the chorus numbers. He explains it in a logical fashion, but fails to understand that the chorus in Sweeney Todd is not just the artificial ""let's make the crowd sing"" that is so prevalent in musicals. That chorus is an integral PART of the story-telling, and a dramatic person.<br/><br/>""God That's Good!"" loses all of its charm and satire when the only people singing are Lovett and Toby (here the part is played by an actual child, in my opinion, the only truly wonderful casting in the whole film).<br/><br/>And the opening credits music, basically the bare skeleton of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"", just sounds like the orchestra practicing before the singers show up. Without the actual MELODIES the music means nothing! So Burton missed the boat completely on that issue.<br/><br/>Where he again missed the boat was with the cuts. I think that there have been enough 3-hour films that have been monstrous box-office successes that any justification he might come up with for shortening the play so dramatically (under 2 hours) are just so much hot air on Mr. Burton's part.<br/><br/>The over-all tone of the film is dark, which is fine, but some of the humorous lines come across as simply bad writing when they are delivered in the pasty-faced deadpan that Burton obliged his actors to use. ""Worst Pies in London"" is a confused mish-mash of imagery that is completely incomprehensible when delivered in this fashion. Particularly when the two leads suddenly burst into misplaced laughter.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a masterpiece... the musical, not the film. It deserved to be treated as such. I hope in future Tim Burton stays away from the musical genre which he obviously neither appreciates nor understands."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","2","30 March 2008"," A dark parable of light
","Nothing to compare with the French version seen at the cinema some years ago. This film in its original version is entirely or nearly entirely sung and the music is probably the best part of the film.<br/><br/>First Tim Burton recreates in color the bleak black and white vision we can have of London in Dickens among others. Oliver Twist is there in front of us all over again, and his world of coal, smoke and dirt. The only real color he uses is red, the color of blood and nothing else. That is already a piece of art and a masterpiece at that.<br/><br/>Second the actors are so great in their roles and characters that we do believe they are what they pretend to be. Sweeney Todd is really a monster at first look and will not vary from that identification one single iota. He may be justified in his monstrosity or monster-ness, but he is a monster through and through. And he drags everyone around him into that ugliness.<br/><br/>Third there is no hope whatsoever. In the film at least. He abandons the younger ones behind, the youngest has just Killed Sweeney, the two others, the sailor and Todd's daughter are just abandoned alone and frightened. You can also imagine what the good old English Victorian society is going to do to them when they are discovered or captured in that vast cemetery of corpses and cadavers.<br/><br/>Fourth the speaking is voluntarily fuzzy, misty, dark, difficult to follow, often too low, and that is done on purpose. The dialogue is not so much important, apart from a few sentences now and then. It is an atmosphere that is created as if everyone was more or whispering or mumbling in order not to be overheard or understood, misunderstood maybe.<br/><br/>But fifth in this atmosphere the most important element is the music and the singing. It is in no way attractive, charming, harmonious or whatever you may expect from music and singing. It is always the same tone, even when the tune is changing, a very minor dirge that stretches out without any kind of harmony or even attractive rhythm. It is a slow tempo for a very flat music and a minimal singing. A dirge I said, maybe even more than that, the complaint of surviving undead living dead ghosts. We are in the deepest most sinister cul-de-sac blind alley you can imagine in full darkness, with no public light, just a smidgeon of moonlight between two heavy clouds.<br/><br/>And Sweeney Todd is so much engulfed in his vengeance that he does not see anything any more. He does not recognize his own wife except when it is too late. He nearly does the same thing with his own daughter, though he is distracted just in time. He even gets rid of his main accomplice probably out of pure blind vanity and addiction, the addiction to his own vengeance and killing. And his unaware child accomplice is getting just like him at the end and the final razor cut sinks deep in our sensitive mind. Nothing to save that Sweeney and his world. Victorian to the very last second and even right into the credits.<br/><br/>If you believe in love, stay away. If you believe in the beauty of man's heart somewhere, at least the hearts of a few people, stay away: there is not one single beautiful heart in this film. But what is Tim Burton trying to do? To scare us witless out of our pants and frocks with what the world really is behind the shiny and sparkling faÃ§ade? Probably.<br/><br/>A pessimistic film to make us feel relieved when we get out of it: after all, the world is not that bleak. But is it or is it not? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Sweeny Todd tells the legendary tale of a man who loses his wife and daughter to a corrupt judge, is sent to prison unjustly, and comes back to exact revenge. The whole history of the story is rather convoluted but apparently it might have started as a true story and was converted from a legend, to novels, to a Broadway musical, to several movie adaptations. The most recent of which, directed by Tim Burton, is musical film drawing mostly from the Broadway play. <br/><br/>Sweeny Todd is probably my favorite movie of the year next to There Will Be Blood. The movie is the combined effort of regular collaborators Tim Burton, Jonny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. The film has Tim Burton's signature style all over it with its dark macabre look, its dark macabre romance, and its dark macabre everything else. But that's okay because it works. Probably the first thing people will notice about the movie is that it's a musical. Though you don't usually think of serial killers and musicals at the same time, Sweeny Todd really makes it work and the music, credited to Stephen Sondheim, is excellently written. The performances in Sweeny Todd are very good as well. Jonny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter work wonderfully together while Alan Rickman and young newcomer Ed Sanders do extremely well also.<br/><br/>Overall, This is a great movie and I highly recommend it. The level of violence may get to some people (not many these days) but if that doesn't bother you then by all means, see it. I didn't really like musicals as a kid so if I can enjoy this as much as I did than I'm sure you can too."

","Sweeney Todd I knew this was a musical. I saw in the trailers  that it was dark, and bloody; a different genre of film production! <br/><br/>Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) convicts the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) on false charges, rapes Benjamin's wives and destroys a wonderful happy family. Benjamin barker returns from exile after many years, adapts a new name and looks - Sweeney Todd; sets up a new barber shop along with a weirdo baker Mrs.Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). There is a sub-plot in where a young boy Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) falls in love with the Benjamin's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who is adopted by Judge Turpin. Sweeney Todd starts his gory revenge saga by cutting the throats of all the culprits involved in destroying his life and family. There is a tragic end to the tale  which I won't disclose here, to keep the spoilers away.<br/><br/>The attempt by director Tim Burton is excellent. He presents the Broadway hit on screen in musical  a dark, bloodied and gory revenge saga is really an attempt. I read that this project idea was cooking since last 25 years with great actors in mind to play the lead. Luckily Johnny Depp got the onus.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp acts brilliantly as the demon barber and it is difficult to imagine anybody else could have played the character with much more better conviction that Johnny Depp. He is outstanding in each scene. The other acting that stands out is again the mean portrayal of corrupt judge by Alan Rickman. He has matured into a seasoned medieval evil and looks convincing.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is intentionally dark and with blue tinge. It creates the atmosphere of loathe and disgust and letting the minds live in those dark ages. Especially the beginning 15 minutes  is intentionally darker in contrast, then the rest.<br/><br/>Stephen Sondheim provides the original musical score of Broadway. It is excellent.<br/><br/>For those with  weak stomach for blood and gory; and with weak likings of musicals  this is not their cup of tea.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good attempt to capture and present the world of cinema  something different, a dark, bloody musical!

","Let me begin with what I liked about the movie. I liked the actors, although I really wondered why Alan Rickman agreed to play in a movie like Sweeney Todd. Excpet the fact that especially the women sang in a cruel way, they did a good job and made me like the characters. With one exception: Sweeney Todd himself. <br/><br/>Although I'm not a big fan of musicals and I didn't like the music here as well, I have to appreciate the duets and the way, some musical structures were introduced to pop up again later. Nice trick to make you feel as though you liked the music, even if you didn't. <br/><br/>Some of the characters were quite enjoyable. The strange thing is, that I really liked Mrs Lovett and Judge Turpin, but absolutely hated Sweeney. I mean, Mrs Lovett and Sweeney are pretty similar to each other. They're both crazy and have, as far as I can see it, not even a hint of what it means to be human. In Mrs Lovett's case, this behavior is somehow understandable -- in Sweeney's it isn't. <br/><br/>Now, what was the problem about the movie? When I left the cinema, I thought, Oh my God, this is sick and not much more. This movie was contrary to all my opinions about life. Maybe this is conservative or naive or optimistic or a bit of everything, but I felt, that nobody should make a movie like that. ""We all deserve to die"". Well, maybe, I hear this pretty often, but I can't understand it. This is pathetic way to moan about how bad your life is, and mixed with sickness, it doesn't lead you anywhere. Lateron, I discussed the movie with one of my friends. She was delighted, I wasn't, she tried to explain, how Sweeney's mind worked and I actually understood it. And this is, what I really have to decry about the movie: Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd"" does not work as a psyhogramm. It's protagonist is an insane murderer, it's topic should be the mind of this murderer and not his fabulous actions. But for this goal, Burton just doesn't get into it deep enough. A musical as the outer form of a story about a murderer? Sorry, but that doesn't fit and Burton definitely sets the wrong accents. Sometimes, mixing unconventional elements can be revolutionary. In Sweeney Todd's case, it isn't. <br/><br/>So, if you like music and have no problem with unexplained immorality, go watch this movie, it might entertain you. It didn't entertain me -- because I believe, this whole Sweeney Todd-topic is not a topic, that should entertain at all."
"harsawa","10","0","3","29 February 2008"," A brilliant mix of dark humour, haunting visuals, and great music make for one of Tim's best films!
","When I heard that Tim Burton was doing Sweeney Todd, to be honest, I had low expectations. I had no interest in the play, at the time I thought it was nothing more than a story about a couple of killers, a baker and a barber. I had no idea that it was so much more complex, and I am very glad a good friend of mine drug me too it.<br/><br/>Yes, there is lots of butchery in this film, but it all goes with reason. The music is excellent, a dark orchestra fills the background with an almost menacing overture in certain parts, and although many of the songs repeat themselves, they find ways to stay fresh or catchy.<br/><br/>There is a good dose of horror and black comedy in Sweeney; for example, the ending shot alone will haunt you for a good while, while some numbers, such as Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney's conversation when she figures out how to make good meat pies, will have you rolling. Even if black humour isn't your taste, you might find something to laugh at in this scene or the odd 'By the sea' number which almost blinds you with it's brightness and cheeriness compared to the dark visuals of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There are only a couple downsides I can think of, and they come in the form of some of the performances.<br/><br/>For one, Alan Rickman has a hard time hitting notes. He has a fine voice, but it goes off tune sometimes.<br/><br/>Other's include the character of the 'Beadle,' who thankfully only has one singing number, but you will want to claw your ears off when he does so.<br/><br/>There isn't really anything wrong with the people playing Johanna or Anthony, they sing fine, but they sometimes seem to be a little bland when they aren't singing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the rest of the cast turns out wonderful performances, one notable side attraction is Sacha Baron Cohen, who does an absolutely hysterical portrayal of an Italian barber who runs scams on people.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful film, from beginning to end, it looks amazing, sounds amazing, and it lives up to the style with great performances and brilliant direction. What more could you ask for?"

","Sweeney Todd Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2007): Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Laura Michelle Kelly, Alan Rickman, Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, Timothy Spall, Ed Sanders, Jody Halse, Lee Whitlock, Mandy Holliday, Nick Haverson, John Paton, Phill Woodfine, Charlotte Child, Kira Woolman, Buck Holland, Jerry Judge, Norman Campbell Rees, Laura Sanchez, Jon-Paul Hevey, Liza Sadovy...Director Tim Burton, Screenplay John Logan.<br/><br/>After years of waiting by some fans, the film version to Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd"" was released in theaters in December of 2007. The film did not garner any real Oscar buzz as most musical films often do, though it did win Golden Globes (much like Phantom of the Opera back in 2004). The musical film genre is dead and no attempt to revive it really works. But here we have a terrific film that combines thriller mainstream cinema with musical. Tim Burton as Director (Edwardd Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas) is perfect for the Gothic, dark feel to this musical. The cinematography and look (mostly noctural colors black and grey, sunless, pasty faced people, etc) captures a nightmarish and fatalistic quality. Sweeney Todd (Depp) once a prosperous middle-class barber, is accused of a crime he did not commit by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who had set his eyes on Todd's wife (Laura Michelle Kelly). After satisfying his lust for her, he throws her out like garbage and she is destitute and becomes a crazed beggar woman. Years later, Todd is out of prison and seeking his wife and revenge against Turpin. He teams up with Mrs. Lovett (Bonham-Carter) who runs an unsuccessful pie shop. After beating the Italian barber Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen in a hilarious role) he acquires his apprentice Toby (Ed Sanders). After murdering a man who recognized him from his past, Sweeney Todd begins to conjure up a plan to avenge himself. He sets up a joint barber shop and pie shop business. Murdering his paying customers, Mrs. Lovett makes the dead bodies into pies. Ultimately, their crime is uncovered and Todd has been consumed with so much bloodlust and revenge that he unknowingly kills his own wife in a final scene that is straight out of Italian opera with echoes of Pagliacci. All this is built up in a great climax as far as this film goes. In the theater, the musical is witty, darkly humorous and thought-provoking but the medium of film has stepped it up a notch. The problem lies in the fact that there is too much emphasis on blood and gore. The R rating is clearly marked and so this is only suited to mature audiences who can handle it. As for the performances, Johnny Depp does not make this role his own. He is still Johnny Depp, in another one of his countless costumes and roles (he was Willy Wonka not long before this film) and he offers no real depth to the performance. Helena Bonham Carter does not try to imitate the terrific Angela Lansbury who owned the role on Broadway. This is good for so many reasons. She makes Mrs. Lovett appear dysfunctional rather than ""warm and cutesy"" like Lansbury did. It's easier to believe Bonham Carter as equally deranged as Todd than Lansbury. Another thing is that in the original Broadway musical, Lansbury was an equal star to her Sweeney Todd. In this film, Helena B. Carter has to take second chair next to Johnny Depp, who is a big star with a huge fandom and lets everyone know it, too. Much of the film shows too many close-ups of him. Alan Rickman does not make a villanious enough Judge Turpin and plays the part as a cold and aging womanizer. He has lost his ability to play really nasty villain (compare him to his performance as Sheriff Nottingham in ""Prince of Thieves). The rest of the actors are not Broadway trained and it shows so hardcore Broadway fans will feel the same way about this film as they did ""Phantom of the Opera"" back in 2004. Though nothing like the stage musical, this film has its moments. It was for me one of the few good films of 2007. Watch this film if you're a fan of Sondheim's musical and of Johnny Depp."

","I knew of the gory exploits of the Demon Barber via the 1936 barnstorming vehicle for British ham extraordinaire Tod Slaughter, though I haven’t watched that particular film itself; on the other hand, I was vaguely aware that Stephen Sondheim had turned it into an unlikely but, by all accounts, successful musical.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is a genuine but somewhat erratic talent but, whenever he joins forces with one of today’s finest actors – Johnny Depp – he seems to be particularly inspired, and this one’s no exception. As ever, the film’s visuals (of a seedy and forbidding 19th century London) are impeccable – and SWEENEY TODD deservedly emerged the Oscar winner in the art direction/set decoration category last Sunday night! Interestingly, Depp had never sung on film previously but he does extremely well and, indeed, figured prominently – somewhat surprisingly (this is a horror musical, after all) but rightly so, in my opinion – among the year’s Best Actor nominees; his brooding good looks are perfect for the character’s mix of pent-up emotions and cool viciousness. He’s matched by Helena Bonham-Carter, the director’s own mate, as the pie-shop owner who decides to spice up her traditional recipe – and is delighted to see the formerly dormant business flourish (with the helping hand of revenge-seeking barber Depp)! The supporting cast is headed by reliables such as Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall and newer star acts like BORAT (2006)’s Sacha Baron Cohen as a pompous traveling barber/charlatan (and, hence, a rival/victim for Todd).<br/><br/>SWEENEY TODD has been criticized for its vigorous blood-letting, and I do concede that Burton should have restrained his predilection for these grisly scenes – since they tend to become repetitive and, eventually, lead the film towards overlength at almost two hours. A local critic whose opinion I usually respect and value was underwhelmed by the film and only gave it **; he was also unimpressed by the songs or the actors’ idiosyncratic rendition of them; I personally found Sondheim’s score quite effective and rousing at just the right moments…though, admittedly, it could also be grating i.e. whenever the actors have to sing separate choruses on top of one another. Similarly, Mrs. Lovett’s fantasy beach scene comes across as a distraction – as if we’d been suddenly thrown back to the environment of Burton’s own BIG FISH (2003)! The narrative’s overwhelming Gothic bleakness remains unrelieved till the very end – with events leading to the inevitable frenzied climax tinged with a tragic irony; we should perhaps have been allowed a ray of hope by being shown the young lovers united but, since the film is really about the plight of Depp’s character and his luckless wife, it’s appropriate that we stick with their fate."

","What a great movie, based on the hit Broadway musical which tell the story of Benjamin Barker a.k.a Sweeney Todd who returns to London after many years in jail to prepare his vengeance against Judge Turpin with the help of mysterious Mrs Lovett. It is the classic type of movie Tim Burton use to make, although its a musical it has a pretty sense of mystery and suspense, it also has some very good moments of black humor. The photography is excellent, everything so dark and creepy. The soundtrack is simply wonderful, it is a plus to the film that makes it even more enjoyable. The cast is just perfect, Johnny Depp with a flawless performance, Sweeney Todd is that kind of role that fits him very well, with the surprise that he didn't sing that bad, no wonder why he earned that Oscar nomination for best actor. Helena Bonham Carter is also wonderful in the role of Mrs. Lovett, watching her performance was a real joy. Alan Rickman was excellent as Judge Turpin and the supporting roles from Sacha Baron Cohen, Timothy Spall, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener were a very good complement. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year and one of the best musical I've ever seen, its really a pity that it has just a few nominations because it really deserves a lot more"

","If you heard that there was a musical movie about a barber who goes insane and kills people then his land lady takes the bodies, grinds up them up and uses the meat for pies, what would you think? Would you go see it, would you be grossed out, would you be so interested but not willing to pay full price that you would wait for it on DVD. Well, if you're like me and are a die-hard fan of the musical tale of terror by Stephen Sondheim, then you would see the very first showing of it at your nearest movie theater. <br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of Stephen Sondheim or musical theater, this is a real treat for anybody who loves the genius of Tim Burton. The filming style is extraordinary, in this we, the audience, are taken through the more darker side of Tim Burton rather than the whimsical, fairy tale like imagery seen in his previous work of art, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Here we are taken back to the ""Batman"" style darkness of Mr. Burton, it's bleak, macabre, somber and there is no chance of a ray of sunshine beckoning the cobblestoned streets of Dickensian London.<br/><br/>And if Tim Burton's return to the darkness isn't enough for you, we have the remarkable vocals of not Len Cariou, not Michael Cerveris but of the immortal and impeccable Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp's ability to sing is even more surprising than Gomer Pyle's. To some it is amazing the fact that he can sing, but to me it is nothing smashing because Johnny Depp has amazed me with so many roles, including Edward Scissorhands, Jack Sparrow, Gilbert Grape, Ed Wood and Willy Wonka. If Johnny's given a role, he's going to make it nothing short of spectacular. <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, there are films that you can see at home and films that can only be viewed best if seen in theaters. Good titles to prove my point would include 300, Across the Universe, Moulin Rouge and, of course, the film about a demon barber and a sinfully sweet baker woman, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
"Ahm_Shere","10","0","2","24 February 2008"," One of Burton's finest movies
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet street is a Gothic, musical horror, which just has Tim Burton's name all over it. Everything about this movie is fantastic, and it just shows how great of a director Burton actually is.<br/><br/>The acting, especially Helena Bonham Carter's, where amazing, and I can honestly say that she outshines Johnny Depp in this movie for her vocals and acting, although Depp was still brilliant at both.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd got me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie, and I was always wondering what was going to come next. Who's throat he was going to slash with his silver razor friends. Whether the Judge was going to be murdered by Todd, and whether Todd and Lovett would be together. So many twists and turns, and so many jumps.<br/><br/>Go see the movie if you haven't already, and its something you wont regret. This certainly is a Tim Burton masterpiece."
"filmbuff20","8","0","1","24 February 2008"," Wonderfully twisted macabre musical from a visionary.
","Mixing the lyrical and musical talents of Steven Sondheim and the twisted macabre of Tim Burton, Sweeney Todd is a unique beast, not neatly fitting into any one genre and therefore struggling to find it's audience in a world of viewers who seem to take their musicals and splatter-fests mutually exclusively. But Sweeney Todd is so much more than either of those two things and each serves the other to tell a rich, funny, tragic and visually wonderful story about love loss and revenge.<br/><br/>From the very first ominous note, we're in for a Gothic treat, the wonderful CG title sequence acting as visual overture to the musical one playing over it. We are introduced to Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), a barber whose life is stolen from him by the villainous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Reminiscent of the path taken by The Count of Monte Cristo's Edmond Dantes but far less honourable, Barker returns under the name Sweeney Todd and vows revenge on those responsible.<br/><br/>The slightly jarring first songs can take a few minutes to adjust to for newbies, amidst the quintessentially Tim Burton looking design, but once the story's background is established and Johnny Depp's duet with Helena Bonham Carter, My Friends, begins, it is clear that the marriage of Sondheim's genius and Burton's twisted sensibility is a sound one. The lightning fast lyrics hold more cleverness in subsequent viewings and the musical nuances become more and more apparent with multiple listens. Burton draws on his influences, the washed out treatment of the picture evoking an almost black and white feel (although in colour) comprising of a blues, greys and golds with the occasional burst of vibrant colour in the dream/flashback sequences for punctuation. This is nothing new, Burton having used a similar palette for Sleepy Hollow, but just as it fit then, so too does it seem like Sondheim's Todd was meant to be lensed in that way. The character design further services Burton's filmic obsessions. The wild hair, pale skin and sunken eyes recall old horror films like The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari and Bride of Frankenstein.<br/><br/>The standouts among the cast, ironically, are not the certified singers. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman all give superbly shaded performances heightened by their surprising vocal talents, while Burton sprays blood everywhere as a metaphorical emotional release for Todd's ailing psychopath. The final reel is a juggernaut of tragic happenstance, with a gut wrenching final shot that makes you realise that you care for these flawed nutcases more than you'd care to admit.<br/><br/>In short, Sweeney Todd is a wonderful adaptation. Those coming from experience with the show will adore it and it will gain more fans who haven't seen the show as it becomes the cult film it's destined to be."
"jeigan","5","0","3","24 February 2008"," Not an awful movie, but a huge disappointment nonetheless...
","Let's get right to the point: Sweeney Todd is a disappointment. Neither Tim Burton's awesome Gothic atmospheres nor Johnny Depp's and Helena Bonham Carter's great acting can save this movie.<br/><br/>Since Sweeney Todd is a musical/splatter movie, it offers both a lot of songs and a lot of blood. Both done poorly.<br/><br/>The songs aren't what you would expect: basically, each character has a ""theme"" song: Anthony keeps singing his annoying Johanna song, judge Turpin repeats ""pretty women"" a dozen times (and it's called a song?), Toby has his ""while I'm here, blah blah blah"" part and so on. All these characters do is talk, sing for a couple of seconds, and go away. The exceptions are the main characters: Sweeney Todd, a man torn by vengeance and a bit of a psycho, and Mrs. Lovett, owner of a meat pie shop, who is, at times, even crazier than him. These two do have their theme songs (Sweeney's is like judge Turpin's, except he sings ""London sucks"" instead of ""pretty women""), but also sing with each other, or with other characters. Sometimes there is a song that's not awful like the ""theme"" ones, which is a welcome addition (for example, Mrs. Lovett stating how she makes the worst pies in London).<br/><br/>As for the splatter part, it can be summed up in two points: 1) the blood is done VERY poorly, to the point it looks like (and flows like) red paint... 2) there are only a few gory scenes, with some 10 or so executions, all done in the same way, which means when you've seen the first two, you've seen them all. Add that, in my opinion, the movie's Gothic ambiance hardly suits these blood-filled scenes, which are more suited to a B-movie.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are one-dimensional and can be summed up by their theme songs: Anthony is your usual idealistic youngster who falls in love with a girl he's seen ONCE at the window, and gets obsessed with ""stealing her""; Sweeney's lust for revenge, and blood in general (I guess one could say he's emo) is reflected in his ""London is full of crap, London is this, London is that"" lines, and so on.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie does not suck that bad (hence the 5/10): some of the scenes are in fact very enjoyable, if not downright comical, like the ""duel"" between Sweeney and Signor Pirelli, but they alone are not enough to save the whole film. There is a total of ONE plot twist, towards the end, which can leave the viewer in shock for a second or two, but nothing too exciting.<br/><br/>In the end, Sweeney Todd doesn't offer much: a Gothic atmosphere, some forgettable songs, great acting by the protagonists, and that's it. I was very disappointed with this movie, so I can only advise you to think twice before watching it..."
"Schaeuffelchen","10","0","1","24 February 2008"," Even more than one could expect
","Tim Burton has always been known for his combining the brutal with the beautiful and the melancholy with the funny. He is one of the very few directors who can make the longing for death a humorous matter, and Burton has been perfecting this ability throughout most of his career. A chief contribution to the particular Burtonesque style was his teaming-up with Johnny Depp for ""Edward Scissorhands"". Ever since, this dream team of the ""rather extraordinary movie"" has produced masterpieces like ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Corpse Bride"". And now: ""Sweeney Todd"". I have read much about the danger of producing a musical, using an adapted play, and making actors sing. However, I always knew that Burton would not try to make this film perfect but to deliver a certain mood which can only be described as ""Burtonesque"", or maybe ""DeppandBurtonesque"". Surprisingly perfect is the result, though. Although we are talking about an old play which was hardly modified in the process of making the film, it seems like the story, the characters, and the setting were put together in anticipation of someone like Burton to make them the core of an blockbuster (if Burton films can be called this). It's hard to judge whether the ""sub-perfect"" singing voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman are part of the film design or whether they do originate from lack of vocal abilities. Why should a broken character sing with the voice of a nightingale? By the way: Especially during the songs, but even in general, the appreciation for the best performance is owed to Helena Bonham Carter. What surprised me, though, was the amount of blood and the degree of brutality which is untypical - even for Tim Burton. At some points, it feels like you are sitting in a Tarantino movie or like you are watching a new ""SAW"" trailer. But considering the completely stylized mood of the movie, a certain equilibrium is created again, so that you are not left with the image of a horror slasher film but with that of a true Tim Burton creation."

","Tim Burton is the leading goth director of today and this is probably his best performance. ""Sweeney Todd"" is a ""so so"" musical, but there has probably not been such a performance on stage, like the one you see here. And definitely not that much blood.<br/><br/>Certainly Depp and Bonham Carter wouldn't have passed any stage auditions if they hadn't been celebrities. Nobody is a good singer but they perform their old mimic tricks, which always function in the movies. And in this kind of rather shallow musical it's enough.<br/><br/>The photo is rather excellent and Burton brings out the best of this material into a fairly entertaining two hours. Some time the old discussion about movie violence ought to get restarted however. Are we in the audience corrupted or perverted or what's our problem?"
"RResende","Null","0","2","23 February 2008"," (too much) classic
","This is made out of a clear line which is perverted, and twisted, according to Burton's own visual way to put things together. In other words, we have a classical musical and a classical Burton. We get music as ""numbers"" in the sort of construction the classic American musicals used, borrowed from Italian opera (bel canto, mainly). This structure uses songs where opera used arias (reflection moments), and dialogs where opera placed recitation (action moving further). Burton doesn't try to change a bit of this. I'm OK with this. Despite the musical genre has been getting some interesting new additions in recent years (Moulin Rouge stands out here), i think it's plausible to recover the classic form. Over that fully developed (and recognizable) structure, Burton places his personal vision. His concerns have much to do with image, the power of a vision, an environment, than it has to do with space. When he is able to pull off that vision with power (Batman, Ed Wood, Edward...) he creates a truly deep, visual, and lasting experience. Batman was specially well done, because it is spatially deep, as well as visually.<br/><br/>This film is minor work, in the big picture of Burton's work. I think that happens because none of it is fresh. The base form, i mentioned it, is classic, and this Burton is also classic. the breaks he introduces were fresh once, and because they were fresh they were spontaneous. Here, things are more predictable. I supposed the pretended effect would be something of a contrast between what we are accustomed to get from a musical with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire, and the gore/Burton imagery which includes blood in great amounts, dark environment, twisted characters (here they are all twisted, except the ""old"" woman and the young lover). That contrast is felt in some spaces, it works out as something funny, rooted on a comedy sense of absurd, strange things and the way we react to them.<br/><br/>Depp with Bonham Carter is a good team, here i think it is more effective than the more media-tic Depp/Burton. Johnny Depp is someone who is beyond the 'method', and to my view, he is adding new steps to the path Brando walked in his artistic life. I suspect something about him, but i need confirmation, that may come with a future important film he makes. He started his career on the footsteps of Brando, someone who eliminated from his characters the overly dramatic, distracting kind of acting, more suited to theatre than to cinema. He understood cinema acting as 3dimensional acting, meaning that he represents some characters, but over that he layers other meanings, personal annotations, a kind of deepness impossible to achieve with theatre (John Malkovich and Bruce Willis created personal versions of this kind of way to act). Now, i suspect, Depp is somehow coming back to those theatrical roots. He is getting 'stagy' on purpose, he is allowing for the audience to understand in many moments that he is really acting, performing, standing on a stage. I don't know where he may be getting to with this, it may even be a wrong impression based on recent parts, but i'm really interested in following this possible thread Depp is building. Buy now i don't dislike what he is doing, but i want to check where this goes.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 you have better rides to try from Burton, and from Burton/Depp<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

The songs are catchy and will have you singing them for days... I recommend that you go purchase the soundtrack or you will regret it.

It's a musical so 3/4's of it has singing in it. It's directed by Tim Burton who has a brilliant mind for making goth theme movies. Also contains a cast of well known actors. Johnny Depp and Helena Boham Carter who both worked with Tim before did an amazing job together.

If I have to use a word to describe it, it's Burton's most unique directed film.

","When the opening credits began I was already very excited. I had goosebumps. It does begin with a song, but I was not worried about that. I don't like those musicals when people begin dancing and getting mad and the musics don't play an important role. In Sweeney Todd it's very different. The lyrics tell us the story, and the musics are even exciting. Sondheim's soundtrack is great too. Johnny and Helena sing beautifully. But Alan's, Timothy's and Sacha's singing are a bit odd. Johnny deserved to win an Oscar since the first role he played, but now that he's nominated, he deserves it more than ever. His character must have made many people have nightmares. One of his best characters yet. Helena also deserved to be at least nominated. She is simply great as Mrs. Lovett. I could even give some laughs in some of her scenes. Sacha plays another memorable character, just like Borat.<br/><br/>Lots of blood, the dark London, the barber shop, the pies shop, at last, everything from special effects to makeup, figurine and production design is simply amazing and scary. There's a very surprising ending, which made me stay stunned for half an hour after I left the movies.<br/><br/>This is a stunning and scary film, one of the best I have ever watched, and surely the best musical, that deserves to be remembered and deserves a special place in my DVD shelf. Once again, Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did their job in a wonderful film with an exceptional ending that must be watched by everyone, even by the ones who doesn't like musicals."

","Went on premiere of ""Sweeney Todd"" here in Croatia yesterday and I must say that this is brilliant movie on so many levels. I had high expectations because of Burton's previous work and Depp's magical ability of portraying every single role on this world. Two of them never ever failed in my eyes. After movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Corpse Bride"", we've got ""Sweeney Todd"", another masterpiece from this productive duo. Burton, as always, took the risk of making such a movie. It's very hard to make a movie based on hit Broadway musical and Burton does it with no problems and yet with his so well known signature. <br/><br/>Story follows Benjamin Barker (barber), who returns in London after years in exile for a crime he didn't commit. Barker comes back as Sweeney Todd, who wants his revenge. He must find where are his wife and daughter, with a little help from Mrs. Lovett (owner of meat pie shop). Man who is guilty for destroying Todd's life is evil Judge Turpin. But not one man killed, or ten thousands men can satisfy Sweeney's appetite for revenge.<br/><br/>As always Burton assembled great cast. Here we've got his all time favorite Johnny Depp as Sweeney Tood, his wife Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Sacha Baron Cohen as Adolfo Pirelli. You simply don't know who was better. Depp in Oscar worthy performance, Cohen in great small role, Rickman as villain or Bonham Carter who portrayed her character with perfection (all of them are amazing). Also I must say that young Ed Sanders is great. All the singing parts are done by the actors. Johnny Depp wasn't bad and Bonham Carter was very good. They sing most of the songs and I think they did a good job (just like all the rest). Johnny Depp makes another memorable role. After so much beautiful created characters, he plays Sweeney Todd ('Epiphany' is amazing). A man who wants his revenge, a mad man, a killer. Depp never played such sick person, Sweeney is like evil brother of Edward Scissorhands. Depp's range of emotions is unique and this is Oscar worthy performance (he was in every movie genre and he's done it all with perfection). Maybe this will be finally his year, but we don't need a golden statue to acknowledge one of the best actors today.<br/><br/>The whole movie is amazing. Starts from the port and we see streets of London just like we're looking at play in a theater. Burton's dark tone is great and it represents how Sweeney feels. There are few bright colors, like in Mrs. Lovett dream of her happy life. Maybe the whole movie starts a bit slow, but from the entrance of Adolfo Pirelli it takes great turn. We are drawn into the story with beautiful simplicity that only Burton can create. There is lot of singing at the beginning and only one boring and annoying character of Anthony Hope (at least to me), but Burton needs all that so he can present the whole story. So to conclude, I was very surprised with this movie cause I didn't expect this and I would like to recommend it to all of you. Burton, Depp, blood, music, atmosphere, revenge. All that you can see in this beautiful achievement of cinematography. I will just repeat a title of one song: 'God, that's good!'"

","I have to say that maybe I am not very objective when I look at Tim Burton's films because I have to say that both he and Johnny Depp are my two favourite artists. I went to watch the movie yesterday and I really liked and enjoyed it. It is not boring at all. Although the movie lasts 2 hours, the movie is not boring at all because all the time are happening things.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie is one of Burton's masterpieces with Edward Scissorhands. I am not going to make a summary of this film because there are a lot of summaries on the web. I am only going to tell you that if I were u, I would go to the cinema to watch the movie without a doubt. This is a film to watch at the cinema and not at home. If you pay attention to my advise, you will not regret it."

","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for such a long time! Since it won't come out in Germany until February 12th I had to wait even longer than the American audience. Well, I finally got to see it and here is my review.<br/><br/>First off, I think on its own terms the movie is extraordinary! Truly one of the greatest movies of the past year. When it started I was at first put off by the picture of the Tower Bridge (which did not exist an the time in which the movie is set) but I quickly got over it and just followed along.<br/><br/>The whole look of the movie is incredible. The costumes, the production design, the wigs, everything fits together perfectly. This is probably, along with ""Batman Returns"", the one where Burton captured his German-Exypressionism-Look best. Everything is just a little bit twisted and shabby yet somehow beyond all the filth there is something glorious about it.<br/><br/>The actors are just as great. Helena Bonham-Carter makes for a very funny Mrs. Lovett, even though she decided to play it down a little bit from the usual hysterical stage version and make her a human rather than a complete maniac. Depp seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's ""Brokeback Mountain""-performance judging by the way he constantly clenches his teeth together. Because of this decision his singing often sounds like he is hissing the sounds through his teeth, but it fits just well with his performance. I like the decision to make the main characters not too exaggerated as they often are on stage. It might fit there, but here this portrayal seems so much more realistic and adds to the effect of the movie. Of the entire -wonderful- cast, there are only two characters who are completely overplayed: Timothy Spall's Beadle and Sasha Baron Cohen's Pirelli. But this as well adds to the movie and helps making these people characters you just love to hate, in the case of the Beadle perhaps even more than the Jugde.<br/><br/>The gore-level is very high and the throat slitting seems to be the most real thing in the entire movie. This is a very courageous decision as it makes you squirm even though you are entertained. Whereas the stage-version is often darkly comical the movie is rather macabre and the viewer can feel how painful death can be (and still can't wait for the next death). This makes the movie very bitter-sweet and makes it stay with you a lot longer. I was actually surprised that Burton did not go all the way and decided not to show Toby's fate as it would have made the ending even more heartbreaking. But that would have been just the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>And now the one thing that makes me take off one star of the movie: It really sounds like I am one of these elitists if I compare it to the stage version and I really don't mean to. In fact, if you don't know the stage version you will not miss anything at all. But since I have seen it I have to compare it automatically. Make no mistake, everything that's here is great, no complains. I just sometimes wished that some of the abbreviated songs had been intact in the movie. I know why Burton cut them and I understand his decision but since I think the choires are so integral to the musical I would have preferred it if he had kept them in a few songs, most notably ""God that's good"" and ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"". Sometimes it simply felt like the songs were just hinted at instead of really performed. And for ""A little Priest"" I would have preferred had Depp and Bonham-Carter made it just a little bit more lively. There is no need to make it the wild number it is on stage, but it is a sweeping waltz after all.. A little more than just staring out of the window would have been nice.<br/><br/>But enough of that. I can only advise everyone, even non-lovers of musicals, to see this movie. You probably won't be disappointed - as long as you don't mind the blood."

","Leave it to Time Burton and Johnny Depp to take a dark classic musical, and make a it bloody good time. The film is fantastic, I can't even describe or scratch the surface of how amazing this is, but I'll start with Depp. He is unforgettable in this movie, his performance is the most charismatic of this decade. As much as I prey to the gods that he'll win the Oscar, I think (unfortunatly) that it is going to go to Day-Lewis, as much as I want Depp to win. He truly deserves it and it will be even better that it's in the best Tim Burton film since Ed Wood. Keep your fingers crossed for Johnny's Oscar. Mrs. Lovett played beautifully by Helena Bonham Carter, she carry's the character with a certain grace that I can't picture any other actress doing.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's direction is also award worthy. This play was huge on stage and Burton brings it down to from a opera on stage to a film that is huge, but doesn't feel it. Don't get me wrong this film is by far one of the best of this year, but he is able to take this from Broadway to a film. It doesn't feel like a play, it feels like a real movie, I can't even describe it, this film is so go and so terrific, you'll wanna look away from the gore, but I guarantee you won't be able to."

","Its dark...its musical...its dramatic...its all of it together. I've never enjoyed musicals that much, i actually find them quite boring. Still, when I was watching Sweeney Todd, I couldn't even go to the bathroom, i just didn't wanted to miss anything!! The songs and the lyrics where amazing and, sometimes,even funny. I actually liked the singing parts, because the story didn't freeze during it, like most musicals. The end of the film was unexpected and not a cliché at all, and the actors' performances where great! I admit I didn't knew what to expect from a musical where Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter both sing, but I was surprise with their voices. Johnny Depp made a brilliant performance, making us wanting more!! The ambiance of the movie is also great. Tim Burton presents this kind of twisted universe of London, full with thief's and not any moral at all. Everything just seems perfect, to the smallest detail, like the clothes or the set. The blood is obviously artificial, but the fact that it is so red, just makes it part of the universe. 5* for me!!"

","Tim Burton's version of ""Sweeney Todd"" is a heavily flawed film, but it is one of the year's best films despite the flaws.<br/><br/>The actors are all really good. Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter look like zombies. The film is very cinematic and is not like watching a stage production.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the singing is not very good, especially if you are used to hearing ""Sweeney Todd"" sung by professionals. This is not a fatal flaw but it is distracting. Also, the film is extremely gory, which might turn off many of the people who would normally like musicals.<br/><br/>The flaws will probably be most evident to viewers that are familiar with the stage musical. If you are not familiar with it, you probably will not notice.<br/><br/>If you like musicals with a really, really, dark sense of humor, you should see ""Sweeney Todd."""
"mollymormonbrat","9","0","1","10 February 2008"," Ah, the glory of fountains of blood and dark comedy/tragedy singing!
","Johnny Depp certainly got himself another hit on his hands with this one, much to the delight of his considerable fan club and every other Broadway baby out there. While I don't know if Johnny Depp is the world's greatest singer (he won't be doing opera anytime soon) he proves that he can carry a tune well enough to make this a musical worth seeing, and fans of prior versions of the show should be pleased. Helena Bonham Carter keeps up her pace as his consort with that flair of hers we all know and love.<br/><br/>But it ain't just Mr. Depp and Ms. Carter. Even without him and his gifts ""Sweeny Todd"" is art, a sensitive version of the old legend of the killer that speaks of his personal tragedy even as it recognizes his darker and, dare I say, it comedy. Simply put, ""Sweeny Todd"" is a great story in every sense of the word. It has it all: comedy, tragedy, romance, cannibalism. What more do you need? Visually it is a gem, from the river of blood that opens it to the scenes that vary between the streets of London and the cramped spaces of the homes and pie shops. It does not sweep broadly, but pulls you into claustrophobic conditions that force you to examine the characters. Every one of them is real. Every one of them, good or evil, earns your appreciation in a character-driven story that refuses to be two-dimensional.<br/><br/>This is not about a barber that kills people. This is about what people will do when they are desperate in their passions of love and hate. We see goodness, innocence, love. We see revenge, evil, pain. We see everything in between, serious and funny alike.<br/><br/>The songs are incredible and do their part to move the story along in their lyrics of passion and black humor.<br/><br/>Isn't it great that musicals are back in vogue?"

","I never expected to enjoy a musical movie in my life. I was automatically hooked on the movie when the opening started. The eerie sound and imagery already gives you a vivid idea of how eerie it will be. Of course, Johnny Depp does a remarkable job in the movie. He is so good in capturing the audience's attention and does a fine job in singing. I did not expect Depp to sing so well, but he did an excellent with all the other cast members.<br/><br/>I usually hate watching movies that spend most of the time with just songs. Sweeney Todd was 90% filled with songs, but that is what made the movie so good. In this movie, you cannot skip forward and not listen to the songs. If you skip the songs you lost the entire movie. They sing in such a way that it makes you want to sing along.<br/><br/>You barely see a movie that combines musical, drama, crime, and thriller in one. This is a must see movie.<br/><br/>My vote: 10/10"
"davideo-2","10","0","1","7 February 2008"," Revives the musical
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a simple barber with a pretty wife and infant daughter, until the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) had him unfairly locked away so he could force his wife to be with him against her will. Years later, Benjamin returns to London but with a new name- Sweeney Todd- and with one thing on his mind: revenge. He makes friends with pie shop owner Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and, after missing his chance for revenge against Turpin, decides to take his anger and vengeance out on the ordinary inhabitants of London, slitting their throats so Mrs Lovett can use them to make meat pies.<br/><br/>The musical has been a genre that's faded away over the years, much like the western or the murder mystery. But director Tim Burton has reunited with frequent star of his films, Johnny Depp, to make a film version of the popular stage play. And it has his unmistakable style stamped all over it. This is no Rogers and Hammerstein, everything's jolly, la la la musical from the old days, but a raw, savage, blood-splattered film that would shock fans of those types of films away. Not so much The Sound of Music as The Sound of Throat-gurgling! It's Burton's darkest film to date and he handles it very well indeed.<br/><br/>Watching the film, you're reminded what a unique and pleasant experience the musical can be, for a type of film that isn't about much nowadays, as the frequent musical numbers do sweep you away and wrap you up in the film quite wonderfully. Even more impressive when you think that all the cast, including Depp, Carter and Rickman, all did their own singing. It's not so much their performances that roll the film along here as their singing, which is certainly more likable. The story's pretty decent, too, showing an unflinching 18th century London with corruption and moral decadence everywhere, as well as exploring how one man's endless quest for revenge warps his mind and causes him to lose his soul.<br/><br/>The 18 certificate didn't come for nothing, and when the throat-slitting scenes come about they don't spare anything, all the blood squirting and spraying out the slit throats in a manner as gross as you could imagine. This may be too much for some faint-hearted viewers, but it could just as easily be a recommendation to others. At any rate, this is well worth checking out as a sterling re-introduction to a genre that's fallen to the sidelines pretty much altogether over the years. *****"
"twlarge","9","0","1","6 February 2008"," Burton and Depp's best yet
","A grown-up cartoon film. Don't be put off by the reports of blood and gore - although there's plenty of that, it's no worse than your average Tom and Jerry, writ large and real. More importantly, it's Burton's best for years. By constraining the action to almost a single set, he enables his actors to stretch, gradually creating evolving characters, and cleverly shifting our sympathies between them. Depp and Bonham Carter rise to the occasion, turning in performances which teeter on the edge between grande guignole and farce - and almost always land on the right side. Oh yes, I almost forgot the music! Which says it all really. Although the spoken-to-sung ratio isn't quite as low as I'd been led to expect, it's still fairly operatic. I'm not a big Sondheim fan (more of a Rodgers and Hammerstein or Loesser man myself), but it's to his credit that there are no big show-stopper first-half-closer tunes in there. As regards Burton's direction, you have to admire and support his preference for classic filmic techniques, rather than clever whooshy jump-cuts, to advance the story to its denouement. A brilliant film. BTW, Johnny sings good!"

I had sort of heard of it when it was mentioned in ""Jersey Girl"", but other then that my knowledge was totally non existent.<br/><br/>On one hand I had a fairly difficult time understanding much of what was being said, but only because of the incredibly thick cockney accents that were being used Which in all fairness made the film more believable. All of the players did a spectacular job in the making of this film.<br/><br/>I was most surprise by Cohen's performance as the most i knew of him up until that point was borat, and i hardly call that acting as much as i would call it acting like a complete tool and getting paid for cruelty to his fellow man.<br/><br/>But he did exceptionally well.<br/><br/>I will say that both my wife and i were really kind of depressed towards the end. It's a sad movie, and while you totally understand why sweeny todd wants revenge, by the end of the film you shouldn't feel bad about what happens.<br/><br/>It is a very dark tale, but an enjoyable tale.

The acting was top notch espec from the main actors..Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Ed Sanders as the little boy and of coarse Sacha Baron Cohen who in his character reminded me so much of his character Borat from the accent. I wasn't too sure if the blood was meant to be the color it was as it looked pink rather then the way blood should look..whether that was the way Tim wanted it to look i'm not sure, the death scenes were still pretty brutal and for me it was a thumbs up!

","This was an excellent movie version of Sondheim's brilliant operetta. I thought the casting was impeccable and the cinematography was perfection. The time and tale fit Burton to a ""T"" and he, them.<br/><br/>I have two minor complaints which kept me from giving the film an ""8"" instead of a ""7"".<br/><br/>A couple of Bonham-Carter's numbers were sung a bit too softly and were almost throw-aways instead of character-defining moments. I got the feeling though that she was holding back at Burton's direction and definitely not through a lack of vocal skill! Her opening number ""The Worst Pies in London"" definitely could have used a lot more energy and slightly better timing. She showed plenty of energy during her duet with Depp in ""A Little Priest"" so I don't understand why they were satisfied with ""Worst Pies"" the way it is.<br/><br/>Too much blood. It was a little too ""Sweeney Todd"" meets ""Natural Born Killers"" for my taste. Yes, Sweeney slits throats, but did we need to see fountains and rivers of gore for every kill? Perhaps just a spurt or two for the Judge could have satisfied Burton's thing for blood? It became overly distracting and when any element of the film stands out like that it takes away from the whole.<br/><br/>Other than those two comments, I was delighted and enthralled by the direction, the performances, and the cinematography of Burton's ""Sweeney""!"

","I'm not at all shocked at the rave reviews on this site, as Tim Burton has a rabid fan base. Most of the time I'd agree. I love Tim Burton movies, because they are visually appealing to me. Now, I recognize that the movie is based on the play and not the actual real life story of Sweeney Todd, but I guess I expected good old Timmy not to pander to Hollywood/Broadway/the establishment in general, and get with the truly awesome story of the real deal. Or at least bring it close, but he got a little too fairy tale.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp both look absurdly, obviously evil in the movie to the point that a blind man could call it. The poor continuity involved in the setup of the house aside, the real story of dragging the bodies around the catacombs under the city and giving them to his girlfriend is much darker and more befitting. Killing her (Mrs. Pruett) at the end is just a cheap way to cover the gap and end the film without figuring out how he gets caught, because that element in the true story has been abandoned. Maybe I have just come to expect more from Mr Burton, but I would say that the film just lacks credibility."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street starts as wrongly convicted escaped penal colony prisoner Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) arrives back home in London 15 years after he was imprisoned at the behest of the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) leaving behind a beautiful wife & a young daughter named Johanna for the lecherous old Judge to prey on. Barker heads back to where he used to live & finds Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) running a meat pie shop, she claims his wife committed suicide & the Judge now keeps Johanna (Jayne Wisener) imprisoned in his house. Changing his name from Barker to Sweeney Todd to hide his real identity he sets up a barber's above the meat pie shop where he plots his gruesome revenge...<br/><br/>This British American co-production was directed by Tim Burton & is a gory Gothic & darkly morbid film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical as opposed to a straight adaptation of the infamous story which has been around since the 19th Century, apparently. The musical adaptation was by Christopher Bond while the films screenplay is credited to John Logan, I will admit right here & now that I haven't seen Sondheim's musical this is based on so I have no idea if it's faithful but by all accounts there are several songs missing from this & it goes without saying that this film version has far more flexibility in what it shows than a live stage musical ever could. I liked the story, I liked the setting, I liked the character's & for the most part I liked the songs too but I did think the first half was a little slow at times. It's fair to say right now a few weeks after Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opened it has reached #189 in the IMDb's 'Top 250' films list although I doubt very much that it will stay there especially when it comes out on home video. This is a hard film to call & recommend, apart from some isolated sequences with dialogue the entire film is sang & that in itself may put many off, it can look a bit strange at times & I must admit that I did start & get a little bored with it as the entire first half of the film is song after song with very little incident. Once the killings & gore start the films picks up immeasurably but that's probably down to the fact that I love horror films & gory horror films at that so one could argue that my liking for such things carried me through. If you don't like musicals where everyone bursts into song every few seconds & you don't like blood drenched darkly Gothic horror films then Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is your worst nightmare come true. This really is down to personal taste, if you have no interest in musicals or gore then give it a miss since I think it's a very acquired taste.<br/><br/>Director Burton knows how to turn in a visually interesting & stylish film with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street no exception, there's some wonderful camera shots & plenty of little visual gags & clever touches. It's certainly a great & often ghoulish film to sit down & watch. The sets are superb, they really give you a feel of the run down rat infested back streets of Victorian (modern?!) London & are totally convincing. Large parts of the film are gore free but once the blood flows there's plenty on show with some of the coolest slit throats out there, huge spurts of crimson red blood look great as do the various minced up bodies & mutilated human remains seen at the end of the film. Talking of the end it's all rather morbid & downbeat, personally I thought it was an appropriate & fitting way to round the film off but just don't expect a Grease (1978) style happy ending! Over here in the UK the trailers that have run on TV have all been dialogue based & make no indication that Sweeney Todd: The Barber of Fleet Street is 95% musical, I could certainly see people mislead by the trailers into thinking they were going to see a Tim Burton Gothic horror gore-fest rather than a sprightly musical which I think is rather naughty...<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is superbly made with exquisite production values, the sets look gorgeous although Burton tends to bleach a lot of the colour out of the shot & at times it's not far from being black and white. Actually shot here in the UK this certainly looks very nice. The acting is alright, the singing is alright & I have no major problems with either although I doubt anyone will be singing any of the songs on show here to themselves on the way home & the heavy cockney accents might put some off.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an acquired taste for sure, I'm positive it won't stay in the IMDb Top 250 for very long & I don't really think it deserves to be there now. This one really is down to personal tastes, bear in mind that it's a musical & that it's quite bloody & if it still appeals to you then your more than likely going to enjoy it."

","I knew nothing of the Stephen Sondhiem musical 'Sweeney Todd' other than that it existed and so I was able to go and see this film adaptation without any preconceived ideas of how it should sound. Like most people, I suspect, I was going to see it because it is another Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration and those are always worth watching. I expected to enjoy the film. What I didn't expect was to be so utterly blown away with it. I wanted to right back into the cinema and watch it again as soon as it had finished.<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie excels themselves - Helena Bohnam Carter as Mrs Lovett, while utterly insane, is actually really quite lovely. Her unrequited love for Sweeney Todd is heartbreaking and her song 'By The Sea' where she imagines that she and the man who is helping her make pies out of people can live a happy and normal life is both hilarious (I defy anyone to watch Johnny Depp throughout this song and not laugh out loud) and deeply touching. It doesn't take a genius to work out that this happy ending will quite simply never be. The rest of the supporting cast is fantastic too.<br/><br/>Really, though, this film belongs to Johnny Depp. His Sweeney Todd is a deeply tortured soul, quiet, totally intent and focused on his goal to the exclusion of everything else. There isn't a scene where the pain and heartache of the past fifteen years is not etched across his pale face. Despite the fact that he is mad with his desire for revenge and you should want him to get his comeuppance, you want him to get to Judge Turpin, you want him to be free from the pain of his past. His singing, while by no means professional, is full of heart and is at times achingly beautiful - where he sings the tender song 'Johanna' about his lost daughter all the while slitting the throats of his unwitting victims is almost too much to bear - not because of the gallons of blood, but because here is a man so totally crippled by his hatred not only for the man who sent him away but the world in general. From his first appearance on screen, spitting bile, to the quiet acceptance of his fate at the end of the film, Depp is electrifying.<br/><br/>I know people who have been put off seeing this because it's a musical, but it doesn't take long for you to forget that and just be completely entranced by the performances. It would be no exaggeration to say this is now my favourite film and even after umpteen listens to the soundtrack, I have yet to tire of it. Absolutely sublime."

","Depp and Bonham Carter - a wonderful combination and the two best actors on the circuit. Any lessor actors would have spoiled the film.<br/><br/>The first reviewer mentions Depp sharpening the blade against the strop rather than with it as a goof. But anyone who has ever tried to get a really sharp edge on a blade will know that the last couple of stokes should be towards the edge. This is because the normal strokes leave a burr which can be removed by gently stroking towards the edge.<br/><br/>I'm sure an actor of Depp's skill will have researched his role by speaking to a barber who uses 'cut-throat' razors. Perhaps the film has that 'edge' of authenticity that is a little more subtle than fist appears."

","Before I went to see this movie, I was thinking how it would come out to be. A positive portray of some psychopath killer? Or a promotion of some bloody antihero and vengeance? It worried me because my church fellows would hate to see this one for such reasons.<br/><br/>But it came out to be very different. Yes, it's dark and make you scratch your head quite a lot. So many disturbing murderous scenes would simply make your kids cry all the way home,therefore don't take children to this movie, and don't see this movie yourself if you are mentally immature. That means, the movie is talking about paradox in revenge and danger of retaining hate ever after a tragedy, instead of promoting the idea of killing by a razor. On some level, it even looked like American History X to me. I'd like to give Tim Burton a big hand for his work of balance in the movie. Despite so twisted the characters are, so twisted the presentation and the lyrics are, it doesn't make you sick after all if you always focus on the songs.

","I have to confess from the outset to something of an on-off respect for Tim Burton. Whilst I loved the Nightmare before Christmas I was ambivalent about most of his other work and genuinely disliked The Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. I am no great fan of Depp's either. Nevertheless, I am a huge fan of the whole Sweeney Todd story and Stephen Sondhiem's masterpiece on stage had the potential, as raw material, to raise Mr Burton's stock in my eyes. But only if he got it right.<br/><br/>He did.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is essentially an opera, not even a musical. It features wall to wall singing with what is hardly a stellar cast of musical talent: Rickman, Bonham-Carter, Depp, Baren - Cohen (Hilarious as the Italian Barber) and Timothy Spall are not exactly renowned in the hit parade. Fear not though. There is barely a bum note to be heard. The great thing about Sondhiem's majestic score is that it's not so much the technical singing ability as the passion, insight and energy that makes his music and stunning lyrics come to life. Add to that sublime art direction and cinematography and you have yourself a bleak gorefest full of humour and pathos.<br/><br/>""There will be blood"" I assumed. There was.<br/><br/>Burton, for me, styles films as much as he directs them, but one cannot argue with the quality of performance he ekes out of his other half (Helena Bonham Carter). Mrs Lovett, the pie shop owner and Sweeney Todd fancier, is every bit as important a character as Sweeney himself and much of the film focuses on Bonham's adoration sadly, for her, reciprocated by an equal and opposite dismissal by Depp.<br/><br/>The comedy is glorious too and Timothy Spall makes a lovely, grisly sidekick (the Beadle) to Alan Rickman's gloriously camped up Judge Turpin. Sacha Baron- Cohen's cameo appearance as Senor Adolfo Pirelli is laugh out loud.<br/><br/>If you think you dislike opera make one exception in your life and see Sweeney Todd. As my 13 year old son would say It's a beast."

","Revenge is a powerful emotion, and is a popular narrative tool for movies and books (e.g. ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Taxi Driver"" to name a few). ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street""  directed by Tim Burton and based on the 1979 Steven Sondheim horror/comedy musical  uses the theme of revenge as it tells the story of 18th Century London barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp). Sent away on a false crime by Judge Turpin (an understated Alan Rickman), who wanted his wife Johanna (Jayne Wisener), he comes back fifteen years later with his young assistant Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower). Once he gets back, he teams up with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who makes the worst pies in London. Driven by for revenge, he adopts a new identity  Sweeney Todd  and sets up his barber business upstairs, with the help of Tobias Ragg (Edward Sanders), after taking out Italian rival Pirelli (a delightfully over-the-top Sacha Baron Cohen). In an enterprising piece of cross-promotion, Mrs. Lovett starts making her pies out of the remains out his Todd's victims, whose throats he slits with his razors, only stopping when he gets the Judge. Meanwhile, Anthony has fallen for Tood's daughter Johanna, and is determined to free her from Judge Turpin, who is holding her captive. The most striking thing about Todd is his obsessive need for revenge, which consumes him to the point where the only meaningful relationship he can have is with his razors (which he serenades in ""My Friends""). The only time he pays attention to Mrs. Lovett  who is in love with Todd and will do anything to have him - is when she agrees to help with his macabre plan. The most striking image of the movie is near the end, where Depp is almost covered in blood. While this movie is  as expected  very violent  the violence is over-the-top, similar to ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", and will only affect the weakest stomachs.<br/><br/>Considering the dark nature of the movie, it was a no-brainer that Tim Burton would direct. Burton re-imagines 18th Century London as a bleak, Gothic sewer, similar to ""Batman"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". Burton's regular collaborator Depp is superb as Todd. While his versatility is now well-known (thanks to his career-defining role as Captain Jack in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy), it's his singing voice which is the biggest surprise. Singing in a cockney accent, Depp handles the complex Sondheim songs, and manages to convey the desperation of Todd. While Todd isn't technically a bad guy, his actions are so abhorrent, and his purpose so single-minded, that he's hard to like. As befitting a musical, the characters move effortlessly between dialogue and song, with the highlights including ""No Place Like London"", ""My Friends"", ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixer"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Epiphany"" and ""A Little Priest"". In short, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a brilliant movie, managing the tricky balance between soaring musical and macabre violence, without making it too gory or too melodramatic. He is helped by a quality cast and some great songs which convey the desperation of the period."

","This film is about a barber seeking revenge against a judge who destroyed his family and snatched his daughter away.<br/><br/>Unlike the recent Tim Burton films, ""Sweeny Todd"" is not as visually dazzling as it does not feature the whole spectrum of colours. That's not to say the visuals are not good, in fact the gory scenes are brutally scary that makes me squirm. It makes up by having lots of melodic songs and expertly written lyrics. The plot is tight and gripping, and I am immersed in the story throughout. The ending is a little surprising, and it certainly is not a Hollywood ending. I find the film engaging and powerful, and it makes me scared to know such a psychopathic person could exist."

","I quite enjoyed seeing the movie last night, being a devoted Sweeney, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen and last but not least Tim Burton fan.<br/><br/>The filming, set, costumes and acting were all brilliant and it was a pleasurable experience for me. EXCEPT for one thing. I'm sorry, but the two main actors were NOT equipped to sing their roles. They simply do not have the voices for it. So all my favorite songs went completely flat and sounded positively high school musical. WAY to Disney for me! These roles need meat on the bones, darkness of sound, a range of colours in the voice, resonance! (and then you could easily hear all the auto tuning going on.. dreadful) <br/><br/>Why on earth didn't they get proper singers to sing for the two main characters? Do everyone HAVE to sing themselves in films just because it was done in Walk the line (a lot better I must say)? Others were better, I was not overly fond of Jane Wisener's vibrato (dreadful, but easily fixed by a proper voice teacher) but I thought Ed Sanders Toby was wonderful, Sacha murdered the role of Pirelli (no pun intended), Timothy Spall did well and should have been allowed to sing more of his role (cut a lot), and Alan Rickman was as gorgeous as ever. He can sing! Jamie Campbell Bower was also a lovely, lovely Anthony.<br/><br/>Conclusion: one star off for each of JD and HBC vocal performances. The rest a full house!"
"Baldrick44","10","0","1","2 February 2008"," The best musical adaptation going around
","Musical theatre films has been in vogue in the last few years but the thing about most of them is that they are really just a stage show with film cameras and haven't really allowed the capabilities of film to flex it's muscles. Not so with Sweeney Todd; a wonderful marriage between Stephen Sondheim's dark neo-baroque musical score and Tim Burton's visual nous.<br/><br/>The thing that grabs you straight away as soon as the film starts is the atmosphere. It doesn't so much introduce itself as grab you by the shirt and immerse you in a dark, grimy Victorian London. Not to give too much away, Sweeney Todd ( Johnny Depp ) has returned after being sent to a penal colony for a crime he was set-up for by Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ), in order to obtain Todd's wife. Todd burns for revenge and with the help of Mrs Lovett ( Helena Bonham Carter ), he begins to plot his way towards the evil judge and his henchman, the Beadle ( Timothy Spall ).<br/><br/>All very well, but we are talking about a cast that has never sang in film before- a big ask then to take on one of the most harmoniously complex scores in musical theatre. But actually, they do very well. Depp sounds somewhat like an early David Bowie and his performance as Todd is great to watch as he goes from rage to catatonia and everywhere in between. Bonham Carter makes the role of Mrs Lovett hers and doesn't overplay the humour, just allowing the audience to pick up on it without labouring.<br/><br/>As for the two villains, Rickman and Spall seem to be having the time of their lives as the repulsive Turpin and Bamford respectively. Rickman's voice is naturally lended to singing bass ( his duet with Depp in 'Pretty Women' is a highlight ) and he does a wonderful job conveying the judge's lechery while Spall is so oily it's almost visible on the screen.<br/><br/>The real surprise is Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, who steals the scene in the shaving contest with some great singing and acting.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd does not have the musical talent of the show, but it does have better acting talent and atmosphere. And in a musical like this, that's no bad thing."

","Grim. Gorgeous. Hooray! Welcome back sexy, brooding Johnny Depp. Pirate lovers go stick ya Jack Sparrow where mainstream audience appetites don't shine! Needless to say Johnny Depp's performance as Sweeny Todd is a coup. He manages to maintain an aura of absolute evil right alongside a dark eyed, soulful, tortured facial expression that keeps the audiences heart strings well and truly strung on his side of the story. This is a film that deals in heroes who are villains- in the most iconic sense of the word. Mrs Lovett is also glorious. Wild haired, dark-eyed and soulful too if a little more on the practical side where mortality is concerned. Mrs Lovett will have you eager for Sweeny's first kill with all her motherly clucking about the need for patience which delays the gratification for all concerned. She will have you roaring with laughter as you voyeuristically consider the culinary possibilities of a crowd people of various professional flavours. In short, Mrs Lovett may have you begging the question of yourself rather than Mr Todd: 'have you gone barking mad?' And somehow it is her love story that seems the most truly tragic of them all.<br/><br/>It is particularly satisfying that 'Sweeny Todd' does not try to encompass a period London setting of any scale or authentic grandeur. Neither does it elevate SFX beyond the demands of it's content. The rendered cityscapes establish a foreboding atmosphere and position the film in between the generic arenas of musical, horror, fairytale and myth. The colour palate of the film, black though charcoal and lighter grey with splashes of scarlet throughout, is reminiscent of shades used in Sin City. The effect is a similarly successful one of bringing to life ghoulish violence and inner pain in a stylishly graphic way. The realistic and unrealistic forms used in the film compliment each other and together bring to life a world where the natural and unnatural are inherently linked. The camera sticks close to its subjects. Big close ups create emotional intensity and as opposed to engendering a sense of claustrophobia they tantalise the viewer with a sense of forbidden intimacy. The instance where the lens gets a small spray of blood serves to highlight the moral dilemma in which the viewer has been put.<br/><br/>Of course, if singing ain't ever gonna be your thing then maybe this film just ain't gonna be your thing either. I can only tell you that I think the singing is good. Heart achingly so. The minor keys predominate, of course with plenty of accidentals and disharmonies to boot. Certainly it is not an easy score to sing and it is sung well. In particular the young boy impresses in this area and without even being nauseatingly talented in any sort of 'I'm a young child that has just got my break in a musical' kind of way. What's left? Ah, Alan Rickman is clearly a God. The 'good guys'? pfffft He's pretty and she's striking, in the way that we expect Tim Burton to choose an unconventional looking female beauty. A stronger actress with a more authentic voice could have improved the role of Joanna that's true. But what are actually presented as the personification of beauty in the film are the blades themselves. Held up to watery moonlight, contrasted with the cracks of the grimy mirror, winning Sweeney the opportunity to exercise his talents in Fleet Street. The blades, quite rightly, are the stars of the show.<br/><br/>Well done to Tim Burton, who is after all our hero and whom we love this time around for stepping up and properly ignoring the brighter side to fairy tale conventions. We love to see him wallow in the darkness; it suits his talents so very well. 'Everyone deserves to die'. There isn't anything more final than the closure offered at the end of the tale of Sweeny Todd. Except that the legacy of this film for members of it's audience may well be the worryingly persistent compulsion to hum that haunting, melancholy refrain 'I will have veeeennnngeance' whilst going about their daily tasks: housework, paying the bills..cooking."

Anyway, love it, it's my new musical obsession. I like musicals with actors who sing rather than singers who act. I think it's more natural, easy to believe that the characters just couldn't contain their emotions and burst into song.

","In 1979 Stephen Sondheim brought his groundbreaking musical ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" to Broadway. It won a total of 8 Tony Awards and went on to become one of the most revered Sondheim musicals of all time. A much-loved televised version would air on cable in 1982 starring it's TONY Award-winning star, Angela Lansbury. And now, 28 years after it's Broadway debut, Sondheim's operatic tale of the demon barber has finally found it's way to the big-screen. Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" hit theaters a few days before Christmas and gave movie-goers a cinematic masterpiece for the holiday. Albeit, a bloody one. ""Sweeney Todd"" tells the story of Benjamin Barker, the wrongly imprisoned barber who returns to London to seek revenge on a corrupt Judge named Turpin who sent him away on a trumped-up charge in an attempt to gain Barker's wife and child. Changing his name to Sweeney Todd, the vengeful barber Barker pairs up with landlady Nellie Lovett as they try to lure the Judge to Todd's barber shop for one final shave. Along the way, Lovett and Todd concoct a scheme to turn Todd's unknowing customers into meat pies via Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, which is conveniently located beneath Todd's barber parlor. Sondheim's original stage production was over three hours long and contained some of the most difficult music any stage performer could ever want to sing. So, when word went out that Burton would cut the film's running time to under two hours and cast mostly non-singers in all the leading roles, many were understandably skeptical. As a fan of the 1982 televised version I approached this film adaptation reluctantly at first, only to emerge from the theater with not only a greater appreciation for the material but an even larger one for it's cast and crew. Tim Burton has created his best film since 1994's ""Ed Wood,"" making some really interesting and brave choices in translating one of the most difficult and unlikely musical theater pieces of all time to the silver screen. Burton, while trimming songs and cutting just a few has somehow managed to maintain the mostly sung libretto of Sondheim's stage masterpiece. Sondheim's brilliantly ironic and clever lyrics are preserved here along with one of the most beautifully orchestrated arrangements of his score to date. Jonathan Tunick, who orchestrated the original Broadway production orchestrates here as well, making the musical soundtrack alone a great reason to see this film. If bringing original Broadway crew members like Tunick (as well as original Broadway conductor, Paul Gemignani) into the film's production was a wise choice by director, Burton, the casting of movie-star and Burton regular Johnny Depp was an inspired one. Depp takes-on the role of the barber bent on revenge with a fearless passion. His Todd never forgives and never forgets, not even for a moment. He sets out to destroy the one who has brought rack and ruin to his life and anyone else for that matter who gets in his way. Depp's brooding Sweeney is relentless. He forgoes much of the humor Len Cariou and George Hearn found in their respective stage performances, leaving much of the film's humor to co-star Helena Bonham Carter. As Mrs. Lovett, Bonham Carter walks ghostly through the film, falling hopelessly in love with the vengeful Todd. The two make a great pairing in this younger casting of the two leads. (Angela Lansbury was 54 when she played Lovett on stage, Bonham Carter is 41. Depp, 44 is actually four years older then Cariou was when he played Todd in 1979.) Also on screen is the always resourceful Alan Rickman as the evil Judge Turpin, along with a slimy Timothy Spall as his henchman Beadle Bamford. Sacha Baron Cohen appears briefly as a competing barber for some humorous and bloody moments. And young newcomer Ed Sanders sings beautifully as Toby the workhouse boy turned Mrs. Lovett's tagalong. All these performers are shot strikingly by Warsaw-born cinematographer Dariusz Wolski against a background of sets created by Italian production designer Dante Ferretti. Ferretti and Wolski create an atmosphere that is gorgeously Gothic and as representative of 19th century London as any Dickens novel could ever hope to be. Of course the blood flows freely in Burton's filming of ""Todd,"" cleverly serving as an homage to the Hammer Horror movies of the 1960s. Burton frames his subjects mostly in close-up and with great care carefully crafting every frame in what is easily his most visually striking film to date. Of course the big question mark with this film has to do with the singing voices of it's leading players. Can they sing? Yes, and well, actually! Are they Broadway voices? No. Do they have to be? Not really. Yes, if you are looking for the prettiest translations of these Sondheim classics, you may fair better listening to the original Broadway CD. But if you want to see and hear an honest attempt by brave multi-talented actors translating Sondheim's most difficult work to screen, then treat yourself to this unique tale of regret and revenge. For it is told so interestingly and artistically through music, song and celluloid by one of the greatest assembling of talent brought together for a film in years.

As it turned out I was happy that I gave this a chance because it is a very good film, a strange mix of musical, horror and comedy, but it works.

"LoneWolfAndCub","10","0","1","31 January 2008"," Sweeney Todd: A dark, violent, funny masterpiece
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is the must-see movie of the year! Tim Burton's visual flare is present in every scene throughout the movie and so is his dark sense of humour. Johnny Depp is once again the main character and boy does he shine! Not only can Depp sing but he takes the role of Sweeney Todd and gives it everything he's got and the product is a dark, twisted creation that is quite frankly the best thing Depp has done. Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett and (again), not only can she sing but she also takes her role and gives it her everything and we get a sad, lonely, funny but still twisted character. These two actors are the future of Hollywood, they are willing to take risks (like singing with no previous experience) and make a movie that's unlike anything you have seen.<br/><br/>Primarily this movie is a musical, about 85% of the movie is singing. But it's also a horror with Dario Argento levels of gore. Blood sprays like a fountain when throats are slit and heads explode when they fall through the chute. If you are a fan of both genres, as I am, then you will be in heaven, as I was. The Gothic feel of the film (much like Burton's other stuff) really suits this film, everything is a dull colour and London is a dirty, dreary place. However, the blood is a bright red colour (kinda like paint) and it provides a beautiful contrast which really adds to the film. The songs are all done extremely well by the actors and tell the tragic tale of Sweeney Todd. And all the supporting actors are perfect: Alan Rickman (Judge Turpin), Timothy Spall (Beadle Bamford) and Sasha Baren Cohen (Pirelli).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this unique, gory, funny and deep musical/horror. It's a visual treat and every actor can sing and act amazingly well.<br/><br/>5/5"

","This movie was great, I actually saw it in theatres, ordinarily I absolutely hate musicals, especially in movies since once it turns into a musical it's extremely misleading to the tone of the movie. I think that works for Sweeney Todd since whenever they start singing, it's in a horribly ironic way, i.e. we're going to kill everyone, the duet in ""joanna"" where the sailor is singing for heroics and depp's singing is directed towards revenge. The ending to the movie was very straightforward i felt, it showed exactly how blinded by rage Sweeney Todd was, his wife and daughter were quite literally in front of him the whole time and he didn't notice i.e. he didn't bother to look for them. Overall, i thought that this movie was an incredible interpretation of the play, though it's not for kids, too much blood."

","Sweeney Todd is a fantastic movie full to the brim of superb characters, beautiful music and Gothic charm. Director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride) is a master of Gothic cinematography and misunderstood outcasts and is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today. He has managed to become a mainstream artist without compromising his personal visions. This film is no exception to this.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd, played by Burton regular Johnny Depp, is wrongly imprisoned by a corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) and returns from prison years later to find his wife and daughter and seek bloody revenge with the help of pie maker, Mrs. Lovett, played by Helena Bonham Carter. The plot may seem simplistic but runs deeper than what is seen on the surface and is truly enthralling from the opening scene to the gripping conclusion.<br/><br/>Performances in Sweeney Todd are undoubtedly flawless. Any preconceptions of Johnny Depp as a certain Pirate are immediately washed away as soon as he takes his first victim, which is suitably gory and fuelled by blood-lust. Depp has been refused Oscars on numerous occasions but his performance here is truly Oscar-worthy. And Helena Bonham Carter is equally brilliant as the devious and darkly comical Mrs. Lovett; why she hasn't been even nominated at this year's Oscars is unfathomable. The supporting cast also shines with talent, from the evil glint in Alan Rickman's eyes to the impressive turn from newcomers Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower and Sacha Baron Cohen's cameo as Todd's Italian rival.<br/><br/>Stephen Sondheim's music is hypnotic and fresh, suitably toned down for the big screen (don't go expecting any Hairspray-style campness here). My only criticism would be that the soundtrack may have been toned down a little too much. About 70-80% of the movie is song, transitioned subtly between dialogue. Burton's cinematography must also be commended for bringing a gloomy and Gothic 1850's London to life while retaining a certain level of dark humour throughout.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and would recommend this to anyone (over the age of 18, considering its appropriate rating). Overflowing with beautiful imagery and Gothic stylisation, Oscar-worthy performances and enchanting music, this is cinema at its best."

Depp's Todd is flawless,but I found myself more impressed with the performances of Bonham Carter(mentioned earlier),Alan Rickman(as the cruel and overbearing Judge Turpin),SAsha BAron Cohen(as the rival barber Pirelli)and Ed Sanders as the boy Toby,whose duet with Mrs.Lovett on ""Not While I'm Around"" is one of the best movie song sequences I've seen in a while!<br/><br/>Director Tim Burton's dark,sinister treatment of Stephen Sondheim's book and music seems like a good fit,and for the most part it does go together evenly. While I feel like this story and the music are better suited for the stage,I credit Burton and company with being able to make it easily workable on the big screen.<br/><br/>My rating might improve on ""Sweeney"" with another viewing or two. While I cannot ply the title ""Best movie of '07"" on this(nor do I feel any sense that the wrong call was made when it didn't get a Best pic/director nod by the academy recently),I certainly was impressed with the general construct and execution of the grizzly legend of tall tale and stage."

","Musicals are stupid. Or at least I think they are, they're terribly popular so they must be doing something right. It's just that there's nothing more jarring than when you're starting to get absorbed in a story and suddenly the leads burst into a cringe-inducing song and dance routine. Turns out I might just be watching the wrong musicals though, because ""Sweeney Todd"" is brilliant. Everything's shot through with Burton's flair for the Gothic, with London looking like a charcoal pop-up book full of jagged buildings and sneering bitter characters, the perfect setting for Depp's twisted barber to exact his revenge.<br/><br/>It looks stunning, and rather than pulling you out of the story the songs actually service it brilliantly, adding a real emotional immediacy to proceedings. Depp throws himself into these numbers with gusto, while Helena Bonham Carter manages herself pretty well too and looks gorgeous to boot. There are a couple of less effective songs that could have been trimmed, but there's not much to gripe about here really. I'm not a full convert to the musical cause(I shan't be roaring along to Hairspray anytime soon) but this has shown not all musicals are stupid after all."

","For all of Tim Burton's reputation Sweeney Todd would seem to be a given that he would be brilliant at doing and there is no doubt that Burton easily made this his own. Everything about Sweeney Todd is just brilliantly put together from the outstanding cast who aren't your typical stage singers, to the dark and gritty London, to the gruesome and completely gratuitous murders that Sweeney Todd hinges on. Its visually stunning, beautiful haunting music and a story that locks you into every moment. Burton holds nothing back from his dark side as he creates the ultimate in dark musicals. I admit I am a big musical fan but I think that's only because the ones I have seen, especially in 2007 and now this one, have been truly great. Sweeney Todd is unlike any other musical you will ever see. You can't really 'pick' a favorite song because the entire film nearly is sang...they run together and tell a story and yet has this incredible musical score that sticks with you. Its jaw dropping and shocking and all set to music. It could be described as a horror, a drama, a thriller, and a musical all into one. I have never seen Sweeney Todd on stage but this has to be the next best thing because Burton has created a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp once again shows his incredible versatile talent as the emotionally deranged and wrongfully imprisoned Sweeney Todd who returns to London to exact revenge on those who wronged him. Depp is absolutely perfect and probably well deserving of an Oscar for this role. The thing is...he isn't a singer...as is the case with a lot of the cast but his performance is brilliant and no less astounding. He IS Sweeney Todd in every sense of the word and by no means he is a hero and yet you can't help but feel empathy and share his rage. Helena Bonham Carter is deliciously twisted and the eerie sidekick to Depp's Todd. Mrs. Lovett is just outright deranged and her and Depp have incredible chemistry and make an evil pairing right up there with Bonnie and Clyde. Her misplaced affections for Todd make for a twisted romance. Alan Rickman, as always, makes an incredible villain for Todd as the Judge who locked him away, killed his wife and took his daughter. Rickman hardly sings...in fact I thought he might be the only one who doesn't but he does eventually sing a song or two and he is the perfect addition to this cast. Timothy Spall also does an incredible job as Rickman's sleazy little sidekick. Jamie Campbell Bower is the pure balance to this deranged cast as the love sick sailor who wishes to save Johanna (Todd's daughter) from Rickman's grasp. He is good but doesn't stand out compared to the other performances. Honorable mention must be given to Ed Sanders in his premier performance as the young Toby who gives an earth moving performance and has this incredibly unique and strong singing voice. He is amazing and should have gotten a supporting actor nod for his small but significant role. Also a kudos to a cameo role by Sacha Baron Cohen as the conceited Barber on the road show. One of the best scenes in the film that you must see is the 'shave-off' between Depp's Sweeney Todd and Cohen's Signor Adolfo Pirelli.<br/><br/>The gratuitous death scenes and blood spurting doesn't begin right away. In fact Burton and Depp do an incredible job at giving Todd this character arc that has him struggling with vengeance and sanity and dealing with Mrs. Lovett and her strange infatuation. You could watch Sweeney Todd again and again to see the incredible world that Burton creates. Whether its realistic or whether its the dirty, disgusting underbelly that Todd creates in his mind...its truly stunning on the big screen. Even if you're not a fan of musicals you can hardly take your eyes off Depp, and Carter, and Rickman and all the rest of the cast and everything going on. When the blood starts to flow there is no holds barred in some of the most disturbing and gruesome kills I have ever seen. And yet all this is done with some sort of grain of dark comedy which I believe only Burton could pull off. Slitting throats, dropping them violently onto the cement floor and clean up for the next one could only seem somehow darkly entertaining in a Tim Burton film. Regardless you must see this amazing film. 9/10"

","Depp and Burton are always a perfect match. I rarely enjoy a musical film to say it is one of my favorite films and I can't think of a musical that Burton would have done better. This film really was better than my expectations. Visually, the film is fantastic and a couple of times found myself thinking ""How amazing was that last shot?"". I'm thinking particularly of a great shot that shoots up through the streets of London at the beginning of the film. Reminded me of Baz Luhman's Moulin Rogue and the shot through Paris, which funnily enough is the only other musical I would recommend. I found the singing sensational. All the singing was done amazingly well and fitted the scenes perfectly. I think that probably the humor is lost for some, I found it all entertaining though, even the gory throat slitting segments I found amusing with the musical element to it. I loved the story of the film, I understand the play is slightly different, which is perfectly understandable. I will be going to see this on stage at the first opportunity. I feel only Burton could have done this film as properly as this. His style fits the story perfectly."

"ramzaw","10","0","1","29 January 2008"," Tim Burton Does it Again
","Tim Burton, the famous director of such hit movies as The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood, has once again shown his demonic directing expertise in the expertly crafted film, Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Was the movie flawless? No. But it was one of the best movies I'd seen that was released in 2007.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the criminally insane, falsely accused Benjamin Barker, who was once a well respected barber of Fleet Street. Returning home after a fifteen year imprisonment, he discovers that his wife has gone, and his daughter (who only saw her true father when she was but a baby) has been adopted by the very man who falsely accused and imprisoned Barker: Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Swearing that he will get his revenge, Depp teams up with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the long forgotten meat pie chef, changes his name to Sweeny Todd, re-starts his barber shop, and gets ready to give people the ""Closest shave of their lives."" Seeing as this film was a musical, I believe that the first item that should be on our agenda is the musical aspect of the film. Right when the movie started, I could tell that it was a Tim Burton film  the opening song was so dark, and, in a sense, attractively strange, it fit the role of a song in one of Burton's film's perfectly  like a glove, one may say. Once the credits ended, it broke into the very first song of the film, in which Depp starts singing in almost immediately. I have to say, his first song left me a little worried about the rest of his singing in the film  but throughout the movie, his singing actually improved. While Depp did most of the singing, alongside Carter, hearing Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) sing was quite a pleasure. What I have noticed in most musical films is that the main actors will mouth the words they are ""singing,"" and someone will sing for them. One of the things I loved about Sweeny was that everyone sang for themselves, and that is a main reason to see the film. You'll actually be able to hear Depp, Rickman, and many others sing in their own voices, and the audacity of this fact should be able to drag anyone into the theater. They may not be the most talented singers in the world, but their singing voices fit in perfectly with their characters.<br/><br/>The only problems that I saw with the film, besides it being a little slow at the start, were the continuity errors  there were just a couple, but at least one was blaringly obvious, if you are paying close enough attention.<br/><br/>And so, I hereby give my first ten-star rating to this excellent piece of work, and say just one more thing: if you want to see an excellent movie with high-rating actors, buckets of blood, and fantastic music  or, you just want to see a movie because you are bored  see this movie, and I guarantee that you will be pleased in the end."

","'Sweeney Todd', could be best described as part slasher flick, part morality play. It has more substance to it than most slasher flicks where the gore is added as a sensationalist attraction for the morbidly curious. The overtly gory component incorporated in Sweeney Todd had me questioning 'why do people kill one another?' and 'why must we have war?' It is a difficult task to remain commercially viable and to include all the various elements that Mr. Burton has presented for us in this film and so he deserves congratulation. Particularly, for the fact that the gore in the film causes the audience to re evaluate their own response to it, because it is not presented as an attractive satisfaction for the ghoulish nature of the human psyche, but instead serves to raise moral questions from its repellent nature. This is its value as an element in the narrative and gives this film a value that most 'slasher' films do not have. I didn't know it was a musical until the singing began and it reminded me of those films of the 60's and 70's that were almost put to death by 'Grease' and 'Xanadu'. 'Sweeney Todd' maintains the tradition of films like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'My Fair Lady' and 'The Sound of Music', but with bulk darkness and a slight amount of gratuitous gore added. I thought Johnny Depp's singing was good in this movie, in fact I thought he had a voice that could easily rock out if he was put amongst it with some hard rocking band. He's apparently stated that he can't sing very well, (probably just worried that people will decide to hate him out of envy if he adds singer to his repertoire of skills). Obviously, Johnny can make any film a classic since he is easily one of the most popular male actors of his generation, but that's not the only reason 'Sweeney Todd' amuses and terrifies. Helena Bonham-Carter's looks and ethereal, other-worldly quality make her perfect for a tale of this ilk, positioned as it is in Tim Burton's macabre vision of Old London Town. For me, it was obvious that he has made a list of images that he wanted to incorporate in this project and he has done it with artistry and panache and he dramatically uses the big screen like the most skillful painters, (before photography), used the canvas. Well done, though not exactly a film for the young kiddies (or vegetarians)."

","Wow! This movie is amazing!With any musical that is transferred to the movie screen (and remember..it IS a musical!)I always enter the cinema with a sense of trepidation,however, this is a movie that blows you away! From the moment the movie starts you know you're in for a trip that transports you back to the grisly streets of London at the turn of the 19th century. Tim Burton has transformed a story of legend in to a breathtaking masterpiece that is a feast for the eye and the ear ( thanks to Stephen Sondheim). Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter give performances that surely must win awards! Along with a supporting cast of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen ( who are all excellent )this is a must for any Burton/Depp fan. To summarise it's like marmite...you'll either love it or hate it! I just happen to love marmite!"
"come2whereimfrom","8","0","1","29 January 2008"," Bloody good fun if you can stomach the singing!
","Tim Burton has had hits 'Mars Attacks', 'Big Fish' etc and misses mainly 'Planet of the Apes' but whatever you think of him you can not disagree that he is nothing if not challenging and is in everything he does a visionary. Sweeney Todd, based on Steven Sondheim's hit Broadway musical, is no exception its big, its bold, brilliant and dark its everything you have come to expect from a director like Burton but unfortunately what's with all the bloody (sic) singing. I hate musicals so it is with trepidation I watch this film but I love Burton and Depp so will that be enough to sway me? Well yes and no, to start with the singing which follows a typically inventive opening credit sequence does feel odd especially as Depp seems to be a Cockney David Bowie/Dick Van Dyke hybrid a camped up rocky horror scissorhands armed only with cutthroat razors and a Gothic sensibility. As the film progresses you kind of get used to the fact that the cast are singing everything and I even started to enjoy it a little, there is a great centre piece with Sweeney imagining himself stalking the streets plying his trade and there is also a very funny song in the pie shop as along with Mrs.Lovett (Bonham Carter) they discuss the fiendish fillings. But some of the songs did get on my nerves a bit and the ones the children sing are just plain annoying, the brief appearance of Sacha Baron Cohen seems a tad unnecessary and Alan Rickman is criminally underused. That said the sets are marvellous, the tracking shots around the city's grimy streets are great and the costumes really help to add to the overall feel. The transition from stage to screen has been handled effortlessly and because of the FX department the blood level have been hiked right up to maximum hence the 18 certificate. Quite simply Burton has dumb founded his audience again pitting musical lovers against the gore and gore freaks against the songs causing people to put up with the elements they don't like, the old ladies I've spoken to love Johnny and a sing song but the graphic throat slitting was a bloody bridge too far for most. Overall it is genius and adds to an already amazing but truly eclectic body of work. Fight your fears of the film and go see a master create spectacle like no one else, the question is what will he do next?"
"justinconboy","7","0","3","29 January 2008"," Brilliant Movie, but songs just not good enough, unlike Oliver Twist
","I loved the visual aspect of this movie. I thought the casting and acting was perfect. This is truly a perfect movie but only deserves 7 out of 10 because the songs are just not good enough. If we look at all the really big musical movies, Oliver Twist, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and so on and so on, there are always one or two songs that you'd remember from those films. With Sweeney Todd, there is no memorable song at all, not even a melody to hum on your way home. There is also only one scene where the actual musical moves out of the reality of the situation; what I mean by this is that the character Sweeney Todd actually sings in the street with the street patrons not taking any notice of him, a scene of disbelief within disbelief. This is a trait which has worked in many a musical movie and which actually doesn't work here at all as it's a lone scene of this type of singing on the street. This, you'll notice, happens a lot in Oliver Twist and with 60 years between these movies, Oliver Twist is a far more superior movie than ""Sweeney Todd""."
"triumph_of_the_bugle","10","0","1","29 January 2008"," Stunning...
","As a big fan of Tim Burton, I came to see this movie expecting all of his 'trademarks'- rebellious main characters with crazy black hair, panning opening credits, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter & a unique Gothic style. But I got so much more. The music was great- I was not a big fan of Sondheim before seeing the film but am starting to like him more and more.<br/><br/>Depp put in a great performance well worth his Academy Award nomination- but I was shocked that Helena Bonham Carter didn't get nominated for an Oscar (she did get a Golden Globe nomination) because I thought she was absolutely amazing- however I was told my a friend that her performance was quite different from how the character is played in the show.<br/><br/>The story follows Benjamin Barker (Depp) , who is sent to Australia for 15 years for a crime he didn't commit- and then returns as Sweeney Todd, taking vengeance on the judge (Alan Rickman) who purposely exported him. He starts a sort of relationship with Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter, beautiful as always)- who owns a pie shop below his old barber shop and recognises him from 15 years ago. Sweeney goes a bit mad and decides that everyone in the world deserves to die. He and Mrs. Lovett create a plan to kill everyone who comes for a shave at his shop and then turn them into meat for he pies. At this point the film switches from a story of Sweeney's revenge on the judge to him and Mrs. Lovett killing everyone. Blood starts to spurt in an (sort of) hilarious scene which includes the violent slashing of customer's necks. Things get more complicated as Mrs. Lovett expresses her desire to marry Sweeney (in one of the best scenes of the film- the song ""By The Sea""). Eventually blood continues to pour until all the characters have died (except three).<br/><br/>Burton outdoes himself in on of his best films yet- and the cast is great, all with good voices for non-professionaly trained singers (Bonham Carter especially. A must for any Burton fan.<br/><br/>The blood is plentiful but as long as it's just blood it still has a slightly comedic affect.<br/><br/>The film can best be summed up as a cross between 'Moulin Rouge' and James Whale's 'Frankenstein'."

","Musicals have always inspired, awed and gave us a good sense of fun. Brace yourselves for an-unorthodox musical in Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton's latest fare is a testament to his unrelenting Gothic vision coupled with amazing visuals, contemporary music and great acting. Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker, bringing the role of a vengeful barber is stellar by all accounts. Helena Bonham Carter's Miss Lovett provides the necessary comic and cover for Sweeney Todd. The bleak, dark atmosphere of the movie is most refreshing setting the mood living up to it's tag line of Never forgive, Never forget! Supporting roles from Sasha Baron Cohen as an Englishman masquerading as a Spanish medicine man, Alan Rickman as a corrupt judge and Timothy Spall, in a role reminiscent of Albert Pierrepoint has been amazing. Overall it was great fun to watch. Highly recommended!"

","If there is a musical more suited to the magical Tim Burton than Sweeney Todd I will be very surprised. This really is a match made in heaven, high octaves and oceans of blood shaken into a delightful Burton cocktail. I am not familiar with he source material so do not know how faithful the movie is, but the movie had the feeling of a stage show with only a few sets used ah but what beautiful Gothic sets they are lending the movie a cartoonish Gothic feel). The songs are well staged with Johnny Depp in particular benefiting from no singing lessons delivery his lines instead with a sense of menace and madness. Depp as ever delivers a stunning performance helped as usual by Burton's camera loving him as it does his Mrs the again excellent Helena Bonham Carter, who for me gives her best performance since fight club. In the end the whole cast is marvellous with great performances given from Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall ( as Judge Turpin and his slimy assistant Beedle Bamford) and a great cameo from Sacha Baron Coen as a rival barber. The basic premise of the movie is that Sweeney Todd returns to London from unnamed location where he has been wrongfully imprisoned seeking vengeance on the man who wrongfully imprisoned him Judge Turpin. The movie is stunningly shot with some real gore so if you do not like the sight of blood then steer clear. However if you can stomach the blood then there is so much to enjoy here. Dive in to a magical fairy tale and enjoy one of Burton's finest movies."

","""I will have vengeance, I will have salvation!""<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of musicals and felt that a person getting up and singing in the middle of a film was stupid and tedious. However, this is an exception <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd is a bloody and gruesome story of a barber called Benjamin Parkerwho once lived a happy life with a beautiful wife and child. The judge then takes an interest in his wife and then wrongly convicts Parker to take his wife and daughter for himself. Parker is then sent adrift from London and returns years later seeking vengeance.<br/><br/>To seek revenge he starts his barber shop back up by partnering with Mrs Lovett and her pie shop in the gloomy streets of London. Todd kills the people and Lovett makes the human pies!. He hopes that the judge and his accomplice will come for a shave!<br/><br/>This is a very intriguing film that has awesome visuals and cinematography. Tim Burton has produced a visually fantastic film. The make-up is fantastic and retains the gritty feeling of the film fantastically. The ghostly white tint on every character's face is perfectly done.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter produce an exceptional partnership on screen through both of them pulling off beautiful performances.<br/><br/>The reason for the films 18 rating is because of the blood produced when Todd slits the peoples throats, the blood squirting is almost like the blood in kill bill in the sense that it stylised and somewhat unrealistic. It may be argued thats it inappropriate in kill bill but its very appropriate in this film because the film itself is set in an unrealistic and dramatised world of London. The extravagant blood squirting also makes the film more dramatic, especially when Todd finally kills the judge in a bloody frenzy.<br/><br/>The film also has glimpses of comedy. My personal favourite comical moment in the film was when the 'by the sea' song was sung by Mrs lovett , when she is reminiscing about them relaxing on the beach, there is an hilarious shot of Todd in a black and white swimsuit sitting on a towel looking emotionless and bored. A great gag about how annoying woman ranting can be! <br/><br/>The film features a library of very catchy and epic songs that i mostly (surprisingly) loved. My favourite song and scene of the film was when Todd sang 'Epiphany', i thought it was a very powerful representation of Todd's frustration and desire for revenge. On top of the that, the song was very catchy and the lyrics were awesome. I also loved the sequence where Todd and the judge sing 'pretty women', the whistling was eerie and slightly sadistic.<br/><br/>------------SPOILERS----------- <br/><br/>The ending of the film in which the beggar is found to be Sweeney's wife was genius in my opinion. The final scene was very well done although, i think that the child slitting Todd's throat could have been more dramatic, but thats my only criticism. The final shot was awesome and left me blown away at the only musical i would ever love.<br/><br/>So why have i not given it a 10? Well although this is a film i loved, it is a musical and i cant bring myself to give a musical with a simplistic story higher than 8.5.<br/><br/>Don't be scared off by the fact that its a musical, I HATE musicals but enjoyed this immensely 8.5/10"

","I went to see Sweeny Todd not knowing too much of what to expect from it. I didn't really know to much about the story of Sweeny Todd either as i have not seen the book published in Australia. I love Tim Burton's work so i thought it would be interesting to actually see how he would go about directing a movie about a murder but in the form of a musical. It was a dark kinda movie like most of the ones he makes but it did have a comical kick to it which i think was a good idea. The gore side to things wasn't to bad, i thought it would be worse so i would say that was the only sightly disappointing thing about the movie but thats only because horror is my fav genre ha ha. Apart from that I love the outfits that were worn, the songs were great(especially the lyrics), the music was great and the acting was brilliant. The songs definitely get stuck in your head this is yet another job well done by Tim and if you are a fan of Tim's work i definitely suggest that you go see this movie and take a friend or too, its different but brilliant. <br/><br/>Best Part of one of my fav Sweeny songs is: ""There's a hole in the world like a great black pit and it's filled with people who are filled with s**t! And the vermin of the world inhabit it!""<br/><br/>awesome movie, a must see in my books :)"
"jboothmillard","9","0","1","27 January 2008"," Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
","From Golden Globe nominated director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow) comes another great Gothic masterpiece, and it is rare treat, a musical with a lot of blood (the opening credits alone is full of it), in fact, it was the first 18 certificate film I saw at the cinema. Basically set in Victorian England, London, Benjamin Barker (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Johnny Depp) reminisces the loss of his wife Lucy and daughter from the lust of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who ruined their lives. He raped Lucy, who apparently poisoned herself in despair, and had Barker deported to Australia, and the daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is now the Judge's ward. Years later, Barker has returned (illegally) with the new image and name, Sweeney Todd to seek revenge, with the help of young sailor Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower). Todd visits the pie shop of Mrs. (Nellie) Lovett (Golden Globe nominated Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's long time girlfriend), in the building where above he used to rent the room to do barber work, she tells him about the wife's death and the Judge's ward, his daughter. With his ""friends"", the hidden razors back, Todd decides to reopen his barbershop. On a stroll through market, Todd and Lovett stop to watch a possible rival barber (and hair tonic salesman), Signor Adolfo Pirelli (Borat's Sacha Baron Cohen), but Todd wins a shaving competition against him, judged by the Judge's sidekick, Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Pirelli comes to see Todd, and reveals that he used to work for him, and tries to blackmail him, but enraged Todd kills him, slicing his neck with his razor blade. Mrs. Lovett is of course shocked, but soon calms, and understands his reasons, but they have to dispose of the body, and they both have the fantastic scheme to use the body, as well as other customers that will follow to make meat pies. The Judge does visit for a shave, but Todd loses the opportunity to get his vengeance, so what follows is numerous neck slicing murders, and Beggar Woman (Laura Michelle Kelly) is the only person noticing the suspicious action in the upstairs room. A subplot story sees Anthony Hope falling for the Judge's ward, Todd's daughter, Johanna, and with the Judge telling him to keep away locks her away. It is obvious towards the end there won't be a happy ending, Todd does get to kill Bamford and his master the Judge, Johanna is caught hiding by Todd who tells her to stay put till he gets back (that's the last time you and he see her), the little boy helping at the pie shop, Toby (Ed Sanders) discovers the dark meat secret, with a finger in his pie, Todd kills the Beggar Woman, who he didn't realise is actually Lucy (!), he throws Mrs. Lovett in the fire as revenge, and as Todd weeps over his dead wife, Toby slices his neck with his own razor blade. Phew! Look out for a quick appearance by Anthony Head as a Man in the street. Depp is superbly sentimental and mental at the same time, same with Bonham Carter as the cannibalistic pie maker, and both are quite good at singing. There is a hell of a lot of blood, there are small humorous moments, and the songs are also very enjoyable, a true classic that I will never tire of. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design (why wasn't Burton nominated), it is nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up & Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"

","I'm not a big fan of musicals unless the music isn't typically that of a musical if you get me - for example The Blues Brothers, O Brother Where Art Thou and Chicago are amongst my favourites in the genre.<br/><br/>What do I not like about this movie - I felt that it was poorly paced, spent too long on certain plot points that could have been covered more efficiently and the character setup was a bit slow. The music I found wasn't particularly memorable and conflicted with the dark tone of the story and characters too much to pull me into the universe. I did notice that some themes were reprised at different points to make an emotional and musical mark, which is good musical practice, but a day after having seen it I can't recite a single bar from it.<br/><br/>What does it have going for it then? Well it looks fantastic, very grim and dirty. Performances from the leads - Bonham Carter, Depp, Spall, Rickman, Baron Cohen - were good and committed. It was also a good choice to have the actors do their own singing, to make it a bit more believable. The killing scenes were disturbing, which is a good thing as that is what you'd be looking for in this kind of deal, and sometimes they were dealt with a bit of black humour, also a good thing. I thought that the final frames, even though they were grisly, were beautiful and poignant.<br/><br/>All in all a mixed bag for newbies. If you like musicals, worth a watch. If you're already a fan of the musical, worth a watch. If you're not fussed on musicals, there's probably still something in it to make it worth going to see."

","This movie certainly doesn't smell as bad as Mrs Lovett's chimney! Unusual lyrics, gloomy sets and Helena Bonham Carter, is all you need for another triumph from Tim Burton. The movie wastes no time in jumping straight into the dark and depressing story of Sweeny Todd. Depp and Carter play their roles with a passion that allows the viewer to actually care about murderous baker and barber. The chemistry between them shines through the gloomy story line with room for some sadistic little chuckles on the way. They are obviously not the greatest of singers, but do a descent job of it, and are helped by other (well cast) characters with exceptional vocals. It ends rather abruptly, which leaves you hanging for a moment while you realise the credits are rolling and leaves you rather put of from meat pies for at least a couple of months!"

","It's going to take a brave person to kick against the waves of euphoria with which this has been greeted. I have no problem with sacred cows as a rule but in this case I didn't DISlike it enough to subject it to a hatchet job. I'm definitely not a fan of Burton's Gothic landscape and I can take or leave Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter but on this occasion all three combined to come up with something half decent. It's still a tad pat and unrealistic in the way it relies on coincidence to keep it flowing and although I've never actually witnessed a throat being cut I very much doubt if blood behaves in the way Burton portrays it here. The photography contrives to appear black and white which begs the question why bother to use colour stock in the first place, Sondheim's score has been curtailed but what remains is reasonably well performed but one is always aware that these are primarily actors who are singing rather than singing actors. It's going to be a smash anyway so good luck to it."

","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) <br/><br/>Top 10 - 2007<br/><br/>Top 50 Musicals - All Time <br/><br/>Rated R for graphic bloody violence <br/><br/>Tim Burton's adaptation of the bloody stage musical, based on the legend of a barber who slit his customers' throats is no disappointment. Stephen Sondheim's low key songs are wonderfully suited to the dark, gloomy and often tragic nature of the film.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one - Once upon a time there was a barber on Fleet Street, that had a beautiful wife and a newly born young daughter - life was good and simple for Benjamin Barker, until a corrupt and malevolent judge eyes his wife and makes it his intention to make her his. Judge Turpin falsely convincts Benjamin and he is sent into exile Down Under. Until he returns back many years later, a changed man, who has seen and lived evils , a gloomy man who is returning for revenge, for salvation. That man is Sweeney Todd. Slowly, Todd manages to set up his old barber shop, with the help of his old neighbour Mrs. Lovett, who makes the worse pies in London. The duo work together and plan on how to get back the Judge (and his unceremonious, ugly apprentice).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is Sweeney Todd and Johnny Depp also executes one of the year's best performances alongside Tim Burton's equally able wife, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Lovett, with such edge and raw power. Tim Burton's direction is artful and graphic, adding an element to the film's beautiful style. The art direction is also great. This is not the London we are shown in other cheerful musicals; this is the London of the alleyways, dark, depressing corners, a city ravaged by petty crooks and corrupt officials.<br/><br/>While not a great fan of musicals (although I do enjoy some of the classics), Sweeney Todd was a satisfying experience. A bloody, brilliant and ultimately tragic story displayed beautifully by one of cinema's most interesting (and often unnoticed) filmmakers. A very respectable achievement.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Too many songs? yes! and I hoped Sacha Baron would have a larger role (his big break will have to wait)...however it's hard overlook the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>This is an extremely good and well executed revenge story, with great singing and acting...(read more)g by Depp (truly Oscar worthy). The supporting cast was also really good. Though the songs were too many, some were good & essential to express what was going on in the characters' mind and the overall story. Burton was truly in his element with this dark themed drama, and used a terrific score to add to the movie's quality. He is a true artist, never failing to provide stunning imagery to add to the movie's mood.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the finest movies of 2007. Despite having 95% singing the film is quite engaging; leading us through the darkness towards the unpredictable finale."

","Long-awaited and presented as a musical gore-fest, this 'Sweeney Todd' is excellent and does full justice to the Sondheim musical. Who would have thought that Johnny Depp could sing and put across the songs (Epiphany, Pretty Women, Johanna, etc.), albeit in a slightly higher register than some previous Sweeneys and with more than a nod to the vocal style of Anthony Newley and other Broadway greats? Who could have imagined the English rose, Helena Bonham-Carter, as Mrs Lovett, maker of 'The Worst Pies in London'? <br/><br/>Johanna and Anthony, smaller characters,are soppy cyphers on the side but some other clever casting (Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, Timothy Spall as the Beadle, Alan Rickman as the Judge - his duet with Depp is a delight) makes this film extremely watchable. Yes, there's a lot of blood and the violence is graphic and realistic, more so than any stage production. Dark and brooding, this London is one of shadows, broken hearts, bitterness, and mystery.<br/><br/>I miss 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd' though - theatrical though that song is, it sets the tone and acts as a chorus throughout the drama, and if you know the stage play well, you instantly notice it has been cut. However, there are more than enough Sondheim songs remaining, done well, and fitting perfectly with the way the film has been shot. The opening credits are also well done and appropriate.<br/><br/>Maybe this is the first 18 rated musical, but it is a mix of genres which works well."

","First I would like to comment on what was done right in this movie. Tim Burton certainly knows how to create a ""dark"" film. ""Sweeny Todd"" reminds me of a cross between ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Johnny Depp sure gave a fantastic performance as Sweeny Todd. As a matter of fact, all the actors/actresses did a great job both in acting and their singing. The story was pretty solid as well. Like I said it reminds me of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" because Todd goes after revenge on all who had wronged him in the past. However, the way he takes his revenge is truly out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Not everything about this movie was great however. I had a problem with all the singing. Not that I don't like musicals, I'll be honest musicals aren't my favorites, but you couldn't really ""get into"" the songs. What I mean by that is take ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Phantom of the Opera"" for example. These are musicals where you can sing along and the songs really add so much to the story. Outside of the song about his arm being complete I really didn't feel that the songs had much of a purpose. I also didn't care for the ending, although I'm not going to give anything away.<br/><br/>Finally I wan't to close by disputing the 8.3 rating on IMDb. I highly disagree with this film being one of the 250th best films of all time. A raking of 6 or 7 makes since to me but 8.3 is far to high."

","Based on Stephen Sondheim's hit Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a classic revenge story ala Zorro or Count of Monte Cristo (DOM steals humble hunk's wife and child) but told in bloodthirsty gory, er, glory.<br/><br/>Wrongfully accused barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) goes back home to London with vendetta on his mind as Sweeney Todd, barber extraordinaire. Somehow, the townspeople don't seem to find his and fellow tenant Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter)'s ghoulish looks any stranger than her meat pies. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) is the insidious old geezer who steals Barker's wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and now has evil designs for his daughter! The rest of the supporting cast gave memorable performances. Sacha Baron Cohen adds a fun albeit short stint as Todd's competitor, Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Timothy Spall (who once more plays the villain's sidekick as in Enchanted) is the judge's disgustingly evil lackey Beadle Bamford. Ed Sanders as the poor orphan boy Toby is an incredibly bright and talented surprise. Jamie Campbell Bower as the lovestruck sailor Anthony Hope appears in the very first scene with Depp and even as the film unravels, his tenor voice and effeminate looks has the audience wrestling with his gender. He looks a lot like Claire Danes or Hanson's lead singer, especially when he does the trademark Danes facial expression of the furrowed forehead. Jayne Wisener plays the 15-year old Johanna, Barker's daughter all grown up. Despite her satisfactory acting chops, she is shockingly blond with an annoying soprano voice that it's hard to see her as the beauty she is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Even with Hollywood's latest character-role fave Johnny Depp as the star and one of my fave directors Tim Burton at the helm, musicals even in film form is still unsavory for me. But Burton succeeds in sneaking Sweeney Todd into your thoughts long after you've left the cinema. It's good to confirm that I have not been desensitized after seeing so much gore, and I'm even happier that violence was not glorified in this film despite gory images being the staple in each scene."

","Sweeney Todd has some marvelous scenes and great acting. It is highly entertaining in parts, particularly the first half. However, it seemed to go over the top with disgusting and unnecessary scenes. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was well suited to this role - he is always at the top of his game. His facial expressions, in particular, added great depth to the character. He was at his best in Helena Bonham Carter's romantic day dream of the beach and marriage. That said, the voice he used will take viewers back to Captain Jack in Pirates. Several expressions could have fit that character equally as well. Such are the minefields, I suppose, of doing movies back to back with British accents. <br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is that it's a musical. The lyrics and music create a seductively funny elixir. Depp, Carter and the rest of the crew were exceptionally entertaining. Sasha Baron Cohen was perfect for his role. In fact, the casting for this film was as good as it gets. <br/><br/>The one negative was the gore. I understand the nature of the film and the need for it. However, I think that it could have been pulled off with a bit less in parts. The second half of the film became a bit too disgusting. He dwelled a bit too long on the gore in some camera shots and I think would have accomplished his purpose equally as well without some of that. I understand, as well, that this is part of Burton's style. But, in terms of entertainment, the film could have been improved with a bit more subtlety an innuendo in parts. It is reminiscent of Fargo with it's dark humor; however, while Fargo had some gore, it was not unnecessarily ""in your face"" with it. That's not to be hypercritical of Burton's work here. But, he's done better without this. <br/><br/>Overall it has great entertainment value, but I know many will stay away from the film due to it's incessant over the top gore in the second half of the film. Midway through - I was thinking, my wife might actually enjoy this ... I may need to call some friends and tell them to go see it ... by the end of the film, I thought, ""there's no way."" Some will like it, as I did, but I know many who would not. It's a shame as they would enjoy very much the singing, the humor, the darkness, and the acting, but will be a bit turned off in the end."
"Polaris_DiB","7","0","3","9 January 2008"," Rules for watching ""Sweeney Todd""
","1) Whenever a throat is cut, yell ""HOORAY THE SPRAY! HOORAY!"" <br/><br/>2) Whenever Ms. Lovett says, ""Mr. T."", chorus, ""I PITY THE FOOL!"" <br/><br/>3) There is a wedding scene--bring rice.<br/><br/>4) Whenever a throat ISN'T cut, show your disappointment.<br/><br/>5) Reference to meat pies? ""Mmmm, meat pies! I'd like some meat pies, would you like some meat pies?"" Have good meat pie conversations with your neighbors (esp. if they haven't seen the film before). This can be especially fun during the song ""A Little Priest"".<br/><br/>6) Try to memorize the lyrics and sing along, but even without having seen it before, EVERYONE should chorus to, ""I'll steal you, Joanna!"" <br/><br/>7) Have fun and make up responses as you go along.<br/><br/>8) YES, it IS just as good/bad as Rocky Horror Picture Show, so let's get some activity going! --PolarisDiB"
"monkeygrl_2004","10","0","4","7 January 2008"," Harry Potter Characters.....
","Okay, why is it that no matter what movie with English actors in it you're going to see, you have at least two Harry Potter actors? We saw Richard Griffiths with Daniel Radcliffe in Equus. Love Actually sported Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. Driving Lessons featured Rupert Grint with Julie Walters. What is this? Some kind of Harry Potter uprising? THEY'RE TAKING OVER THE WORLD... Okay, I know that's a little extreme, but they are everywhere. You can't go to any movie without seeing some sign of a Harry Potter star anymore. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. I like Harry Potter and they're good actors. Maybe if we give them a chance, we'll see that it's a franchise that has made many a good stars and not just good looking faces like Lord of the Rings did. So, when you watch Sweeney Todd(haven't gone yet, but I am) have fun with the THREE Harry Potter actors, Helena Bonham Carter/Bellatrix Lestrange/Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman/Severus Snape/Judge Turpin, and Timothy Spall/Wormtail/Beadle Bamford. You have fun, I know I will!!!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission ... I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I think he is a film genius. Unlike many, however, I don't believe this is his best work. Still, it is incredibly creative and stylish. It's just missing something.<br/><br/>For a musical, the lead voices are mediocre at best. Rickman is barely passable. Young Ed Sanders who plays Toby had far and away the most impressive voice, while newcomer Jayne Wisener (Johanna) has such a high pitch that it made me wish for her parakeet to chirp instead. Depp and Bonham Carter are OK, but one expects stronger vocals for a Stephen Sondheim production.<br/><br/>Be prepared for an overdose of spurting blood, but there is enough comic distraction to offset. Sacha Baron Cohen has a funny bit as a con man/ competing barber and Timothy Spall is just so funny looking that you can't help but chuckle whenever his ugly mug hits the screen.<br/><br/>Still not sure what was missing here, but I felt it falls short of greatness despite the amazing visual feast of Bonham Carter's dream. Of course it goes without saying that the great Sondheim songs are pure brilliance. His talent is so unique when compared to most Broadway production numbers."
"tobamese","8","0","5","22 December 2007"," Sondheim and Love
","Sondheim's musical, with Angela Lansbury as the quirky Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn as the barber, Sweeney Todd, (also Len Cariou, on Broadway), is near and dear to my heart. I saw the show with Patti Lupone and George Hearn in concert and fell in love with the massive wonder of murder made hilarious. <br/><br/>Tim Burton also, is as near and dear to my heart as Sondheim, but, I was weary of his involvement with this project, especially since he was using vocally untrained actors for a very demanding musical. BUT I must say, I loved all the dramatic AND musical performances. Depp, Bonham Carter, Rickman, and Baron Cohen blew me away. I shared the feeling that ""Borat"" in Sweeney Todd was a bit of a stretch, but he made the role his. His big acting was perfect as the comic villain. I believe Sondheim oversaw the casting, which may have affected the brilliance of all their performances. <br/><br/>The reason this movie gets an 8 and not a 10 from me, a die-hard Burton AND Sondheim fan...are the nuances, of course. For those of you not familiar with the musical, it won't be an issue at all. I felt the parts cut were a great loss. ""Kiss Me"", ""Ah Miss"" were cut, and they are both ballads sung by Johanna and Antony. I felt they were denied a great deal of dimension by the elimination of their songs. I was VERY relieved that they did not cut, ""Green Finch, Linette Bird"". Also, parts were cut out that stole dimension from Sweeney himself, but I must say that Depp did an amazing job in portraying a troubled man :P. For the first time I was afraid of him. However, I found Sweeney much more ""emotionally approachable"" on stage than I did in the movie. I found myself disgusted with him, (understandable considering his 'profession'), but that didn't happen when I saw it on stage. I felt a great deal more sympathy for Sweeney off the big screen. There is LOTS of blood. Streams of it.<br/><br/>All in all, I am not too disappointed. But, I definitely prefer the stage version."
