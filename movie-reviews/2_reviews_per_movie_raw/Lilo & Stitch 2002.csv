"gogoschka-1","10","80","95","27 March 2019"," Disney's Most Underrated Animated Movie
","This is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm actually convinced it's Disney's most underrated animated movie. I guess the main reason I like this film so much is that it features the most sincere depiction of a relationship between siblings in any Disney film. For once, we get real, flawed (and therefore all the more lovable) people - not the usual perfect Disney princesses. But it's also incredibly funny and spectacularly entertaining throughout (not to mention that it has one of the most hilarious intros in any sci-fi film ever). I simply adore this movie, and I'm not ashamed to admit it makes me cry every time I watch it. This and Sanders' and DeBlois' other masterpiece, the first HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, are the cinematic medicine that get me through my darkest days.<br/><br/>The look of the film is very distinct and refreshingly different from Disney's previous animated features. And the visuals are gorgeous; the backgrounds are painted in beautifully faded watercolors, and the 2-D animation is an example of artists at the peak of their craft. Every scene is jock-full of original ideas and a virtual demonstration of Chris Sanders' and Dean DeBlois' seemingly limitless imagination (the film also features a ton of clever references to sci-fi and monster films). Simply one of the best animated films - and one of the funniest sci-fi comedies - of the last 20 years.<br/><br/>P.S. (for new IMDb users): In case you don't know whether to trust this review or not, because you have no idea what my tastes in film are, just click on my username - gogoschka-1 - and you'll see a list what my 50 favorite movies are."
"Theoron","10","136","173","21 June 2002"," Is this a Disney movie???
","Project ""Six-Two-Six"" is deemed too dangerous by the ""Grand Council.""  A hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David Ogden Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished to a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his days. On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then escapes using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan girl named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and takes him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the Grand Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture experiment Six-Two-Six.<br/><br/>And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a combination of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" and Saturday morning cartoons.  The dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's beloved ""Loony-Tunes."" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for one, didn't miss them.)<br/><br/>We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a ""dysfunctional"" household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life without her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can appreciate.<br/><br/>Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel they go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the ""talking dog,"" and decides to take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis), and to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.<br/><br/>
Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little monster, but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness in the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being ""nice"" to Lilo was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.<br/><br/>Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch as the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect. Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba, is trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien. At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry for the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance he's longing for.<br/><br/>I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc."").  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that comes from their computer animation partners.   ""Lilo & Stitch"" demonstrates that there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so famous many years ago. But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find yourself caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin d a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to keep social worker ""Mr. Bubbles"" (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a foster home.<br/><br/>There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as being entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft repeated phrase: ""Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind.""  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" but isn't something you often find in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, ""no one gets left behind,"" has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text book. It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value, and that there is no such thing an ""expendable"" person.    A better lesson for young children would be difficult to find.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10."
"Victor Field","Null","54","69","22 March 2003"," A very un-Disney-like Disney animation. And not in a bad way.
","""Lilo & Stitch"" is unusual for a Disney animated movie in that it actually seems to take place in the real world (not to mention the present day), despite the latter half of the title being a genetic creation from another galaxy. Devoid of almost everything that people come to expect when the name ""Walt Disney Pictures"" appears on screen - which is not to say we're in ""Golgo 13"" territory here - this, as did ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" suggests that though the box office takings may go down, the House of Mouse may yet pull another ""Beauty and the Beast"" on us one day.<br/><br/>The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death (offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons (see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot (Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.<br/><br/>The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo & Stitch"" often feels like a live action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip). Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic, but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no real ""bad guys"" per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing their jobs).<br/><br/>And if all else fails, take into consideration the fact that it's also often genuinely funny; the fact that it never condescends to its audience; the fact that you actually have real Hawaiians (the voices of Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee) as key Hawaiian characters; and the fact that the songs used here actually have a purpose (to add dimension to our heroes - Lilo is a major fan of Elvis and tries to reach Stitch through the King), something many live-action movies often forget. ""Lilo & Stitch"" would be something worth seeing even if it wasn't a Disney film; seeing that it is... moving forward was always one of Walt's credos. It's encouraging to see that they're actually capable of following his ethos without the help of Pixar.<br/><br/>One major flaw though: in spite of the presence of Elvis, Wynonna and Alan Silvestri, the British release version has well-known song-murderer Gareth Gates slaughtering ""Suspicious Minds"" over the end credits. Thank heaven someone invented the ""mute"" button."
"ednakrabapley","10","75","102","26 November 2004"," This is Disney at it's best. Honestly.
","""Lilo & Stitch"" tells the touching story of a lonely little Hawaiian girl, named Lilo, who meets and befriends Stitch, an escaped refugee alien who poses as a dog at the pound. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much when it first came out, not being to interested in it. Well, after seeing it at the theater, I can now say it is Disney's best film. Ever. It's better than classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" both of which I adore. Many will not feel the same way as I do but I thought ""Lilo & Stitch"" was one of Disney's most inventive and involving scripts with fleshed-out and well-written characters.<br/><br/>We are set in Hawaii, a tropical background that gives the movie a great feel. Setting it in Kansas, as originally planned, would not have had the same effect. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters. <br/><br/>However, it's the story that ""Lilo & Stitch"" tells, along with many other great elements, that makes this film so outstanding. Not only is the film very funny (in fact, it's hilarious!) with pure moments of comic genius that can appeal to older audiences as well as kids, it's one of the most touching films I have ever seen. The whole middle of the movie is one that gives us spectacular scenes in a row that move me to tears each time.<br/><br/>***SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH, TO AVOID MILD SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I don't wanna say too much, but Nani's fight for custody of Lilo, tossed in with Stitch's touching character arc and search for the one place he does belong, and Lilo's loneliness, and a broken family, and cherished and beloved friendship with Stitch make this movie a surprisingly heartwarming and touching feature. One of the film's strengths is that it can be, at times, so sad.<br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The direction is solid, as is the animation. The water, and backdrop of Hawaii is desirable. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney classics, and lovable. You can identify with these characters and feel for them, and yes, Stitch does qualify in that category. His battered emotions, as well as the also adorable Lilo, are part of what makes this film so moving. This is an original, funny, and extremely heartwarming film that I highly recommend to families.<br/><br/>""Lilo & Stitch"" was wonderful characters that I instantly fell in love with. More captivating than previous, sub-par Disney releases such as ""Hercules,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" or ""Tarzan,"" this movie makes me laugh, cry, and moves me immensely. While it didn't break any new ground or anything, it thankfully returned audiences back to Disney's roots in terms of quality.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","8","42","55","12 October 2006"," Gets Better And Better As The Film Goes On
","This was a pretty entertaining ""kids"" animated film. It was a little different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good role models. However, as the film progresses, all those characters (small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring ""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message. You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the beginning.<br/><br/>I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie these days with absolutely no profanity in it. (What a sad statement to have to make.)<br/><br/>In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly recommended."

","I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office. This is perhaps Disney's best animated film to date. It rivals anything by Pixar. Why? Very simple really and it's what Pixar keeps doing so well. They tell a good story filled with well developed characters. Not to mention the animation is excellent and the watercolor backgrounds beautiful. Watch it a second or third time just to look at these fantastic pieces of art! I hope Disney learns a lesson here (from DVD sales at least) that 2-D animation isn't dead if done right and Lilo & Stitch was done right. I purchased the DVD for my daughter, okay, for me too but she loves it and while only almost four, she gets the themes. (although it took her a while to understand Nani is Lilo's sister and not her mother). The special features are good. The Hawiian Children's Choir and Hula segments especially good. I liked the deleted scene feature and would like to see them added for a later release. Disney should have marketed this film better. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen. Personally, I don't care for Disney as a company but if they keep producing work like this, I'll keep coming back."
"Damfino1895","10","61","84","23 November 2004"," A surprisingly savvy movie
","I was disappointed with the comments of a previous reviewer called ebayanderson concerning this movie as I feel that he/she is not living in the real world. Lilo and Stitch is one of my favourite Disney movies as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well, she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc. and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your heart with out being sickly or distressing a la Bambi. 10 out of 10"
"soymilk","8","48","66","27 February 2004"," Disney Bites Back
","Yes, it's a sad fact that Disney, the family favourite for close to a century, have fallen into decline. All the same, it annoys me no end when people go on about how 'The Lion King' of 1994 was the last truly great film that the company produced, because, in their period of decline and lack of success, the House of Mouse still surprised us all by churning out one cracking exception - the sassy and heartwarming 'Lilo and Stitch'.<br/><br/>In the Stitch of the title (and face it, he may have shared his title logo with Lilo but Stitch has always been the undisputed star of this empire) it really feels like Disney have found that very likable and very different kind of hero to break them out of their rut. To begin with at least, he has none of the noble or high moral qualities that Disney usually attributes to its lead characters. And the circumstances in which he comes about are, for a family film, startling - the result of an illegal extra-terrestrial experiment to produce a creature that is both destructive and indestructible. When Stitch finds himself seized by the Intergalactic Council to be punished for his inbuilt wickedness, he escapes - it wouldn't be much of a movie if he didn't - and flees to planet Earth, with the alien authorities in hot pursuit. Though the film's anarchic spirit owes a fair bit more to 80s creature films like 'Gremlins' and 'Critters', I suppose you could look at it as a inversion on the plot of 'ET', in which, this time round, the humans are harmless and it's his fellow aliens who pose greater threat to Stitch.<br/><br/>Finding himself stranded on Hawaii, our little anti-hero has no choice but to disguise himself as a dog and take refuge with Lilo. Lilo being a lonely young orphan living with her older sister Nani, and who may be taken away in a matter of days if Nani doesn't prove herself to be a more responsible guardian. The merging of these two very troubling story lines shows a lot of tenaciousness on Disney's part and in the end they produce a film that is fun and funky enough for the younger audiences, but also heartwrenching enough to touch even the most cynical of adults. It's also helped by a good line secondary characters, the most successful of which are Jumba and Cobra Bubbles, because, like Stitch, they're unconventional in the roles they fulfil. Jumba is an evil genius with a heart. Bubbles is a social worker who, fittingly since he's voiced by Ving Rhames, looks like he walked straight out of 'Pulp Fiction'.<br/><br/>It ain't perfect though. Considering that Stitch is one of Disney's most engaging heroes, it really blows that Gantu should have to be one of the stuido's flatter villains. He isn't drawn very well and he isn't developed as a character much further than being ruthless and bad-tempered. There is also one pretty big plot-hole that older viewers may be troubled by - if that lady at the pound really thought that Stitch was dead, why did she put him in with the dogs? And wasn't she alarmed by his six legs and his antennae?<br/><br/>It may be flawed, but in the end it's the merits that triumph. And it's a good example of just how dazzling 2D animation can be when given the right attention to detail. Once you get past the pretty pale opening scenes in outer space and enter the world that Lilo inhabits, visually this is beautiful stuff, employing the technique of watercolour backgrounds for the first time in decades. And the soundtrack too is one of the most memorable in Disney's canon. I believe this is the first time they've based its score around the pre-existing songs of a familiar artist - in this case the immortal Elvis Presley. Needless to say, it's great music.<br/><br/>(Sadly, we also had to tolerate the likes of Gareth Gates and A Teens doing sugary covers over the end credits, but at this stage you can always switch off or leave the cinema.)<br/><br/>Too bad that Disney are now really on the wane, or they could have tried doing these themed soundtracks more often with the Beatles and Pink Floyd...oh well, I can dream.<br/><br/>To sum up, Stitch is the best. Watch him.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"fjhuerta-2","8","33","44","29 July 2002"," I gave this movie another chance. I'm glad I did.
","First time, I commented how ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was my favorite Disney movie of the last ten years, and how ""Lilo & Stitch"" had left me wanting for more.<br/><br/>How wrong I was then.<br/><br/>I gave it another chance. I went back to watch it with a couple of friends and their sons and daughters. What best atmosphere to enjoy a Disney flick?<br/><br/>And then, the scene were Stitch is alone, with ""The Ugly Duckling"" book, shouting ""I'm lost!"" (or at least that's what he was saying in spanish) made me change my mind. I suddenly became very identified with the main character's quest for belonging, and suddenly realized he was actually everyone I know - searching for approval, trying to be loved, longing for love. The watercolor drawings, the facial expression, the music, the mood - perfection, indeed. There are a couple of animated scenes that convey this kind of mood - the Ballroom Sequence in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Simba's dad being killed in ""The Lion King"", Jessie's song in ""Toy Story 2"" - and this one is one of the best I've ever seen. Such simplicity and beauty is strange to find.<br/><br/>When we walked out of the movie, my friend's kids were talking excitedly about the movie, when one of their mothers asked them what they enjoyed most about the movie. And one of the girls exclaimed ""Ohana means family! And your family never forgets or abandons you!"" (that's what is said in the spanish version of the movie).<br/><br/>Then I suddenly realized we need more movies like this.<br/><br/>Solid 9 / 10 for Lilo & Stitch."
"Foux_du_Fafa","9","35","47","21 October 2006"," The Oasis in the Middle of a Desert
","Disney's animation department (until the purchase of Pixar) had, to tell the truth, fallen into a bit of a dark age as the 90s drew to a close. The films were getting muddled with executive desires, and as a result went ridiculously over budget, and needless to say ultimately often bombing at the box office and/or with critics as a consequence. Only the Pixar films and, to a lesser extent, DTV sequels (themselves not exactly the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) were really the only new animated films from Disney that were making money. Whilst a number of Disney's animated films of the early 2000s are fine (""Home on the Range"" and ""Brother Bear"" are, in particular, both fun flicks), they certainly don't quite live up to the best of Disney animation.<br/><br/>And then there's ""Chicken Little"". I wanted to like it, but I was left really disappointed. It had nice animation, but executive meddling had left the story in a mess. I'm a fan of Zach Braff and Harry Shearer, but even their vocal talents didn't save this film, which resulted in the worst Disney film of all time, and was probably only a hit due to the sheer mountain of advertising.<br/><br/>And yet, there's always an oasis in the middle of a desert, and ""Lilo and Stitch"" is, in this case, just that. It's the story of a girl who mistakes an alien for a dog, and whilst seeming an unusual little flick, is unpretentious. The animation differs from the classic Disney style that many may be used to, but it's delicious eye candy. It's rather touching, too and was rightfully a hit with critics and at the box office. Director Chris Sanders is directing another animated film for Disney entitled ""American Dog"" and should be released in 2008. Hopefully that will be just as good.<br/><br/>Although it was rated PG in the USA, I honestly think that most young kids will be able to take this if they survived the likes of ""The Lion King"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Dumbo"". But enough with the kids, and onto the adults; seriously, don't dub this as a kids movie because it's made by Disney. It's got something for everybody in it and I recommend it."

","This is a great little movie.  It has the right mix of comedy, drama, and tear-jerking.  The characters are interesting and very well done.  The animation is high quality.  The setting is fairly unique.  I have to say, Disney's animation people can do something besides make bad sequels after all."

","There is a little Hawaiian girl named Lilo, she enjoys diving, surfing and folk dancing. And she desperately wants a friend, even not just a friend, she wants to have a soul mate. A flying saucer crashes near her house and a strange creature emerges. Actually it is a hostile alien whose the only aim is to destroy life on earth. Their paths cross. What happens when the little earth girl and the extra-terrestrial maniac meet? A funny, heart-warming story of friendship, love, family ties To be frank I was not going to see this animated film considering it to be ""little kids stuff"". But when eventually I saw it I realized how wrong I was. Disney proves its reputation for making ""family friendly"" films because this is the film in which each family member, whether it be a child or a parent, can find something for him/herself to enjoy and think about. A couple of words about music. Since Lilo is a huge Elvis fan, the soundtrack contains a lot of his songs. It is a hard task to make songs written rather long ago fit in the modern film but the producers succeeded! Recommended to all!"
"Chris_Gardner","Null","11","14","21 October 2002"," What would have happened if ET had been a belligerent life-form rather than a friendly one? That's the question Chris Sanders must have asked when he wrote the latest animated Disney movie Lilo and Stitch.
","The film, directed by Sanders who also provides the destructive alien Stitch's voice, is a very touching animated comedy which turns Steven Speilberg's original ET movie on its head. The plot revolves around little Lilo, a five-year-old  Hawaiian orphan, voiced by Daveigh Chase who unknowingly rescues an alien experiment from the dog pound thinking that she has rescued a dog. Her sister and guardian, Nani (Tia Carrere) is none-too-pleased due to his destructive tendencies, but is soon distracted by young surfie David Kawena (Jason Scott Lee). Unbeknown to Lilo the creature she names Stitch is actually experiment number 626 and has been designed to destroy all that he comes into contact with. Because of this Stitch is banished to  an asteroid for the rest of his life but escapes to a blue-green world known as earth. To help with this he has extra thick skin and has been given strength way beyond his means To make the story of family and friendship more alluring Stitch's creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba voiced by David Ogden  Stiers, and the one-eyed Agent Peakley (Kevin McDonald) have a different idea. They are despatched by the Galactic Federation of Planets to capture Stitch and bring him home without interfering with the native humans. As the story unfolds Stitch learns what it is to be part of a family, albeit a very dysfunctional one, and feels like he belongs for the first time in his short life. As well as being loosely based on ET, in basic concept only, there are tips of the hat to the Star Trek television series as well as the Star Wars movies. The most obvious is when Stitch, imitating Jedi Master Yoda in Attack of the Clones, catches a laser blast in his hands, forms it into a ball and tosses it back at his attacker. Unlike most Disney films Lilo and Stitch has little music, save for the occasional clip of Elvis Presley which helps punctuate Lilo's obsession with the singer. Like Stuart Little 2,  Lilo and Stitch is packed full of family values and emphasises the importance of friendship. Hilariously touching."
"saarvardi","10","9","11","23 July 2007"," Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore
","2002 may seem a long time ago now, but in fact only 5 years have passed since then. Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.<br/><br/>After all this time, I still don't know if it was the whole atmosphere of the brief vacation from the army or the fact it was an over the top animated masterpiece from the get go. As anyone would tell you from personal experience, it's all subjective anyway. Fact of the matter is, I instantly fell in love with the film and its lovable characters. The story of an alien being (cute and cuddly as he may be) who is stranded in a place miles away from home made me relate to my own personal status, having to serve in the hot and humid southwest area of Israel, hundreds of kilometers from my own home. Once I was there, feeling for the ridiculous looking Stitch, I soon developed a gradual empathy to Lilo, the little girl who adopted Stitch after mistaking him for a dog, as I myself am an orphan, and I can see why she needed a dog to share her emotions.<br/><br/>Now mix all this with the hilarious animation, numerous likable side characters, beautiful Hawaiian setting, refined Elvis Priestly soundtrack, and you got yourself a winner. Lilo & Stitch manages to be silly and intelligent both at once, and to this day makes me laugh and cry simultaneously (I obviously own it on DVD). It's the last traditional animation outing that was a big hit at the box office as well (if memory serves me right, it earned nearly 150 million dollars in the US alone), and there's an obvious reason for that. Like Shrek 1&2, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and other 3-D CGI animation films, it keeps its plot simple and easy to follow, when all the while manages to pay gestures to older films and themes us grown ups can relate to; thus really living up to the cliché that insists a G rating is for everyone from 4 to 90 9or something like that).<br/><br/>As you can tell, I first and foremost fell in love with this film for sentimental reasons, but at the end of the day, what made me watch it again and again over time was its original mix of Sci-fi and traditional animation, unbelievable funny scenes (try watching Stitch running over the toy model of San Francisco and tell me you didn't laugh) and simple morals of family and friendship. Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore."

","I deliberately saw this film again recently having read some of the comments in a quiet moment. I was amazed how some people saw this movie: Most specifically the negative comments. While I appreciate that we're all different, I am at a loss to understand how anyone could not have loved this film? Did some people really think it was too violent, not suitable for children and most bizarrely of all that Lilo was nasty and aggressive? This is a young girl who is poor, teased at school for being ""different"" and who has recently lost both her parents in a car crash and she is a therefore a terrible role model for kids??? Lilo was gorgeous, in every way. Disney captured with stunning beauty and accuracy the mannerisms of a troubled child, a little lost, scared and angry, but also sweet, (wanting to pay for her pet herself) loving, (the home made doll she returns to) clear thinking (not feeding Pudge the fish, tuna sandwiches) and hopeful (the constant photo taking of ""family"" people that she so yearns for).<br/><br/>It's my favourite ever Disney film and in my top 10 of all time because of the way it makes me feel when I watch it. Wonderful characters, laugh out loud funny in places, great soundtrack, strong storyline, good over evil, redemption and ultimately the sort of family values that we all crave. If some people couldn't get over the fact that initially Lilo is a troubled child and Stitch is a character without morals and guidelines (which Lilo teaches him throughout) when that is so obviously the point, I feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>A beautiful film in every way 10/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","8","10","6 May 2009"," One thing I've learnt while watching this movie-NEVER judge a film by its trailer!
","I don't know why the animators decided to use the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast to advertise the film. It did put me off seeing it, but when I eventually decided to do so, I am glad I did. I thought Lilo and Stitch a warm and entertaining film, with beautiful animation with the Hawiian coast. The characters were engaging and funny, especially Jumbaa(wonderful voice work from David Ogden Stiers, in fact all the voice work was terrific, the other standout being Tia Carrere) and Pleakley. Their scenes were hilarious, like Pleakley getting bitten by mosquitoes. This is all helped by a superb script, that mixes hilarious and poignant brilliantly. The music is lovely and quite nostalgic. I thought I would never say that, but it honestly does add to the sense of fun. Both Lilo and Stitch are engaging, and there are plenty of bonding scenes with them together, that makes the film often moving(I was genuinely touched by Lilo telling Stitch about her parents and the significance of the Ugly Duckling story). I have two criticisms with the movie, and they are that at times it is a bit slow, and the climax is a tad rushed. But both flaws are redeemed by the film's good nature, emotional heart and spirit. I will award Lilo and Stitch an 8/10, for entertainment and warmth. Bethany Cox"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","8","10","28 March 2008"," After a Long Time, Disney Gives Us Another Gem?
","It feels like ages since Disney gifted us with numerous gems like 'Bambi', 'The Little Mermaid', 'The Lion King' etc (to name only a few) but things haven't been going too well for them in the last 20ish years. The other day I saw 'Tarzan and Jane' and I was mortified at how awful it was. Not just in term of its content, but even the animation looked very amateur. 'Lilo and Stitch' is a gem to have emerged from Disney after a long long time. Sadly, Disney has gone back to churning the usual crap and the success of trash like 'High School Musical' can assure us that we cannot expect anything great from Disney for a while longer.<br/><br/>'Lilo and Stitch' presents a very new style of animation with a new story. The characters, setting and music are all very refreshing. It's quite a nice touch of Disney to reintroduce Elvis to the younger generation. I loved most of the songs including Wynonna's version of 'Burning Love'. the only song i hated was A-Teens version of 'Fools Rush In'. Those bitches totally ruin that song. I didn't listen to the rest of the songs during the end credits but i hear that those too have been ruined by non-talents of the current-day. The setting in Hawaii is beautiful. I know it's only animation but it makes one want to go live there. The Hawaiian culture is very nicely portrayed. <br/><br/>The characters are very unique, real and lovable. We can recognize the little brat we once were in Lilo. She's a brat and gives her sister one hell of a time but also has a soft spot. She clearly loves her sister and is pretty much a lonely child. The sisters relationship was very real. Nani is pretty much the sole guardian struggling to make a living and raise her sister. This was also another point that 'Lilo and Stitch' lightly tackle, real life situations where an elder sister is trying to be a good parent to her little sis while she is also threatened by a social worker and tries to balance her worklife and life at home (which is clearly dysfunctional). At the same time we also see that she hardly has time for any romantic relationships. Stitch is one of the most unique characters of a Disney film. He is pretty much like an outsider who doesn't get along with anyone in the beginning, mostly through faults of his own but gradually forms a close bond with Lilo and Nani (kind of like me when I was a teen except that instead of Lilo and Nani I had a few good friends). The voice cast (that includes names like Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers Ving Rhames and even Chris Sanders who created the film) do a fine job giving life to their characters.<br/><br/>'Lilo & Stitch' is sheer entertainment. It tackles some relevant themes such as family value, the need to belong and unconditional love but it is well handled and doesn't do it in a way that will bore the kids. It's as much a movie for kids as it is for adults. It all started with Chris Sanders's (who also dubbed for Stitch) idea and he deserves full credit for it. Just think of the beautiful line often repeated in the film. 'Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind'. Simple words yet such a powerful line. And it's coming from a Disney film. A real gem indeed."
"Jenny Ho","7","6","7","27 October 2002"," Refreshingly different from the usual Disney fare
","Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who is brought up alone by her elder sister. They adopt a dog, Stitch which unknown to them, is actually a mutant alien accidentally landed on Earth and has been designed to destroy everything it touches.   Despite Stitch's genetic tendencies towards destruction, a bond forms between girl and alien while the scientist who created Stitch also arrives on Earth to capture him. <br/><br/>Lilo is an adorable but rebellious little girl who loves Elvis.  Therefore, instead of characters bursting into song singing the usual Disney tunes, we get Elvis songs on the soundtrack which makes for a refreshing change. Stich is immediately unattractive, being a big-eared four armed monstrosity designed for destruction and creating havoc.  Like with Warner Brothers' Tasmanian Devil, it is down to the animation and characterisation which up the cute factor and allow for the audience to warm towards the alien.<br/><br/>It seems like Disney have gone with the times, choosing to deal with the issue of a single parent family.  In doing so, they keep the right balance of sensitivity and compassion in the relationship between the two sisters without being sickeningly sentimental. <br/><br/>As is often the case in animated features, part of the fun is to work out who the familiar voices belong to:  Lilo's older sister Nani is played by Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee plays Nani's friend who offers her a shoulder to cry on (and probably wants the friendship to develop into something more!)  Another character is the Ving Rhames-voiced social worker who oddly, is a big burly Man in Black type character.<br/><br/>
Chaotic action towards the end of the film is a little bit of a let-down after the fun of the relationship between Lilo and Stitch and inevitably, the ending is a sentimental and happy one.<br/><br/>Overall, Lilo and Stitch' is good fun and will win over audiences both old and young through the story's originality and the characters' charm."
"manicman84","8","5","6","11 August 2006"," charming and ingenious
","Although the animation is traditional, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is quite modern and refreshing movie. It has a charm characteristic to previous Disney productions combined with a really ingeniously-done action (the beginning and the end of the flick). Every single character is lovable - moving and hilarious at the same time. Stitch is a character which matches all the icons from classic animated films and one can utter its name along with Shrek or Duffy Duck. A very typical for such pictures message - the glorification of the family is given in a touching way and does not spoil an enormous fun. The script is full of interesting, a bit surrealistic ideas and funny dialogues. This movie is a worthy addition to the best productions of Walt Disney studio. I definitely recommend it to the whole family."
"crowrobot","10","5","6","17 August 2005"," A greatly satisfying Disney comedy....
","'Lilo & Stitch' is truly one of the oddest Disney films you will ever see. It all started with the gut-busting ad campaign: The titular monster Stitch showing up in classic Disney movies and genuinely wreaking havoc in them. This offbeat charm shows up in the movie, and 'Lilo & Stitch' is Disney's strongest animated offering in years.<br/><br/>The story: Experiment 626 (voice of writer-director Chris Sanders) is a highly dangerous, highly disgusting, highly... tiny illegal alien experiment. He escapes a Galactic Prison and lands on Earth where he is mistaken for a very strange dog and adopted by a odd little Hawaiian girl named Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase). Lilo is what you'd call a misfit; she listens to Elvis, makes strange dolls, and believes that a fish named Pudge controls the weather. When these two meet, trouble is sure to come. You see, Stitch has a highly aggressive nature, but sweet little Lilo tempers him, and the certified Disney happy-ending comes into play. After, of course, several movie references, lots of slapstick and verbal comedy, and tons of space action.<br/><br/>What really endears one to 'Lilo & Stitch' is it's highly quirky characters. Lilo is one of the few 6 year-olds who listens to Elvis, and Stitch has a high-pitched laugh that evokes movies like 'Gremlins' and 'Critters'. Another true joy of the movie is it's supporting cast. Nani is Lilo's big sister, voiced by Tia Carrere, and a surrogate mom (their parents died). She's not perfect, though, and is constantly at risk at having Lilo taken away from her by Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), a disapproving social worker. Let's talk about him for a moment. In another movie, Bubbles would be the villain (and ostensibly he is), but here he's more realistic. When he tells Nani that Lilo has to be taken away, there is true sadness in his animated eyes. And then of course there's the bumbling duo of Jumba and Pleakley. Jumba (David Ogden Stiers) is the self-described ""evil genius"" who created Stitch with a Russian accent, and Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) is an alien officer who is an 'expert' on Earth. He believes that mosquitoes are the dominant life form on Earth (this is another odd character quirk).<br/><br/>'Lilo & Stitch' is an odd, skewed but hilarious Disney animated offering that is sure to entertain the whole family. Also, Disney gains a new animated hero in Stitch. You just can't help but like the little monster."

Not to mention their pathetic sequels & ""new exclusive editions"" that've been clogging up the shelves at your local rental store. This movie however came as a pleasant surprise from Disney. Not only did it have the typical ""Disney- awwwwwww!"" feature, but also an unusual dosage of satire and ""evil-deeds"" from the cute little blue alien Stitch.<br/><br/>This is probably one of my new favorite Disney-flicks, mostly because of the charming way the whole picture is drawn, and the evil little creature Stitch!"

If you may want to watch the movie with your child if they are young, since kids can be susceptible to fears of abandonment The other central figure, Stitch is comical and appears to be intelligent.  The animation, choice of music and gags in the movie were also good.  The plot was a little weak (especially the second half of the movie).  I rated this 7 out of 10, I'll be looking for more work from Sanders and DeBlois (the writers). Perhaps if Disney could leave a few loose ends or avoid forcing every story to an almost predictable happy ending, then the real skill of these writers might shine through."
"Mr-Fusion","8","4","5","5 July 2016"," Fares even better on rewatch
","""Lilo and Stitch"" is an approachable movie because of its charms, in each of the main characters. Lilo has got to be the cutest Disney character in existence. Stitch on the other hand is a lovable spaz. And when I first watched this movie, that likability and the Elvis soundtrack made for a generally pleasing movie.<br/><br/>All of that seems heightened on the second go-around. I clearly admit bias as Lilo reminds me of my own kid. But she has great chemistry with Stitch and it enhances the broken family story. I can't relate to that, so I don't know how realistic it really is - but it's emotionally effective and it's not overdone.<br/><br/>This is top-tier (modern) Disney, with surprising wit and an ideal voice cast. The songs are good, the sentiment is endearing and this just hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>It's a great movie<br/><br/>8/10"
"moviesleuth2","7","4","5","25 October 2009"," Works better than it should
","Disney, the King of Film Animation. Well, it was at one point. Now Dreamworks is giving them a run for their money, but never mind. This is a Disney movie, although the film has taken its competitor's taste for the irreverent and mixed it with its own Disney heart.<br/><br/>Stitch is a monster created by the ""mad scientist"" Dr. Jumba (Disney animation regular David Ogden Stiers). But because such experimentation is illegal (and Stitch is engineered to be a complete menace), Jumba is arrested and Stitch is ordered into exile. But clever Stitch escapes to Earth, and Jumba and another alien, Pleakly (Kevin McDonald) are sent to bring him back. Meanwhile, Stitch gets adopted by a little girl named Lilo (Daveigh Chase), who after the death of her parents, is being raised by her older sister, Nani (Tia Careere). But while the inclusion of Stitch into the picture may have been made with good intentions, he may end up causing enough trouble to get Lilo taken away to an orphanage.<br/><br/>The voice actors are good. Daveigh Chase is excellent as the shy and awkward little girl. She wants friends, but she lacks the appropriate social skills (it doesn't help that the other girls treat her like crap). Tia Careere, whose career has been in a rut despite being in one of my all-time favorite movies (""True Lies""), is great as Nani. They may drive each other nuts, but Nani really cares about her sister. David Ogden Stiers is suitably kooky as Dr. Jumba, while Kevin McDonald equals him as the neurotic PETA-clone (some may find his vocalization annoying though).<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that we really come to care about Lilo and Nani. Any time Stitch wreaks havoc (which he frequently does), it is at the expense of Lilo and Nani's shaky stability. His hilarious chaos makes their life harder, and the movie struggles to find a balance between the two. Also, the animation is sub-par, especially when compared to the likes of the previous animated films Disney brought us.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is still a lot of fun for the whole family."

"Will_Scarlet","10","4","5","3 March 2004"," Suprisingly moving.
","It's hard to say what this movie is: A crazy sci-fi story, or a serious family drama, or both? The trailers showed it as one, big, crazed sci-fi epic, but I was amazed at how much this movie touched me. Opening at an intergalactic tribunal over<br/><br/>Jumba Jookiba, an alien scientist jailed for creating a living weapon of mass destruction, and developing into a high-speed star-trek type chase as the<br/><br/>experiment escapes to Earth, the movie segues into the introduction of a little Hawaiian girl named Lilo, who is clearly not a typical five or six year old. She makes sacrifices to a fish she believes controls the weather, reads books about voodoo, posts pictures of obese tourists on her walls, and adores Elvis, and her older sister is clearly struggling to raise a child like her since the death of their parents. The relationship between the two sisters is handled remarkably well, and is a welcome change in a Disney movie. Having the writers drop ""Stitch,""<br/><br/>the destructively deranged alien experiment into this family seems like too big of a risk. But the story's appeal does not come from the comedy of this family<br/><br/>dealing with Stitch's antics, but from the effect the family has on Stitch. He is very much like the Frankenstein monster, knowing he is unnaturally created, and<br/><br/>feeling he lacks what the rest of the world has, and doubtful, knowing he is built to destroy, that he can fit in. His lonely night scene, in which he cries into the night ""I'm lost,"" is just as moving as any scene from Dumbo, Bambi, or Mary<br/><br/>Poppins. Chris Sanders, writer and director for the movie, makes Stitch a<br/><br/>remarkably sympathetic character, aside from the physical and verbal comedy,<br/><br/>in which his voice is the joke as much as Donald Duck's. David Odgen Stiers,<br/><br/>under Eastern European accent, does the honors for Jumba, while Kevin<br/><br/>MacDonald, imitating Jerry Lewis' vocal styles, is a hilarious Pleakley, the erratic expert on Earth. Also excellent is Ving Rhames as the Man-in-Black turned<br/><br/>Social Worker, ""Cobra"" Bubbles, going back to his ""Pulp Fiction"" stylings. The real credit, however, goes to Daveigh Chase for her in depth, eccentrically<br/><br/>innocent portrayal of Lilo. Finally, the film's Hawaiian setting is well done, helping to break away from the stereotypes that have existed for years. The<br/><br/>rendition of ""Aloha Oe,"" which has become a hoaky Hawaiian stereotype for<br/><br/>years, reminds us that it is a song of goodbye. The watercolor backgrounds give the movie a delightful old-fashioned feel, contrasting almost comically with the new-age themes. Do the two stories mix well? Does the movie move too quickly<br/><br/>from scene to scene? Who cares! Don't think about that while you watch, and<br/><br/>this movie will capture your heart! Movies that do that don't have to make sense all the time."

"Spleen","10","4","5","20 September 2002"," As good as animation ever gets
","If we're STILL hearing idiotic comments about the Disney ""formula"" after this, I think I'll scream. Just so I'll know, which Disney cartoon, exactly, is representative of the formula which the rest allegedly follow? Certainly not the last, say, five, which show an astonishing amount of daring and have nothing whatever in common with one another: ""Tarzan"", ""Fantasia 2000"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Atlantis"", ""Lilo and Stitch"". True, two of those five (""Fantasia 2000"" and ""Atlantis"") are total misfires, but two others are of transcendent quality: ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Lilo and Stitch"". And ""Lilo and Stitch"" turned out, to my surprise, to be even better than ""The Emperor's New Groove"" - and what's more, even funnier. (It's even more surprising because the prologue before the main title, a meeting of the Alien High Council, suggests something generic and ordinary - but thereafter, every single moment is solid gold.) At least half of the humour, as it should, comes from the animation: the way Stitch is drawn, the way he moves, the strength of the characters' attitudes and, ultimately, the depth of their emotions.<br/><br/>The animation is (after the disappointing ""Atlantis"") of the highest Disney standard; the art direction is fresh and lovely (the backgrounds are in watercolour, for the first time in decades); and the minimal computer animation is used tastefully and correctly - there is NOT ONE garish mismatch between, say, a CGI spaceship and a pencil-animated human. The characters feel unique and even the child, Lilo - ESPECIALLY the child, Lilo - is endearing. The strong sentiment towards the end is not manipulative or false, but grows naturally out of the comic premise.  There can be no doubt: this is a GREAT movie.<br/><br/>One thing I will hear occasionally that will also make me want to scream is the critical kiss-of-death: ""Lilo and Stitch"" is ""good for children"". This is perhaps the most misleading thing a reviewer can say. It's GOOD, period. I don't know what particular demographics - children, adults, Hawaiians - will most admire the film, and I don't care."

","I think this is the best Disney movie that has come out so far.  Although the movie doesn't have the animation style as its predecessors, it has a lot to say.  The animators have taken a bold step.  Yes, that is to incorporate a very serious theme in a children's movie.  But, it still works great, and it is brilliant.  <br/><br/>Stitch is an alien being, who was put into exile due to his destructive capabilities and his inability to adapt to a normal life.  But, he escapes and lands on earth (in the state of Hawaii).  He is, then, discovered in a dog pen by a Hawaiian girl who adopts him as her pet.  It is really touching to watch how stitch learns to become a part of her family.  The essence of the movie, however, is that ""Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind"".  This is mentioned again and again.  If you're sensitive enough, you might even find yourself crying, because the animators do an exceptional job of portraying feelings of guilt, loneliness and belonging. But, don't hesitate to take the kids.  This is a comedy, and they might even learn something important.<br/><br/>All in all, great film, I give it a 10/10, although I am an adult."

"StevePulaski","9","2","2","31 May 2012"," An unattractive character that manages to become undeniably cute
","The original theatrical poster of Disney's Lilo and Stitch is one that perfectly compliments the picture itself using very, very few words. It shows many of the iconic Disney characters, from Pinocchio to Aladdin, Beauty to the Beast, staring at poor little Stitch who is firmly planted in the center of the poster, looking at the audience and optimistically smiling. This is one of the first times Disney willingly marketed a character that wasn't too presentable in quality, but after staring at his unique blue self for about a half hour, you begin to see the beauty in him, and by the end, he firmly clings to your heart.<br/><br/>Lilo and Stitch is one of the brightest, cleanest, and cheerfully different Disney pictures I have seen, and one of the company's bravest of the decade next to Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Unlike that picture, which resulted in a disappointing performance at the box office because of its different look and crisper, more adult-like style, Lilo and Stitch shot and scored with audiences and revenue, and dare I say, was one of their best films of the decade.<br/><br/>The story begins with Dr. Jumba Jookiba (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), who is on trial for his latest illegal genetic experiment. The creature, dubbed ""Experiment 626,"" is a pint-sized, blue, dog-like creation, aggressive, obnoxious, and very, very sneaky. After being forced to be executed, 626 manages to escape to Earth, crash-landing on Kauai, a small island of Hawaii.<br/><br/>It is there where we meet Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a likable, yet alienated soul who is taken care of by her nineteen year old sister Nani (Carrere) after her parents' tragic death. The pair is constantly interrupted by Cobra Bubbles, voiced to perfection by Ving Rhames, a tall, ominous, and intimidating social worker, concerned that Lilo may not be in the best care with Nani, and is planning to move her to a foster home if conditions aren't up to his standards.<br/><br/>Frustrated when Lilo's alienation worsens, Nani takes her to an animal shelter, where she finds Experiment 626, who was taken there after being hit by a truck late in the night. She adopts and names 626 ""Stitch"" and they quickly become best friends. The creature, at first, is ill-behaved and lawless, worse than any dog one could have. But later on, he develops heart and, what was originally intended to be a plan of cunning instincts, being taken under the wing of an innocent girl to be protected from Dr. Jumba and his bumbling sidekick Agent Pleakley (McDonald), becomes a truly real story of family (or ""ohana"" in this case) devotion, self-worth, love, and a keenly observant lesson in philosophy. This story is appealing to everyone, and for a while, it seemed that Pixar was light years ahead of Disney, while at this point in time, they were neck and neck.<br/><br/>The animation is beautifully rendered and bleeds classic style. This was, again, the time period where animation was changing. Pixar invented the ""full length CGI feature"" idea, and it was at this point in time where movies of both the classic, hand drawn vibe were being released, as well as newly invented computer animated features. This proved to many that despite flashy tech-work and glossy colors, that it is the story that matters, and that Disney was still able to deliver a rich, compelling feature of depth and heart.<br/><br/>Lilo and Stitch is simply a wonderful film. It packs in undying morals to accompany its premise, never seems to become more interested in awkward sentimentality and witty one-liners, and always seems focused, sophisticated, and effervescent in its idea of ""doing what it can with what it has."" It has brilliant voice actors, elegance in its art direction, a smooth script, and a touching and sometimes poignant story that serves as a feast for the heart. It is an absolute treat.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Daveigh Chase, Chris Sanders, Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, and Jason Scott Lee. Directed by: Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois."

","This odd story of a potentially dangerous (but cute) alien being adopted by a small Hawaiian girl is possibly the least Disney-like of all that studio's traditionally animated features. It was also miles away from the cutesy preconceptions I had from the promotional artwork.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that it doesn't have its cutesy elements, of course. But there is a distinctly dark leaning in the arcs of its two main character - the girl Lilo, dealing with the deaths of her parents and possibly being wrenched away from her sister's guardianship, and the alien Stitch, bred to be destructive, learning the value of family, and constantly trying to evade the forces trying to recapture him.<br/><br/>I was delighted to view a Disney animated feature which was so far away from what I expected, and which was still entertaining, amusing, and full of heart.<br/><br/>A good family film.

","I actually liked Lilo and Stitch. I went to this film with low expectations and came out with a delightful smile on my face. Disney always does a good job with their animated features. This film is about a dog-like alien who escaped from a ship that was bringing him to exile. He lands on Earth and to escape from aliens searching for him, he ends up being a pet for Lilo and her sister. He wreaks havoc at first but as the movie goes on, he learns to have better control. The animation is pretty good, not the best. I am happy to say that there is Elvis in this film. Many classic hits are in this movie. I am also happy that this could've won an Oscar because this film was nominated for Best Animated Feature. This was a great idea by Chris Sanders. Overall, this is a great family film.

","Recap: Evil Genius or Idiot Scientist (Disputed) Dr. Jumba Jookiba has just been sentenced to jail for tampering with genetics. His result, Experiment 626, a little creature made to destroy, is to be exiled to an asteroid. Now Experiment 626 is not too keen to spend the rest of his life on an asteroid, or he is just trying to be destructive. Anyway, he escapes confinement, hijacks a spaceship and takes off into hyperspace. And crashes on Kauai. Now, water is about the only thing that Experiment 626 can't cope with, so being stuck on an island is not very good for him. And then his creator and Earth ""expert"" Pleakley is sent to recapture him. Enter Lilo and Nani, two sisters who has lost their parents and while Nani struggles to making ends meet and being a mother to her sister, so that they are not separated, Lilo has her own troubles being alone and shunned by other kids her age. Nani decides that a puppy might do the trick, but unfortunately Lilo chooses the talking dog (Experiment 626), that she names Stitch. Not very happy with the new arrangements Stitch stays with his new family just to avoid being recaptured. But things literally fall apart around Stitch, and the outlook for the new family is not very good.<br/><br/>Comments: So sweet! Stitch is so adorable in his own peculiar disturbing way. And he is funny. Together with Lilo, who is adorable in a more normal way, they make a great team. Together they wreak havoc wherever they go. Stitch is made for destruction, but together with Lilo he is a great comic creator, making one funny scene after another. Add the big sister Nani, her aspiring boyfriend David, social worker Cobra Bubbles, Pleakley and Jumba Jookiba the character cast is as good as it gets. Each and every character contributes to the story in a unique way. And there is more to the story than just laughs. Love is a big theme, and the concept of a family. Everything combined the result is a sweet funny movie with an attitude, and a deeper message that works for all ages.<br/><br/>One should note though, that this maybe isn't the best movie for the smallest kid to see without someone older to watch it with. Yes there is guns, and shooting but that is not what concerns me. That is done in a cartoonish comic way that even the smallest child sees is make-believe. What concern me more is a few moments when Nani and Lilo and Stitch are about to be separated. Being as well made as this movie is, playing on and conveying emotions well, maybe a hand to hold during these scenes are not a bad idea.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a great movie, especially if you love Disney-animation movies.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Hilarious, Gorgeous, Sparkling (and with a creamy-crispy cookie core)!! Lilo and Stitch is certainly one of the most entertaining and especially one of the most funny Disney films ever. I really loved the latest Disney films like Monster Inc. and Emperor's new Groove, too, but L&S took the ideas from Emperor and developed them. The humor is just so un-Disney-esque, it's almost Simpson-esque. By the way, my Disney favorites are The little mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>One of my favorite jokes was the scene in which Lilo asks Mr. Bubbles (Mr. Bobo) if he has ever killed someone or the scene in which Nani tries to give Lilo instructions what to say to Mr. Bubbles about her family life and Lilo finally ends up saying that she gets beaten up every day by her sister.<br/><br/>And I loved the jokes with Dr. Jamba as tourist and Pleakley as his wife...by the way, Pleakley seems to be a bit gay at all (Remember that charming phone call with his mother, when Pleakley sits on the palm tree?) And it is one of the rare, if not the only Disney cartoon that hints something like sex (Lilo to David: ""Nani said she liked your bottom."" or something similar). I know that Disney establishes a new character design in every film, but why does everybody in this film have these fat legs?!<br/><br/>I don't know why some mothers (it can only be mothers, perhaps belonging to the group I personally call AMA (Adjusted Mothers of America)) screw up about L&S, like Disney was only allowed to make films that provide important morally values. For those AMA-Moms: IT IS NOT! Lilo and Stitch is just a great piece of animation and I'm really looking forward to its DVD release here in Germany.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the film in English yet, but Nani's voice is a bit annoying in the German version."
"stamper","7","2","2","26 January 2003"," Stitch rocks
","The biggest reason, to go and see this film is Stitch. What an amazing little creature. OK, I know he is supposed to be a scary monster, but who can resist that cute little head and that funny voice? This character does not have to say anything and can make you laugh harder than some comedians who think about a funny line or comment for about half an hour. The rest of the film is more or less standard' animated feature with a dramatic' sub-plot and a little love' theme'. The only thing that is not standard (except the cuteness of Stitch) is the great music by and inspired by the work of Elvis. I really liked that. First of all, because the music fitted well into the film and second of all because it is good music (even Stitch can't stay as evil' as he is supposed to be with that sort of music around!)<br/><br/>

"GuyCC","9","2","2","5 January 2003"," An Entertaining Combo Of Humor and Emotion.
","When I saw the print ads for ""Lilo & Stitch"", the concept seemed amusing. When I saw the parody trailers, my interest was definitely piqued.  Seeing the actual movie, it has become one of my favorite Disney films from the last few years.<br/><br/>Above all else, the animation and lush backgrounds are stunning.  This truly is a beautiful film, with its rounded art style and realistic emotional gestures and nuances of the characters.  Among the most impressive of the lot is Stitch himself.  Even in the background, he was always doing something worth noting.  His transition from being a mischievous, trouble-making creature, to a lost and alone orphan, to a loving and caring pet.  Stitch was a character full of personality.  He was a riot when he was bad (great gags throughout), and disarmingly touching when good.  Stitch is a great character design.  Probably one of the best Disney Studios has done recently.<br/><br/>The other characters were filled with clever one-liners, a full range of facial expressions, and a respectable amount of depth.  The film managed to balance between being hilariously funny and pulling on the heart-strings as Disney films are known to do.  Nothing seemed really heavy handed or forced in the emotion department, and the character voices really kept the film going and gave the other characters personality.<br/><br/>As for the music, it relied on three sources: Alan Silvestri's score, the Hawaiian music and of course, Elvis.  The Elvis elements that were worked in made Stitch an even funnier character, and didn't take over the film as the only musical element.  The other musical elements provided traditional Hawaiian flair and again, a score that helped set the mood of the film (MINOR SPOILER: the best example of this is when Stitch enters the woods to be found by his family).<br/><br/>""Lilo & Stitch"" is a very funny and sweet film, filled with slapstick elements like an old Warner Bros. cartoon and a little bit of sci-fi action at the beginning and towards the end of the film.  I don't think it's as violent as some reviewers have made it out to be, but it is a very different Disney film with no princes, singing mermaids or enchanted objects.<br/><br/>But sometimes, different is good.  Hopefully, this will take ""Best Animated Picture"" for 2002.  The artwork alone should place it into the winner's circle."
"tv_pikachu","10","2","2","31 December 2002"," This was a Disney movie? No, seriously, this was a Disney film?
","It IS a Disney film, and it shows Disney Magic at its best.  I have to tip my hat to Chris Sanders (the Director) for making an original, and refreshing animated film.  I love the characters and plot so much, but I'll let you watch it and find out how good it is for yourselves, however, I do want to mention some things I noticed and enjoyed in the film.   First off, it's humor; it's slapstick comedy, and it's timing is right on!  Underated Disney films like The Great Mouse Detective, and Rescuers Down Under pull off this subtle timing of humor, but never so masterfully as Lilo & Stitch. Also the colors in this movie are spectacular.  In fact the cold technology of the Aliens in the first scenes of the film were so well contrasted by the warmth of planet Earth in all her watercolor pastel beauty later on.  The anatomy of the human characters is the best I've seen in any animated movie ever made!  Sure they are stylized in Chris Sanders art style, just like our Japanese neighbors and Hayo Miyazaki's style being rendered in all of his films; but the anatomy is amazing in Lilo & Stitch.  Nani (Lilo's older sister) moves and looks like a real woman!  She has a smaller chest, and very wide hips.  She looks so natural, that you almost start to believe she is real.  The story itself has emotion, action, adventure, comedy, love, friendship, and a frog  sitting by the side of the road!  What more could you ask for in a film?!  Elvis music?  Has it.  Watch it!  You won't regret it."
"matrixdirect","Null","2","2","25 December 2002"," Brilliant!...Though not for everyone.
","**WARNING: Possible Spoilers!!!***<br/><br/>Ah, Lilo & Stitch, the movie that answers the question `What would happen if George Lucas, Hayao Miyazaki, and Joe Dante all collaborated on a film. Lilo & Stitch takes on the old idea of `child befriends strange creature' and gives it a refreshing and quirky twist.  Sort of like taking E.T. and replacing E.T. with one of the creatures from Gremlins.   All in all, `L & S' does not remind me of a Disney film.  It seems more like something that either Warner Brothers or Dreamworks would produce.   I have seen quite a few negative reviews by the Disney `purists' out there complaining of its violence and lack of warmth.  They miss the point!  This is not supposed to be a typical syrupy musical puke-fest Disney typically has released in the last decade. Lilo and Stitch would really be recommended to fans of the nontraditional Buena vista releases such as `Nightmare before Christmas' and `Roger Rabbit' (both underappreciated films in my opinion) as well as the works of Miyazaki and the oldschool anime of Tezuka Osamu. (even the characters have Tezuka's familiar stumpy looking qualities)  The story begins rather abruptly with no opening credits until about 10 minutes into the film.  In a far off galaxy, a genetic scientist Jumba Jookiba is standing trial for illegally creating a genetic experiment which he calls `experiment 626'.  626 was designed to be an indestructible weapon of mass destruction (even though he's only 3 feet tall, looks like a blue koala, and sounds like the Andy Kaufman character Latka).  Most surprising about Lilo & Stitch is that most of the time, you can't be sure that you are actually watching a Disney movie.  The film is notably violent by Disney standards and most of the humor can be quite dark at times.  Most noticeable is the absence of traditional Disney musical numbers and cute anthropomorphic animals.  Stitch is a cute alien, but he is also hell-bent on destruction for about the first third of the movie.  As far as Disney films go, Lilo & Stitch has to be one the most realistic I have ever seen.  Lilo's character is the most realistic portrayal of a child in a Disney animated feature. She is not excruciatingly cute for cuteness sake and she actually behaves like a real child.  She (nor any other character) is allegorical and is not completely good or bad.  Each character has their flaws.  Lilo can be a brat and she can be mean to others but she always tries to love her sister and Stitch.  She always has the patience to put up with Stitch's destructive behavior.  Interestingly enough, she also seems to be the moral center of the film.  When her sister Nani has had enough of Stitch's unpredictable behavior, she threatens to throw him out.  Lilo has to remind her that even though Stitch is less than admirable, he is still family and repeats the movie's catchphrase `family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten'. Stitch, even though from the beginning is a destructive little demon, he evolves throughout the film.  He learns about having a family, something he has never had.  He was genetically created with no greater purpose other than to be a one-alien wrecking crew.  As he continues to destroy, he finds out that nobody likes him because of that, eventually even Lilo, the one who saved him from being captured by his creator.  During the second-third of the film he goes through a massive inner conflict between his genetic programming to destroy and his discovery that he could serve a greater purpose and that he is actually loved (at least by one person).  The Elvis soundtrack is a delicious change of pace instead of musical numbers and the songs of the king are often used for amusing montages.  This is also one of the funniest Disney films I have ever seen.  Lilo gets all of the best lines with her deadpan and childlike innocence in her delivery of her bizarre and sometimes disturbing humor.  Meanwhile, Stitch gets all of best visual gags and physical humor. Some of the funniest moments are: Stitch frequently becoming frustrated and destroying everything he touches, the Elvis montage where Lilo teaches Stitch to become a model citizen like her hero Elvis Presley, some of Lilo and Nani's sisterly quarrels (they fight like real siblings), the exchange of dialogue in a scene where Stitch and Jumba toss back and forth a plasma cannon that is about to explode, and Stitch driving a gas truck into a volcano to use the explosion to propel him like a jet pack. The jokes and gags come fast and furious throughout the first 40 minutes and reaches an arc of melodrama in the middle followed by the funny and action-packed final third. Ultimately, Lilo & Stitch is a story about acceptance, redemption, and redefining the concept of family.  This film takes the outdated 50's concept of the nuclear family, throws it out the window and replaces it with the more modern and realistic concept of `family is where the home is'."

","What do you say first about ""Lilo and Stitch""? Do you stand slackjawed to learn the film cost $80 million to make when it looks considerably cheaper? Do you revel in its totally irreverent moments and clever touches? Or do you talk about the overall feel of the film?<br/><br/>Frankly, L+S is just so-so. It has some of the funniest moments in a Disney film (""My friends needs to be punished."") and some of the most disjointed. It does not feel as consistently whacky as ""The Emperor's New Groove"" or as saccharine as ANYTHING from Disney in the last two years. Some of the characters are priceless, though, and I like Stitch a great deal. To me, though, that's not nearly enough to make it a classic. Let's face it: the studio paid $80 million for THIS? On what?<br/><br/>Compare the storytelling and animation of this movie to ""Spirit"" that came out within a week of L+S's debut and got clobbered at the box office, and you might understand why I cannot give this movie super-high marks."

","As soon as I saw the teaser trailers featuring the main character gate-crashing some of the more staid and sickly Disney movies (hello Beauty and the Beast/Aladdin), I had a feeling that I was in for something at least a little different to the standard Disney formula. What I ended up with when I saw it was a splitting headache and sore stomach muscles. It is without doubt the most original and hilarious animated feature I have ever seen. Funnier and more emotionally engaging than Shrek and the Toy Story's put together, there are no obvious jokes in Lilo and Stitch and no forced comedy from so called 'a-list' stars. What there is however, is excellent dialogue, beautifully strange painting/drawing, a simple genuine message and ridiculously funny slapstick as a result of the diminutive Stitch's special alien powers. While never really feeling like a 'Disney' movie, it reminded me more of the humour I love from TV programmes like The Simpsons. Show it to your kids if you have them, show it to your friends if you don't. Family extends beyond immediate relations, see this film."

"orangecatdancing","10","2","2","11 November 2002"," Disney is back on track!
","Films by the Walt Disney Company have been in danger of becoming stale recently - and although there have been valiant attempts to stray from the well-worn fairy tale musical (such as the recent Atlantis: The Lost Empire, a Jules Verne homage of nineteenth century explorers attempting to find the fable underwater city, strangely enough for a Disney film, without song), it has only been the CGI offerings of Pixar that has revitalized Disney with such modern classics as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. But how was Disney to reenergize itself with its traditional cel animation? The answer lay in the story of a small Hawaiian girl called Lilo, and her pet ""dog"" Stitch. Lilo is not a traditional Disney heroine. Unlike Belle from Beauty and the Beast and Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Lilo is not the perfect girl who puts everybody before herself. She is a deeply troubled girl who cannot come to terms with the death of her parents in a car accident. She deliberately ostracizes herself from her peers, and even goes out of her way to antagonize them. She also frequently clashes with her sister Nonnie, who is trying to hold the remnants of their family together even though she is no more than a child herself. Nonnie is also not perfect. Lilo annoys her, and even though there is a desperate love between them it is their differences and inability to grieve properly that brings them to the attention of the child welfare authorities. Nonnie is given a short period of time in which to prove herself fit to be Lilo's guardian, and to try and cheer her little sister up she decides to adopt a family dog. Enter Stitch - the product of an alien genetic experiment who has escaped from his homeworld, and is followed by an intergalactic united nations to attempt to bring him back. Stitch will prove to be a kindred spirit to Lilo, as he is also on a path of self-destruction. He has been programmed to destroy everything that gets in his way, but under Lilo's guidance and away from the influence of his creators he becomes open to the Hawaiian concept of ""okana"": family. Nonnie and Lilo operate by the maxim that in a family nobody gets left behind. And that grows to include Stitch as his secret is revealed, but he proves his worth in a family that is trying to piece itself together. The film does lag slightly towards the end though, as there is the sewing up of a vast and imaginative plot when the other aliens reveal themselves. But is a slight hiccup in what I feel to be one of the best films of 2002. In the end the characters realize that a family can be composed of many elements, and that members do not have to be of the same bloodline. You can choose your friends, and in that respect they can become your family as well. This is an extremely heartfelt film, but it is not as saccharine as past Disney offerings. There are some true moments of madness to be discovered, and also great poignancy as we watch Nonnie and Lilo trying to rebuild their lives after a tragedy. This is helped by the beauty of the animation itself - Disney has reverted to the traditional watercolouring method that was apparently only last used in the forties. It is a method well suited to bring out the vibrancy of the Hawaiian setting, and the movie rocks along with an Elvis Presley soundtrack which works surprisingly well. All of this adds up to part of the Disney canon which proves that the old Mouse Factory's non-CGI animation department isn't dead yet. There is a breath of fresh air rolling through, and it has been provided by Lilo and Stitch."
"albasch","Null","2","2","6 November 2002"," Finally, misfits who actually don't fit in
","Don't get me wrong.  I have nothing against most any Disney film.  Love 'em, love 'em.  But the studio's concept of a ""misfit"" has left much to be desired.  Most of their so-called misfits are actually just people with natural curiosity and ambition, placed in irrationally stifling environments.<br/><br/>Not Lilo and Stitch.  These people are misfits because they are horribly, terribly, wonderfully wrong in the head.  I sympathize.  One of the first scenes we see of Lilo (the cute little girl in the hula skirt) is her torturing voodoo dolls of her friends.  This is, frankly, not out of character.<br/><br/>Stitch is worse.  So much worse it's not worth my trying to describe.  The movie doesn't downplay it.  It revels in his rudeness, his malevolence and general insanity.  It's good (well, bad) fun!<br/><br/>But that's the -wonder- of the story.  He starts off so very, very bad that it's a real journey of discovery for him to turn out even a little good. This isn't some arabian street-rat who finishes the movie plus a pretty wife and some self-esteem, but otherwise unchanged;  Stitch goes through a total metamorphosis.  It's like a how-to manual for learning to care about others. ""Selflessness for dummies""<br/><br/>I can think of no better role-model for a young child than this screeching, cursing, loving alien."
"mweston","7","2","2","15 October 2002"," 3 stars (out of 4)
","When we meet Lilo, a little Hawaiian girl, she is swimming and body surfing in the ocean, which she loves so much that she's late for a rehearsal of a hula dance. Soon thereafter we learn that she lives with her older sister Nani (voice by Tia Carrere, who really is from Hawaii), and that they don't always get along. Furthermore, a social worker incongruously named Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames) is suggesting that Lilo be taken away from Nani unless things get better real soon.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, somewhere else in the universe, we meet Experiment 626 (who is later named Stitch, and whose voice is by one of the two directors). 626's mad scientist creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers) has been put on trial for creating 626, a creature designed to be very powerful, intelligent, and dangerous. 626 is sentenced to exile, but escapes. And from the title of the film and the previews, you know that he ends up in Hawaii with Lilo.<br/><br/>The animation here is very different from the computer generated films that are common these days, and more like the two dimensional animated films of years past. The backgrounds are often lovely watercolors, and most of the animation is also hand drawn from what I've read, although based on the credits there is also some computer animation.<br/><br/>This is also not your usual Disney animated film, although it was made by Disney. Both Lilo and Stitch have some pretty objectionable habits, and the jokes target many pop culture icons. I heard that the film was made with much less detailed committee supervision than would usually be the case at Disney, in exchange for (as I recall) a smaller budget.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good, including Hawaiian music as well as a bountiful selection of Elvis Presley songs (six, I believe).<br/><br/>The biggest downside to the film is that the message is a little too precious, although this is not a big complaint, and I found it less obnoxious than ""Ice Age"" in this regard. The basic message is one of family, whether or not that family is a traditional one with a mother and a father, or a makeshift one as we see in Lilo, Nani, and Stitch. The Hawaiian word ""ohana"" is used, which means more or less the same thing as ""family."" This is timely for me since we just became members of the Hawaii International Film Festival's Ohana in preparation for attending their film festival in November.<br/><br/>This film is definitely recommended, even if you have no children. I originally gave it another half a star, so it's at the upper end of this rating.

Take a blue Koala figure with 4 arms that crawls like a bug, and has a temperment like the Tasmanian Devil and speaks like Donald Duck on hyperdrive..  Stitch is a laugh a minute, (the first scene when Lilo brings Stitch home, and he jams his hind legs into his mouth and rolls into a ball, had my dying on the floor..)<br/><br/>The story continues and concludes with standard Disney fare, (the good guys win, everyone goes home happy), but there is certainly more than enough entertainment for adults in this film as well as for kids.<br/><br/>I wish I had Stitch when I was a kid...<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10"
"suebasko","Null","2","2","30 June 2002"," More Violent than Expected
","This animated Disney film aimed at little kids is more violent than I expected.  I think the screenwriters sat down and tried to include some elements that would appeal to boys and others to appeal to girls.   So, first the film is about outer space, with lots of ugly monsters and evil characters and shooting and space ships and things being blown up.  Then the movie shifts into a tale about girls with dolls and big wheels, and human interaction involving a little girl being raised by her sister.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>   Everything about this movie shouts: We need to make a movie that will not be too offensive for watchful parents and critics, and yet appeal to little boys and girls.  The movie has bits of humor for the adults who are stuck seeing it, as well as perky music that gets the toes tapping.  This movie is a safe summer moneymaker, but it is not any extension of creativity, and will never be a ""classic.""  Toys based on the film are for sale in stores, and they are cute.  If you think McDonald's serves acceptable ""food,"" you will probably think this is acceptable ""entertainment."""

","Okay so this is not ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", but it is not too shabby either!  I liked the approach of the movie, to make it a little more intelligent than just strictly kid stuff. <br/><br/>
Lilo - Little girl with big heart...but likes to get in trouble.<br/><br/>Stitch - Little alien with a big heart...but also likes to get in trouble!!<br/><br/>Stitch made this a fun movie.  Seeing how he adapted to his surroundings and so on was fun.  I liked seeing it.<br/><br/>The music was a little bit much...Elvis Pressley is an alien...ehehehe...sorry could not pass that up!

"janyeap","Null","2","2","18 June 2002"," Nope, it's not simplicity at its best...
","A sweet film that captures the feeling that anyone has the ability to change for the better through love, sharing, and bonding!  It focuses on themes that are easily associated with everyday life.  Sure, I'm fascinated with the way this film connects the themes to the Hawaiian 'ohana' concept.<br/><br/>
Ohana, for any Hawaiian, means a group of people (closely and distantly related) who share nearly everything. Yep, sharing is the core of ohana value. Hawaiians believe that duties to 'ohana' will help them increase their mana (spirituality). The concept of `immediate family' is alien to native Hawaiians. I'm not sure whether the very young viewers will be able to grasp this association, but I'm convinced they would definitely grasp and enjoy watching the development of friendship between the environmental-conscious, little Lilo and the koala-gremlin like, extra-terrestrial Stitch.<br/><br/>Two characters who are so different in appearance, yet almost similar in behavior and traits. I've no doubt that it would tickle the young viewers to catch the mischievous behaviors of these characters on screen. Also, there's enough action and plenty of wacky and weird looking characters in this film to hold up their interest and attention. Young lads would most certainly applaud the sci-fi creativity. And there's nothing crude or terrifying to tempt contempt from their parents. This film has a fair amount of humor, but I'm not convinced that kids below the age of 5 would be able to recognize most of it. Overall, the movie is paced well and the length of the story is appropriate - even for the very young kiddies.<br/><br/>The artistic style of this movie pumps up memories of the traditional animated cartoon medium of Freddie Moore, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas and Eric Larson. But I wouldn't say it's simplicity at its best.  The characters lack the charisma and color of those characters of Monsters, Inc. And the film does fall short of those lovely musical elements that have come to be so appealing with the modern-day Disney animated flicks. After all, the film's setting is Hawaii, and Hawaii is known to be an island of song, beauty and dance!  However, I'm grateful for the familiar Queen Liliuokalani's composition `Aloha O'e.'<br/><br/>The voices of Tia Carrera and Jason Scott Lee succeed in giving their characters the Hawaiian credibility. But overall, the voices given to the majority of characters don't appear to energize the characters' personalities.  Only Stitch's character is cool and pretty credible. an alien whose actions definitely speak louder than words. He is the character that truly brings out laughter from the children sitting around me!<br/><br/>Obviously, this film pays a great deal of homage to Elvis. Quite appropriate, I must say!  How can fans of Elvis ever forget that The King had serenaded them with those unforgettable songs from his `Blue Hawaii' flick!  Overall, it's a nice summer film to watch with the younger kids. But I doubt it's the sort of Disney movie the kids would be willing to watch over and over again."
"henryhail","Null","2","2","24 June 2002"," very entertaining and visually beautiful film
","Being from Hawaii, I was expecting to see a movie filled with stereotypes and that painted some kind of unrealistic tropical paradise.  To my surprise, this is an amazing movie that really feels local.  The characters are realistic and it hard not to empathize with the family's economic struggles.  Stich is a funny character, and the loneliness and longing for family felt by both Lilo and Stitch is actually quite touching.<br/><br/>
The most impressive part of this movie, however, is the animation.  In an era when computer animation makes everything looks geometrically perfect and, frankly, fake, Lilo and Stitch is a welcome throwback to old school Disney animation.  The visuals are amazingly lush, detailed, and personal. Both children and adults are sure to enjoy this quality movie."

","It seems Disney has finally gotten back to what they do best, but this time, better. Lilo & Stitch is truly heart warming, you simply fall in love with the characters - specially Lilo and her strange but very special personality. This is a very simple and real story which many people can relate too, the single parenting reality.

","I had the chance to see Lilo and Stitch at a ""Surprise"" Sneak Preview ( without prior warning ) - and laughed my head off.<br/><br/>This is NOT standard Disney ""sweeter-than-Cotton-candy"" fare - even more so than the surprisingly good ""the Emperor's New Groove"" it takes a rather anarchistic humour and comic hyperbole, stirs, shakes and twirls it to a new degree of potency and serves them with a flourish.<br/><br/>As for the story - an escaped, genetically enhanced lifeform programmed for the wholesale destruction of cities and with a keen sense of survival and cute blue fur ) escapes from its creators, its jailors and the whole of the ""united-galactic-whatever"" and gets stranded in............. Hawaii. Here it gets adopted/picked up by child-terror Lilo, the bane of her older sister, her playmates and the general sanity of the pacific island. On its trail - the mad alien scientist and a fumbling galactic bureaucrat concerned with the safety of the local wildlife - humans and other ""sucky"" species...... A perfect setting for large scale chaos, groovy scenes ( in two words - ""Elvis lives"" ) and much less than expected emotional, family values scenes.<br/><br/>As for the technical side - the animation is not especially outstanding, the backdrops at some times unbelievably ""kitschy"" and very little computer animation visible (though I do have some suspicions, they do not distract/jar with the conventional animation ), colours stay themed and the soundeffects are cool. Oh, did I mention, there was hardly any singing ? THERE IS HARDLY ANY SINGING ! Thanks Disney, you are finally getting the clue ! Now keep up the good work............<br/><br/>There is little of the ""sweet and furry"" and ""perfect family"" stuff which used to be almost a Disney trademark , but when some ""touchy"" scenes come deep out of left field, they are even more poignant for it. Real life problems like broken families, unemployment and child care by single parents are presented in an unobstrusive and ""simplified for children"" way and add motivation to the characters without dominatiing the plot. Adults will get a series of laughs out of subtle (MIB, Godzilla, Star Trek etc.) and less than subtle ( Elvis ) references, with big orgies of comic destruction and some fun science fiction gadgets helping out. Basically everyone in the theater walked out with a big and wicked grin (although they were all adults due to it being a sneak preview, I do have a fair suspicion how my six year old nephew is gonna like this movie....). This is a family movie in the best ""take everyone, and have them enjoy themselves together"" sense , as well as flick that one can simply go and enjoy as an adult (ok, one with a sense of anarchistic humour )."

'Lilo and Stitch' had lively, spunky characters, fresher, hipper, self-aware humor, and was a surprisingly touching story. I'm a 23 yr old man's man and I cried, don't judge me folks.<br/><br/>Lilo is a feisty, kickass little girl and the first scene at her dance class was terrific (""He controls the weather""). She's not as glossy and overdone as some of Disney's characters and heroines in particular. She really could be a kid, full of trouble, but you like her.<br/><br/>High praise for the animators, they did an awesome job conveying emotion, behavior and thoughts in Stitch's expressions and motion. Better than I've ever seen in an animated feature before. ('Stallion', eat your heart out!) He's also one of the best Disney characters ever, a rugged little rebel.

","Lilo and Stitch is definitely not a 'usual' Disney movie, but then again, neither was the fun 'Emperor's New Groove'. This movie is not aimed at little children either, as the humour at times is rather adult and younger kids won't understand what's going on. <br/><br/>The animation isn't so great and looks rather early Nineties except for some of the computer animated graphics of the space craft. The story is rather bizarre, and I won't ruin any of it, but it's enjoyable in the typical Disney way. Lilo (pronounced Lee-low) is adorable and her and Stitch go very well together on screen. The movie does taper off towards the end with a mish-mash of scenes, but the movie as a whole is fun, and worth the time to watch it. However, it won't go down in history as a memorable Disney movie. By the number of positive reviews though, it appears I could be wrong, but there really wasn't anything here that was truly genius. I won't go as far as saying it's a straight to video/DVD release, but it wasn't anything new.<br/><br/>

","Usually I'm not against Disney making films that stray from their usual formulas (heck, I liked ""The Black Cauldron"") but ""Lilo and Stitch"", being one of those films, just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a Disney film that takes place in present day, allowing us to be treated to some great Elvis music - the bits of songs heard throughout the film being one of its only highlights for me. <br/><br/>Otherwise it's a rather bland effort. Stitch is a serious contender for the title ""the most annoying Disney character ever"". As for the visuals, I understand they used watercolors to achieve a vintage look a-la-Dumbo, but anyone who appreciates great visuals in a Disney film would find this film a letdown in that department. It's flat, soft and uninspired. <br/><br/>I'm aware this film made good money at the box-office so I guess it does appeal to some folks... minors, I guess?

"musteline","Null","3","4","6 December 2002"," Commentary on the comments and an overall review.
","""Lilo & Stitch"" was a good movie with positive values, and while I certainly don't fault anyone who sees it another way, I do have a few points to list in its defence.<br/><br/>1)  The ""adult"" themes.  Do we really have to shelter our children from the cold, hard facts of the real world?  If anything, this movie opens up questions about real family problems that kids NEED to learn about.  Where was Mr. Bubbles going to take Lilo?  What happened to Nani and Lilo's family?  Kids need to know that bad things can and do happen -- maybe they can glean understanding of the real world from the people they trust most: their parents.  This film does little but expose children to the realistic view that sometimes, things really aren't so peachy after all.  If parents think these ideas are too ""mature"" for their children, perhaps they should take a good long look at what kind of life expectations they're giving these kids.  (I'm NOT saying we should be sitting three-year-olds down and telling them, sometimes kids get taken away from their mommies and daddies.  There is an appropriate age for such revelations, but often it's quite earlier than parents seem to think.)<br/><br/>2)  The ""violence.""  This is a PG-rated movie.  (For non-American viewers, most Disney movies are rated ""G,"" which means ""for general audiences"" -- in most cases a family movie with little controversial elements in it.  ""PG"" means ""parental guidance,"" indicating that, though still likely appropriate for children, the movie does have some things that parents might not want younger children to see.)  Yes, it's animated, but so was Princess Mononoke (a Japanese film released in the US around 1997), and it certainly wasn't a children's movie, now, was it?  There are things in PG-rated movies that you wouldn't want your kids to see, and violence is one of them.  ..Of course, then again, the violence was presented in a slapstick, Bugs Bunny kind of way, though original in its own right; there was absolutely no instance of gore or blood and the space-guns looked as though they were spewing Jell-O rather than some volatile substance.  You'll find worse on afternoon children's programming, I can assure you.<br/><br/>3)  ""Inappropriateness.""  This isn't a movie simply for children. Granted, there are instances which may be inappropriate for young children who cannot yet understand the concept of foster care or death.  But look at a lot of other recent animated films -- Don Bluth's ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" springs to mind.  I went to see this movie in the theatre when I was six years old and left with nary a CLUE of what had happened.  I recently picked it up from the movie rental and found all sorts of hidden jokes, plot themes and circumstances which passed right over my head before.  I can say comfortably that, had Lilo & Stitch come out in 1989, I would be rediscovering it in much the same way.  The compex themes would suggest this movie be aimed at children at LEAST eight years old, but there is little harm in taking younger ones to see it.<br/><br/>4)  Lilo's behaviour.  Yes, Lilo was a brat.  Yes, she had a good reason, and yes, she was acting like a normal child.  Children go through all sorts of horrible things, and they react accordingly, often developing serious behavioural problems.  Lilo's springs from her parents' death and her and her sister's, as another reviewer put it, inability to recover from this grief.  A glance at the children on your own child's playground, even in the most upstanding of communities, presents an array of children, some with serious problems, even some children who are in trouble with the law or come from, god forbid, ""broken families.""  If I may interject here with my own opinion of Lilo, it is that I liked her; it was refreshing to see a Disney child who wasn't an upstanding citizen like the children from The Rescuers duo, Pinnochio, The Jungle Book, and the various animal children from movies like The Lion King, Bambi, and The Aristocats.  Lilo acted like a real child.  (Kudos to ""Treasure Planet"" for its portrayal of Jim as a juvenile ""delinquent"" as well.)<br/><br/>In conclusion, Disney has gone a great way and provided a film that, despite its science fiction backings, is quite a bit more real than other classics it's thrown our way.  True, there are instances that might be considered ""mushy,"" and there are instances that might baffle or frighten younger children, but overall there is very little cushion between the audience and the raw facts of Lilo's situation."

","Rating: U Stars:  Ving Rhames is the biggest name Theme:  Disney - says it all Language/Nudity/Violence:  comedy violence<br/><br/>""Ohana means family... family means, nobody gets left behind, or forgotten""<br/><br/>Yep, Disney has taken its family values and shoved them further down your throat than ever before.  The central message is the importance of family, no matter who you are or where you come from.  Lilo lives with and is cared for by her older sister, Nani, in Hawaii.  Stitch is an intergalactic killing machine who crash lands on aforementioned island.  After some typical Disney confusion and comedy timing (and some blind ignorance from the people running the dog pound), Lilo adopts Stitch. Cue the hilarity.<br/><br/>At least, cue the chuckles.  There are a few moments of laugh out loud humour, but generally its smile raising and appreciative giggles all the way.  The story itself isn't classic Disney, which is refreshing.  And the characters aren't typical beautiful Disney faces.  The women in the movie all have the kind of thighs that a New Zealand winger would be proud of and all the human characters have flattened Hawaiian noses.  Of course they are all cute, those animators aren't completely stupid.  Stitch himself is even quite loveable, despite being in need of serious orthodontic care.  And the setting lends itself to images vibrant with bright full colours, classic Disney more like Aladdin than Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>The animation itself harks back to classic Disney.  Perspective is considered greater than flashier effects.  The mind blowing three dimensional animation of Beauty and the Beast or Mulan isn't apparent for most of the movie.  It is used carefully to separate worlds and to add to the narrative the notion of differences and colliding cultures.  In fact it was the intelligence with which the movie was created which impresses more than the movie itself.  The prologue, set in a space craft and modern in its animation style, contrasts with the classic animation of the Earth scenes. On the few occasions when space craft are seen flying around Earth, the animation switches back to the modern rendering.  The perspective on Earth is that the viewer is looking up to everyone (which may explain the thighs). The only characters we can see eye to eye are Lilo and Stitch themselves - we are one of them, one of the family.<br/><br/>This is not the greatest Disney movie ever released, but its not the worst. It will probably spawn a snatch of straight to video sequels and make a fortune in merchandising this Christmas.  It will also earn many a boyfriend out there some extra brownie points as well.  This is a pleasant enough Disney film that won't offend anyone and won't seem like 90 minutes of your life wasted.  But don't expect a life changing experience, or even to spend too much time thinking about the film after you leave the cinema.  Perfect for a quiet night out.<br/><br/>Rating:  6.5/10 Who to go with:  Men, your girlfriend.  Women, your boyfriend (and he won't mind taking you either)"
"ufx187","7","3","4","3 August 2002"," Disney's back!
","Disney brings back watercolor backgrounds, not since 1941's Dumbo, in this stunningly-awesome looking animated movie. Even with that to boot, Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders managed to come up with a respectable plot that wasn't a complete rip off of E.T. (1982) or even, well, Mac and Me (1988). It's funny to see that the average person who doesn't enjoy any type of Disney production has been favoring this movie more than others, as I feel, it's a pretty nice step for the company. Disney goes flat-out to create a funny character put into a situation where only large laughs are going to occur. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) tried so hard to accomplish that, but fell just short of a home run. `Stitch' gets that extra foot or two.<br/><br/>After being created by a mad scientist named Jumba (David Ogden Stiers), Stitch (Chris Sanders) is immediately set aside as a misfit and ordered to spend his life on a remote asteroid. After finding his way to a spacecraft, Stitch outruns the galactic police and crash lands in Hawaii, where is wounded and treated in an animal shelter as a dog. The following day, Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a lonely and misunderstood young girl, arrives at the shelter to adopt a dog after her sister Nani (Tia Carrere) allows her to.<br/><br/>Along with the frustrating social worker Mr. Bubbles (Ving Rhames), Stitch proves to be too much for the sisterly duo. Their own relationship, scarred by the death of their parents, starts to fall apart. Lilo feels that Stitch is the only one who understands her, her sister just doesn't respect her anymore, and her peers don't seem to be accepting her at all. Two relationships in this movie are key, with Lilo & Stitch and Lilo & Nani. Acting as the stronger point, Lilo helps transform Stitch and Nani into different people with different priorities, the main one being family.<br/><br/>`Ohana,' which means `family,' seems to be one of the largest elements in this film. Being referenced numerous times by Lilo throughout the film, it eventually starts to grow onto Nani and Stitch, until they use it themselves by the end of the film to  well, you'll have to see it for yourselves. Reading some user comments on the film, it seems that most Hawaiians are glad that the message of `ohana' is being used, and the meaning is becoming known a little better. It's almost like if people in Japan made a movie and had the main character say `Yeah baby, yeah!' dozens upon dozens of times. It represents our great culture, so it feels good to let others know about it.<br/><br/>The comic character is there, the sappy child-left-behind character is there, the setting is there. Everything seems to be `there' for this really un-sappy (besides a few short moments) cartoon. Oh, and did I mention that this one is awesome enough to contain no please-cry-because-I'm-lonely songs sung by the characters? Just some good ole' fashioned Elvis playing. Even without the tunes, this movie would still be rock n' rollin'."

","At first, I thought that the guys at Disney were at a lost cause.  Allow me to recap...<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid was great, Beauty and the Beast was great, Aladdin was great, and The Lion King was great.  Pocahontas was a disappointment, The Hunchback of Notre Dame was okay, Hercules was a disappointment, Mulan was okay, Tarzan was an improvement (I haven't seen Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis: the Lost Empire yet), but when I heard of this new Disney animated flick called ""Lilo & Stitch"", I didn't know what to think of it.  The early promos didn't say anything much about the movie...just an 'inter-Stitch-al' where Stitch rips on ""Lion King"", ""Little Mermaid"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" (I got to see the 'inter-Stitch-al' on ""Aladdin"" on the Lilo & Stitch PlayStation 1 game)<br/><br/>Earlier in the summer, I took a ""beginning watercolor"" class for a painting credit and at one point my teacher discussed the watercolor style of 'Stitch'.  (First in 60 years-last was Bambi) It started growing on me until I finally said ""Oh, hell with it.  I'll see the movie!""<br/><br/>*basic plot ahead, small spoilers* When a diabolical space creature (codenamed 'Experiment 626', aka 'Stitch') is exiled from the Grand Council, he escapes in a squad cruiser and crash-lands on Earth.  There, a lonely 6-year old Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai, whose parents were lost to a car accident and is being raised by her 18-year old sister Nani are adjusting to this new lifestyle.  According to 'Cobra' Bubbles (a social worker who ressembles Shaquille O'Neal in shades), Lilo might be better in a foster home.  Lilo's not exactly the most popular girl on the block, so Nani figures she'll need a companion.  At the dog pound, Stitch is caught and poses himself as a puppy.  Lilo loves him, and takes him in, unaware he's on the run from Jumba (his creator) and Pleakley (an Earth 'expert') who are assigned to capture him.<br/><br/>The characters are a different bunch.  You'd probably expect Lilo to love Britney Spears (or any current trend), yet she's a fan of Elvis.  Stitch is Elvis, a B-movie monster, a superhero and an indestructible six-limbed alien.  (Chris Sanders' description) You grow attached to the two 'outcast' characters who wish for acceptance.  We can emphasize with Lilo's rejection in society,  you hope Stitch can get love and family that he's never had, and Nani's quest to keep Lilo in her custody (don't worry, it's not too preachy or sugary).<br/><br/>Stitch is the star of this movie.  You've just got to see his actions for yourself.  They're enough to make you explode laughing.  He's such a great character!  ('Blue Punch Buggy!' ^_^)<br/><br/>I'm probably going to believe the word 'ohana' will become a household word. It's not hammered in your skull, but 'Ohana means family' is used enough to get its point across.  The movie is very neutral about 'good' and 'bad' characters.  No one is murdered, seriously hurt, left in the dark, or abandoned.  It closes where you feel good about every character.  Even Jumba and Pleakley are treated fairly.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised by the enthusiasic reviews.  You can't help but love ""Lilo and Stitch"".<br/><br/>""Stitch"" is a 'hunka hunka burnin' love!' ^_^"

And don't be surprised if you laugh, too, maybe harder than your kids do.<br/><br/>Lilo is a tempermental 5-year-old being raised by her big sister Nani, who is constantly trying to keep social workers at bay and hang on to her job. Stitch is Experiment 626, a genetically-engineered destruction machine, bent on wreaking havoc and terrorizing big cities.  Thank goodness he lands on Kawai, a small island with small cities, and there is adopted by Lilo from the local animal shelter (he makes himself look like a dog).  The two bond instantly in much the same way toddlers bond into holy terrors when left alone together in playtime.  But along the way, Disney's familiar lessons of family triumphing over all play out in interesting and fun ways that your kids will love and you will even find yourself smiling knowingly over. There are too many clever allusions here to list:  MIB, Godzilla, tacky Polynesian tourist shows, Jaws, extreme surfers, and Blue Hawaii jump right out from the start and make things fun along the way.<br/><br/>This is the movie that with virtually no hype beat out MINORITY REPORT at the box office on Friday, 21 June, and with good reason.

","I have no idea what movie most of these reviewers saw, but it wasn't this one.  Before last night, the worst movie that I had ever paid money to see was the ""Joey Tribiane""-led Lost in Space.<br/><br/>Lilo and Stitch is worse.<br/><br/>This would have been a great 20-minute cartoon.  Stitch is an interesting enough character, and the family that he joins is very real, with real personalities and real problems.  Lilo acts like a real child, and her quirks are endearing.  Then the whole thing goes to H-E-double-hockey-sticks.<br/><br/>First of all, Disney's marketing force goes into full drive with the introduction of a couple of aliens who try to recapture Stitch.  They exist solely to sell toys.  They add absolutely nothing to the plot, and get very tired very quickly.<br/><br/>I can hear it now--""But it's an *adult* humor movie!""  First of all, part of this is correct, in that your children will probably not get much of this film.  The ""blue period"" that dominates the middle section of the movie is too heavy for young kids, and no, mouthing the catchphrases does not mean that your precocious little one gets it.<br/><br/>The worst thing, however, is its inability to decide how serious it wants to be.  The plot flies from serious, melodramatic ""After-School Special"" drama to slapstick so base that the Three Stooges wouldn't touch it in the course of about five seconds.  Plot holes were closed by what seemed to be the first suggestion (no matter how ludicrous) that flew out of someone's piehole in a boardroom.<br/><br/>I don't look for Hamlet when I go to a Disney movie.  I do expect, however, that the quality of the plot and story will surpass a undergraduate screenwriting class.  Lilo and Stitch doesn't even come close.  If you want to see a good Disney movie, then wait for Monsters, Inc. to come out on DVD, and save your money on this dog."
"ebayandersen","1","16","46","28 March 2004"," The worst animated film ever made by anyone, ever!
","Ever since I was young, I have always loved going to see Disney films at the cinema. Some have been incredible - Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, The Emporer's New Groove. Some have been very good - Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan. Some have been okay - Atlantis, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear. Some have been not very good (like Hunchback and Pocahontas) but with them, at least I could still sit through them without being offended or appauled. This is what I felt when I went to see Lilo and Stitch, and the brilliant ad campaign promised so much ...<br/><br/>There are dozens, even hundreds of things wrong with this film, and one thing right with it - Elvis songs.<br/><br/>Bad things ...<br/><br/>All the characters have the potential to be funny, but they either choose the wrong things to say, or say them the wrong way or in the wrong accent - this makes nearly every line painful to watch, and makes you want to kill the characters. And I mean that.<br/><br/>It's badly written - choppy, inconsistant plot, stupid dialouge (that bit at the begining when Lilo says something about her fish predicting the weather - what the hell was that!? I have never heard such an awkward silence in a cinema before.) Everything is twisted (not gracefully) to be about families, and worst of all, the characters are incredibly cruel to each other (for laughs, I felt) and never really turn around until the last two minutes. I thought these were flaws that were so blatant everyone would notice them. The little movie critic that lives in my head was screaming bloody murder.<br/><br/>Lilo is the worst child I have ever seen - she beats people up, (One of the most disturbing parts is when Stitch & Lilo shove a little girl off her tricycle and take off with it, leaving the little girl sobbing in the dirt. If you think that's funny, you have some serious mental problems.) She's annoying, she nails herself into rooms saying ""leave me to die"" (am I crazy, or is that not appropriate for a children's film?) She's annoyingly designed and voiced. You never, EVER feel ANY sympathy for her at all. I kept hoping this movie would have a happy ending in which Stitch would redeem himslef by doing the world a favour and rip Lilo in half like a phone book.<br/><br/>Nani is the worst care giver ever, and the family situation was a horrible scenario. The worst bit was when she's locked out and they're insulting each other ""I'm going to kill you"" ect. and then later they act like the closest of friends. Absolutely appauling! This film also has THE most blatantly saccharine family values quote ever ""Family means no one is left behind"" - not so much cheesy, as a chain of cheese shops, which just may have been ignorable had the characters had any sort of believable familile bond. But they didn't, which brought the film down several more notches.<br/><br/>Stitch is terrible, a destructive brat who (everytime we just about feel sympathy for him) blows up a house and starts off from square one. Annoyingly voiced and desgined (as pretty much everything is in this film) and with the huge plot hole (if he's adverse to water, why does he come into contact with it ALL THE TIME and live?) Well done, writers.<br/><br/>The aliens ... don't get me started on how annoying they were. No sense of good comiedic timing or delivery (or writing for that matter). Add to this, an ending which was stupid, forced, and convientley didn't make sense but tied thngs up. I have never left the cinema so disspointed. More than that, I felty angry that Disney, who I have grown up with and cherish have made something this terrible and actually think it's good. Treasure planet was heaven after this!<br/><br/>The moral this one left me with was ""Hey, it's okay to treat others like ... because Ohana means family."" - Sorry, I won't buy that. I'd strongly suggest parents read some proffessional reviews on this movie, there's a reason this movie hasn't made much money in comparison to the Disneys of the past. ""Hunchback"" and even ""Pocahantas"" grossed over $100 million more than this one, and at least they were boring but inoffensive. I hope that says something. In conclusion, avoid this festering turd of a film, and if you have it and like it, watc it again having read this and see if you can deny what I've said."

","This animated feature is a major step up from the studio's recent (and weak) films. Much better that Atlantis, Treasure Planet, and Emperor's New Groove. Though the story isn't as epic as the lion king or Little Mermaid, it is very entertaining and ever so adorable and very sweet. You can't argue with that! The animation, unlike some recent movies, is really in the classic style. It is absolutely beautiful; with watercolor backgrounds and hand animated water (instead of CGI). The character animation is very, very good; smooth and fluid (as smooth as any computer animation). The story is all about family and belonging, a little sappy sometimes, but good for kids and adults that don't mind feeling a little sentimental. Could be a little boring for some younger kids (not a whole lot of flashiness) but Stitch is a great and entertaining character.<br/><br/>This is one of the last hand animated movies we'll probably ever see. So sad; this movie's look is so ""warm"" and ""vibrant"" compared to the ""cold"" and ""plasticy"" look of the recent barrage of CGI animations.<br/><br/>Recommend highly."

When I watched it, I laughed when it wanted me to laugh, I sat on the edge of my seat(nearly falling off), and nearly started sobbing. This movie will make you feel whatever the heck it wants you to, but they're all enjoyable.<br/><br/>One part of it, where Lilo tries to teach Stitch to be an Elvis imitator, had me smiling constantly the entire way through. My cheeks seriously hurt when it ended.<br/><br/>Stitch is perhaps the most lovable little monster you'll ever see in a movie, and this Lilo & Stitch is perhaps one of the most lovable movies you'll ever see.

","This is a masterpiece of graphics, textures and plots. Very very nice. <br/><br/>I've grown up with Disney, as have most of us. And I've seen many of the Masterpiece collection, first hand on the big screen. <br/><br/>I am also a fan of Disney's non-Christian views and presentations of the world. They make you use that imagination, whether you want to, or not. They have a way of making a person face the harsh realities of life, and realize that life will go on; regardless. <br/><br/>They transport you, if only for a few moments, into another world, another place and/or another time. Not many movies really do that for you, but for me, Disney animations do. The good ones, that is.<br/><br/>I've yet to see a sequel of a Disney movie that was worth a penny of my money or a moment of my time. But in all fairness, I have yet to see Cinderella 2 and Lion King 2.<br/><br/>The graphics in this instant classic are absolutely beautiful, as are the textures and color blends. As someone who does computer graphics for my own site, I am truly in awe of the Disney animators who did Lilo and Stitch and dozens of other Disney animations. I have one question though. Where the heck were they when the sequel was being made? <br/><br/>Stitch is beautifully expressive both in animation and in voice. <br/><br/>That's something you totally lose in the sequel. Lilo's face is also expressively drawn and animated, something else totally obliterated in the sequel.<br/><br/>Also, I was very pleased that there were no ""Disney originals"" in the soundtrack. This soundtrack was dead ON for the movie. Thankfully, they didn't use the ""Beach Boys."" Wow! What a difference THAT would've made! (and for the worse, I do believe.)<br/><br/>This movie is wonderful entertainment, and instills a feeling of family, even when that family is self-made; self-""adopted"" people you just find and take into your life. <br/><br/>Wonderful message.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie.<br/><br/>It gets a 9.98/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend:."
"meeza","9","2","3","3 January 2003"," King of Disney Films!
","In cinema history there have been a few contrasting characters that have generated immense screen chemistry: `Martin & Lewis', `Nolte & Murphy', `Tucker & Chan' to name a few. The latest entry to this illustrious category is `Lilo & Stitch'. This amazing entertaining Disney film stars a Hawaiian orphan girl who befriends a ferocious alien creature. Lilo is an avid fan of Elvis Presley. Stitch is an avid fan of anything that has the capability of being torn to pieces. In other words, Stitch is no `hound dog'. Speaking of the king, Disney: I would like to `thank you very much' for inserting Elvis music into `Lilo & Stitch'. Lilo develops a `burning love' for Stitch even though he converts her house into a `break hotel'. Lilo's older sister Nina has the challenging duty of being Lilo's caretaker. Because she is a young caretaker, an exuberant social worker investigates Lilo's habitual situation. His `suspicious mind' makes him think that Lilo is not living in a suitable environment  because of Nina's unemployed situation and Stitch's anger management situation. He pressures Nina for the situations to change or he will `return to send her' a notice stating that she must `surrender' Lilo. At the same time, Stitch is `all shook up' when realizes he is being chased by aliens who have been instructed to return stitch back to his extra-terrestrial homeland. The one-eyed pursuant alien should have been instructed to have ` a little less conversation , a little more action'. `Lilo & Stitch' is by far my favorite Disney film. Some of you might say this is a bit of an overstatement and might inform me to `don't be cruel' to such Disney classics as `Cinderella', `Fantasia', and `The Lion King'. However, Disney is all about imagination and `Lilo & Stitch' is bombarded with it. So `if you are lonesome tonight', spend the evening with `Lilo & Stitch'. ***** Excellent"
"bix171","7","2","3","14 December 2002"," A Mixed Outcome
","One of the weirder Disney concepts: a genetically-mutated alien bent on destruction escapes to Earth, where he's adopted (as a dog) by a pair of orphaned sisters struggling to keep their family together. The younger sister, Lilo, is a friendless misfit, given to acting out rages stemming from parental abandonment and the bond she forms with her antisocial pet, Stitch, is natural, helping bind the family into a self-sufficient unit. (Her sister Nani's boyfriend David ultimately completes the set.) Perhaps the film's most interesting selling point is the elongated time it takes for the audience to develop affection for the characters; upfront, both Lilo and Stitch are maliciously irascible and the sentimental notions of family don't always seem to fit. (And the idea of Stitch's having no past--and thus no concept of family--due to his genetic engineering seems forced and oddly foreign.) But there are so many good absurdist comedy bits in writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' script that it's a relief when it loses its focus; when it doesn't have to be so ploddingly serious, it's very entertaining indeed. The setting is Hawaii, which means there are plenty of sunny color schemes in the animation; unfortunately, it's some of Disney's least interesting animation in years. The original songs by Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu are just as boring. But the tribute to Elvis Presley that serves as both a running joke and running commentary is a delightful stroke of genius and proves that Disney still has the chops to be the hippest animation team in the business."

","This is without doubt Disney's best in recent years.  I have nothing but praise for this film, and it finally seems that Disney is back on track. Whether or not they can keep it up remains to be seen, but Lilo and Stitch was worth every cent of admission and it will definitely be joining my DVD collection.<br/><br/>The animation is beautifully done, though the animators aren't trying to dazzle your pants off - it was refreshing.  But what really stands out about this film is both the story and the cast of characters.  The story sucked me in right from the start and I was more than happy to go along for the ride. This is thanks mostly to the characters.  They're all memorable and endearing creations, and for most of the film you will be cracking up in your seat at the onscreen antics.  While this film is aimed at kids (hello, Disney), don't let that put you off as adults will be just as entertained. I was even surprised at a lot of the humor, it didn't seem so childish as you might expect.  That said, it's not all hilarity and comic capers, the film does tackle some deeper issues and at times it's touching.<br/><br/>Two words.  See it."

","Lilo and Stitch is basically nothing special from my view; the alien Stitch is a cool character and having a setting in Hawaii is sharp, but this could also be the type of cartoon that if it didn't have the clout to be from Disney would be on during the day on Cartoon Network or other. Incidentally towards the end things in the movie get really inevitable, and almost sets it up for a follow-up to come on a TV series.  And yet, I liked the movie, and for the most part it kept me (a late teen just right out of seeing Minority Report) entertained which means it will be pitch perfect for kids and might envelop their parents with its humor (Elvis, MIB part 1, Godzilla and part of Jaws are referenced).

"pmcollectorboy","10","2","3","22 June 2002"," Worse than The Black Cauldron? HA!
","This movie reaffirmed my belief that the critics are nothing but a big bunch of paid-off, self-absorbed idiots. This is possibly the single most underrated animated movie ever created, surpassing a level of underratedness of even the great masterpiece of 1981, The Fox and the Hound. Lilo and Stitch is not merely a mild cartoon flick with Saturday morning level animation. This is an outstanding flick with gorgeous animation. It is bouncy, engaging, shockingly heartwarming and stunningly sincere. These are all traits I enjoyed in The Fox and the Hound that I find in few other animated movies. Here, there are no good guys or bad guys, just a group of characters, some realistic, others cartoony, playing out one of the most beautifully simple and simply beautiful stories I've ever seen in a Disney movie.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed an animated movie than didn't try to make a big deal out of everything, hence my love of The Fox and the Hound and now this movie. Not everything needs be laugh-yourself-silly funny. Nor does everything need to have slick computer graphics or obnoxiously detailed animation. Don't get me wrong, though, Lilo and Stitch has wonderful animation. It is reminiscent of the earlier days of Disney where the animation was simple yet fluid and beautiful and the backgrounds were joys to behold. Here, the backgrounds are watercolors, like in the Disney movies of old. While I have a small hunch a few computer graphics might have been used, mainly in this movie watercolor backgrounds were used where in any other animated movie, a computer generated image would've been used, and the result is a hundred times more beautiful and effective.<br/><br/>Some of the things I find fault with most of modern Disney after The Little Mermaid include sappiness, bad and overblown musical numbers, insistance on jokey humor, fake or set up climaxes, and an even bigger instance on putting said jokey humor inside a dramatic scene, weakening its impact and making it feel fake or set up. Lilo and Stitch has none of that. It's never sappy. There are no musical numbers other than Elvis songs, beautiful Hawaiian music, and a touching lullaby. The humor is very funny but character driven. The climax is very entertaining and exciting and nowhere near as ridiculous as many Little Mermaid era Disney fight or chase scenes, and there are no rude interruptions of unnecessary parts.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, you can take movies like Tarzan and Hunchback of Notre Dame and just flush them down the toilet. If you think the best thing to happen to animation in a while are movies like Shrek, Ice Age, or Monsters, Inc., guess again. This it right here. I doubt it will win Best Animated Movie at the Oscars, but not only do I feel it should win, but I also believe it should be the Best Movie of the year. While all the critics are going gaga over this year's loud and obnoxious action films, Star Wars Ep II included, Lilo and Stitch reaffirms basic values and never forgets true storytelling. To sum it up, if you only need to see one movie this year, see Lilo and Stitch. If you only need to see one animated movie this year, despite what critics like Berardinelli seem to think, skip Spirit and see Lilo and Stitch. I confidently call it the best animated movie anyone's ever done since The Fox and the Hound and deserves no less than a 10/10."

"Tweekums","10","1","1","24 June 2019"," Not your typical Disney animation but still great
","There are certain things one expects from classic Disney; beautiful princesses, handsome princes and characters who regularly break into song... one doesn't expect malevolent, genetically engineered alien creatures coming to Earth and befriending a girl who bites and punches her friends; that is what we get here though!<br/><br/>Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who lives with her sister, Nani; she is a real handful and social services are investigating to see if she should be taken into care. 'Experiment 262' is the alien creature that crashes to earth and is mistaken for a dog; it is taken to the pound and adopted by Lilo, who names him Stitch. At first he just sees her as something to put between himself and the two aliens sent to recover him but gradually they become friends and learns about 'ohana'; the Hawaiian family ideal. As the story progresses Stitch may cause trouble for Lilo and Nani but not through the deliberate malice he was designed for.<br/><br/>I must say this film was nothing like I expected... and it was all the better for that. I loved the fact that neither Lilo nor Stitch felt like typical Disney protagonists. Both characters get great introductions before being brought together. Their relationship develops well providing plenty of laughs. There are also many thrilling moments, but nothing too intense, as other aliens try to retrieve Stitch. The main pair after him are funny and even though one of them is the 'mad scientist' who created Stitch they don't come across as too unpleasant for younger viewers. While characters don't break out in song effective use is made of Lilo's love of Elvis's music. I really liked the modern Hawaiian setting; it made the human characters feel more real than those in most Disney cartoon. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of animation, whatever their age, who enjoy a good mix of humour and action."

","This is an amazing family film for many reasons and a great example of a movie that is enjoyable for the whole family. the movies main focus is on family and accepting new members into the family and losing the old. The directing of the movie is also pretty good take the beginning for example it starts with a close up at a low angle to show the power of the galactic chancellor then goes to a wide shot of the room to show the reach of the federation, the enemy stitch must confront, His escape then shows how he is a representation of chaos that is totally unstoppable, even picking the red police cruiser and wearing a red prison suit helps the representation since the color red is associated with violence. This is until he lands on hawaii and meets lilo. When stitch finds out he is trapped on the island his purpose and identity are destroyed in the process since he has always been unstoppable until this point where he has to question who he is and what to do now. Where as lilo who recently lost her parents is isolated from everyone else and hoping for a friend when she meets stitch. She tries to educate him and believes he is good despite the fact he uses her as a shield. Both of them are social outcast lilo having lost her family and stitch being a monster on the run. stitch enters the family like an adopted child and becomes a brother to lilo and the start to form a familial relationship. When gantu tries to abduct stitch but accidentally takes lilo, stitch is the one who gathers jumba and plekle to help and save the only family he has. The story for the movie has a certain depth that any good movie needs and is relatable to anyone to see. The movie has no real striking flaws that can make me dislike it and seeing it again after many years has been an unexpected treat."

","The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death (offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons (see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot (Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.<br/><br/>The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo & Stitch"" often feels like a live action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip). Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic, but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no real ""bad guys"" per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing their jobs)."

The music is great. It features a few songs from Elvis, and it has some great Hawaiian songs. The jokes aren't just chucklers they are jokes that will genuinely make you laugh even if you are an adult. Then there is the strong emotion about family. Lilo and Stitch was a sign of a great decade for Disney animation, but instead of making great movies they decided to rip off little girls with Hannah Montana, The Jonas Brothers, and High School Musical.

The almighty piece of artwork called Lilo and Stitch.<br/><br/>The film is a delightful sci-fi family film created by the Walt Disney Company shortly before their descent into Dumbville, population them. The film focuses on two unique characters; Lilo, a young lonely Hawaiian girl who is living with her older sister Nani who in turn in struggling to cope being a guardian since their parents died offscreen (what is it with Disney and killing off parents); the second is Experiment 626, a maniacal genetically-created alien who escapes imprisonment and goes on the run, crashlanding in Hawaii but due to be run over by a three trucks, he ends up in a dog shelter and is adopted by Lilo as a dog named Stitch.<br/><br/>Stitch at first uses Lilo as a shield to protect himself, but over time he learns the concept of ""Ohana"" - which means family, and family means that ""nobody gets left behind or forgotten"". Stitch turns from a destructive and cruel person into a courageous, caring and loyal figure. Lilo also changes to some extent. The film has a well-rounded amount of characters and each of them have a designated goal or desire and enough screen time. Lilo wants a friend, Stitch's motives change over time, Nani wants to be a good guardian towards Lilo, David wants to date Nani, the list goes on.<br/><br/>In regards to the villains, well there are two interesting things: There are effectively six villains in the film, but none of them are proper Disney Villains and wish to conquer the world or harm someone: Mertle is a typical bullying and pompous little girl who picks on Lola out of fear; social worker Cobra Bubbles is just doing his job despite wanting what's best for Lilo and Nani; Jumba and Pleakley are hunting Stitch for personal reasons; Gantu is doing his job too and sees Stitch as a threat to the universe; and the Grand Councilwoman is also doing her job for the greater good and protection of the universe.<br/><br/>There are many emotional and memorable moments throughout the film and reflects on the tale of the Ugly Duckling - Lilo, Stitch and other characters being outcasts and are brought together by Ohana and over such emotions. Each of the primary characters (Lilo, Stitch, Nani, Jumba and Pleakley) all have their own individual scenes alone or in the company of a close affiliated character.<br/><br/>My favourite is when Jumba observes Stitch and comments to Pleakley that he never created Stitch for a greater purpose other than to destroy everything and questions what it must be like not to have any memories or anything else to remember. There's a charming scene seconds later of Stitch looking around for something to do, and starts reading books, coming across the Ugly Duckling book.<br/><br/>There are many more great moments in the film, some comical (e.g. Stitch plays an Elvis song through his mouth) and musical numbers to enjoy. The last twenty moments goes into the traditional sci-fi wham-mo blammo, but the emotion is still there.<br/><br/>Like many Disney films I've seen, I highly recommend you view this film."

","One movie that I suggest to you is "" Lilo and Stitch"". This is anime. But everyone can enjoy watching this movie.Stitch, hero of this story, is invented by Dr.Janba experimented in gene. so, he is trial product No.626. Lilo lives in Hawaii with her sister Nani. Because they lost their parents. so, Nani decides to have a dog for Lilo. Lilo selects the dog in pet shop. The dog that Lilo selected is Stitch!!! Since then Lilo and Stitch live together. But Stitch doesn't know ""Ohana"" at all. It means ""family"" in Hawaii. so, Stitch is self-centered, and behave at the discretion of himself. At first, they aren't getting along with each other. While they live together, little by little, Stitch learn significance of Ohana, his whereabouts from Lilo.Many events strengthen relationship between Lilo and Stitch. They become precious friends!!!!! This is hart-warming story. so, I burst out crying.This is touching movie. After watching this movie, you will have a refreshing feeling. This is dubbed version, you can enjoy sound of their cute voice. The scene of this story is Hawaii. So, the heart that Hawaii cherish others is painted much in this movie. I think it is very good! But it is regrettable that this movie isn't quite painted about Hawaii. I want to pick up good point about Hawaii more! This movie will fascinate youâ˜†"
"I_am_Jacks_Revenge","10","1","1","11 August 2007"," I love this movie.
","This movie is one of the best Disney movies I've seen in a while. It's a part sad story if you think about it after watching it.<br/><br/>Plot: Experiment 626 has been deemed dangerous and his creator has been sentenced to prison, but 626 escapes from the Intergalactic space jury or something like that. I forget what they are called. So, he hijacks a spaceship, and heads off into space, only to crash on our planet Earth. The creator has been assigned to retrieve 626 and bring him back to them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on Earth (on one of the islands of Hawaii), there is a little girl named Lilo. She was just giving him a peanut butter sandwich. Apparently, the fish--his name is Pudge--controls the weather. She is like a social outcast because the other girls don't really like her. She lives with her sister Nani, who finds her sister listening to Heartbreak Hotel and the doors barred with wood and the door is locked (I like when she says in a depressed way, ""Leave me alone to die.""). A social worker named Cobra Bubbles has come to look over Nani and Lilo to see how their home is like. The problem is that if he's not satisfied, Lilo gets taken away from Nani. Nani gets one week. <br/><br/>One of my favourite parts is when Cobra says, ""Let's talk about you. Are you happy?"" Lilo says, with Nani assisting behind Cobra's back, ""I'm adjusted. I eat 4 food groups and look both ways before crossing the street. And take long naps... and get disciplined...?"" ""Disciplined?"" ""Yeah, she disciplines me a lot. Sometimes 5 times a day. With bricks."" ""Bricks?"" ""Yeah, and a pillowcase..."" Nani butts in, ""Okay, that's enough sugar for you... little cutie.""<br/><br/>When 626 lands on Earth, he doesn't know what will happen. He first gets hit by a truck. What a welcome, eh? He wakes up in a dog pound. Coincidentally, Lilo is there to get a dog. He has 6 legs, but he sucks in 2 to blend in. When she picks him, Nani and the store owner freak. ""Oh yes, all of our dogs are available...... EXCEPT THAT ONE!!!!!!!!"" ""What is that thing?!"" ""It's a dog.. I think. But it was dead this morning."" ""IT WAS DEAD THIS MORNING???!!!!"" ""We thought it was dead! It was hit by a truck!"" I love that part! Lilo calls him Stitch (which isn't a real name... in.... Iceland). Thus begins their adventures.<br/><br/>A very cool part was when Stitch was told to build something. So he took a couple of books and other materials and made something. ""Wow, San Fransisco.""<br/><br/>One of the sadder parts is when Lilo is talking to Stitch about her parents. ""It was rainy, and they went for a drive."" It was so...... sad. This was a really touching movie. I really liked it because of the funny parts and the sad parts. It really is about family and that they should always stick together. If you don't believe me, watch the movie and think about it."

","I stayed clear of Disney animated movies for a while, claiming I was 'too old for them' but I'm glad I gave this movie a chance, as it changed my opinion completely.<br/><br/>Lilo is just an adorable character. Some people love to love her, others hate to love her because she's so cute. It was obvious she was going to be able to teach Stitch the meaning of Ohana, especially as she'd lost some of hers already.<br/><br/>Pleakly and Jumba are the perfect comedic element to this movie, following the double team of Lilo and Stitch.<br/><br/>The underlying things adults and teenagers can see is the intervening of social services, in the form of Cobra Bubbles - in most Disney movies, they'd carry on living together, despite how hard life would be, but this movie addresses the more serious side to things, and I liked that - it made the movie seem more real."

","Well, the cover of the DVD doesn't lie. ""Funny, sassy, and original."" This movie is bound to stay in your DVD collection for a long time. Let me explain why...<br/><br/>You see, Stitch (aka Project 626) is an alien who was created by a scientist as an experiment on a faraway planet. The scientist was charged in a sort of galaxy court on this planet for created him with traits that posed as a threat to the population of this planet. Before he gets charged, though, ""Stitch"" breaks free and runs rampant out of the court taking a spaceship into space and heads directly for Earth. The scientist and one of the court-ordered officials must go back to Earth to retrieve Stitch, but all sorts of trouble breaks out when Stitch lands in the backyard of a Hawaiian girl, Lilo, and her sister. They adopt Stitch as a ""puppy"" and keep him safeguarded in the house until CIA agents and the aliens try and take him back.<br/><br/>That's a very complex story for a child to fully understand, but it was definitely worth the fun of seeing these new characters on this DVD. Throughout the film, the characters have a fixation with Elvis (for whatever reason) and are always getting into hijinks with Stitch's childish ways. Think ET with a more complex story.<br/><br/>I gave it a standard 7/10 stars for it's potential for children to love it, it's complexity and originality, and Disney's reputation for making truly classic animations for these complex stories. That was another point that I was surprised about: the animation. Everything flowed so easily and effortlessly that it seemed like it took 500 people to make this movie possible. Leave it for the brilliant Disney team (which may get overlooked, like I originally did, because it is a standard Disney-esque look to the characters and everything) to turn these Hawaiian profiles into something magical and beautiful. Good work to you at Disney for creating some truly inspirational accomplishments."

This movie touched me. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater we saw it at. Though this movie isn't very strong, the storyline means well and conveys a cute message of family and love.

Of all their efforts from the last couple of years, this is one of the better ones.<br/><br/>Of all the Disney movies this is probably the most ""adult"".

It's pretty heavy stuff and it goes about some serious issues and shows the value of family. I like the way the story is brought.<br/><br/>But luckily it's not all serious, there is still lot's of fun and things to laugh about. There are some typical Disney characters that provide some comical situations. I especially like the Cobra Bubbles character voiced by Ving Rhames.<br/><br/>There is a good balance between the serious and funny scene's. The seriousness never ruins the fun and the funny scene's never ruin the serious situations. Perfect match!<br/><br/>The style is cool and the pace is fast and the Hawaiian locations are beautiful.<br/><br/>However the story line is a bit too simple and some of the situations and scene's are a bit too crazy and forced. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, still very entertaining and it has a good and important message in it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","For most part 'Lilo & Stitch' is just a lot of fun. The story about an alien who is created by an alien-scientist as a monster but slowly turns out good in the hands of a little girl on earth is perfect to show all that fun. Lilo is one of those characters from the great creators from Disney that you will remember. Almost every modern Disney film has one of those characters, but mostly they are the villains (Ursula, Jafar, Scar). This time it is one of the good leading characters. He has so many funny moments.<br/><br/>Again a Disney film you can enjoy with the whole family, and probably adults will even like it better. I enjoyed it very much."

Granted, a movie about a six limbed alien with bad manners did seem to be a pretty odd subject matter, I can honestly say that Disney hit a home run and left me ""all shook up""  Okay okay so I used an Elvis pun, but in reality this film used many elvis songs in its soundtrack which was very well utilized.<br/><br/>Setting the film in Hawaii with the beautiful scenery and almost magical atmosphere left me with a feeling that I was really in our 50th state.

"kkooper","Null","1","1","18 April 2003"," surprising hit
","Considering that the Disney corporation has in recent years downsized its traditional cell department for computer animation, it is a relief that ""Lilo and Stitch"" did as well as it did with such a bold style.  The film is a radical departure from the traditional Disney formula.  Unlike past films there are no cute cuddly mascot-like side characters like Abu (Aladdin) or Meeko and Flit (Pocahontas) to muddle up the plot or steal the comedy. The laughs are completely owned by the main players --- Dani, Lilo, Stitch, et al.  Also refreshing is the bold anime-like style that is used by the studio.  It has been a long time ---at least since the 1940s that the Disney Corporation has chosen such a direction and it works so well here.  The lush colours and the lack of details (which reminded me more of the latest selection from the Legend of Zelda than it does of Disney) was refreshing. Also bold was the setting --- science fiction is very a-typical of tradional Disney fare).  The characters were also different as is the direction of the plot.  I almost expected a different ending to this picture but Disney remained true to its traditions --- at least in this one respect. Although this film might be seen in the future as perhaps the death knell of cell productions, (and I hope this is not the trend) what a masterful close to an era it makes."

","I have never seen people's opinions so polarized on a animated feature as I have with Lilo & Stitch. As one who found this feature hilarious, touching, smart, bold (for Disney), true-to-form, gorgeous, and a joy to watch, I can't begin to understand how anyone could be in the opposing camp. And as a native Hawaiian myself, I find it interesting that the only people who found it culturally offensive--some whom I know personally--are non-Hawaiians. Why, a reader asks, is everyone drawn with fat legs? Because some (not all) Hawaiians have thick legs (especially calves). It's refreshing to see these artists and animators unafraid to portray (again, some) local people as they really look. Why does Lilo immediately pounce upon a girl and start beating her up? Because sometimes haoles (an absolutely non-derogatory term for caucasians) are outspoken and don't think about the consequences of their words. Funny how Lilo's character is berated for her actions yet no one says a word about the girl who blurts ""you're crazy!""<br/><br/>My advice: Don't let the negative comments expressed by some viewers deter you from watching this refreshingly different and well-crafted animated feature.

Other than that, I'd say this one was a winner.<br/><br/>First off, Stitch is the cutest original character since I can remember. (Yea, I'm a heterosexual adult male saying this, but I'm giving credit where it's due.) Maybe it's the fact that he's not a typical cutesey teddy bear, but a bit of a punk in a Disneyfied version... but that's ok cause it still works. Example: Seeing him with the cape and bra at the end credits is both funny and an ""awwww"" moment.<br/><br/>Lilo comes off as a brat I'd love to smack upside the head a few times (and the way that Nani deals with her is great too)... but then you start to pretty much identify with her when Stitch comes along and all is well again. Dr Jumba and Pleakley are great characters and funny, not irritating (as some Disney comic reliefs are)...<br/><br/>The previews for the movie (that you can see on the DVD) are hilarious as well, and it's good to see that not all of Disney is so incredibly PC and sugar-coated... (Stitch steals Aladdin's girl: funniest thing I've seen from Disney in years)<br/><br/>And also, it's rather moving (at times) for a Disney movie, so all in all, seems like good fun for all ages as long as you give it a chance...

","One fact is certain, Disney has Mickey's fingers on the pulse of society. Occasionally after a few child adoring epics such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King, Disney will create a hilariously quirky feature or featured character for those of us who love to laugh. Timone & Pumba ignite the screen during the somber moments in LK, Robin Williams' Genie steals the light from Aladdin's lamp and then comes Stitch. <br/><br/>
Disney trudged through the mud in the late 1970's and early 1980's until the masterful and completely underrated Great Mouse Detective.  The grand comedic timing and talented cast allowed the Mouse to expand his horizons. Lilo & Stitch is the benefactor of that expansion.<br/><br/>Stitch is known as ""Experiment 626"" on his home planet and is sent into exile.  Through some bungling, he arrives on Earth where he disguises his crude body to look somewhat like a canine.  The lonely and obtuse orphaned girl Lilo adopts him and true mayhem ensues.  <br/><br/>The relationships are portrayed beautifully from the big sister/little sister angle to the transformation of Stitch from monster to family member. The jokes are hysterical albeit mature, the character development is superb and the animation breathtaking.  <br/><br/>This isn't Bambi.  If you want Dumbo, rent it.

A giant alien is told to read the charges, and he announces that the chubby purple alien has been accused of experimentation on a genetic level. It is announced that they believe he had created something, and a covered floating platform rises a few feet to the chubby alien's side. It is revealed under the covering a blue, 2-armed alien with large blue eyes, huge ears, and a smirk on his face.<br/><br/>
Lilo & Stitch follows the adventures of two beings who meet up. Lilo is a 6-year-old depressed Hawaiian girl who listens to Elvis. Indeed, after the action-oriented introductory first 10-minutes, we do feel more than a little heartbroken for a while. She has no parents, and her sister, although good at taking care of her, does have some bad luck with a certain day and a certain man sent to check in on them.<br/><br/>Stitch is the experiment. Made to be destructive, he lands on Earth after a daring escape(or a lucky escape, whatever your look)and starts going through some tough times when he finds Hawaii has no large cities.<br/><br/>After an hour, Stitch is in Lilo's care in a last ditch effort for Lilo to stop being depressed in front of the service man, named Cobra Bubbles. With nothing to destroy, Stitch must look for the next greatest meaning he can find. That, is the center of this story: family.<br/><br/>Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten.<br/><br/>Stitch turns to a very short version of The Ugly Duckling in a Nursury Rhymes book, and starts relating to the lost bird.<br/><br/>Finally, many aliens sent to capture Stitch, or Experiment 626, meet up, in a grand explosion, a serious time, and a slightly confusing action battle.<br/><br/>Stitch, who had brought in his alien features to slightly resemble a dog, does eventually grow on you, he's super cute by the end, and you're happy to know a second movie, more of a prequel, is being made probably featuring the little guy. And you gotta love his voice. It is forgotten in a 50 minute period of growling, but you won't not be able to hear it enough eventually.<br/><br/>Lilo, though amusing, seems to be missing something, yet she is enough for one movie.<br/><br/>The first exclusively water-colour background Disney movie since Dumbo looks amazing, if you are slightly put off by the cartoonish look. The emotion and story is far beyond anything expected, especially for a Disney movie. And, though some seems trailed, the actual execution of the plot is almost up to it's fullest, with a few tweaks here and there. And I do want to see Stitch again, if not Lilo."

","Okay, this movie has child-care service, broken home, parents death, problem child, fugitive on the loose... and it's a cartoon comedy made by Disney. I know that Disney is capable of being violent. After watching Mufasa died, ocean of corpses in Mulan, and Clayton from Tarzan got lynched, Disney no longer have to prove itself. But it's not that Lilo and Stitch is violent. It just deals with too serious subject matter to be a cartoon show. This is the kind of movie parents and adult would enjoy. But other than few physical humor, I do not see how kids can appreciate this movie. The movie may depress them even more. I felt very depress with the story. Dont' get me wrong, it's a well crafted, complicated domestic drama. But usually when i pick up Disney like The Emperor's New Groove or Little Mermaid, I want to relax and enjoy myself. With Lilo and Stitch... I just feel depress. It used to be that Disney film let us see through the eyes of kids looking up at the adult world. Now it's reverse. Even though there are children in the movie, Nani(the older sister) seems to be the central character and the one that the viewer can relate to the most, not Lilo (the problem child) and Stitch. So if you are a kid... you can't relate to anybody in the movie (well, if you are wild, may be Stitch). As serious as it is, you got to hand it to Disney though. When it meant to be funny, it is EXTREMELY funny. I give this movie 10/10."

I think everyone involved in putting together a full-length, animated Disney feature is passionate and talented enough to move into the 21st century while keeping a firm grasp on the old-fashioned Disney flare.  This movie was pure proof of that!  Don't get me wrong. The fairy tales that Disney has already chosen like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast are cherished classics and always will be.  The animation and Hawaiian music in Lilo and Stitch are very beautiful.  This one is a must for everyone!  Make sure you don't miss it!"

","That's a list of just a few of the words that come to mind when I consider this movie.  It's an absolutely delight to watch.  Though essentially a children's movie, I see no reason why an adult can't enjoy it.  There's plenty of subtle humor.<br/><br/>This movie simply has everything.  Though ""ohana"" is repeated a few too many times, one can't help but appreciate the message.<br/><br/>These are also some of Disney's more interesting characters.  What other Disney movie has an evil alien and a girl that makes voodoo dolls?<br/><br/>The animation is exceptional.  It has a bit of computer to give it that nice, modern look, but for the most part, this is the classic hand-drawn stuff.<br/><br/>""Lilo & Stitch"" is certainly one of Disney's better movies."

It has laughs, tender moments and lots of great sci fi action.  I was very impressed by the sci fi at the beginning.  Stitch started out as a CHUPACABRA but eventually was a very tender loving pet who found his family as humans in Kauai (this place I have been).

","I've always been a fan of animated Disney families.  But even my stubborn attachment has not blinded me from the harsh fact that the films have been going downhill for sometime now with only a very few pleasant surprises.<br/><br/>When I first saw trailors for this movies, I wanted to see, despite the nagging voice in my head that said it might not be that great.  When it came out, I was met with plenty of great reviews.  Unfortunately, my little college town is not known for a plethera of movie theatres, so summer passed and so did this film from theatre to video/DVD.  When a friend purchased the DVD, only then did I get to see it.<br/><br/>What a gem! This twisted and poignant little tale is truly worthy of the name of Disney.<br/><br/>The story itself is surprisingly clever and original.  That imagination alone is enough to love this movie.  Then the makers go throw in a bunch of delightfully varying and quirky characters, plenty of humor, and more charm and heart than should be legal.  You are able to understand the characters, know them, and, most of all, love them.<br/><br/>This isn't just quality entertainment.  There are several great messages on the importance of family, no matter the kind, and redemption. That's something Disney rarely shows: Most of its heros are heroic at the beginning.  Yeah, the learn something and grow a little bit, but not to the extent of Stitch, Lilo, and Nani.  Stitch begins the movie as an evil and chaotic little alien.  Lilo is a twisted little child who could have grown up to be the next Carrie.  Nani is hardly the typical Disney female with her temper, frustration, and disorganization.  But even as the characters learn and grow, you love them for exactly who they are.<br/><br/>The animation is to be appreciated.  It's a tribute to classic Disney hand-drawn animation, with just a touch of computer to give it that nice edge and finish.  Add plenty of Hawian color, and you got a film that is just great to stare at.<br/><br/>I don't know where Disney's been hiding for so long, but I'm glad it decided to crawl out and start actually working under its reputation.<br/><br/>This movie is with Disney's finest.<br/><br/>(I'm also happy to say that this film was not a one-time thing. I had the pleasant opportunity to see ""Treasure Planet"" last week. It's also top-notch.)"

","This is one of the most original, cutest, funniest Disney movies I've ever seen.  It's such a great, refreshing movie from Disney.  It's not a fairy tale, not a sequel, not someone else's movie redone.  A very original cast, including the cutest non computer child (right with Boo from Monsters Inc.) and the nastiest little alien ever created.  Stitch is the most rotten little cartoon character you've ever seen.  Until Lilo gets a hold of him. It's amazing to watch this movie, and see the relationship unfold in front of you.  He goes from being that mean, evil little guy, to the most cuddly, lovable creature ever put on film.  The Elvis references, the lush Hawaiian scenery, the music, everything screams fun, and beauty.  If you would like to show a movie to your child about the values of friendship, or if you would just like to be entertained by one of the most quality cartoons ever created, this is exactly the movie for you."
"jeev7882","7","1","1","4 December 2002"," ...worthy of the Disney name
","Lilo and Stitch was worthy of the Disney name that spawned the most glorious age of hand drawn animation. I must concede that I am a Disney Freak. I am a big fan of the movies, theme parks, collectible items, and other such things. Still, I like to think of myself as an objective reviewer because I do not like everything that Disney throws at the big screen, especially more recently. Lilo and Stitch did have a tendency to get over emotional and corny at times by trying to pound in the theme that ""Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind."" This statement was repeated over and over by our protagonists throughout the movie. Is it important? Sure. The lesson for youngings is to never to give up on someone because they are different and that family is very important. Aside from the traditional themes, this movie was a fun kids movie whose tone was just right for its target audience.<br/><br/>Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/lilo-and-stitch/ to read the complete review!"
"dballred","9","1","1","31 October 2002"," At Last: A Full-Dimension Disney Character
","This is the best Disney product since Pinocchio--thanks largely to the depth of the main human character, Lilo.  The Disney studios have a particular affection for the one-dimensional character--and this film is no exception. In this case, as opposed to the disappointing Atlantis epic, the technique works as it should--because most of the characters are from the same ethnical background.  Lilo, however, is the aspect of this film elevating it above the other modern Disney animations. She can't be described by one word or even by the 1000 words allowed for this review.  Stitch, her mutant space-pet, is pure Disney and pure fun, following the edgey smoke trails and paw tracks of Aladdin's Genie or Mulan's Dragon.  I heartily recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it solely because he or she has given up on Disney. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10."
"Firework022187","Null","1","1","21 October 2002"," Awesome!!!
","I can say nothing but good things for this movie! This is possibly one of Disney's best movies ever. The idea of having an antihero was a bold step for Disney, but definitely a brilliant one. Although Stitch may not possess the best qualities, you still fell in love with him and felt for Lilo and Stitch and how hard Lilo tried to change him. I loved the idea of having Lilo be like an outcast. The dialogue and gestures really made you feel during this movie. Most movies that are supposse to be sad just make you feel irritated, and most movies that are funny just make you feel bored, but this movie makes you feel the emotions they are trying to convey. When Lilo is sad, you feel sad. I would give this movie a 10/10!!!!!!"
"simian123","9","1","1","9 October 2002"," Thank the good lord Disney hit the Jackpot!!
","This is by far one of the best Animated Disney films to date.  Asaid from the typical Disney ""family is where the home is"", this is very entertaining. In every Disney film there is always a character which is trying to be a cute little ball of fluff, and this is no exception.  Except fo the fact that the cute creature is a weapon of mass destruction with a blue car and a chain saw.  The plot is slow to get going but once it pick up you'll be fully engrosed in it.  Jokes in the movie are fresh and won't date with time.  Suffice to say, ""oh good, my dog found the chainsaw"" is one of the memerable parts of the film.  Strangly origonal with a hint of Disney magic that makes this film a must see for people of all ages, if you do not agree take what sense of humour you have and trade it in for Lilo and Stich."

","Sequels aside, you can tell that Disney put alot of effort into their movies. It shows, too, in movies like the Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan... Lilo & Stitch is no exception.<br/><br/>When I first saw a clip of the movie, I thought it was going to be Disney's worst. Disney did not put too much effort into that clip. Then came the teasers, then I knew the movie was going to be good. The teasers were the first that caught my eye. Then came the word of mouth. ""Did you see this movie yet?"" ""That movie's really good."" ""It's almost too good to be Disney."" Once I saw it, it was higher than my already high expectations.<br/><br/>I was expecting another Emperor's New Groove (which I also enjoyed), but what I really saw were movies that Disney had given us before. Movies that actually have themes.<br/><br/>This isn't too good to be Disney. This movie is what Disney is all about, and it's a movie that I'm sure Walt would be proud of. Sure, the alien thing might make it look like some kind of plotless story that makes sure the audience is laughing too much to notice, but it's not. This movie, as different as it looks, is much like the Disney movies we've grown up with. I rank it up there with the Lion King, Pocahontas, Aladdin, etc. because it deserves to be in those ranks. <br/><br/>The animation isn't revolutionary like Final Fantasy, but the movie is really good."
"Loz8","Null","1","1","3 October 2002"," Wonderfully Imperfect
","I went to see Lilo and Stitch yesterday. Let me tell you straight off, it was worth the admission fee. Every single cent. <br/><br/>I was amazed at just how different, refreshing and enchanting this film was. It is not only set in a location never used by Disney before but has a style of animation that is not only beautiful but interesting. There are no perfectly proportioned faces or bodies, even in the humans. I'm not going to say that the characters look realistic, but they are a lot more realistic than Snow White and Belle in their simple imperfection. <br/><br/>
There are no Disney musical numbers, not typical ones, anyway, and this seemed right. It would have been disheartening to grow to understand, perhaps love these characters and then see them launch into a verse of ""a whole new world"". <br/><br/>From the beginning you could tell this was not going to be a normal Disney film. Apart from the straight-to-video release of ""Buzz Lightyear"", this was Disney tackling something they had never done in a film before. Extra Terrestrials. <br/><br/>These new characters and characterisations are astounding. Hilarious. Well crafted and well executed. Who wouldn't be scared of the Captain voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson (seriously, you should hear that man roar...  it is terrifying). Who wouldn't find Stitch (Chris Sanders) offensive yet funny?<br/><br/>
I thought the voice acting was brilliant and I am very impressed with Lilo's voice artist Daveigh Chase who has also done the voice of Chihiro in the American dub of ""Spirited Away"". <br/><br/>The animation is beautiful. I have never been to Hawaii, but now I have a determination to go. The backdrops, the characters, the way they move. It is all unique to this film. <br/><br/>The storyline is well developed, simple to understand and the themes surrounding it are obvious. Love. Friendship. Family. Community. No-one gets left behind. These are integral to the spell which Lilo and Stitch casts on you whilst watching. I didn't look at my watch once, and even if I'm enjoying a film, I usually do. <br/><br/>The film follows Lilo and her sister Nani as they try to keep their family together whilst contending with not only interstellar nuisances but social services authority, Mr Bubbles (Ving Rhames). I won't give any more away, because, let's face it. Everyone else has anyway. <br/><br/>I didn't think I would say this about a Disney feature again, what with half-thought-out sequels being released every which-way, but this film deserves 10/10. Go buy your ticket today!"
"jinky","Null","1","1","25 September 2002"," Disney's best in a long,long time
","It was a fantastic decision for the animators to do watercolor! It really captures the beauty of Hawaiian beaches and its landscape. The characters Lilo and Nani are so REAL, and there are some truly hilarious moments, one of which is the scene where Lilo was on the floor mouthing the lyrics of Heartbreak Hotel while Nani was trying to get into the house. The movie loses some of its ambience towards the end, when the alien leaders reappear, and you are somehow reminded that the producers must have decided to throw in some elements to make the movie more commercial and marketable. Still,I give Lilo and Stitch a rating of 9/10."
"orangecatdancing","10","1","1","20 September 2002"," my faith in disney is reaffirmed
","let's face it, disney films were becoming a bit stale.  while everybody was raving about the cgi masterpieces toy story and monsters inc, i was hoping for a return to classic disney animation.  although atlantis: the lost empire was a valiant effort at trying something new, a musical number-less jules verne-ian adventure, it still lacked a certain sense of disney spirit. lilo and stitch has brought that back.  although it still retains traditional disney ideals, it is irreverant and cheeky. lilo and stitch are not the classically endearing characters from the mould of ariel and belle, and we can breathe in relief from that.  it is because of their lack of social graces that we love them more, they seem all the more real to us.  what adult, looking back, cannot remember a period of their life when they felt just as isolated and unhappy as lilo, and needed a friend like stitch to bring them back from the brink again? the animation is beautiful, and the location of hawaii and the hawaiian people also bring a fresh perspective to this movie. the soundtrack of elvis presley songs make a surprisingly effective backdrop to the story. i cannot heap enough praise on this film, but shudder at what the inevitable video sequels might do to ruin this classic."

But when 626 did alive to earth and was becoming shooting at the rain drops than suddenly movie was getting to a funny point. Afterwards the funny thinks were coming after each other for example: when the dogs were afraid of Stitch or when David burnt himself. The most important thing was that it also had education behind it. Everyone should have a family. I like the scene when Stitch realizes that by looking at lonely duck. The action scene was also great at the end of movie. Let the evil lose again!Overall the movie was great but Disney had much better movie!<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10"

What it does accomplish is good, clean, fun entertainment for children AND adults alike in one movie (toss in a few family value lessons, too); something I have yet to seen accomplished in the Summer of 2002. That's all you could really want and Disney does it with good style with nothing over the top.

This film strayed from the formula that has made most of Disney's recent films boring.  <br/><br/>The characters of Stitch and Lilo are both adorable but not bland and goody goody.  However, I was not impressed with the other alien characters and David.  I think the beginning of the movie could of also used some work.  The quality of the film drastically improved once Stitch was in Hawaii. Still, ""Lilo & Stitch"" is the best animated feature in a long time."

","First of all, bravo to Disney for bringing something so REAL world and REAL time to the big screen focusing on something that we all truly need, a reality check on the importance and value of ""family"" ( ""Ohana"" ). Bravo to this gem of a movie, destined to be a classic for it's humor, but especially for its message that it gets across with such clarity and deeply charged emotion, and I mean, EMOTION ! A characteristic of real true Disney fashion. I've seen it three times, and there are quite a few deep moments that bring a definite lump in the throat and mist to the eye. Believe me, if there is any person whose heart is not touched in any way in the way this movie intends to do, or if there is no positive effect felt by that person's heart from this movie, then there must truly be something not right with that person's heart. And bravo to all those that gave this movie AT LEAST 4 stars ( maximum of 5 from the other review board from where this review came from).<br/><br/>Bravo to anyone giving this movie at least 8 stars on this review board. Anything less means you're not looking deep enough into the work that went on behind the scenes and in the hearts of all those who made this movie possible. The majority of the raves and reviews reflects only part of the reason why there will be a sequel made for VHS/DVD for TV for next year as well as a TV series and then a second sequel in 2004. If anyone cannot get the message that this film is trying reach out to you with, then you're can't be looking for the right thing. I give Lilo & Stitch my max - 10 stars Also to you Ronzo-4 whose review I read - Bravo to you for seeing exactly what the writers, producers, directors,and all involved wanted you to see, and feel. As you quoted from the movie, ""Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. Or forgotten"". ( You forgot that end part Ronzo - no problem )A message that we really need to give a greater re-awakening to on its value, importance, and power, and all that it embodies. One of love's greatest symbols has to represented in the meaning of Ohana / Family. And from what research the writers Sanders and Deblois did in Hawaii /Kuaii, uncovered what they testified to be very STRONG community / family ties in that area. What an example to write into this movie. And it is also great to see how they honored the Hawaiian culture properly in the artistry, the music, the characters in this movie. Using what they termed as colorwashing the Hawaiian scenery in watercolor did bring back a 60 year old style not seen since days of Dumbo, Pinnochio, and Bambi. All in all this movie will go on and further in its theming, and future continuation through sequels and tv series, & franchising, all rooted in the memories that this original has placed deeply enough into all those who loved enough to create it for all the right reasons, and all those who loved enough to hear what it has to say. COWABUNGA Disney - COWABUNGA Stitch !"

Fake Pidgin accents are too easy to pick up for any one that's ever spent more than a year in Hawaii.  Too often the fake pidgin accent will ruin a movie.<br/><br/>Accents aside, the movie really captures the feel of Hawaii.  The first scenes with Lilo swimming with the fishes and the Kamehameha Childrens Choir singing made me misty eyed (and I almost bought a ticket to go back home to Hawaii immediately).<br/><br/>If you are from Hawaii and you have your doubts because so many movies in the past have horrible portrayals of Hawaii and Hawaiians . . .

It's not necessarily better than the three I mentioned, and definitely not better than the ones Walt made, but this one is definitely the one that would have made Walt proudest (except Beauty and the Beast, which I'm sure he was looking down and proud of). I can not think of a time when I did not like any part of this movie. In fact I cried when I saw this with my 11 year old niece, who loved this far more than I did, which is funny cause we don't usually agree on animated films.<br/><br/>One thing I rolled my eyes about was the overkill of pop songs, though the Elvis ones did have relavance to characterization at least. *shrugs* I still prefer score over pop. At least the score was better than Menken's atrocity he calls score (though Hercules is an exception), but I would rather James Newton Howard bring the same score magic he brought to Atlantis and Dinosaur, here.

This is a pretty good movie, as cartoons go. Stitch is great, Lilo (finally) is a bad girl with no excuses save a raging temper (inherited along with her sister's). The side characters are good, if a flinch underdeveloped, even if the chief inspector looks a bit ""Men In Black"" (willingly, i hope). And most of all - NO BAD GUYS! Finally Disney grasped the idea that everyone is good and bad at times or - as they say - everyone has his moments. The humor is good and, i suspect, heavily inspired by Calvin & Hobbes - the ""San Francisco"" scene appears IDENTICAL in a strip and the temper and drawing tastes of Lilo are very much alike to Calvin's. The weak point is the hurriedness of plot in the very end - make it 10 minutes instead of 2 and it would still have been fresh, maybe with some flashback. Oh, and stay for the credits - worth it."
"movieman1969","7","1","1","29 June 2002"," good family film- a little odd,though
","LILO & STITCH is a pretty good family film, but it's definitely different from your traditional Disney animated films. If that's what Disney was going for, then I feel they succeeded 100%. The biggest element of the film that grabbed me wasn't the STITCH character, but LILO and her sister. I found their story to touching and endearing. The aliens looking for STITCH story line was a bit of a beating for me. Overall=7 out of 10. Let me also mention, since this an animated movie, that once again the animation was very good. Nobody does it like Disney."

I think that this movie is one of the best Disney movies, after seeing Monster's Inc. I thought that there wouldn't be more great movies like that but I was wrong and here's the proof ! The movie is great and the animation is the best! Disney really knows how to make good movies! A+"
"Fil-5","Null","1","1","20 June 2002"," One of the best movies in Disney history.
","Disney made this movie fearing that the animation genre was dying, being replaced with the often more popular CGI genre.  In response to this fear, Disney made a move they have never tried before.  They made a movie that can only be referred to as vulgar, violent and somewhat abusive.  And guess what....  It Works!!!  Disney has finally let go of their attempt to make kid friendly, childish movies which spawned disappointments like Dinosaur, and moved in the direction that Shrek made: lets make a movie that parents can enjoy as much as their children do. The result is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies in the long line of Disney pictures, one that puts together a perfect blend of comedy, sorrow, and warmth.  This movie is definitely one I'd recommend. I got into this movie with a special screening pass, but I'd more than happily pay to see it again...even at today's ridiculous prices.<br/><br/>9/10 if not higher."

","An entertaining animated offering from the folks at disney. This one features a crazy space mutation that crashes in hawaii and winds up being taken in (and mistaken for a dog) by a young hawaiian girl. While not overly original, this one gets points for capturing the lifestyles of hawaii fairly well and for being mostly entertaining. GRADE: B+"
"abyman","10","1","1","27 June 2002"," Now that's the way Walt would have done it...
","Finally a plot and story that's worthy of the Disney name. It seems the Bountiful Valley had gone dry after Lion King, with the exception of the wonderful work at Pixar. Lilo & Stitch, with the exception of the PG rating due to the alien content and the more realistic approach to ""real"" life, was undoubtedly a reawakening for the Buena Vista studios. It was wonderful to see real everyday characters intermixed with the fantasy of alien culture. The values of true family themed throughout, even with the typical poor little troubled girl of Disney plot chemistry. Snow white, Cinderella, Ariel, move over, and if you don't, she's going to make you, because here comes Lilo.<br/><br/>Stitch on the other hand, wins your love, after you love to hate him first. Percussing in his own native tongue at authority and expectorating just the same, you start to like him even when all odds are against him. But who couldn't love just one more Elvis impersonator. Hats off to Disney, you just made your father Walt proud... A+"
"Merkal-2","10","1","1","27 June 2002"," this is dumbo/bambi quality
","This movie could just have been made 60 years ago. It feels the same as Dumbo or Bambi. Simple animation, a couple of characters and a good story though the last is very different then the elepthant or deer. Animating on Elvis songs is wonderfully done. The Hawaiian music is a winner too.<br/><br/>When I first read about Disney making a movie about an alien crashing down on earth and taken up in a human family I thought the bosses had lost their mind. No one will ever buy that from the company. I'm glad that I was wrong. A Disney Classic, but with a unexpected approach.<br/><br/>Personally I never felt there was anything wrong with the modern, 90's classics where the hero and heroine fall in love defeating the badguy helped by talking parrots, fish, theapots or clocks. I hope that it doesn't take to long before Disney returns to such movies.  I would'nt mind seeing 5 more ""Lilo & Stitchs"" GO DISNEY! Traditional hand-drawn animation rulez forever!!"

","I loved this movie from start to finish.  I love the animation, the characters, the music, I loved the whole idea behind the story.  This is truly the best movie Disney has done in quite sometime.  The joint movies with Pixar were great but Lilo and Stitch is what Walt Disney was all about. It has been a long time since I have felt this good about a Disney movie and although it has a completely different tone, I rank this movie right up there with Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King as far as how I left the theater (all 3 times)feeling.  Disney has had some major disappointments lately (Atlantis, Dinosaur and all the stupid straight to video sequels)but Lilo and Stich is pure and simple fun.  When I go to the movies I expect to be entertained, thrilled, excited, I expect to FEEL something, Lilo and Stitch delivers."

Well turns out we were like the oldest people without kids in the theater. Go fig. Movie starts and I was hooked right from the beginning. Man did I eat my words about this film. Stitch was down-right funny. One part in the film literally almost made me puke because I was laughing so much. The guy next to must of wanted to kill me by the middle of the film.

"Spellvexit","8","1","1","30 June 2002"," A brilliant buildup to a self-destructive conclusion
","I absolutely loved the first half of this movie:  Stitch was perfectly characterized as reckless and feral and completely dangerous in the compass of his small, adorable form.  Lilo, when first introduced, ran the risk of being nauseatingly cute, but it dissipated as her quirks rose to the surface.  Even the sister was remarkably deep; in fact, one of the most outstanding qualities of this latest Disney installment is that the plot followed the development of three characters simultaneously and with an equally talented brush.  I found myself interested in the outcome of all three characters, unlike so many other Disney films which follow one protagonist surrounded by a static collection of stereotypes.<br/><br/>But I knew the heights to which Disney brought the plot would fall as its innovation by necessity had to be hammered into a hackneyed moral lesson and a conclusion in which all loose ends must be tied up in the most just and comforting fashion possible.  But the methods they used--!  I was able to suspend my disbelief for half of the show, but the chain of events grew more and more logically outlandish until in the end I was forced to throw my hands in the air and feel as if I were almost watching a different movie where all internal integrity had been lost!<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie greatly, and it's one of Disney's best.  I knew the ending had to be shoehorned in, and as a result, I sat back and enjoyed it. But it was a flaw that derails it from its course to being a true classic."

I felt that the transformation of Stitch's personality was too rushed, but I can understand how you tend to lose the kiddies' attention when you push a movie up over 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I have no doubt this will soon become a second-rate Disney cartoon series, and that the toys will be clogging the markdown shelves well past November.<br/><br/>Sum total of my opinion: worth seeing once."

"ikramerica","10","1","1","25 June 2002"," Great Movie that blurs line between good and evil
","This is a great little movie, and lots of fun.  There are some weighty issues, and some sad parts that might make your kids sad for a little while, but by the end, they are happy again, and have learned something.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>What is so wonderful about this movie is not the story itself.  After all, there are plenty of fish out of water and hiding from danger movies in history.<br/><br/>No, what is so good about this is that there is no pure good or pure evil. No stereotypical characters.  We like so many of them, and by the end, dislike NO ONE!  Why?  Because, like most of the real world, people are more complex than good or evil.<br/><br/>Stitch is designed to be evil.  And in the beginning, he pretty much is, but it doesn't mean he always will be.<br/><br/>Lilo is lovable, but she is NOT a good little girl.  She is aggressive, disobedient, and somewhat of a brat.  But there are reasons for this, and she needs to sort them out.  Again, she is real.<br/><br/>Her sister, while trying her best, is also not perfect.<br/><br/>The social worker is a ""villain"" in that he wants to take Lilo away, but it is not out of evil, but out of genuine concern for Lilo, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>The leader of the Universe is not Evil, but trying to protect her country from a very destructive little monster (Stitch).<br/><br/>Stitches creator isn't evil, though again, a ""villain"", because he is just trying dismantle what he sees as more of a robot than a real being, and once he notices that Stitch is more like his ""son"", he has a change of heart.<br/><br/>The ""expert"" is likeable, and wants to protect all things, including Stitch, but wants to make sure Stitch is dealt with properly.<br/><br/>And even the Captain is just doing his job, not understanding that Stitch is a thinking, loving, creature.<br/><br/>And that's the point.  most conflict in the world is do to unfortunate circumstances, mistakes, and misunderstandings.  Conflict is about shades of grey.  Most conflict isn't because one side is ""good"" and the other ""evil."" And this film does more to explain this to little kids and adults alike than anything Hollywood has produced for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Add to that the way the animation and characters are done, and you have a winner.  It's nice to look at, funny, the animation is realistic in proportions (no Barbie women and Ken men, like most other disney flicks), and just compared to what else is out there, this takes the cake so far for the summer. Hopefully, Hollywood moves more in this direction, since most movies have become cliched, and this film has very little cliche in it.<br/><br/>So, that's why I gave it a 10.  It is not perfect, but nothing is, and a 10 just means excellent, which this film was."

","""Lilo & Stitch"" is a gem, a jewel, a delight, and a must-see for all children and children-at-heart.  It entertains without ""dumbing down"" and there are many levels of humor to enjoy.  This little movie touched my heart, and my kids (4 1/2 & 6 1/2) totally loved it.  Anyone who has ever felt like they're on the outside looking in (and haven't we all at some point?) will identify with Lilo and her efforts to make and keep friends. Ah, but children can be so cruel, especially to anyone they perceive as ""different.""  My heart broke for the sad little girl who couldn't fit in, yet cheered her determination to remain true to herself.  The movie never lapses into slobbering sentimentality; these are characters worth caring about, who insist on persevering together in spite of the many setbacks that keep popping up.  The philosophical issues that are dealt with are done in a manner that everyone would do well to imitate.  (Cobra Bubbles deserves special mention here as the social worker/former CIA agent with a big heart...)<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are stunning, as has been mentioned already. There are enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending is heart-warming, not sappy.  This little jewel has found a place in my heart right next to ""Casablanca""; a movie to be watched over and over and appreciated anew each time."

The movie is full of things for all ages from the toys and dolls of childhood, to the oldies of Elvis and Godzilla.  Even though there are some Hawaiin words that are not explained (Kapu written on Lilo's door means Forbidden), you don't get the feeling that you are really missing anything.

The audience at the screening I was at was about half adults and half children.  The adults all seemed to be interested and following along, and, more impressively, the children were ALL well-behaved - no running around in the aisles, no noisy restless children - everyone seemed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The plot was nice, the character development was pretty good, and you really FELT for the characters, both when good things & bad happened.

Even stitch Pleaded that ""My family is a bit broken, but still good""<br/><br/>The scenes when Lilo and Stitch are searching for families are more emotional than any other disney feature I have ever seen. I do not understand why Critics like Ebert and Roper gave this film a bad write up, they must not watch Real Life tv shows very often.<br/><br/>Now there is the lovable and evil character of Stich, who was made to be the ultimate weapon but learns what the meaning of family is and is taught to create and not destroy. His voice and his antics make him adored by moviegoers from the beginning, and when he suffers so do the fans. I don't believe I have ever seen a more emotional attachment to a movie character<br/><br/>all in all I give this Film a Ten... above episode 2 above spider man... see this movie this summer!"

I loved the accents and all of the pidgen they were speaking.  All of the little places they had there, the fruit stand with the little old lady, the local shops, all brought back fond memories of going up to the Northshore and getting a shave ice from a little shop up there.  The fact that they used actors from the Islands also made it enjoyable.  It was a well done movie, and in a way, captured some of the magic of the Islands, esp the people, and the great respect for Ohana, and the fact that it not only includes blood, but those you take into your family.  It is a very charming, and yes, funny movie. I gave it a 9, but thats because I have yet to really see a 10...well maybe one or 2.<br/><br/>Rob"

","I thought I would LIKE this movie but I loved it!  I got to go to a special preview the day before the LA Premiere.  The audience was mixed with children and adults of all ages and ethnicity.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian choir was there that performed in the movie as well as lots of Disney employees, Wynonna Judd and the A-Teens, who sang songs from the film.<br/><br/>I have to say that this is the best animated film since Lion King.  From the writer of Mulan, this is ""based on an idea"", and the idea works very well.<br/><br/>The film doesn't rely on the Disney tradition of a song every seven to eight minutes.  When they come they fit in, maybe because they are NOT sung by the characters.  Whether it is background music from Alan Silvestri, or the beautiful Hawaiian music, it is extremely good and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The story is a mix of sci-fi and a little Hawaiian family trouble with Lilo & Stitch - a young mischevious girl under the care of her older sister and a somewhat cute and dangerous blue fellow from one of the galactic federation planets. When the film gets emotional it has much more impact because of the way that it comes from nowhere.  It's not at the end of a refrain or song so it is always not expected.<br/><br/>Adults will love the film as much as kids with several movie references during the piece.  A refreshing story with good production from the animators in Florida, I hope we see much more of this type of animated fare.<br/><br/>I think it could be some time before we see this ""type of animation"" again. It's doesn't take cheap shots like Dreamworks ""Shrek"" and still entertains everyone. Maybe the folks at Disney will do a sequel direct to theaters instead of video, i.e. Lion King and Aladdin.

The opening of the movie has some great comic-action moments, somewhat inspired by ""Star Wars"" as genetic experiment '626' (Stitch) escapes the clutches of the Galactic Federation.<br/><br/>The movie really shines when he crash lands on Hawaii and becomes the ""puppy"" of Lilo, a young Hawaiian girl who lives with her sister.  Lilo sees the world in a creative, amusing, and truly different way, and that makes it hard for her to make friends.  She's a great character, and her relationship with her guardian/sister is truly realistic and also fun.<br/><br/>This movie has the combination that makes Disney movies great -- comedy and heart.  You'll laugh as Stitch, designed to destroy, tries to find a way to cope with the fact that there is nothing around him on this beautiful Hawaiian island to destroy.  You'll sniffle as he tries to find his greater purpose, and you'll cheer as he uses his awesome powers to help Lilo and make things right.<br/><br/>The animators did a truly wonderful job of making a beautiful movie.  From the water color backgrounds which capture the Hawaiian locale perfectly, to the digital spaceships and vehicles, to the animation of the graceful hula, to the hyper-kinetic Stitch.  This is a beautiful movie and a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Stitch is my favorite animated character of all time.  He can be a crazy, caffeinated monster to a truly touching and lost creature.

Lilo and Stitch is very refreshing, and quite entertaining. I think that definitely it should be up for the animation Oscar, but it is still not up to the height that Disney reached in the early '90s. Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast are 2 of my favorite movies of all time, and Lilo just doesn't reach it. It is however better that the low point in the mid '90s (you all remember Hercules). I think that it is a solid Disney movie, quite enjoyable and it did make me cry."
"webmistress-1","Null","1","1","24 June 2002"," Animated Amelie-Like Perfection
","Smart, warm, and refreshing, Lilo & Stitch makes up for years of Disney mediocrity and then some. I just wish it was an hour longer. All of the characters, from Mr. Bubbles to Stitch himself, are highly compelling and ultimately likable. This is a well-designed film -- both visually and in terms of plot/characters. A triumph for any studio let alone Disney, who really needs a crowd-pleaser right about now.<br/><br/>I went in expecting to dislike Lilo & Stitch. I think like most folks, I'm tired of the saccharine, cookie-cutter musicals and the regurgitated plots Disney has spit out over the years. Likewise, the pop-culture-reference laden Shrek and its ""wink-wink, nudge-nudge"" ilk lack an epic feel and are destined to seem 'dated' at some point. And I love a Pixar film as much as the next guy/gal, but all of those entries save the original Toy Story feel somewhat disposable.<br/><br/>Lilo & Stitch is the most enchanting film I've seen since Amelie. In some ways, Lilo's eccentricities reminded me of the Amelie character -- Lilo's treasured snapshot collection; her self-made doll; her trip to bring a sandwich to the fish.<br/><br/>But it's because of the rich characters that the animation seems so complimentary to the story. This is a welcome departure from 'business as usual,' where the story does nothing but propel snazzy animation.<br/><br/>I'd also like to say that I think Disney did itself a disservice by poking fun of its past successes in the Lilo & Stitch trailers. I think they almost took the anti-Disney barbs seen in Shrek TOO seriously. The trailers really turned me off to the film. I was expecting a self-parody in the tradition of (the beat-to-death) Animaniacs -- the type of film that I had no interest in seeing. Lilo & Stitch stands on its own as a classic. I'm so glad I gave it a shot despite Disney's childish, self-referential advertising campaign."

","Lilo and Stitch was amazing. Me and my fiancee were laughing the whole way through, Except for the moments I was nearly crying. True there may be parts in this movie that were more geared towards adults than for children but it was enough stuff in it for children to keep their attention glued. There were very few seats empty in this theatre and over half of them were filled with kids. Very few of them were talking or moving about their attention seemed to be glued to the screen and the story.  Whats better than a good comedy ??? A Disney comedy with NO TALKING ANIMALS. or Talking inanimate objects. Stitch can not count he was an alien. I loved every moment of the movie and will not go into details because that is what made this movie so great is that there were so few spoilers out there. None of the clips at other movies or what they are showing on TV can give you the least inkling of what the movie is really about. I would rate this a 10 out of 10."
"bretsyboo","10","1","1","21 June 2002"," Previews don't do it justice
","A much better movie than I expected to see, as many laughs for kids and adults, and yes plenty of tears for the genetically created alien.  See this movie, it is one of Disney's top 15 easily.  There are scenes that probably will frighten young children, but if one can survive bambi's mother getting shot, they can handle this one."

","I just sat through a matinee of Lilo & Stitch, a movie I really have been anticipating to see; being the cartoon freak I am.<br/><br/>If you like Spirit, you'll hate this, because it is a lot more weird, hip, slightly more violent, and has more heart. Why? Well, it makes you laugh as well as get to your heart more than Spirit probably would; but without turning the film into a piece of sentimental fluff.<br/><br/>The animation is also cool as well. Finally, an 2D animated film that uses CGI as a supplement for a couple of shots rather than unnecessarily using it. It blends together with the 2D animation really well, the backgrounds look nice and lush, and the designs look simple enough but likeable because they don't try to look really slick.<br/><br/>The characters are for once fresh. They aren't generic characters, they are likeable developed characters, they aren't characters that are cloying comic reliefs that we all have seen before in other films, they are NEW! Oh yeah, and Stitch kicks @$$.<br/><br/>And the humor. Well, it's funny! This movie really doesn't depend on humor most of the time, but when it comes in, it really does! It isn't from comic reliefs, not from one-liners, but sight gags and physical humor. The running gags with the Elvis tunes and guy with the ice cream cone are simply cool!<br/><br/>And plus, the sound and music! The Dolby Digital sound in the theater was set up very nicely, with the revving-at-times sound effects of blasts, ambiance, and dialogue simply pumped. You could almost feel it! As for the music, nobody bursts into a song! It's mostly cool Elvis tunes (yay!) and some Hawaiian tunes.<br/><br/>It is very rare when a animated film nowadays hits the spot that Lilo and Stitch does: masterpiece! Classic! Brilliant! These films only come around every 10 or so years, the last being Nightmare Before Christmas. Between this and NBC, there are many excellent near-classics that came around (mostly from Pixar) that get a 10/10 in my book; but they really aren't able to reach this level of genius. 11/10. Oh yeah, I'll say it again: Stitch kicks @$$! Oh, and make sure you catch this in the theater on the VERY next screening of it if you have yet to see it. Do it now! The DVD will be great but it won't have the theatrical impact it did on me and many others. Come on you guys who have yet to see it, you got to bump up more ratings on the masterpiece so it can get on the Top 250. You don't know when the next animated masterpiece of the decade will come! This film needs more than the current 341 votes it has, it needs at least a few thousand to get the recognition it deserves, and maybe a bit more than 8.2."

","My 10 year old son and I just returned from seeing Lilo & Stitch.  It's hard to comment on the plot without giving too much away - but it has a rich and fresh story.  Fun characters with flaws and, well, mostly flaws but that makes them all the more real.  But the best part has got to be the animation - lush, deep colors and textures - the water and waves alone is worth the price of admission.

"kim-63","8","1","1","21 June 2002"," Has all the elements, but is lacking something.
","I just got back from seeing this film and am once again disappointed in a Disney film.  I just can't figure this one out.  This is a cute story, has great characters, lots of action and takes care of some things that have been lacking in a LOT of Disney films-but I still left the theater without really caring about the characters.<br/><br/>I'm not going to reiterate the plot line.  I'm sure you've heard it enough. Lilo is a very spunky little girl who is VERY lifelike in her attitudes and actions, still coping with her parents death. There are times in the film when you just want to pick her up and hold her, but there are other times where you just question why a girl as smart as she is is not more aware of her situation.  All I've seen on her says she's 11, but my take is closer to 5-7.<br/><br/>Every time I saw Nonni on the screen, I really wanted to cheer!  Finally an animated film with a realistic female body!  Her hips are actually wider than her bust and she is proportional!!!  Hallelujah, they are finally listening.  (I think Odette's waist in the Swan Princess was something like 1/6 her bust).  And I loved not only her interaction with her sister in similarities, but their fights as well.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames couldn't have been better as Cobra Bubbles.  There are just some voices that are meant to be certain characters and this is his.  (Think of the difference between John Goodman in The Emperor's New Groove as the peasant and Monster's as Sully).<br/><br/>The supporting characters of Jumbaa, Grand Counsel woman and Plinkley are good but they left me flat.<br/><br/>Stitch does an amazing transformation in his search for someplace to belong, and I cheered when he said he could be soft and fluffy, but again-I really didn't truly CARE.<br/><br/>There is no real quintisential Disney villian in this piece and I think that is truly lacking, but with the villians they've had lately, that may be an improvement.<br/><br/>I read a review that panned this film as too long and just not enough something.  They felt it would be a great cartoon series.  While I liked it well enough to see it at least one more time, I pray for the cartoon series. Now THAT is a vehicle with potential for this story.<br/><br/>On my Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh LD, there is a featurette in which they said that because America was unfamiliar with Winnie the Pooh in the early 60's, Walt decided to split the story into 3 pieces to give us time to get used to and fall in love with Edward Bear.  It worked then and it is a shame that they weren't able to do something similar here."
"Redfroggy","10","1","1","22 June 2002"," Disney's return to classics!
","As a genuine Disney lover, I enjoy most of Disney's animated features. Lilo & Stitch was different, it was the first animated feature I had actually been looking forward to excitedly since the Lion King in 1994. With Lilo & Stitch, Disney has returned to what made them such a powerhouse of the early 90s. Lilo & Stitch is heart warming, exciting and funny. It will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. The watercolor backgrounds are beautifully done and help bring the Hawaiian atmosphere to life. The characters are fun and enticing. From Lilo's eccentricities to Stitch's badness level, Lilo & Stitch's characters bring to life a story that's hard to forget. Lilo & Stitch will be one of Disney's newest masterpieces!"
"schuhj","9","1","1","22 June 2002"," Stitch is a winner
","I think that Disney has come up with a winning new character  in Stitch. The story line is not as good as it might be , but it starts off with a bang and keeps moving. The occasional frenzy ends  down often enough to make us care about the characters and it has plenty of comic touches. It seems to be a hit, so that will give a boost to two-dimensional cartoons."
"AUAU","Null","1","1","22 June 2002"," With a Heart Filled with Mahalo (Thank You) for all involved...
","Aloha ka~kou (Aloha to All of Us),<br/><br/>Yesterday, with great anticipation -- yes, with bated breaths -- we, my husband and I who were born in Hawai`i fifty years ago and raised there, went to see LILO AND STITCH at our local theatre, hoping for its unmitigated success and yet knowing it could be yet another dirty bomb unwittingly directed against the Hawaiian culture.<br/><br/>We were utterly impressed with LILO & STITCH's shining truth and loved and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the galactic high adventure and its down-to-Earth (literally) endearing story, brimming full of Aloha of the real, day-to-day variety, not the syrupy, touristy stuff. Having been raised with Disney movies, ourselves, we were delighted with its high caliber Disney feel and animation mastery, especially the stunningly gorgeous water-color visuals of our homeland.<br/><br/>Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois bolstered our faith in the next generation of moviemakers.  I dare say that they are uniquely enlightened young people, wise beyond their years.  Certainly, this movie is not yet another run-of-the-mill, Hawaiian-themed fantasy that my generation has come to expect out of Hollywood. We've seen, rolled our eyes upward, and laughed at the ludicrousness of too many hurriedly slapped together movies based on deluded, overly-dramatized or white-washed, idealized visions and versions of Hawaiian culture and its people.<br/><br/>Instead, it was clearly evident to us that the research that went into LILO AND STITCH was done with thoroughness, sincerity, concern and care.<br/><br/>
The result? A movie with a huge sensitivity, concern and Aloha for our endangered Hawaiian and local culture, which, with a combination of ""attitude"" and sweetness, captures the authentic spirit and genuine warmth, and inner and outer beauty of Hawai`i, especially its unique Aloha Spirit and valuing of `ohana (family).<br/><br/>In its unique, far-reaching way, LILO and STITCH -- and Disney --  will help to perpetuate Hawaiian ways, beingness, and arts, as well as our one-of-a-kind local culture.  I loved the snippets of pidgin, for most of us, our first language.  Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee were perfect in their voice roles as Nani and Kawika (David).  For a change, true locals playing local roles with every truthful and subtle nuance.<br/><br/>
Loving Hawaiian music as I do, I am particularly grateful for the inclusion of authentic Hawaiian musicianry: the mesmerizing, lively chants by real-life Hawaiian chanter, Mark Keali`i Ho`omalu, were right-on. The casting of real-life kumu hula (hula master)Kunewa Mook as the voice of the hula teacher in the movie was exactly pono (right and proper); his input on depicting hulas as it is actually danced, and not the swishy hula gibberish of past Hollywood movies was greatly appreciated by us, his peers.<br/><br/>And singing by the Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus -- you must have indigenous blood to go to school there -- could not have been truer or more delightful.  Ahh.... I am going out to buy the CD ASAP!<br/><br/>Of course, we grew up with Elvis' classic tunes, so we absolutely loved the resurrection of his songs as well as Wynonna's rendition of ""Burning Love."" A perfect balance to the Hawaiian music.  Pono, which means not only right and proper, but balanced.<br/><br/>We spotted only one glaring mistake: the shakkah (""all is cool"") sign as depicted in the movie at the end.  They got the fingers right, but the way they did it, it's only half of the shakkah sign.  As it was, it stopped as the Texas Longhorn symbol. Locals then swivel their wrist, 180 degrees, completing the local sign with the BACK of the hand toward the viewer. Oh well, as we say in Hawai`i:  ""Ain't no big t'ing, braddah"" as the moviemakers can fix that faux pas for the video version.<br/><br/>
A big MAHALO (THANK YOU) to all involved, viewers included, who make LILO & STITCH the sharing movie it is.  Spread the Aloha.<br/><br/>Me ke Aloha, AU/AD of hawaiianlanguage.com"

Lilo and Stich isn't just a rehash of E.T. as many naive critics have said; the film takes a much different approach to a slightly similar story line.

As someone who grew up on Disney films like the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, I found this movie to be more for the new generation of kids out there.  Perhaps catering to parents just as much as their own children, Lilo and Stitch has a little more sophisticated humor while at the same time maintaining the level of Disney innocence that the world is used to.  I think everyone who enjoys a heartfelt story with a lot of laughs along the way will find Lilo and Stitch to be right up their ally."

","I haven't been a fan of traditionally animated Disney movies for many years. Sure, some have been great to see once or twice (Mulan, Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast), but some I regret taking the time seeing (Hercules).  Out of the Classics, Bambi always stood out for me as a favorite, but even so, I don't yet own the DVD.  But Lilo & Stitch has quickly jumped to the forefront as my favorite Disney movie ever.  Why?  Because it's got heart and edge yet avoided the sappy sentimentality and stuped one-liners.  Stitch and Lilo complement each other well.  They're both adorable, even when they're getting into trouble.  These characters aren't perfect nor completely evil. They're just like the rest of us...a little of both.  But they want to be a part of something where they can belong.  Ohana works for them.  It works for me.<br/><br/>Kudos to Disney for not making this film by committee and letting two amazing artists create their vision on their own.  It makes a difference!"

"paul_supercala","Null","1","1","20 June 2002"," Disney gives us something old and something new to try to expand their horizons (and longevity) and it works pretty well.
","Instead of trying to keep up with or outdo the popular Pixar (""Shrek"", ""Monsters, Inc."") technology, Disney has reverted back to the old days of watercolors for what they hope will be their next blockbuster. With a daring ad campaign that puts ""Stitch"", the destructive yet cute koala-looking alien, amongst classic Disney characters like Snow White and Ariel (""The Little Mermaid""), it smells like Mickey has a new franchise in the works. The movie, however, is less than traditional. In fact, the themes at times seem a little too heavy or realistic for a typical Disney feature.<br/><br/>For example, you'll see Lilo, the not so cuddly little girl, bite other kids, alienate herself from others, and defy authority. She is being raised by her job-hopping sister, Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere), because her parents were killed in an accident and there's constantly a threat of a social service ""thug"" (voiced by Ving Rhames) coming by to take Lilo away. The point, though, is that no matter who it is in your life, it's important to have ""ohana"" (family). It's nice to see that Disney is acknowledging different types of modern lifestyles, although part of the Disney magic is the escapism that's really not present here. Not that every one has to be heads-in-the-clouds entertainment, but sometimes that's why folks go to the movies after all, isn't it?<br/><br/>It almost seems aimed at a more mature audience, referencing slightly older films like ""Jaws"" and ""Star Trek"", while having almost only old Elvis Presley songs in the soundtrack. That's right, no singing or dancing here, just a little dialogue-less destructive alien and a dysfunctional kid in Hawaii trying to find their place in the world.<br/><br/>Writer/director Chris Sanders (""Mulan"") and co-director Dean Deblois are fairly new to the game, but that's probably what Disney needs. The sugary-sweet animated almost-musicals that have worked in the past needed a little updating and rethinking to connect with kids today and it seems to have worked. This is one that kids and adults can enjoy alike. While probably not destined for the ""classic"" tag that the company is hoping for, it's still pretty entertaining. If this sounds interesting to you, check it out. If you're expecting big musical numbers and sweet, loveable characters, you might do best with the older Disney films."
"aarontabak","10","1","1","23 June 2002"," Wow...
","By the time of this film's release, almost every moviegoer had probably seen at least one of the extremely clever trailers Disney placed for this film. Featuring character of Stitch disrupting memorable scenes from several Disney classics (from ""The Little Mermaid"" to ""Aladdin""), the ads essentially promised that ""Lilo & Stitch"" would abandon the tradition of the past few years' formulaic Disney efforts, for something completely new and original.  So does the film deliver?<br/><br/>Yes.  Absolutely, yes.  This film easily reaches at least the same caliber as any of Pixar's efforts, if not a superior level altogether. The characters and voice acting are incredible, the story is less predictable than in any animated feature I've seen, and it is utterly hilarious.  Even the ""manipulative"" scenes, where the film is clearly tugging for the viewer's heartstrings, actually WORK, and somehow avoid drowning the film in sappiness.<br/><br/>Go see it.  Now."

","*mild spoilers*<br/><br/>When ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was released, I was worried that this highly witty, sarcastic, and above all funny movie from Disney would be an aberration, a one-shot deal.<br/><br/>Thankfully, ""Lilo & Stitch"" has proven me wrong.  If anything, it manages to be even funnier than ""New Groove.""<br/><br/>A hilarious script (about two Hawaiian siblings, a runaway genetic experiment, several aliens, a strange social worker and a surfer dude) combined with great voice acting (kudos especially to Ving Rhames as the wonderfully named Cobra Bubbles, and Zoe Caldwell as the Federation leader) make this a definite must-see.  Great songs (most by Elvis Presley) add to the chaos (and ""Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride"" is superb)<br/><br/>I rate this just below ""Spider-Man"" and just above ""Star Wars Episode II.""<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
"mfisher452","Null","1","1","24 July 2002"," Wicked and mischievous; I smell a Disney Channel series
","Though Stitch is a genetically engineered alien life form, he fits the archetype of the mischievous sprite, and though his type is common in story and film, Stitch is an gloriously inspired creation for the X-Files age. He breaks out of confinement at home and escapes to Earth, landing in (where else?) Hawaii, where he winds up in the pound and to survive, morphs himself into a (rather grotesque-looking) dog. He is adopted by Lilo, who is about eight and who is being raised (barely) by her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) since the death of their parents in a car wreck. In her grief, Lilo has become the quintessence of brattiness. The unlikeliest of social workers, Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), is keeping his eye on the whole chaotic situation, while Stitch is on the run from his creator, Dr. Jumba, and Pleakley, an expert on Earth life. The parallel stories of Stitch's gradually realizing the achievement of ""ohana"" (""family"" in Hawaiian) and his attempts to elude capture by steadily growing forces arrayed against him begin hilariously to collide, until they finally come together at the end. This is obviously material for a series on the Disney Channel, although if the creators really want to keep it wicked, it may have to go on HBO or Showtime. A character note: Younger viewers (i.e., those under 50) probably won't realize that David Ogden Stiers's excellent Russian accent as Jumba is actually a bull's-eye impression of the late Akim Tamiroff."
"johnnysugar","8","1","1","23 July 2002"," Disney Finally Grows Up
","It was with high hopes that I went to see the newest Disney offering, ""Lilo & Stitch.""  I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Disney's newest offering (like ""Atlantis"", a PG-rated movie) is a fantastic mix of superb visuals, an endearing story, and wonderful voice acting.  It also jettisons many standard Disney elements, for which I was most grateful.<br/><br/>Stitch is an alien fugitive, a being created by a mad scientist to be a weapon that escaped its confinement.  He is discovered by Lilo, a disturbed young orphan in Hawaii who thinks Stitch is an ugly dog.  Lilo lives with her older sister Nani, and the hulking social services agent Cobra Bubbles has threatened to take Lilo away from her if she does not prove herself as a parent.  Stitch, of course, causes all sorts of havoc in the middle of this.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic, mainly thanks to the use of watercolor cels, a technique not used for almost 60 years prior (in Disney's ""Dumbo"").  The characters are drawn with a high degree of realism, especially Nani who has the facial features and build of a true woman of Hawaiian descent and not the nymph-like physique of the standard Disney female.  Even the voices are accented correctly, thanks to native Hawaiians Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this is not a musical.  Sure, there are songs in it...but they're all Elvis Presely songs and there are no singing animals or song breaks.  The movie is sweet but not syrupy, endearing but not cloying. Stitch is by far not the cute, sweet, Disney animal but, like Lilo, a lost soul slowly learning to adapt to society and suppress their anger at the world. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you're like me, and thought Disney would never regain the wonder and beauty they lost after ""Hunchback of Notre Dame."""

This film also delivers strong messages that is usually uncommon for animated films. It teaches us life's important lessons, such as the true meaning of the word family. The phrase ""Ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind"" clearly displays the true importance of family unity. <br/><br/>It's very rare that animated films entertains as well as educate both major age genre.

""Lilo and Stitch"" is a beautiful animated and sweet movie (which, believe it or not, actually accurately portrays the way a child exhibits symptoms of grief and loss) with a lot of manic humor.  It proves to me, once again, why hand-drawn animation is better than computer animation (even though it does use some, itself).<br/><br/>If I really wanted to, I could probably argue out the alien concept (and Stitch, too), since really the heart of the story is Lilo and her sister and just about anything could have been substituted in Stitch's place (a real dog that had been abused by it's owner (they exibit the same tendencies), a lost koala, the Tazmanian Devil or something), but, what the hell, if it doesn't really matter then why not an alien science project?

","This movie is emotionally like a Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride.  I took my 3 year old grand daughter, as well as both my daughters (late 20's), and the 4 of us laughed, cried, laughed, and cried again.  We have been back 3 times already.  My little grand daughter didn't really understand what made her sad, but this was an excellent spring-board to discuss with her empathy and compassion.  She will tell you in a heart beat that o'hana is family, and that means no one gets left behind, and no one is forgotten.  What an extraordinary way to teach young toddlers the strong bond of family, and the importance of each and every living thing!  This baby had a healthy sense of self-value already, as well as an attachment to Momma and Grandma, but now she knows anything or anyone can be part of family if you want it to be. Because Stitch related to the story of the ""Ugly Duckling"", we were able to read the story, and discuss the things about the ugly duckling that were similar to Stitch, and how outside appearances don't have anything to do with what's inside, and that love is blind.  Besides lessons of empathy and compassion, we were able to discuss acceptance and unconditional love.<br/><br/>We've always loved the princess stories and been able to relate to being sweet and nice no matter what, but in those stories, everyone is beautiful and rich and the poor beautiful princess is rescued by a handsome knight in shining armor.  In this story, a lonely, sad, angry child who still loves in spite of rejection is able to spread love by just loving.  And an unusual creature built solely for destruction learns the value of love and family. The bottom line is that children can learn that every being is valuable and worthy of love."

","I absolutely loved Lilo and Stitch. Stitch is incredibly adorable, and so is Lilo. Though it may seem somewhat dull, and I'll admit it, stupid, it's actually quite funny and it's cute, let alone it doesn't have so much material for it to be a kiddie movie to make parents want to cry if they're forced to see this movie. I think it has something for everyone.It actually deals with a realistic topic, such as a broken home, and such. I wont say what happens in the movie, because I'd rather have people see it than simply read a summary of it and feel as if they've seen it already. I loved this movie, it's cute and funny, and I think it's best to simply let the reader of this comment make their own opinion about the movie if they do go see it...and please do, it's not excrutiatingly painful to watch, and who knows, if you're not into Disney movies, maybe this one will make you change your mind.

I highly recommend it to everyone, although I would say maybe little ones under the age of 6 should wait as there are some sad, and some loud moments which might upset the littler ones.<br/><br/>The watercolour Backgrounds rock!

"DaADA1","10","1","1","23 June 2002"," I'm beyond impressed...
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE PLOT AND CHARACTER SPOILERS. I just got back from the movies and decided to give Lilo and Stitch a go since I've already seen just about everything else that's out. If I had to sum it up in once phrase, I'd say: Not only was it absolutely brilliant, but the best animated film ever produced. This is why:<br/><br/>Usually, in a Disney movie, you can see plot developments from a mile away. Lilo and Stitch is pretty ambiguous, meaning you can never really tell what's coming up next. It doesn't even seem like a Disney movie. Hardly any little childish jokes or anything. It's absolutely fantastic. The music is WONDERFUL. It's subtle yet sets up the mood of the scene perfectly. The voice acting is superb. Lilo (Daveigh Chase) does a fantastic job of delivering the frequently tense dialogue. David Ogden Stiers is probably the best voice actor I've ever heard. His Russian accent really brings his character to life. Not to mention Chris Sanders, with all the incredible noises that Stitch makes. Stitch alone is probably the funniest thing in the movie, with all his screeches and regurgitation.<br/><br/>Spoilers start here<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's great. Nani, Lilo's older sister, is fighting against Social Services to keep Lilo. I'm not gonna expand too much since a synopsis is available anywhere. However, the whole idea that Nani needs a job now really helps the plot so it doesn't bottom out near the beginning. Their social worker, Cobra Bubbles, tells Lilo that she needs to reform Stitch into a model citizen after Stitch throws a book in his face (I was cracking up). Also, Lilo has her fair share of problems. She's an outcast amongst her companions. Just to give you a little taste of what you're in for, I'm gonna completely describe the opening of the movie. Lilo runs into dance lessons late because she was feeding a fish which she believes controls the weather. She says that she was panicking because all they had was tuna and if she fed a fish tuna she would be a bad person so that's why she was late. As she explains this to her dance teacher, this one girl calls her weird and Lilo snaps. She jumps on the girl and smashes her into the floor and starts punching her face. This is the first indication that something's wrong, which is obviously a quantam leap beyond previous Disney movies. Disney has done so many weak movies that you might as well go ahead and disassociate this movie from any other; it's fantastic. Yet another memorable scene is when Lilo tells Stitch to be constructive and build something rather than destroy everything. Stitch then proceeds to rapidly create a scale model of San Francisco (he does this because he is programmed to live in big cities and destroy them. Since Hawaii has no real big cities, he creates one). He then reenacts Godzilla, tearing apart the buildings and screaming and eating little model cars. No other non-human creature in Disney history has ever been so developed as Stitch. I'm not going to spoil any more, but I'll leave you with this:<br/><br/>I don't advise you see this movie, I command it. It will give you not only some joy of watching such a fun film, but it will totally change your whole perspective on animated movies. I mean come on, I'm a 16 year old male and I loved it. That has to count for something, right?<br/><br/>Final rating:  10/10, and believe me, I'd go higher if I could.<br/><br/>Also, some final parting advice: If you don't have kids, go after dark so you won't have to put up with screaming babies and whining kids. It gets old fast."
"Ziman","7","1","1","13 July 2002"," 7 of 10 stars. Another Disney non-musical.
","When one thinks animated feature' (at least in the North American sense), one conjures up a musical rendition of an adapted fairy tale or legendary story.  Disney has been largely successful with that format in the past, and they seem to be diverging from it.  They brought us the hilarious antics in `The Emperor's New Groove' which was furthest from that format.  Now they bring us another break from the pack, `Lilo & Stitch'.<br/><br/>Experiment 6-2-6' was designed by an alien race to be a super-soldier of sorts.  An artificial life deemed to be unsafe it is condemned to imprisonment.  However, it's clever enough to elude its captors, escapes, and crash-lands on Earth.  The landing target is, of all places, Hawaii where it is adopted by a young girl named Lilo (pronounced LEE-lo').  She is unaware of the creature's origins, mistakes it for a strange dog, and names him `Stitch'.  The story follows Lilo and Stitch (hence the title) as Lilo struggles with her broken family life (being raised by only her older sister), and Stitch adapts to life on Earth, while attempting to avoid capture by the society from which he escaped.  <br/><br/>I found this film to be as entertaining to me, as the children in the theatre found it. The relationships in this movie are those that children can relate with.  Stitch's adapting to life in Hawaii is one that comes off quite comical, and routinely unexpected.  His social skills are lacking, and he reacts quickly, without thought, which is the source for the comedy.  I found myself laughing out loud at several of Stitch's antics, and his overall character behaviour really doesn't grow tiring.<br/><br/>The movie does take an emotional side too as Lilo confronts her broken home and grows attached to Stitch, who ultimately is threatened with his own capture.  Although it could have gotten completely sappy at the end, it doesn't, which is refreshing.  Of course, it is a Disney feature, so a happy ending is always expected, but it's a light one complementing the light-hearted romp of this movie.<br/><br/>Granted, it's not Disney's platinum achievements, nor is it an AMAZING story but given the low-key promotion this movie has had, it might slip by you un-detected.  My recommendation is that you do not let this happen. It's completely suitable to go to with children, or as a date flick, or even with a buddy."
"smhamrick","Null","1","1","10 July 2002"," Average, could've been better
","Lilo and Stitch was certainly a turnaround for Disney. Their films in the past ten years have done little to inspire, and have been more of a cameo hit for major actors and singers while forgetting the more critical points of plot and character.<br/><br/>This film I felt turned it around some, but, like a person waking from a long sleep, the efforts were groggy and uncertain in places. The introductory sequence was too heavy on exposition and slowed the flow of the start of the movie too much. They could've delivered the same information in one short scene, rather than drag it out.<br/><br/>Lilo and Nana shouldn't have been portrayed as a broken family. Their quarreling and consummate misbehavior prevented me (and likely the rest of the audience) from sympathizing and bonding with them. I think also Nana's regular outfit was inappropriate for young kids to see, showing too much midriff. It took too long into the movie for them to develop, and the same was true with Stitch.<br/><br/>Stitch is one of the most interesting characters to come along in ages, but he was vastly underused. Why did they wait through two-thirds of the movie before allowing him to speak? That barrier of silence again prevented sympathy and bonding, and it wasn't until his talk with Nana near the end before I felt I had a grasp of the character.<br/><br/>The Elvis sequences were cute, but I think in the end they kept Stitch from developing until late in the movie. He should've been given some time alone<br/><br/>in the spotlight to develop more quickly. In short, I think the concept of the movie was good but the timing and use of characters needed more planning and better timing. Overall, it was okay, but it's not one I'd likely go see again--the end credit sequence was great, though."
"AEBarschall","Null","1","1","11 July 2002"," GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
","This movie was SO GREAT!  I am so happy my son got me to go see it. <br/><br/>
It really has everything: cute cuddly characters in idyllic settings, suspenseful chases, space aliens, Star Wars spoofs, social commentary, love, the frustrations of dealing with and also of being an ill-behaved child, family dysfunction, humor, sadness, adventure, romance, fabulous surfing, and a happy ending.  <br/><br/>Somehow the movie managed to have very complex, subtle character development worthy of high literature and still remain appealing to children.  This is totally different from your typical cartoons, which inspired the concept of ""cartoonish characters.""    In ""Lilo & Stitch,"" people are deep and believable.  They actually suffer from poverty and have to deal with government bureaucracy.<br/><br/>CAVEAT:  I still don't think that any Disney movies are suitable for pre-schoolers, because there is suspense and some violence.  My kids are 8 and 11, which I think are ideal ages for most Disney movies. <br/><br/>
The good thing here is that the suspense is different from most other kids' movies.  There are not really any good or bad guys.  There are just a bunch of fairly confused, bumbling people and aliens who all have their own points of view.  Importantly, the movie carries the message that different and conflicting views can be reconciled, that problems do not have to be solved by killing major characters.  This is the message that we want to give our children for how to live in our crowded world, not that we can kill off our enemies, but that we have to find a way to share space with them.<br/><br/>
I guess it's really a girl's movie, like ""Pocahantas"" was, but my sons liked it anyway."

","I though Disney was kind of in a rut with its recent features.  In fact, I'm not even sure whether I've seen the last couple.  But this one was completely new, and wonderful.  The animation was compelling, but much more interesting to me was the story, which was about the anger, and the resultant acting out, of two children deprived of their parents.  Of course, there are aliens and a monster that gets tamed, battles and lots of jokes, but the subtext was about coming to grips with loss and grief.  What a change for animation where you expect a little adventure, maybe a little boy meets girl.  Great story, wonderfully well told."
"Thalya","Null","1","1","10 July 2002"," HE'S SO CUTE!!!
","Ok, for starters I'm probably biased as I'm typing this with Stitch in my lap. Now: *SPOILERS ahead for what is fast becoming my favorite movie ever (and note, I'm 21 and past faves have included L.A. Confidential and Gladiator)*<br/><br/> And where to start? This movie just was everything; it completely matched my own personal aesthetic in a way no movie I've seen before has: wild, crazy, adorable, laugh-out-loud funny (the most I've laughed at a Disney film ever), poignant, sci-fi, fish-out-of-water/misfit action (I completely empathize with Lilo), and above all CUTE (and FLUFFY!)! And it had the King no less and was beautifully animated; in fact, if it hadn't had the watercolors, I wouldn't have liked it so much, it would make it more akin to some of the earlier-90s flat-color too-serious sap-and-songfests.<br/><br/> Now Stitch is wicked, and that he goes through such an immense character transformation makes this movie stand out from the lot of them. Most earlier Disney animated movies have been drawn from fairy tales, with the heroes and heroines going through superficial change, mostly in social class. This little guy also happens to have alot more intelligence than most heroes do, which helps in him picking up modern lingo in no time flat. ""Blue punch buggy!"" and ""Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah! One potato, two potato..."" could only happen in a movie like this, which happens to also be the only Disney movie that comes to mind set in the modern day, not some period piece.<br/><br/> In addition to those lines above, I've never laughed so hard or remembered so many, or just marveled at tiny little moments. The expression on Stitch's face as Lilo starts teaching him to hula (the one where he goes ""Ooooh!.."") is utterly priceless, not just for the sheer cuteness but if you just take a frame of it and add sound, think of the absurdity of a little blue alien the size of a little girl, in a hula outfit, listening to Elvis and swinging his hip and getting intrigued. It's mindblowing. There's a similar part when he's in his spacesuit and spouting alien gibberish whilst pointing 4 ray guns at a laconic toad. That they made the connection between Elvis and aliens only adds to the rollicking absurdity. Lines to remember: ""I like fluffy.."", ""Not to mention cute and FLUFFY!"", ""It's okay, my dog found the chainsaw"", ""L-l-ost..I'm lost.."", ""No more caffeine for you"", ""She looks like she could use some lovin'"", ""H-hiii....""""Wow!..."" (when Lilo met Stitch), ""I wanna buy him! Can I borrow 2 dollars?"", ""Pudge controls the weather"", ""Oh no, she's just ugly"", ""...and steal everybody's left shoe."", ""He took the red one"", ""Talk! I know you can.""""Okay, okay.."".<br/><br/> Other things of note: they drew David as a hunka hunka burnin love, if you ask me (never a bad thing); the San Francisco rampage (complete with Stitch doing mock voices); the pouting/rolling in a ball bits; the spaceship's horn doing La Cucaracha; Stitch's reaction when Lilo tells him there are no big cities on the island, juxtaposed with Jumba's explanation of Stitch's purpose; Earth vs. the Spiders; the way the two plotlines, family and alien (and come to think of it, an alien was the perfect choice for a story like this, a literal alien), interwove; the (I think it was) Devil in a Blue Dress montage where Nani is job-hunting (excellent interweaving of music and action); also props to Wynnona for her rendition of Hunka Hunka Burnin Love over the end credits, I was set to dance out of the theater; the photos in the end credits were extremely heartwarming as well. Too many things to name, really, which is why it's perfect. I would have preferred a small throwaway line about Elvis and aliens, but it wasn't entirely needed.<br/><br/> This movie was made with alot of love and alot of joy. Every time I think about it I positively beam. Giant props to Chris Sanders! Wonderful idea, vision, execution, and above all voice! I can only try to mimic it and I'm very close to getting the ""eh/ih"" as ""Yes"" down. Ok, I'm obsessed, but my hamster voice was very close to Stitch already.<br/><br/> This is a treasure and I still haven't picked out all the details. I need to see this at least 2 more times, this tops Spiderman and definitely Ep2. This will be a hard one to replace as #1."

"perni","Null","1","1","23 June 2002"," The best Disney feature in years...see it!
","After watching Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I thought that Disney was caput on the traditional animation front. The entire thing felt like a huge waste of time, all because Disney didn't go that extra mile and make it completely different from its past features. It still had dumb, 'wacky' characters that were more annoying than funny, and any hopes of a mature story were overshadowed by their jokes. Thankfully, Lilo & Stitch rejuvenated my wearied soul. The writing is insanely inventive and funny, but the movie also made me choke back the tears with its endearing characters, especially the Lilo-Nani pair. You could really feel that they were sisters in a bad situation. I also love the Stitch character, just because the animation brings so much life to him even though he doesn't speak English for much of the film. Jumba and his skinny sidekick (can't remember that guy's name, but he was voiced by one of the Kids in Hall actors) were also quite funny, Jumba being more so because I loved his accent and roly-poly animation. You also have to give credit to Disney for not putting any real bad guys in this thing. In past Mouse movies, there is the BAD GUY and the GOOD GUY. If you were the BAD GUY, then you are pure, Satanic evil. If you were the GOOD GUY, you have no character flaws and are basically Jesus. Here, the 'bad' characters do good things, and the 'good' characters make mistakes. You know, like in real life. Duh! Of all the characters Lilo is probably my favorite, since she's so out there and weird. I think all kids can relate to her being stranded by the other girls, since every kid is weird in his/her own way. So, to say the least, Lilo is the best film of the summer for adults AND kids. Yes, its so touching and funny that both groups should love it. I give this teddy bear of a film 4 out of 4 stars."

","Lovely drawings, sweet message about family, and I liked the fact that the characters were so unlikeable.  Lilo is lonely and aggressive; her sister is frazzled and aggressive; Stitch starts out as destructive and aggressive....you get the idea.  They all bite or hit or punch or kick.  Is this Disney?  By the end, of course, it is. But could they have spent just a little extra time to have the story make sense?  The ugly duckling motif, for example.   They use this as an important theme in the story,  but no one in the story seems to have remembered that the whole point is that the ugly duckling is NOT a duck. And then the CIA wanders in at the end.  What???  Suddenly the social worker (out of the blue) is an agent? ex-agent?  Was at ""Roswell"" in 1973??  How hard would it be to make these bits fit together.  You don't find this kind of slack in the best of Disney animation.  Because it isn't just about the cool graphics or the Elvis music - in the best Disney movies, it's also about a really well-written story.  That's what missing here."

It was far better than last years' disappointing 'Atlantis' (I can only hope that 'Treasure Planet' turns out better as an action-adventure sci fi movie from Disney). Hilariously funny, serious and heart -warming and totally weird at the same time. There's something new  and fresh to this movie I cannot pin down exactly: the fact that Stich is not a cute animal? Or that the heroine Lilo is not a princess (to be)  and she can be  a real brat, though you cannot help feeling for her? That the story is about 'ordinary people' with problems most people can associate with? The 'old' part is of course the use of water-colour backgrounds. I understand some critics complained about  the ''Saturday-tv-cartoon' level of animation, but I think the 'simplicity' works nice here. It doesn't always have to be slick, detailed 'breathtaking'  'Lion King' -like.  L&S doesn't require the same technique as, for instance 'Tarzan' to be enjoyed. L&S is worth at least a look or two, if not more. I give it 8 out of 10."

","Lilo & Stitch is a welcome breath of fresh air for anyone, like myself, that has fallen out of touch with Disney animated movies.  (I mean, if asked to name the most recent Disney movies, I would answer, ""Um, well there was Lion King...then Mulan was in there somewhere...oh and that Hercules one...I think..."")<br/><br/>Even though the story deals with an alien convict crash-landing on Kauai, this movie is so much more *real* then any other Disney movie I can think of.  The issue of a family being broken up by the death of the parents is real.  The eccentric and understandably child-like actions and feelings of Lilo as she tries to fit in are real.  Even the style of the characters is more real, since it seems that Disney animators have finally discovered that women don't all have waists the diameter of a soda can.<br/><br/>Sure, people say that the plot makes itself too neat sometimes, but I think that adds to the humor.  I thought the ending was all that much funnier for all the loose ends being tied up in wierd ways.  The art, too, was mesmorizing.  I adored the watercolor renditions of Hawaiian landscapes. The songs, both Elvis and hawaiian-style background music, are very nice as well, and I for one don't miss the long and drawn-out musical sequences that have been Disney's claim to fame.<br/><br/>Anyway, bottom line, if four cynical and jaded teenagers can have more fun at this movie than at MIB2, then *anyone* can, and I recommend it to everyone."

Lilo and Stitch is weak, it has moments of wit and is cute enough for the kids, but the characters aren't really memorable. It has a nice message of family and friendship, but Disney has done it better in the past. The truth is that, since Mulan, there hasn't been a really good traditional animated movie from the studio, Toy Story and Monsters Inc. are great but they are CG animation(and Pixar is the actual creative force behind those movies).Rest assured that Lilo and Stitch will entertain kids, and a times adults too.

I enjoyed the fact that Disney was portraying an imperfect family in any imperfect world. Nowadays it not out of the ordinary for kids to come from broken homes. I think it was a nice touch portraying to kids the importance of family without centralizing on picture perfect families. I think Disney has done a wonderful job adjusting to the times, I have to admit I found stitch so hilarious that I was laughing most of the time.

","Atlantis: The Lost Empire sucked. There, I said it. Lilo and Stitch, however, is definitely not in the same ballfield. It sports some great animation ideas (check out those watercolor backgrounds...very 'toon retro), a well-written script with endearing characters, and some very hummable tunes, ranging from classic Elvis to the A*Teens, who I have always enjoyed. Stitch is a fabulous character due to his fuzzy-wuzzy appearance that's matched with his fiery personality. The whole model of San Francisco gag was hilarious, and showed just how offbeat the blue alien is. I also really liked the relationship between Lilo and her older sister Nani. Very believeable and, more importantly, touching. I seriously teared up during this film at times, something that very rarely happens with me. I give L&S 4 out of 4 stars, since it is the best animated film out there right now (with Powerpuff Girls being a late second). Too bad the previews I saw stunk up the joint. Hey Arnold?

Now, ""Lilo & Stitch"" is somehow a mix between the radical humour of ""Groove"" and their classic family stories - and it worked great!<br/><br/>We had a great time in the cinema watching ""Lilo & Stitch"" and Stitch is for sure one of my favorite Disney characters ever!

The science fiction sequences aren't very prominent in the movie and I think this is a good decision.<br/><br/>Technically the film is - as all other Disney movies - top notch. It's not revolutionary, in fact they didn't try to have any technical breaktroughs with this film and invested more time into the characterizations. Again, great choice! The watercolour backgrounds give a very unique and refreshing look!<br/><br/>Overall this is an almost perfect movie which can be seen by kids and adults alike. Kids won't be scared by the aliens and adults will get off on the great humour - watch for some cool movie refrences!"

","if there is one thing I love about some Disney movies today is the level of realism involved as opposed to my day I went with three other people around my age and found we laughed more than my seven year old niece but it still is a movie for children which makes it so good. the movie is about a little girl with an attitude named Lilo and her equally mind-set sister nani shortly after lilo wishes for a pet enters stich lilo instantly falls in love with the destrucive animal only to discover he's a hawaiian space dog sent to destroy the earth. this movie also adds the sorrow of custody woes some children may find to sad but this is otherwise a good movie for kids and adults (with kids)"

","This is a fantastic movie, not even so much for the plot (okay) or the characters (great) but for the world we get to visit: Hawaii! But it's even better than the real Hawaii - it's a Hawaii without bugs, without the ungodly heat, and with only a few tourists. It's so charming, and the dreamy watercolor backgrounds are so stunningly beautiful, I am ready to get on a plane! <br/><br/>Of course, Uncle Walt had bigtime ""issues"" and the parents, as in most Disney flicks, are dead. In my opinion, most Disney movies have elements that are just too dark for a kid under age 10. I seriously question whether it's appropriate to ask a small child (the target audience, here) to deal with concepts as scary as being taken away from your family by a social worker, but at least it's a *whole* lot gentler than Bambi!

"divaclv","Null","1","1","2 July 2002"," Tart and tender offering from Disney
","Filled with surprising depth and charm, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is proof that Disney hasn't entirely lost their touch, and that cel animation is still a very viable medium.  The film lacks the grandeur of earlier efforts, and the music is almost purely from Elvis Presley (this is not, by any means, a bad thing), but there's something here that Disney's earlier efforts have been lacking: real heart, and honest characters.<br/><br/>Lilo is a Hawaiian girl with a morbid streak and a lot of pent-up agression. She has good cause: her parents have recently died in a car crash, leaving her in the care of her elder sister Nani.  Nani tries her best but she's not quite ready for the adulthood thing, nor is Lilo willing to accept Nani as an authority figure: ""I like you better as a sister than as a mother,"" she confides at one point.  Precocious without being cloying, realisticly bratty without being unlikeable, Lilo effortlessly endears herself to the audience.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Lilo's classmates aren't too thrilled with her, so Nani takes her to find companionship in the form of a dog.  Instead, Lilo finds a strange blue koala-like creature whom she christens ""Stitch.""  Stitch is in truth an alien known as Experiement 626.  Created for destruction and regarded by the alien council as an abberation of nature, Stitch was condemned to exile but escaped and wound up in our part of the galaxy. Like the title character of last year's ""Shrek,"" Stitch is an unlikely protagonist: importuned by the leader of the galactic council to show some sign of goodness, he responds with language that, had it been translated into English, would probably have knocked the film's rating up a notch. It is his growth through the story that makes Stitch, and the film, so appealing.<br/><br/>While Lilo and Stitch gradually transform each other, the latter is being pursued by his creator and a nervous ""Earth expert,"" while the latter is threatened with being taken from Nani to a foster home.  The Social Services director on the girls' case, a massive man oddly (yet somehow appropriately) named Cobra Bubbles, serves as an example of the depth of the characters. In many other films, Bubbles would have been a two-dimentional symbol of an uncaring beaurocracy--here, he displays strong flashes of sympathy and humor.  Truth be told, with the possible exception of a humongous, shark-like alien general, there are no real bad guys in ""Lilo and Stitch""--only real people fighting because of conflicting desires.<br/><br/>The resolution of ""Lilo and Stitch"" is rather abrupt, sorting out the conflict with almost buisness-like efficiency.  But the journey is an entertaining and moving one, and the characters we share it with, while a little rough around the edges, make the ride a good one."

This girl, Lilo, adopts what she thinks is a dog, but is really the most dangerous alien in all of the universe. She names this ""dog"" Stitch.

"MovieCrap","Null","1","1","3 July 2002"," ""Stitch"" brings the mouse back to life!
","Disney brings back watercolor backgrounds, not since 1941's Dumbo, in this stunningly-awesome looking animated movie. Even with that to boot, Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders managed to come up with a respectable plot that wasn't a complete rip off of E.T. (1982) or even, well, Mac and Me (1988). It's funny to see that the average person who doesn't enjoy any type of Disney production has been favoring this movie more than others, as I feel, it's a pretty nice step for the company. Disney goes flat-out to create a funny character put into a situation where only large laughs are going to occur. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) tried so hard to accomplish that, but fell just short of a home run. `Stitch' gets that extra foot or two.<br/><br/>After being created by a mad scientist named Jumba (David Ogden Stiers), Stitch (Chris Sanders) is immediately set aside as a misfit and ordered to spend his life on a remote asteroid. After finding his way to a spacecraft, Stitch outruns the galactic police and crash lands in Hawaii, where is wounded and treated in an animal shelter as a dog. The following day, Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a lonely and misunderstood young girl, arrives at the shelter to adopt a dog after her sister Nani (Tia Carrere) allows her to.<br/><br/>Along with the frustrating social worker Mr. Bubbles (Ving Rhames), Stitch proves to be too much for the sisterly duo. Their own relationship, scarred by the death of their parents, starts to fall apart. Lilo feels that Stitch is the only one who understands her, her sister just doesn't respect her anymore, and her peers don't seem to be accepting her at all. Two relationships in this movie are key, with Lilo & Stitch and Lilo & Nani. Acting as the stronger point, Lilo helps transform Stitch and Nani into different people with different priorities, the main one being family.<br/><br/>`Ohana,' which means `family,' seems to be one of the largest elements in this film. Being referenced numerous times by Lilo throughout the film, it eventually starts to grow onto Nani and Stitch, until they use it themselves by the end of the film to  well, you'll have to see it for yourselves. Reading some user comments on the film, it seems that most Hawaiians are glad that the message of `ohana' is being used, and the meaning is becoming known a little better. It's almost like if people in Japan made a movie and had the main character say `Yeah baby, yeah!' dozens upon dozens of times. It represents our great culture, so it feels good to let others know about it.<br/><br/>The comic character is there, the sappy child-left-behind character is there, the setting is there. Everything seems to be `there' for this really un-sappy (besides a few short moments) cartoon. Oh, and did I mention that this one is awesome enough to contain no please-cry-because-I'm-lonely songs sung by the characters? Just some good ole' fashioned Elvis playing. Even without the tunes, this movie would still be rock n' rollin'.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","I can't explain it, and I think I don't even have the words for it to describe how I feel after watching this new Disney movie. I am a great Disney fan, and a movie like SHREK could only amuse me once as where with Disney movies I see them as often as I can. Stitch is something that first makes you feel like you want to leave the theater. Not because Stitch is awful not because you don't like the caracter,it is just a feeling like 'this is not Disney'. But after a while you find yourself leaning back in your seat, enjoying the fun we also know from the Disney/Pixar movies, and although I'd rather heard some new songs instead of some old Elvis songs, it's okay after a while. When I went to the cinema again to watch another movie, I found myself in doubt, did I want to see a new movie? Stitch however was able to draw me back to watch the movie for a second time. It's still an unusual Disney movie, but I like the fact that they are so daring and not afraid of competition from other companies out there. Disney proves, not only their movies, even the company will always remain a 'classic', hard to remove from the world stage! thumbs up!"

","If you choose to believe in the Disney tradition of family and all that it stands for, then this is THE film to see this year.<br/><br/>Clever, charming, funny and witty are just pieces of what makes this film so good. The other parts are brilliant animation, superb background work and a sound track that is second to none.<br/><br/>Not since the Disney film `Dumbo' has watercolour been used as background -- and never more effectively.<br/><br/>The use of watercolour goes beyond effective -- it is magnificent. The backgrounds of the scenes envelop and surround the viewer with warmth and familiarity -- even if you have never been to Hawai'i.<br/><br/>The voice casting is surprising -- yet so appropriate: Tia Carrere as Nani, Kevin McDonald as Pleakley, David Ogden Stiers as Jumba and the incomparable Ving Rhames as Cobra Bubbles the enforcer' are all completely correct.  As a film watcher you could not ask for anything more.  The only credit missing is Daveigh Chase as Lilo -- the heart and soul of this great film.<br/><br/>There is much to praise here: the story, the animation, the soundtrack and all that makes a truly good film but suffice it to say that this if a film that you really do need to see. It will bring laughs to both children and adults and tears to anyone that has ever had an emotion."

","This is a nice, pleasant movie and a heck of a lot better than many recent Disney cartoons (such as POCAHONTAS, HUNCHBACK and HERCULES). Most of the reason it's pretty likable is the film's sense of humor and light touch. However, at the same time, this film is targeting kids and perhaps teens and seems to make no attempt to hook adults. While some adults surely liked the film, it's hard to imagine many of them who preferred this to the many other wonderful Disney full-length cartoons. LILO AND STICH is just too inconsequential and light to ever compare to LITTLE MERMAID, BAMBI, PINOCCHIO and especially BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Now this is not meant as serious criticism--just explaining who the intended audience is and who will most likely like the film. My kids (one of which was a teen) loved it and I felt like I was just there for the ride. Inoffensive to adults and full of silly hi-jinx that the kids will no doubt love."

Lilo was a brat who attacked and bit another little girl in her first scene. She and her sister screamed at each other in a fit of rage, then upon making up concluded, ""That's how sisters act"" or something like that. There was the threat of the small family being ripped apart during the entire movie.  Stitch was not cute in the least.  The scene of him being run over by an 18-wheeler was surely terrifying for small children.  The only comic relief came from the 2 aliens sent to retrieve Stitch.  And although they were quite funny, they certainly couldn't redeem the entire movie. Finally at the end, Stitch redeems himself and it appears that the family will stay together, but it was too little too late.  And there was way to much violence, yelling, bad behavior, etc. for small children to be witnessing. My children will never see this movie again."

","""Lilo and Stitch"" has my vote as being the worst animation movie I have ever seen. It is violent, tasteless,  inappropriate for children, unfunny, uninteresting and terribly disconnected. It is unclear to me what on earth might have been the purpose of making this movie (other than profit ) from a company with past glorious reputation in animated movies. The story line centers around an alien fugitive beast in Hawaii which is being hunted by alien monsters of various kinds. Throughout the entire movie, I could not hear any of the 20 or so children in the theater making any expression of laughter,  delight, or joy but were rather perplexed (as I was) that how they were duped into watching such a senseless story.  The opening credits site the movie was based on ""an idea by Chris Sanders"". One may wish Mr. Sanders would keep his ideas to himself in future."

It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.<br/><br/>This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls ""an alternative family"". This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she couldn't already learn from the gutter.<br/><br/>This trash is further evidence why many have boycotted and continue to boycott Disney.

","There is a great deal of charm to Lilo & Stitch. I'm always a sucker for movies that celebrate the bonds of family, I have a fascination for movies that take place in Hawaii, and the sci-fi element doesn't hurt either. This is yet another in a never-ending line of Walt Disney films that deal with orphaned children, but I appreciated that this movie explored the real-life struggles that children face when left without parents. I also found Ving Rhames voicing the big burly social worker to be a humorous addition, while maintaining the reality of how these broken family situations can lead to problems keeping the kids together under the same roof. The odd juxtaposition of aliens tracking a runaway monster with this realistic family drama makes this film truly unique. I found most of their bumbling attempts to trap Stitch to be the funniest aspect of the film.<br/><br/>I think where I struggle in accepting the plot structure of Lilo & Stitch is the abruptly shifting behavior of Stitch. First of all, when the doctor establishes what he was designed to do, we are supposed to view this creature as a danger to all life as we know it. Yet his behavior continues to present as merely mischievous. He never seems to desire death and destruction, just general trouble-making. I've seen April Fool's Day jokes that are more dangerous than Stitch. Then it takes relatively little time, and not much correction to turn him into an upstanding member of the family who actively tries to save Lilo's life more than once. My dog isn't even that quick to learn proper behavior, and she's not biologically programmed for evil. All that aside, for what it is, Lilo & Stitch is a high-quality film. It has a lot of heart, and plays on familiar themes in a way that should please audiences of all ages."

","Disney steps outside its comfort zone with this mashup of Hawaiian culture and alien invasions. Like the toothy, sharp little blue furball at the center of all the drama, the film is loud and impulsive, recklessly chasing stray plot threads and then abruptly abandoning them for another distraction.<br/><br/>It's far less careful and composed than the studio's usual feature work, which serves as both a positive and a negative. On one hand, it's fresh and different; a necessary (and welcome) new direction for a company that had been making movies for six-plus decades at the time. On the other, well, it just feels like something produced by the competition. It lacks that certain bit of polish, that magical sense of balance. Stitch, the aforementioned extraterrestrial beast, is a far cry from the standard Disney archetype, even in extreme circumstances. His audacious, violent nature lends itself to some impressive action scenes and a few laughs, but damages the character's sudden, climactic transition into a concerned, invested member of the family. He effectively flips a switch and wakes up, and that's not much of an arc. The human characters fare a bit better - their story has more emotional heft - but they, too, leave a lot on the table.<br/><br/>Still, despite all that, I enjoyed myself. The film's got personality and heart, its unique locale plays an important thematic role and factors directly into the climax, the action bits work very well and the visuals are stylish and interesting (I like the trend toward minimalism). Consider it a lighter entry in the catalog."

Even though I think that either critics or audiences or both were a little too harsh on certain Disney movies of the 00's, I can certainly see why Lilo & Stitch reigns supreme as the best of the second dark age of Disney. <br/><br/>It all comes down to one simple thing: the story. <br/><br/>Lilo & Stitch takes up great themes of family and responsibility. The relationship between Nani and Lilo is so real and touching. Spicing it up with an alien coming to Earth was an odd choice, but Stitch is both cute, entertaining and serves a purpose. A big one actually. <br/><br/>I'd say that that is both a blessing and a curse, because it gives the movie a feel of wanting to be two movies at the same time. It is not as distracting as, let's say, Meeko and Percy in Pocahontas or the gargoyls in Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Stitch steals the show and I first discovered the real heart of the movie when I watched it again as an adult. No hate, just a note. But it makes the movie unique in its own way and therfor it does not affect my rating.<br/><br/>I love the characters! No one is dragging the movie down. They're all likable and entertaining, but Nani and Lilo are the emotional center of the movie. David Ogden Stiers' performance as Jumba is my favorite along with Chris Sanders as Stitch and Daveigh Chase as Lilo.

This makes the piece an incredibly inclusive experience, in terms of its portrayal and its messages, that makes a point of pointing out the misfit in us all and making the most of the emotional satisfaction that occurs when it finally finds a home. It is easily one of my favourite Disney movies, mainly because of its positive outlook and emotional connectivity.

","Ok, so I hate to say it. I have NEVER seen this film until yesterday. And everyone is saying I should review it. Everyone got me hyped. And... I don't just like this film. I REALLY like this film. Okay so it's not Lion King, but it's still up there with something like Treasure Planet or Bambi for me. The story is Lilo is a young Hawaiian girl who adopts a pet she thinks is a dog. In real life this is an alien named Stitch. He is an experiment made by Jumba Jookiba, an alien scientist who, along with his friend Pleakley, is on the chase to find Stitch and take him back to his home planet. So obviously my favorite part is Stitch. This guy is so funny and so original for Disney. And then there's Lilo. I don't think she's terrible, but I think she's kind of Boring... as for the aliens, Jumba is pretty funny and gets a few laughs, Pleakley is pretty funny as well. I just wish I got that with Lilo. In fact, I thought all of the human characters were boring. But for the aliens, I do recommend this visually and comedic gem."

","Lilo and Stitch (2002) is comedic family film filled with irony. The story consists of a genetically engineered alien, Stitch voiced by Chris Sanders, landing on earth and using a dysfunctional family, Lilo voiced by Daveigh Chase and Nani voiced by Tia Carrere, threatened to be separated by Child Protection Services as a cover. The irony exist in how similar Lilo and Stitch truly are. Lilo is somewhat an outcast, unruly and undisciplined much like Stitch who is also destructive.<br/><br/>Chris Sanders, creator of ""The Lion King"" and Dean DeBlois, co-creator of ""Mulan,"" maintain their fine ability to match musical tracks and scores with the location and feel of the film. The opening song, He Mele No Lilo performed by Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu, effectively placed my mind in Hawaii. Elvis,' Heartbreak hotel captures the essence of Lilo's mood after her episode at the dance academy. The music portrayed in this film was perfect.<br/><br/>The animation was consistent with animated films of its time, but the vibrant water colors made the movie pop. The film had equal parts of child comedy and adult comedy making it fun for all. When agent Pleakly, voiced by Kevin McDonald, generalized the human race as not intellectually apt, I found it hilarious especially at the end. Mr. Bubbles, voiced by Ving Rhames, is ironically named because he is far from bubbly. Overall this film is a class act for all."

I enjoyed lilo and stitch and how they showed the different culture. Also, with the lesson of Ohana. With Lilo and Stitch I like how Stitch is a heartless monster and he builds a relationship with Lilo to become a better monster and evolves into a better friend for Lilo who did not make any friends. I thought it was hilarious to see that they used Elvis Presley as Stitch's inspiration to try to become a model citizen. I saw this when I was younger and enjoyed this movies just as much. And seeing Stitch feel guilty showing that he was more than a monster, but was adapting to normal emotions that make us all a being. Finally I loved the ending where Stitch wanted to say good bye before he left and he was able to stay with Lilo."

The large focus of the movie on sisterly and friendly relationships is rejuvenating and the unique location of the hawaiian island also adds to the story.

","Lilo and Stitch is one of my favorite Disney movies as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well, she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc. and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your heart with out being known as a loser to the incredible SpongeBob. 10 out of 10"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","3 January 2016"," One of the best films Disney has made in decades
","Lilo & Stitch is something of an oddball for a Disney film. After Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis had failed to bring in the kind of money needed to make them successful, Lilo & Stitch was given a much smaller budget, but also a lot more freedom when it came to story and style. The end result is something you almost wouldn't recognize as a Disney film if you didn't know better. But I mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>The story goes that an extra-terrestrial space government sentences a dangerous lifeform simply known as Experiment 626 to an exile on a lonely asteroid. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on the point of view, the lifeform, about to be known as Stitch, escapes and ends up in Hawaii on planet Earth. There he meets a little native girl known as Lilo, who ends up adopting him as her new ""dog"". The story shifts between the two story lines about Stitch being hunted by the space government and Lilo being potentially taken away by social workers because her parents have died and her sister is struggling to take care of her.<br/><br/>The plot alone would make this an intriguing film, but what really makes this such a wonderful movie is its warmth and maturity. Nani, Lilo's older sister, is not a bad person, despite being unable to take care of her sister properly. Instead she's shown as being a very brave young woman who has been pushed into an impossible situation. I like the maturity that shows on the film makers's part a lot. Lilo and Stitch are also very good characters, shifting effortlessly between typical Disney antics and surprising bouts of tangible maturity.<br/><br/>The story itself is rather basic, given the ludicrous setting. Nothing all that surprising or unexpected happens, but it doesn't have to. It's not that kind of film. It's a film you see for the characters and the emotions. For the message. And all those are spot on.<br/><br/>I also really like the visuals. It's not animated in the usual Disney style, but you can see enough of it for it to feel familiar. And all the new stuff being brought in works very well for the film's advantage, giving it a lot of energy and soul. Sure, it's not on bar with, say, Tarzan or Sleeping Beauty in terms of animation, but given the small budget, I'm more than impressed. The score is also nice, featuring songs by Elvis in addition to some new songs that evoke the feel of Hawaii.<br/><br/>This is a great film no matter how you look at it. Its heart and warmth will stay with you for a long time and it was one of the first signs that Disney could still make great films even in the new century. See it, if you haven't already."

","This movie brought me to tears the other night. It was a classic for me as a kid (pretty sure I have a VHS copy of it stashed somewhere in the basement...), for its simple storyline and cute and relatable characters. It wasn't until watching it as an adult that I got to see the deeper elements of the movie. I fully understood how Lilo acted out and how truly broken her family is. Lilo and her sister live in what's left of the house their parents left behind. Her sister works odd jobs to make ends meet, and Lilo is socially awkward and unable to make friends. But underneath this, she has a heart of gold. And so does her companion, Stitch, who created as just an experiment by aliens in another galaxy, longs for a family. The scene in the forest where he cries out ""I'm Lost"", in the hopes that his family will come find him, had me sobbing. <br/><br/>This is a truly heart warming and enjoyable movie for all ages. Lilo and Stitch will touch your heart and make you feel things, and if they don't accomplish that, at least they will make you smile along the way."

","My analysis for the movie Lilo and stitch was a very funny and heart warming movie. It taught me that when you aren't looking for something it will always be there. I think that when stitch was all alone and he was looking for someone he is didn't realize that what he was looking for was a family. In the movie there're was a phrase family never gets left behind. I think that it was an extremely sweet when Stitch came back to save Lilo. When I watched this movie I had a lot of laughs, it may or may not seem like a funny movie, but if you watch the movie then you could really learn that family is everything and that they will always be there for you mono matter what. You may learn a different lesson, but the main point that the director is trying to get across, is that family everything. This movie was very funny and I think that the next Lilo and Stitch movie will be even funnier. To sum up what I've said is that the moral part of the movie is that family is every thing and no one gets left behind."

"pupupupmf","10","0","0","9 August 2015"," Why I think it's the best Disney animation.
","Which are the Disney undisputed all-time classics? Why The Lion King and Aladdin or course. sure, The Lion King is stellar and Aladdin has the genie... and uh... it has the genie. anyone will say that Disney's golden decade was the 90's which to me is the one where they all started singing for some reason to the point where I was relieved when Phil Collins would do the singing in Tarzan and Brother Bear. To me, the two golden decades of Disney was the 60's (101 dalmatians, The Sword in the Stone, The Jungle Book and The Aristocats) and the early 00's. yeah, sure, Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Brother Bear where kinda mediocre. But The Emperor's New Groove, Treasure Planet and Lilo & Stitch was Disney waking up from there 90's musical/princess/cheesefest trip. Emperor's New Groove was more self-aware and fourth-wall breaking than anything else, Treasure Planet was more ambitious and refreshing than anything else but Lilo & Stitch was just nothing like anything else in the Disney catalog. Then, drawn animation officially died in 2003 when Finding Nemo came out but let's not be resentful of the past, shall we. we're here to talk about Lilo & Stitch.<br/><br/>The movie starts of in the extra-terrestrial world where Stitch (currently called experiment 626) and Dr. Jumba are both on trial. Jumba is accused of having created Stitch and Stitch is accused of being Stitch. From this very first scene, everything works beautifully, you feel engaged and sucked into this super cool setup and it's characters including the grand councilwoman (yes, that's her official name) and Captain Gantu. Then, Stitch escapes effortlessly, flies away with a ship and then crashes on our favorite little blue planet. The galactic government peeps decide to send their own version of Laurel & Hardy (Jumba & Pleakley) to Earth to destroy Stitch. Jumba, because he created Stitch and Pleakley, because he's the alien nerd who knows stuff about Earth. What's so great about Jumba and Pleakley is that they're not evil and stupid because they have to be as Disney antagonists. They're actually very likable and are carrying this mission because Stitch is actually a threat during the beginning of the movie. And the reason they keep failing to catch Stitch is not because they're stupid and clumsy but because Stitch is just impossible to catch, which makes it so brilliant.<br/><br/>We then get to the good people of Kauai, introducing Lilo and her older sister, Nani. And that's where this wonderful little Disney feature get's very heavy and emotional. Lilo and Nani are orphaned sisters and Nani being the young adult, has to take care of Lilo all by herself, under the supervision of the harsh but fair social worker, Cobra Bubbles. They are all introduced in that first infamously heart-grabbing scene that some will remember having cried to back in the day and maybe still today. The wonderful yet heartbreaking connection that Lilo has with Stitch is that Lilo, too, acts like a strange and destructive alien and can't fit in with anyone due to the troma of having lost both her parents and only having her caring sister left as a parent figure who yet is patience-limited at times while going under the stress of her little sister's odd behavior and finding a job so that the social worker won't have to take Lilo away from her (yes, it's a Disney movie we're talking about). I don't think I have ever seen a film or animation that shows a truer and rawer depiction of sibling relationship, while struggling under the burden of living as a broken family.<br/><br/>Eventually, Lilo meets and adopts Stitch in a dog adoption home, as he makes himself look like and act like a dog to stay undercover while trying to get Jumba and Pleakley off his tail. From the point Stitch comes in the picture with Lilo and Nina, he starts of acting destructive and careless while Lilo constantly finds an appeal to him and tries to tame him and soothe him all while Nina is very skeptical of Stitch.<br/><br/>Why I think Lilo & Stitch is the best is because it's made for everyone and has the power to move anyone. Everything feels so true and organic, the attention to detail when it comes to timing, dialogue, comedy, little actions and mannerisms, character relations and personalities and the loyal attention to Kauai's culture when it comes to the dancing and the music makes Lilo & Stitch's quality the same level as an award-nominated live-action movie and if Lilo & Stitch was adapted perfectly as a live-action movie and it could be (even though, I don't want it to be), it would still be amazing but of course not as amazing as it's original form. go watch it."

","Set in the modern times, Disney made more justifiable use of modern-day dialog; however, even so, the script was not overblown with mindless jokes and Hollywood-style clichés. It's a good, well-balanced and captivating film about a Hawaiian girl named Lilo who adopts a fugitive alien (whom she later names Stitch), on the run from the mad alien scientist who created him and is on orders to take him back to their planet for incarceration.<br/><br/>It's a fun story full of laughable moments and adventures, from Stitch constantly getting Lilo and her old sister Nani in trouble with their social worker to Stitch dodging his pursuing captors left and right. The subplot about Nani trying to keep Lilo from being taken away by social services and the theme about ""no family gets left behind"" are very heartfelt points to the story and provides redeeming qualities to our character leads and touches of drama to the overall plot. It gives ""heart"" to the movie, something that was sorely missing in the last few Disney entries. It was wonderful seeing how the characters including Lilo and Stitch develop throughout the course of the film. <br/><br/>I would, though, have liked to see our human characters become more alarmed after spotting Stitch and the other aliens, because it is not everyday you see space creatures roam around in your backyard.<br/><br/>The animation is great, capturing the beauty, care-freeness and freshness of Hawaii, and Alan Silvestri's music score is excellent; I especially enjoyed the Hawaiian-theme pieces that Silvestri interwoven into the score.<br/><br/>At 85 minutes, this is a well-paced film with a good balance of comedy, drama, adventures and surprises to keep you entertained and is what I think one of the best Disney animated films to come out of the 2000s.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

The film flips too Lilo the lonely estranged child who we learn is living an almost troubled lifestyle with her sister Nani.

Lilo and Stitch honestly surprised me, recently I viewed this horrible 2013 film called Disney's Frozen and hated it, so I tried something a little less recent, Lilo and Stitch, which came out during a great year of film-making (2002).<br/><br/>Lilo is a little girl living in Hawaii and is seen as a freak by her peers. The snobby girls in her class refuse to speak to her most of the time, and she has no friends. She is also nearly dirt-poor, her mother and father were killed in a car crash recently, leaving her college-aged older sister, Nani, looking after her. Lilo, being a troublemaker at times, causes a mysterious social worker, Mr. Cobra Bubbles, to become increasingly involved with his newest ""case"".<br/><br/>One day Nani takes Lilo to the city pet shelter to adopt a dog, and Lilo finds a blue puppy, whom she names Stitch, for unknown reasons. While Nani tries to hold what's left of her family together so Lilo won't be taken away into foster care, there's an unknown secret about Stitch... he's no puppy, he's a mutant from an alien ship who was arrested but escaped to Earth... and now the various aliens want him destroyed, so they cause all sorts of issues on the island.<br/><br/>Well, one thing is certain, the plot is definitely original. A little girl with no parents adopts a pet alien in Hawaii? Now there's something you don't see every day! The soundtrack was excellent; not only was Elvis Presley featured but an adventurous score was also provided as background music. The voice cast was great, there were many memorable comedic scenes that were hilarious without the use of fart noises, sexual references or racial jokes. One repeated joke that I've loved since I was a kid is the fat tourist who continually keeps dropping his chocolate mint ice cream and never seems to get the chance to eat it. Lilo has some bizarre hobbies, from making voodoo dolls of her classmates and drowning them in pickle brine, to collecting photographs of morbidly obese people on the beach, which she puts up on the wall beside her bed.

","This animated Disney flick was released when I was a teenager, several years after I had lost interest in Disney cartoons. I doubt I ever even heard of ""Lilo & Stitch"" until several years after its theatrical run. I first saw it in late 2006, after reviving my interest in Disney. Even though it's not one of the company's most popular films, I remember loving it at the time! Nearly three years later, I've seen it a second time. I didn't like it nearly as much as I did the first time, nor was I expecting to. Before my second viewing, I was hoping I would be able to give it an 8/10 (didn't think it would be any higher than that this time), which I can't, as it turns out, but at least I can still give it a 7, so I guess it came close to meeting my expectations. <br/><br/>Far from Earth, an evil alien scientist named Dr. Jumba Jookiba is put on trial for illegal genetic experimentation. He has created Experiment 626, a small but aggressive, dangerous, and nearly indestructible creature! The scientist is sentenced to prison, and his creature is to be exiled on an asteroid. However, Experiment 626 manages to escape to Earth, landing in Hawaii! Jumba, along with Agent Pleakley, are sent to capture him. A troubled little girl named Lilo, who has been looked after by her older sister, Nani, since the death of their parents, and doesn't seem to have any friends, lives on the island where the creature has landed. Nani hasn't been doing a very good job looking after her younger sister, and unless she improves soon, social worker Cobra Bubbles will take Lilo to a foster home! The two sisters go to adopt a dog at the animal shelter, where Experiment 626 has ended up. He poses as a dog, and Lilo adopts him and calls him Stitch. As Jumba and Agent Pleakley try to capture him, Stitch causes even more trouble for the sisters, and will make it even harder for them to stay under the same roof! <br/><br/>Early in the story, Lilo can certainly be a pain, doing things like attacking and biting one of her peers! I think the writers went a little too far with her aggressive tendencies! It doesn't help that Nani is also a little over-the-top at times. The conflict between the two sisters could have been done better. Fortunately, despite those problems bringing the movie down, there are still merits. The animation is excellent, with some gorgeous tropical backgrounds, the film may get more entertaining as it goes along, and there are moments of poignancy, often involving Stitch, a very cute character. The second time I watched the film, I was a little disappointed by the humour, but still found some noteworthy gags. I would say the most noteworthy ones (or at least most of them) involve Jumba and Agent Pleakley on Earth, trying the catch Stitch, especially with Pleakley disguised as a woman! Last but not least, ""Lilo & Stitch"" has a good message about the importance of family. All these things make this 2002 Disney effort watchable. Maybe it's more enjoyable for kids, but it does have enough for adults."

The animation's water color backgrounds and character design made me feel like I was going back to an earlier time, a time in my childhood when animation was simpler and much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The constant developments in the relationship between characters, such as Nani and Lilo's evolution from a very strained relationship to a much closer one once the possibility of Lilo being taken away to a foster family, and the changes in Lilo and Stitch's relationship from when they first met, helped shape the strength of the movie's plot, something other movies of the time lack. Scenes such as Lilo and Nani sitting on a hammock at night, letting hibiscus flowers out as they sing ""Aloha Oe"" and Stitch's quote on ""Ohana means family, and family means no one is left behind"" succeed in the movie's central theme of family, a message that is sent through with great elegance.<br/><br/>This movie's strong development of characters and relationships and animation helped make it unique compared to all other flicks of the times.

Their are also lots of songs that soot the movie perfectly.I loved this movies surprising parts. It gets sad, but it ends well. This movie had the voices with a lot of expression for exampul lilo played by daveigh chase that is very expressive. when I saw this movie on tape I wanted to watch it over and over and over again I could not get enough of the music and great scenes.

","The way this film was advertised almost made me miss out on this heartwarming adventure. Far from being a devil in disguise, Stitch is ""cute and fluffy"" but is also full of mischief. That's mischief, not malice. There must have been a miscarriage of justice is all could I think. Lilo matches him because they are both misunderstood. The Elvis/Hawaiian soundtrack is an asset to the film, rather than an annoyance. That is the songs are good, unlike in Tarzan. I wasn't that taken with the supporting aliens but the humans & Stitch made up for them. After a rash of substandard animation, it's good to see a film that Walt would approve. 9/10"

"bkam","Null","0","0","9 June 2003"," Not Disney's Greatest
","Lilo and Stitch in no regard achieves the level of Disney classics like Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King in my mind, possibly because my nostalgia for childhood overshadows the flaws of those films for me.  On the other hand, it does have a number of funny scenes and the same appealing animation. Furthermore, it marks a departure from the fairy-tale trend in earlier Disney movies to give science fiction a go (some of the ways in which it parodies this genre are pretty intelligent).  Lilo is a good character, if somewhat inconsistent, and Stitch supports a large part of the film with his destructive antics.  The movie as a whole, however, never really knows how to resolve the conflicts within itself.  The transformation of Stitch to family member is contrived and marks an artificial conclusion to the film.  Although David's pidgin and many local stereotypes set the atmosphere for the film, it fails to truly reconcile the oddity of the aliens with the Hawaiian setting; the aliens vacillate between being other-worldly and being human.  Such inconsistencies prevent the viewer from feeling really satisfied with the film in its entirety, and while animation normally makes the willing suspension of disbelief easier, this one pushes it.  However, both Lilo and Stitch are reasonably likeable characters, particularly for children (like my sister), and there are enough clever ideas to make the film worth seeing if you're in the mood.

","**TINY SPOILERS**<br/><br/>I've seen this movie over 20 times, and its still cracks me up! A real eye opener for many young kids and helps reveal the real world through the life of Nani and Lilo. It is original b/c it isn't based on the formula of a normal Disney movie i.e. Caucasian characters having asinine problems in the classic films of yore (devouring poisoned apple from old crone, trading voice for human legs and being late to a ball! *gasp* oh the tragedy!) But L&S being set in the gorgeous surrounding of Hawaii takes away the fantasy fairy tale; the movie becomes more genuine and less mechanical stressing that Stitch's violent impulses that have been ""programmed"" into him all disappear when his natural intuition kicks in as he begins the search for family and friendship, and Lilo, a child longing for a friend, was the answer to his prayers and vice versa.<br/><br/>To those of you paranoid about your kids being subjected to violence (Lilo punching some kid in her face) let me just say, THAT was funny and if you're worried about your kids copying whatever they see on tv, well that sounds like a personal problem to me. It is possible for a kid to determine right and wrong and you can EXPLAIN to them that it is only a movieno wait, a CARTOON. What difference does it make if Lilo hits another girl or Daffy Duck SHOOTING himself in the face? Kids see a lot more than just a punch in the face. It's only a cartoon folks, not a bloody Hannibal Lecter special where you point out the bits of iniquity. <br/><br/>The part where Stitch gets run over was even sugar coated with several cute ""squeaks"" He's *indestructible* after all, (well he's bulletproof and all that) The characters are very unique (whoever heard of a dog/koala who plays an electric ukulele? The part with Nani and Lilo were arguing was so real It was uncanny because it was like my sister and I were just animated onto the screen rarely we can relate to characters on screen, especially a cartoon. And if you didn't know this was about a ""broken"" family READ THE MOVIE SUMMARY if it doesn't have one well im sure you were suspicious of the PG rating, it was on there too you know, so don't go blaming the movie if you're kids become violent blue devils. You knew what you were getting into. Parents are totally oblivious to these labels anyway and manage to get Vice City for their innocent 7 year old.<br/><br/>If you love to laugh and having an adorable little alien win your heartyou won't be let down.

","I had almost given up on Disney; the animation is lackluster, the stories are either tired reworking of old plots or feel-good messages with souring soundtracks and flowing hair.  But the advertising for Lilo & Stitch caught my attention for one reason: the main characters are naughty!  They are really messed up!  Lilo, who you have to love from the minute she's introduced, is truly angry, and she shows it.  The bit with the voodoo doll (just see it) was heartbreakingly honest.  And watching Stitch try in vain to destroy San Francisco...  I don't know if I've ever seen characters in a kid's movie be so destructive, even in such a misguided way.  And while, yes, it seems a little simple to say that these two just want to be loved and then all their problems will be solved, there is no denying that little kids DO just want to be loved.  The adult character were equally engaging, and it was nice to see some healthy legs on the big sister.  Come to think of it, Lilo wasn't model thin, either, but that didn't stop her from being adorable.  Unlike some recent (and wonderful) animated films, this doesn't offer as much in the way of ""hidden"" adult jokes.  But sometimes you just gotta pretend you're a kid and go with it."

","Disney has spent the passed few years as the victim of falling box office receipts for its traditionally animated films.  Some (i.e. ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Fantasia 2000"") were because of poor marketing and release schedules.  Others (like ""Atlantis"") just didn't seem to carry the standard of Disney animation.  Well, that all ends with ""Lilo and Stitch"" The story is bright, funny and heartfelt.  While I had heard many warnings about the character of Stitch, I found him to be one of the most unique and interesting of Disney characters.  The writers also did a wonderful job of making Lilo a real kid.  She has a good heart, but doesn't always make the best decisions.  She's smart, but troubled. The return to watercolor backgrounds is a complete success.  Disney hasn't done this in over sixty years and this colorful movie, set in Hawaii, is the perfect film on which to bring back the tradition. While I know that there are many options in what to spend your family movie budget on, believe me that this is the only family movie playing that will be a treat for the whole family and not just the kids.  It's smart and hilarious.  The parents might want to come back on a date to enjoy all by themselves."

","With all the things people say about ""broken"" homes, it's good to see a film that is not afraid to come out and say ""as long as there is love in the family it's all right."" Lilo and her sister are the ""imperfect"" family and when Stitch comes along it becomes even more imperfect. However, as the movie continues it gives comfort to those children who come from homes like this that it's all right and everything will be okay. Lilo and Stitch seem to be the new attitude of Disney films; crass and strange.  Lilo is a manic girl with an overactive imagination, a far cry from the older, dumbed down fairy tale adaptions of decades past. <br/><br/>  That's not to say that SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is inferior to this movie, they're just diffrent. I think kids of today, while still in awe of the earlier films, will identify with Lilo and Stitch, two obviously flawed characters, than a perfect woman and a charming young prince.

I found the message in line with the general philosophy of Polynesian culture - family pride is huge, not only in Hawaii, but in other Pacific Islands as well.

An alien that is antisocial and destructive finds the idea of love appealing? Throughout the film, the characters do things that are not that socially acceptable. For example, in the initial part of the film, the girl locks herself in the house, and refuses to open the door for her sister. She does not open the door even when the sister gives an emotional plea. Another example is the unreasonable behaviour of the girl demanding the adoption of Stitch. In addition, the constantly destructive behaviour of Stitch is glamourised. What kind of message are we sending to kids? I am so disappointed with this film.

","""Lilo and Stitch"" is one of the better Disney flicks released in recent years. Some points...<br/><br/>1. The film eschews CGI in favour for traditional hand drawn cell animation and a palette of beautiful water colours (water colour backgrounds haven't been used by Disney since the 1940s).<br/><br/>2. The plot is a merger of ""Critters"" and ""ET"", in which a little girl befriends an alien and learns various life lessons. Though at times generic, the film has enough interesting flourishes to differentiate it from most other Disney flicks.<br/><br/>3. The alien at the heart of the picture is not a cutesy creature, but a military weapon designed to destroy planets. Half the fun of the picture is watching this thing crawling about, cleverly adapting to situations and juggling its biological need to destroy with that of self-preservation.<br/><br/>4. The character of Lilo is not your typical Disney kid, but a truly bizarre little girl who mutters matter-of-fact statements about a fish who controls the weather and a stuffed doll whose days are numbered because a bug laid eggs in its ear.<br/><br/>5. The film tries hard to mimic the style and tone of Hayao Miyazaki, but doesn't quite manage.<br/><br/>6. There's some neat psychology in the film. Stitch is like the embodiment of Lilo's self-destructiveness, her need to destroy everything, lashing out because she's an outcast and lost her parents in an accident. By taming Stitch, Lilo tames her own inner turmoil.<br/><br/>7. Like ""ET"", the alien is a sort of surrogate family member who heals the family unit.<br/><br/>8. The opening coda and the final act are weak. You have a nice character study here, which is constantly being sabotaged by erroneous crap. Less action scenes and more drama would have turned this into something special. IE – ""My Neighbour Totoro"".<br/><br/>9. The opening credit sequence is great.<br/><br/>10.

The reason why I'm giving this a 9/10 is because it's not in the same depth as ""The Lion King"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", and several of Disney's films, but it's an emotionally entertaining that still holds up for me as a young adult.<br/><br/>The story is original with a nice concept: An experiment made by Dr. Jumbaa with his assistant Dr. Pleakley escapes from a ship and lands in Hawaii where Lilo, a step-sister to Nani, meets him and adopts him before she names him Stitch. It also has some beautiful emotional moments especially the relationship between Lilo and Nani. There are other redeeming qualities such as the likable and charming characters, some excellent voice work from a cast including Chris Sanders, David Ogen Stiers, Kevin McDonald, and others, it's terrific music score from Alan Silvestri and it's beautiful animation with beautiful backgrounds and decent character designs.<br/><br/>Overall, Lilo & Stitch is one of the childhood favorites that I usually love and I still love it right now since it's celebrating it's 10 anniversary.

","Yup, I'll give it a ten. Lilo & Stitch is right up there with classics like Dumbo and Peter Pan. It's wonderful to see Disney when they get it right.<br/><br/>In this case, getting it right meant taking some risks. The animation and art work in L&S are big, bright, and different. Computer aided animation is used sparingly and effectively, particularly in a couple of dance scenes that to my eye made use of some motion capture techniques.<br/><br/>The bigger risk here, though, is with a storyline that's somewhat edgier than you'd usually find in a Disney family film. Edgy to the point of earning the movie an unusual PG rating. Lilo is not the most sympathetic of Disney heroines, and her family situation is presented with surprising frankness.<br/><br/>There are some lovely messages here, perhaps most prominently that the family you choose can be just as important as the family you're born with. Even with this degree of meaning, though, L&S wouldn't be worth the time it takes to watch if it weren't entertaining as well. Stitch is a very original character, and his creator Jumba is hilarious. The whole Elvis angle shouldn't work at all, but it actually manages to add some charm to the story.<br/><br/>Disney animators should look back at this film as clear evidence that traditional 2D animation is far from dead. Instead of trying to compete with Pixar by producing marginal material like Chicken Little, they should leave Pixar to its strength, and return to their own."

","While the overriding message of ""Lilo and Stitch"" has been mined before in films such as ""Babe"" and ""Shrek"" (that appearances are deceiving and we should learn to tolerate the differences in others) and the film leans toward the stereotypes of Hawaiian culture, it succeeds greatly in the relationship between Lilo, a friendless young girl, and Stitch, a malevolent creature from another galaxy who crash-lands on Earth. The humor doesn't always connect, but the story is an offbeat fusing of fantasy and reality that becomes a showcase for the crazed Stitch and outsider Lilo, which is the moving core of the film.

","The first time I went to watch Lilo and Stitch, I went into it with the attitude that it was going to be another sub-par Disney cartoon, in the same ranks as many of the recent sub-par sequels.(102 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp 2, etc.)  I had also heard that is was simply a new version of E.T.'s story.<br/><br/>I am glad to say, that in my opinion, it is neither. While it may resemble E.T.'s story, in that an alien comes to earth and befriends a child, you will never love E.T. like you love Stitch. He's adorable. Also I think Lilo and Stitch is far more entertaining.<br/><br/>The beautiful artwork and animation, the wonderful soundtrack, and loveable characters make this a welcomed breath of fresh air to all Disney fans. And while it may not be in the same league as the gargantuan masterpieces such as The Lion King, it surely stands on its own as a unique and awesome movie.<br/><br/>
In an age of computer animation, Lilo and Stitch brings Disney back to its roots, where it thrives. I am not against computer animation, however, by showing that Disney's ""magic"" can still be reached using traditional animation (albeit combined with some computer animation) is a step in the right direction, that will hopefully bring Disney back to its past glory."

","If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. If you hated this movie, you obviously don't know what a good movie is.  This movie is top notch on every level, with the exception of acting, since it is an animated feature.  The animation is unbelievable, the cast is terrific, the humor is PERFECT, the story is great, and the runtime is good.  I read in the Boston Globe that Stitch was ugly. They said that he isn't even, ""so ugly he's cute, he's just altogether ugly.""  I couldn't disagree with this more. Stitch is the cutest character, in my opinion, ever to be put on screen, he is cool, and he has a funny voice.  The humor as well as the story and content is very adult-based and warning to parents, some kids may get scared.  Nevertheless, this movie is recommended to EVERY movie viewer."

","I had the chance to watch Ice Age, Monsters, Inc. and Lilo & Stitch all within the space of about 3 days.  My choice:  Lilo and Stitch.<br/><br/>This might surprise some who are aware of the reputation of the other two, along with such monster hits as Toy Story and Shrek.  I still think that Lilo and Stitch beats them all.<br/><br/>What hit me is the depth of characterization and story.  Lilo is a truly interesting, unique, and complex character;  Stitch is not far behind. In comparison, the characters in the other movies are cardboard cutouts. Somebody on L & S spent some time *writing* instead of thinking up in-jokes and amazing CGI.  It shows.  I identified very closely with both main characters, which really sold me on the entire idea.<br/><br/>L & S made me *think*, and *feel*, which any story, any movie really ought to do.<br/><br/>In comparison, the other animated movies are cute but not engaging.

While making fun of their most successful movies, Stitch actually embodied the ""bad boy"" image Disney tried to make him out to be.<br/><br/>Sure, his emotional transformation is not exactly unexpected, but the story and how the plot moves along is certainly more innovative than some of the recent fare Disney has churned out. All be said, the people who brought us Mickey Mouse have created yet another memorable character in Stitch. Sure, the movie was your typical kiddie movie, but there proved to be never be a dull moment."
"Missykender","10","1","2","24 June 2002"," One of the first truly original Disney animated films, ever!
","I knew this film would be different from the instant the credits rolled, when they read ""based on an idea from Chris Sanders"".  Wow...an original IDEA, not a knock-off of some old fairy tale.<br/><br/>This is a lovely film.  It's beautiful to look at:  The backgrounds are dazzling hand-painted watercolor backdrops, a technique that hasn't been seen from Disney since the 1960's.  It gives the viewer a sense that this film was lovingly rendered by artists, rather than much of the impersonal computer-generated images we've seen of late.<br/><br/>The stark reality of Lilo's situation may disturb some extremely young viewers, as she tries to cope with the loss of her parents.  The writers are to be commended for not trying to soften the very real problems her broken family faces.  It is still very evident, however, that she and her sister love each other, and that they are frantically trying to make their situation work.<br/><br/>As in many recent animated successes, they've figured out that satire works, and the film is peppered with pop-culture references that some of the younger viewers might miss altogether.  (There are also a few visual references to some other Disney animated films, which a keen-eyed viewer should be able to pick out.)<br/><br/>The music is wonderful:  Some great Elvis classics, and a lovely new original musical score that transports you to the Hawaiian Isles.<br/><br/>Overall, I haven't enjoyed a film this much since ""The Iron Giant"", which was of a similar quality and story, but unfortunately did poorly in the box office.  I devoutly hope that the same thing doesn't happen in this case, and that people will let the studio know with their pocketbooks that we wish to see more quality films like this!<br/><br/>I thought this film was definitely a 10 out of 10, this is one which will be in my permanent DVD collection!"

","I keep wondering: Where is Disney going? There was a time when each movie they made was as good or better than the one before, namely ""The little mermaid"", ""The Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"". That era is certainly over. They even used these for ""Lilo & Stitch"" advertising campaign.<br/><br/>""Lilo & Stitch"" is 85 minutes of fun, kids and adults will like it just as any other of the last Disney movies, and as such is nowhere near becoming a memorable film like the other movies I mentioned. That's what I think Disney is missing. The best animation movies since ""The Lion King"" that came out under the Disney label were all Pixar's productions: the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""A bug's life"" and ""Monsters Inc."".<br/><br/>Maybe the original idea was to make a movie about a character that was completely different than any other they've made before. I think that idea got lost in the way. From the trailers and advertising we got the impression that Stitch was going to be next to Bart Simpson as the most mischievous cartoon character of all, but it turned out to be a lot more subtle. What kept them?<br/><br/>I'm beginning to think that Disney will not be on the vanguard of animation again for a long time and instead will be following Dreamworks' steps. Too bad."

I found the kid and her sister's situation believable(to a point...), the characterizations of the kid realistic-she's obnoxious, lonely, loud, ummm tries to do the right thing but winds up making things worse on herself and her sister in the process, all those kinds of things real kids do. The animation and her dialogue brought to mind Charlie Brown/Calvin and Hobbes at their best, and that ain't a bad source to build on.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian locale-hula dancing, garlands, surfing, the music-all done up the right way too. I applaud the way 'Cobra Bubbles/Ving Rhames/Marcellus Wallace Jr.' was Not made to be either the Bad Guy or the Fool-just a hard guy trying to do a hard job.<br/><br/>Bravo to the animators who gave us the Laurel and Hardy twins-Big 'Russki Science' Alien and the skinny proper 3PO Envrironmentalist-they were a hoot. Very funny drag/Stranger in a strange land type gags. David Ogden Stiers(Winchester on MASH) has made himself a second career by doing all these Disney voices-the clock in 'Beast', for example-and here does another great job as the Russki Scientist.<br/><br/>*2009 Update* This was also the last really good, classic Disney tunes in the 'Disney Rennaissance from '89-02, it was the first big one since '99's Tarzan, it holds up rather well today in '09 too. Odd that Disney didn't keep w/ this same crew, this had potential for more. <br/><br/>I think that they overdid the 'Hani means family...' line a couple times too much, and yeah the 'taking aliens for granted' by everyone involved was a wee questionable-but beyond that, not a problem.<br/><br/>***1/2, really worth yer time."

Several times in the plot the writers paint themselves into a corner and have to do some hand waving to keep the movie going.<br/><br/>The scientist chasing Stitch (Dr. Jumba) is intent on the capture of Stitch and will settle for his destruction.  But all Stitch has to do is to mumble the word ""family"" at Dr. Jumba and for some completely inexplicable reason the scientist joins Stitch on his quest to join a family.  Another example is Mr. Bubbles, the social worker.  Mr. Bubbles is the largest, wealthiest, most leasurely social worker on the planet.  Hawaii must have a very light caseload.  In addition, since there are aliens zooming around Hawaii and someone is bound to notice, Mr. Bubbles conveniently becomes an ex-CIA Area 51 agent (who also just happens to know the head alien when she arrives).<br/><br/>There is some references to ""family"" and ""aloha"",  But the producers lost their nerve when they added a toss-off reference to fat people as beautiful, but placed it inside a joke.<br/><br/>This is not particularly funny, cute, or moraly uplifting.

So you can imagine the sales pitch of Lilo & Stitch to the suits at Disney.<br/><br/>""Well the main character Lilo is a thoroughly obnoxious and disturbingly weird child, who is looked after by her sister who has her own problems.

Imagine the slow steady puffing of fat cigars and blank stares.<br/><br/>""Did I mention that Ohana means family....yeah it is all about family..."" I think the result was Disneyfied (I want that to become a word in the dictionary one day, meaning to made family orientated and cute) because 626 (aka stitch) is too cute for the scripted response of horror when people meet Stitch.<br/><br/>Certainly this movie breaks the core Disney formula while also keeping to it and in many ways it has been a pity that Disney has not keep up this approach leaving other studios to make things like Shrek (an obnoxious ogre whose bad habits are popular amongst modern children).<br/><br/>Lilo & Stitch is a lot of fun to watch, but maybe a little too simple for adults to really get into it.

","Lilo and Stitch is another of Disney's attempts in a genre that appeals to all ages, having both action and family moments.  Lilo and Stitch is no less.  It starts off with a nice little battle scene involving the red police cruiser.<br/><br/>I missed the first few minutes of Lilo and Stitch, but still caught on to everything that was going on.  That's always a plus--when a movie is not so complicated as to shatter your understanding in the middle of it.  However, the storyline is rather shallow, and soon I was begging for some complications.<br/><br/>It was also a very slow movie.  I was told it was pretty much nonstop action, but was very disappointed when this was not true.  Disney's action genre debut with Dinosaur and Atlantis:  The Lost Empire were more action-packed than this movie.  Lilo and Stitch is mostly about a crumbling family as it tries to build itself back up without parents.<br/><br/>The action scenes, however few, are satisfying.  Stitch's growth in character is real; he starts out as a maniacal, trash-everything in sight little beast, but grows feelings toward Lilo and perhaps a new home.  One can really relate to this little monster.<br/><br/>The music is not all that great.  It has its moments, but I forgot most of it and the composer, which probably means it's not really memorable.<br/><br/>But the movie was just slow.  Not childish, not corny, just slow.  I liked the great animation and the characters, but I don't think that this movie should ever have had a chance against Spirit:  Stallion of the Cimarron, which was released earlier."

My 9-year-old laughed in places and appreciated the overall message of inclusion, but even he had to admit that it was more than a little on the weird side. The broken family relationships that begin the story make this cartoon much too dark for small children. The theatre was of course filled with small tykes due to the Disney brand. They didn't seem to pick up on the pop culture references, nor did they laugh all that much at the antics. The behavioral problems Lilo and Stitch exhibit near the beginning of the film (biting, hitting, spitting, etc.) ought to make any parent think twice before taking an impressionable child or at least be prepared to talk it through. All in all, its not as anti-children as ""Antz"" or ""Shrek"", but its far from being the funfest that the media fanfare seems to be promising."

","I don't really like the company of Disney, but sometimes they make movies that surprise me with their quality (Monsters, Inc., The Lion King). Their animated films can be quite good. Note the word `can'.<br/><br/>Lilo, voiced by Daveigh Chase (The Ring), is a five-year-old Hawaiian girl who is being raised by her older sister Nani, voiced by Tia Carrere. Lilo and Nani's parents died.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in space, project 626 (voice of Chris Sanders) was made to be a vicious killing machine thing. When it escapes, it falls to Earth, while two bumbling aliens try to get it. 626 is found by Lilo and is named Stitch (hence the name Lilo and Stitch). The movie is about their so-called `adventures'.<br/><br/>First off, Lilo and Stitch tries to hard. It tries too hard to be funny, to appeal to all age brackets, and to bring back the appeal of the early 90s, when such movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were deemed best of the best. Sure I laughed a few times, but not enough. Its rather gross humor at times (Stitch licking the inside of his nose, getting apparatus from the nose and eating it) didn't appeal to me at all. Adults would find that revolting, though kids would crack up. Why did they use lavish watercolors instead of CGI? Maybe so they can go up to Dreamworks and say `WE don't need computers to make a movie!' Lilo and Stitch would have worked better as a computer generated movie for some reason. It just seemed out of place to use blue-collar work.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames comes in (!) as a social worker named Cobra Bubbles (generating one of the few laughs I protruded) and wants to take Lilo away from Nani. Gasp! O no! We really know them so well to care!<br/><br/>And that is where my second point comes in. It seems to abandon many plot elements along the way. Lilo runs into a hula dance lesson, but is never seen dancing again. Why aren't we told more about the parents (or would that be too harsh for the young ones who really pay attention to every word said)? David (Jason Scott Lee), a young man, seems to come and go and is introduced without any knowledge. Why is he here and why aren't we told about him at all?<br/><br/>Also, they tried to `dumb it down' a little. Why should we hate a man doing his job (Mr. Bubbles)? We obviously see that Nani is not being a very good parent, so why should we care that they are going to be separated? It's for the best. Too much slapstick even for me. Wow-kids fall. Hahaha. What was the purpose of putting songs from Elvis in? Could it be that it's a musical but those smart folks at Disney couldn't think of any songs to put in? Well, duh!<br/><br/>You may think I totally hate it now, but it is watchable and, as I said before, a little funny. Its whole space theme, I just didn't think should have been put in there. It seemed to not fit along with the remote Hawaiian island theme (but fish-out-of-water, I guess). Lilo and Stitch is harmless kid's fare, but avoid if possible if you have half a usable mind.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for mild sci-fi action."

All I can say is that I do not know why. I found the story was forced and uncomfortable. This is a Disney film and seeing a child hide in a washing machine is truly unbelievable considering the danger is such an act. Also children biting was not what we want to see. Is this movie trying to have a bit of Monsters Inc or a little bit of Pokermon as well.<br/><br/> I see that some viewers love the return to the old animation as compared to the computer animation.

Like the toothy, sharp little blue furball at the center of all the drama, the film is loud and impulsive, recklessly chasing stray plot threads and then abruptly abandoning them for another distraction. It's far less careful and composed than the studio's usual feature work, which serves as both a positive and a negative. On one hand, it's fresh and different; a necessary (and welcome) new direction for a company that had been making movies for six-plus decades at the time. On the other, well, it just feels like something produced by the competition. It lacks that certain bit of polish, that magical sense of balance. Stitch, the aforementioned extraterrestrial beast, is a far cry from the standard Disney archetype, even in extreme circumstances. His audacious, violent nature lends itself to some impressive action scenes and a few laughs, but damages the character's sudden, climactic transition into a concerned, invested member of the family. He effectively flips a switch and wakes up, and that's not much of an arc. The human characters fare a bit better - their story has more emotional heft - but they, too, leave a lot on the table. Still, despite all that, I enjoyed myself. The film's got personality and heart, its unique locale plays an important thematic role and factors directly into the climax, the action bits work very well and the visuals are stylish and interesting (I like the trend toward minimalism)."

","This cartoon undoubtedly belongs to the Disney Studio. In flattering reviews you find that this is a very unusual cartoon for Disney. However, this is an actual Disney movie. Here you will find all its usual components: far-fetched problems, American chauvinism, standard plot development, improbable and happy resolution of all issues. This cartoon is suitable for children from 3 to 8 years. Nothing new, but nothing repulsive about it. Another Disney cartoon."

","In my opinion, this film possibly has one of the most feel good vibe since Hercules. I just smile when I see this film. I love the characters, their designs, that fluid looking animation and the story. The background designs have this simplicity to it. They reminded me alot of Hayao Miyazaki's 2008 animated film, Ponyo. In fact, parts of this film remind me of Ponyo, for some reason. When the humans in Ponyo discover and meet Ponyo's strange family, they kinda accept it, as ir's no big deal. It is just like in thia film, when the humans meet the aliens, they don's seem shocked or suprised, they kinda roll with it. It's my only nit picm with the film. But apart drom that, I 100% recommend this film to people of all ages. It's funny, charming, heart-warming and visually appealing. 😁👍🏾"

"s-heck","6","0","1","9 June 2016"," A Tropical Misrepresentation
","A tropical paradise surrounded by crystal clear blue water and small alien inhabitant best friends with a 5 year old native Hawaiian girl. Lilo & Stitch is a great film for all ages but is especially present in the lives of young, influential minds. This film presents common misconception of the Pacific Islands. Not everyone surfs or wears dresses with tropical flowers or short shorts and a tank top.<br/><br/>When we meet Lilo in the beginning of the movie, she is coming out of the ocean and is on her way to hula lessons. We also see her surfing with her older sister and friend and teaching Stitch how to play the guitar. It feels like a vacation advertisement to the Hawaiian Islands where women meet you at the plane wearing Leis and you can drive around the island to the different beautiful beaches with cool blue water and then head to a luau for dinner for some ""traditional"" Hawaiian entertainment and roasted pig. These tourist images are warping the image of Pacific Island culture into Indo- European views and don't represent the culture outside of what is presented to tourists on their yearly holiday or vacation. <br/><br/>The dark skin tone and unique facial features make clear to the audience that Lilo and her older sister and other characters are portraying people from Hawaii. The Pacific Island portrayal is rounded out nicely with a tropical background and a lot of common activities associated when visiting the Hawaiian Islands. The colonial fiction of a tropical paradise where all your worries wash away in the golden sand and indigo waters is built on misconceptions white people have about Hawaii and the tropical islands of the Pacific. Lilo & Stitch is an amazing film that portrays a little girl and her alien best friend on a beautiful, tropical island but also the colonial narrative of what sets America and Indo-European cultures above the rest."
"datautisticgamer-74853","9","0","1","14 May 2016"," Easily the best Disney film of the early 2000's
","While I have only seen this and The Emperor's New Groove, I can say with confidence that no Disney film made in the 2000's can top this in terms of my experience. The humor is formidably hilarious, the emotion is sturdy, the animation is wonderful especially during the scenes in space, the characters all have lovable or love-to-hate-able (I needed to make that one up). While Lilo can be obnoxious occasionally, she still has an excellent heart, especially during the moments she has with Stitch. The action, as typical of Disney, is almost always engaging, though it does have some questionable moments and seems to drag at some times. Regardless, this is one of the best Disney films I have watched yet, and once you see it, disappointment will not be present. Apparently, this movie was so popular back in 2002 that Disney decided to craft a television series and three sequels connecting to said television series. I haven't seen the series for a while, but I can assure you that most of the fun comes in the film. Laugh, well up, and get pumped? Lilo and Stitch can cater to all of those demands."
"lisafordeay","6","0","2","6 July 2013"," One word to describe this movie and that's cute
","Lilo & Stitch is Disney's 41st animated classic released in 2002 and tells the story about an Alien named Experiment 626(who will be later called Stitch) voiced by Chris Sanders(who left Disney and went on to direct one of my all time favourite animated movies How To Train Your Dragon)who apparently leaves his planet as he escapes in his spaceship shuttle and comes to earth as a puppy that is later bought by Lilo(voiced by Davleigh Chase)who's parents died and is in remanded custody with her sister Nani. <br/><br/>As Stitch spends some time with Lilo while his inventor and his sidekick is also in Earth keeping an eye out on him,he discovers the meaning of family which is this line 'Ohio means family,family means nobody gets left behind'. Now that was a good message as this film values families and trust and that's what I liked about it.<br/><br/>Now to the bad I dunno about you but parts of the film was kinda bland for me,I dunno why but it wasn't as hilarious as let's say Aladdin,it was sort of depressing in a way,but still I did enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Overall I'm giving it a 6."

","Personally, my favourite Disney films of all time just so happen to be 2 films that came out in 2002. Lilo & Stitch and Treasure Planet. Why you ask? It's because they're the only ones that feel a lot more mature than the rest of Disney films, and focusing now only on Lilo & Stitch, I have to say it is simply stunning and beautiful. Story tackles many real life problems like loneliness, acceptance, alienation, family, friends, and so on, and does so so remarkably well that I sometimes forget that this is a Disney film and not pixar's. The art is beautiful, this film always reminds me of summer and beach, and every credit goes to animation too. I'm not afraid to say that it reached my emotional peak during at least 5 scenes and made me shed a tear, first time it is sadness, other time it is happiness, and than another time it is plain beauty. Make yourself watch it, because Lilo & Stitch is beautiful."
"jacob-m-ford97","7","0","1","1 May 2013"," A great children's movie.
","Lilo and Stitch was released in 2002, and is a very fun story about a girl and her pet alien. It has been many years since I have seen this film, and was actually pleasantly surprised when I watched it again. Of course, you have to admit that any movie about a blue, dog-like alien with a very funny voice is going to be enjoyable regardless of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>This is an older animated film, still in the time period of casting little-known actors in all the roles. So as far as acting goes, there isn't too much to talk about. Daveigh Chase carries the lead role in the small, bratty, and somewhat spoiled Hawaiian girl that is Lilo. She has not done many other notable films other than playing Samantha Darko in 2001's Donnie Darko, and voicing the lead in the English version of 2001's Spirited Away. Director Chris Sanders performs the unique voice of the alien Stitch, which is one of the only noteworthy acting performances. Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames also provide supporting roles in Lilo's bossy older sister Nani, and the intimidating, ex-CIA, social worker Cobra Bubbles, respectively. In any animated film the actors are rather hard to judge how great their performances are, so unless the actors cast already have some fame, not too much can be discussed here.<br/><br/>In an animated picture there are three jobs that essentially make the entire film: the writer/director who creates the story, the animators who make it come to life and can be the main source of comedy, and the musical scorers who can set the tone for the entire movie. Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois co-wrote and co-directed Lilo and Stitch, and of the three previously mentioned areas, this is where Lilio and Stitch slacked the most. As a whole the story was good, but looking at individual parts of the story is where it fell apart. It just appeared that they tried to cram too many good ideas into 85 minutes, which to lengthen it is difficult since the target crowd is young children. I was also particularly not fond of the film's ending, I'm not a fan of musical montages in movies at all, but to close the film in that way left me with a sour taste. The animators of the film, however, did an excellent job. Granted, having aliens as the primary characters in a film does give them a much easier job to do, but nevertheless the animation was good and succeeded in making me laugh. Composer Alan Silvestri, best know for scoring his Oscar nominated Forrest Gump and the 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, gave a very pleasant score to this film incorporating both fun original compositions and a wide range of different songs from the legendary Elvis Presley. Mixing aliens with Elvis Presley was rather bold of him, but it resulted in a success and set a sun tone for the whole film.<br/><br/>Lilo and Stitch is a great kids movie. From the funny voices of Stitch to the hilarious action scenes between him and the other aliens, it was a great creation form all the filmmakers; because what dos a kid want to do more than laugh? This makes that very easily possible for a child. Lilo and Stitch was nominated for Best Animated Film in 2003, but lost out to Daviegh Chase's other starring film Spirited Away.<br/><br/>I give Lilo and Stitch a brought-back-memory 7.4/10."
"moviecritichank-7","10","0","1","16 February 2013"," Very Entertaining Film About a Dog Who's Really an Alien
","Lilo and Stitch is a 2002 animated film released by Walt Disney Pictures. Set on the beautifully lush, tropical island of Hawaii, the story is about a girl named Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase) who can't seem to make any friends. Then one day, her sister Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere) takes her to the Pet Store and she adopts a ""dog"" who she names Stitch that is really an alien experiment named 626. Once Stitch (626) escapes the space station, his jailed creator Jumbaa (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) and accomplice Pleakley (voiced by Kevin McDonald) are commissioned by the Grand Councilwoman to bring him back and reward Jumbaa his freedom in return for Stitch's capture. Underlying in this plot is Captain Gantu (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), who, once Jumbaa and Pleakley fail to capture Stitch numerous times, is sent to capture Stitch. When this movie was released back in 2002, there were numerous teaser trailers placing Stitch in some of the most memorable moments in Disney films like ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and ""The Lion King"", which just happen to be films in the Disney Renaissance Era. Those previews were what really made me say ""Wow! This is gonna be a great Disney movie!"" Sure enough, it was, and still holds up 10 years later. Stitch, by far has got to be one of the funniest characters in Disney history. There was even a great message in the film: Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. The scene at the end where Stitch almost had to leave Lilo behind is one of the most emotionally filled scenes I've ever seen in any Disney movie. All in all, Lilo and Stitch is one of the better films in the Disney cannon and to be honest, (aside from the brilliant Toy Story trilogy, Up, and Monsters, Inc.) is better than most Pixar movies that get way too much attention in my opinion. It has all elements of classic Disney with a touch of Elvis Presley! Like many Disney movies, this is one that I have in my ever-growing movie library! This is a film that should not be missed by anyone who's a Disney fan or that has children. Despite the PG rating, it's a great, entertaining film for the entire family!!! Rating: 10/10!!!"

","I enjoy this film a lot. I really like Elvis Presley and I get a picture of surfing and Hawaii. What I really like about this movie is the theme of family. It's true that we can't leave them behind. No matter how much of a pain they are at times. Lilo and Nani's relationship is very similar to mine and my little sisters back in the day. She's the loudmouth, clumsy one and I'm the responsible one. We have a bond over Lilo and Stitch which makes us even closer than ever before. I'm grateful that the Disney Co. created this movie with Elvis music! This review is much shorter and less dense than my other reviews. Please watch this movie.

"Catharina_Sweden","9","0","1","21 September 2012"," A wonderful family movie that has everything
","My daughter and I love this movie. We have watched it several times! It is one of the best family movies I have ever seen! It has EVERYTHING: humour, adventure, love, cute and funny characters, very good animation, stirring music and dancing, perfect understanding for children, and some deeper truths as well...<br/><br/>I think - unfortunately - that very many children of today can relate to cute little Lilo's situation, as an only child to a single mum. As this is Disney, of course the ""single mum"" is not her real mother but her big sister, and of course their parents were married but died in an accident. But in reality, I think the movie wants to picture the typical single mum-situation. And also a lot of single mums, who fight to make ends meet and keep the social workers off, who threaten to take their children away - can relate to the situation.<br/><br/>I also like it, that one gets an insight into the culture and life of the local people in Hawaii. It was innovative, I think, to let the main characters have the typical looks of the original inhabitants of the islands. Normally when the hula-hula girls are pictured in movies, they are played by white, Caucasian women.<br/><br/>The part about spaceships and aliens was the least interesting in the movie, according to both my daughter and me. Although they made some funny jokes out of that too, such as the planet Earth being used as a breeding ground for mosquitoes (!), and the social worker who had previously been one of the Men in Black from CIA (if I got that joke right..?)! :-) I warmly recommend this movie for families with children in all ages - and especially mothers and daughters!"

","""Lilo & Stitch"" is now 10 years old. It's hard to believe this movie came out in 2002. I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it even now. ""Lilo & Stitch"" is a cute little picture, but not so cute, really, that it treads sappy over-sentimentality territory. Quite simply, you won't find a simpler better animated feature from Disney in the early 21st century.<br/><br/>The story begins when the mad scientist Dr. Jumba (voice of David Ogden Stiers) goes on trial for illegally creating a dangerous extraterrestrial life-form, ""Experiment 626"" (voice of co-director Chris Sanders, who shares directing duties with Dean DeBlois). Jumba receives life imprisonment, while ""Experiment 626"" is to be exiled to another planet. As would be expected, the crafty, cunning little blue-skinned bugger that is ""Experiment 626"" masterminds an escape mid-flight, and manages to high-tail it in a space cruiser to Earth, where his ship crash-lands in the woods on the island of Hawaii.<br/><br/>The obnoxious and highly destructive little extraterrestrial is mistaken for a mutated dog and is later adopted by Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase), a lonely, misunderstood young Hawaiian girl, who later renames ""Experiment 626"" as ""Stitch."" Lilo's living with her older sister Nani (voice of Tia Carrere), who is struggling to make ends meet to support them both in the aftermath of their parents' deaths in a devastating car accident. Pretty soon a little family is born - however marginalized - despite the interference of an imposing social worker, Cobra Bubbles (voice of Ving Rhames); and Jumba and alien-government bureaucrat Pleakly (voice of Kevin McDonald), who have been dispatched to Earth to retrieve Stitch at all costs.<br/><br/>I have to say ""Lilo & Stitch"" somehow feels different from other animated Disney features. Obviously, it's still very much aimed at a general family audience (kids), but it also feels very mature; I don't like being preached to by movies - especially kids movies - but ""Lilo & Stitch"" makes the case for family (however bizarre they may sometimes seem, especially when you throw alien fugitives in the mix) and not leaving one behind. We also get a little bit of culture-shock as well, since a great deal of time & effort is spent showcasing Hawaiian native cultures and tradition.<br/><br/>The movie itself is great to look at it, with its excellent use of water-based paintings mixed with minimal CGI. Lastly, Stitch is just so cute! I'm a guy, but Stitch is just crazy! Even though Dr. Jumba designed Stitch with only one purpose in life - to destroy anything and everything he comes into contact with - he soon realizes the truth about his own loneliness and isolation and how to come to terms with finding his own place in the universe.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic and original Disney animation. I loved it, and you'll love it, too!<br/><br/>10/10"

","Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl who adopts a small ugly 'dog', whom she names Stitch. Stitch would be the perfect pet if he weren't in reality a genetic experiment who has escaped from an alien planet and crash-landed on Earth. Through her love, faith and unwavering belief in ""ohana"" (the Hawaiian concept of family), Lilo helps unlock Stitch's heart and gives him the one thing he was never designed to have ? the ability to care for someone else. The movie contains setimental value and a good cast to support it, but the movie lacks potential as a film for all ages seeing it have violence and makes kids believe that there is such thing as aliens.

","I remember seeing this Disney movie when I was taken to see it at the cinema when I was younger, only bits and pieces stuck in my memory, so I was glad to watch it again when I was grown up and judge it properly. Basically in a galaxy far, far away, ruthless alien scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers) has been brought before the Grand Council of the Galactic Federation, having created an illegal potentially dangerous experiment, a strong, intelligent, nearly indestructible and aggressive being called Experiment #626 (Chris Sanders), its only weakness seems to be his high density body making swimming in water impossible. The scientist is sentenced to jail, while the experiment is to be transported to an prison asteroid, but it escapes from Captain Gantu (Kevin Michael Richardson) who was supposed to deliver him, in a stolen police cruiser the experimental creature crash lands on the planet Earth. Stranded in Hawaii, Experiment #626 cannot do much harm, as water surrounds the island, there are no big cities, and Dr. Jookiba and Earth expert Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) are hot on his trail. Experiment #626 impersonates a dog and finds himself in a pet shelter, he is adopted by little girl Lilo (Spirited Away's Daveigh Chase) and given the name ""Stitch"", as time goes by time with Lilo causes the creature to develop an emotional development. Lilo is part of a dysfunctional family, she lives with her older sister Nani (True Lies' Tia Carrere), they are about to be ripped apart by social worker Cobra Bubbles (Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames) who is concerned Nani is not capable of caring for her younger sister. Dr. Jookiba and Pleakley are not able to get close to Stitch, as they have been warned that humans are not to be harmed and the Earth is full of endangered creatures, so Lilo continues to bond with Stitch as her pet, and her are slowly rekindled, with a little help from Nani's surfer boyfriend David Kawena (Jason Scott Lee). Eventually Stitch is discovered to be an alien creature by the humans, most of their immediate reaction is fear, and when Captain Gantu attempts to capture Stitch, Lilo is intentionally taken in his place, but Jumba and Pleakley help Stitch to save her. In the end the Grand Councilwoman (Zoe Caldwell) comes to Earth planning to take Stitch into custody, however Lilo proves that Stitch is her legal property, she therefore decrees that he will exiled to Earth, and she recognises Cobra as a former CIA agent from years ago, telling him to keep an eye of them, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Lilo and Stitch's restored family as well. Youngster Lilo is likable, and the supporting characters are good too, but it is at first aggressive later cute and naughty extraterrestrial Stitch that obviously steals the show, accompanied by a catchy soundtrack, including Elvis Presley songs, and pushing messages of multicultural equality and tolerance this quirky film mixes the family drama, slapstick laughs and pacy action, the result is a fun and colourful animated science-fiction comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Good!"

","""Lilo & Stitch"" is a cute and funny movie which has characters not that hard to like.  Not like those traditional Disney animated features where a lot of the characters seemed to have come out of the same blueprint, this features unique characters with adorable personalities. It also shows the traditional Hawaiian way of life clearly as well as entertaining you without being boring or having to resort with musical numbers.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, you'd probably think ""Yeah right. Yet another animated version of aliens going to earth..."" But actually, it is not about another ala-""War of the Worlds."" The story is about Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase), a lonely little Hawaiian girl who with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) have been struggling to stay together since their parents died; and Stitch (Chris Sanders), a pesky little monster from the planet Turo created by mad scientist Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers), and is programmed for destruction.<br/><br/>Stitch, originally called Experiment 626, is sentenced to exile in a distant asteroid, but when the monster escapes to earth, he is adopted as a pet and is named ""Stitch"" by Lilo. From then on, Lilo and Stitch share some hilarious adventures, evading welfare officer Cobra Bubbles and running away from galactic police agents. They soon learn about ""ohana,"" the Hawaiian concept of family which means nobody gets left behind nor forgotten.<br/><br/>The animation is simply beautiful, capturing the beauty of Hawaii and the waters surrounding it with the computer animation seamlessly placed in with the hand-drawn segments, while a space pursuit prologue enthralls the audience with action and then consistently amazes with the Hawaiian atmosphere on earth. Plus the comedy is brilliant and not contrived.<br/><br/>The downside though is that this movie deals with broken families and how one can recover a new family and it does not present it in the usual Disney way. It has complex issues never seen made so realistically in a Disney movie as when Lilo first meets Stitch, he is a mean, heartless experiment because he has no family. Meanwhile, Lilo and her sister try hard to live together harmoniously and take care of each other as social worker Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames) constantly check on them. <br/><br/>Usually Disney shows issues too shallow as their target audiences are children who are merely looking to be entertained and don't care on what's going on with the world. And oftentimes, issues are shown metaphorically. But in this one it may be too intense and profound for the younger audiences who have had similar experiences. But at least it has none of the preachy syrupy stuff that ruined good old Disney films the past years.<br/><br/>The point is, if you're looking for an excitingly funny and refreshing animated movie, then you won't regret seeing ""Lilo & Stitch.""<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

Just when I thought that Disney was going down the tubes, they come roaring back with this new classic.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is brilliant, beautiful, and original. I think they should keep on using watercolor backgrounds, because it has the feel of a real classic from the '40s. The Elvis music was a great touch! No out-of-place song and dance numbers here, folks, it's very nicely embedded in the background.<br/><br/>I've heard criticism regarding Lilo and Nani's constant arguing, but this is exactly what sisters do, no matter how much they love each other.

","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Shrek, that Dreamworks film about that green ogre, had a wicked sense of humor that must have made an impression on animator Chris Sanders, who peppers his latest film, Lilo and Stitch, with his own brand of quirky humor.  But unlike Shrek, Sanders was also concerned with mixing in realistic human characters and strong, endearing emotions. The result paid off superbly, for everyone, as Lilo and Stitch happens to be one of the best animated films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Experiment 626 is an abomination of nature, a creature whose only function in life is to destroy.  But he escapes his captors by commandeering a spacecraft and crashlands on Earth, specificall Hawaii, where he's befriended by Nani and her younger sister, Lilo, who dubs this newfound pet, Stitch.  With his creator, a mad scientist named Jumba, on the trail, Stitch tries to evade his would-be captors while trying to adopt to his new family, torn between his genetic purpose in life and this warm environment he's been introduced to.<br/><br/>With Disney slumming as of late, they've revived themselves the past year with this effort and the underrated Treasure Planet.  Lilo and Stitch offers a little bit of something for everyone: an unbelievably cute ""hero"" in Stitch, believable and engaging human characters, a touching and well-delivered message, and some of the most beautiful traditional, hand-drawn animation I've seen.  <br/><br/>For nearly an hour, much of Lilo and Stitch's humor is...different, to say the least. I should also mention I haven't laughed so hard during a movie in a long time as I did watching this film.  Stitch, perhaps Disney's most memorable character to date, is a mischievous fellow, but such an adorable one, too, that he wins us over even if he's such a destructive little tyke. The same goes for Lilo, whose initial abrasive attitude is a little disconcerting, but much genuine effort is made to develop her and her older sister into flesh-and-blood characters and it works.<br/><br/>The film eventually won me over entirely with its heartfelt of message of the importance of family, which is delivered with surprisingly little sentimentality, a virtual first for the Mouse House company.  And just when you think the movie might lose its edge, the last two minutes deliver a simultaneously hilarious and sweet montage of its characters as the seasons go by.  A terrific end to a fabulous movie.  So please, Mr. Sanders, don't spoil it with a lame sequel."

That would have been easier to pronounce correctly. While I enjoyed this animated movie, I enjoyed the extras even more. The DVD picture is absolutely first-rate, and on a HD TV looks virtually film-like. Also the 5.1 surround sound is used well. The extras include such things as the animation technique used, and the design which used all ""rounded"" characters and objects to add to its friendly appeal. While I enjoyed this movie, compared to other recent animated films (SHREK, MONSTERS INC, DISNEY'S TARZAN, ICE AGE) it would be closer to the bottom of the list.<br/><br/>
The rest of this review contains SPOILERS, so please do not read if you have not seen Leeloh and Stitch yet.<br/><br/>The premise is an illegally ""created"" little monster on a distant planet, who is sent into exile towards a desert astroid, but the smart little thing figures out how to escape and end up on a Hawiian island. He is built to be impervious to heat, cold, explosions, essentially ""unbreakable"".  But when he gets caught under a big rig and knocked out, he is mistaken for a strange-looking dog, and ends up in the pound where Leeloh and her big sister (parents are dead) adopt him and take him home. Programmed to destroy everything he is quite a handful, and eventually is responsible for destroying their beautiful house. But Leeloh's loving care, and her repeated reference to ""family"" eventually gets Stitch to transform.<br/><br/>
Near the end the aliens show up to nab Stitch (project 626) and return him to proper exile, but being a ""by the rules"" people defer to Leeloh's adoption papers from the pound and leave Stitch with her. The house is re-built, everyone seems happy, the ending sets up a sequel which is now in the works.  <br/><br/>Here's why I did not like it as much as some. To me ""animation"" is a fun medium and an animated film should be mostly fun. Disney's Tarzan for example, while there is an early scene where a Leopard has killed the parents and is trying to nab the baby Tarzan, it is brief while the rest of the film is fun.  In Leeloh and Stitch, the little monster is just too mean, too destructive, that it was hard for me to have any empathy for him. Secondarily, while I in general like the animation style used, all of the Hawiians were drawn with these rounded pig-like noses and very heavy legs which are not attractive at all.<br/><br/>So, yes I realize it just might be ME, but that is my honest reaction. Leeloh and Stitch is a very well done movie, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as most of the other recent animated films."

","Much to my surprise I rather enjoyed this; an added bonus to the fact that my son's attention was held throughout its entire running time.  The animation is quirky, and you can't really go wrong with Elvis can you. The main thing, though, is that the characters are remarkably real by Disney standards."

","Start of the movie really concerned me... Shows one child punching another *in the face* in the first few minutes.  Then a rather realistic portrayal of some type of ""broken home"" family... I'm not sure how much of this movie I'd want my kids watching."

","Hey everyone, I just Lio & Stich, today and it was a great movie, and if it did got me bored about the whole thing, but it about an ailen that turn into a dog, and ask like a dog. But it wasn't a dog it was a really ailen, that came from a different country, and I really think this a great movie for you and your family and I give this movie a thumb up and talk to you soon everyone!!!"
"Jerry Ables","10","0","1","6 December 2002"," One of the greatest animated films ever made
","I truly loved watching this film and found it to be very well worth my time. The animation is superb and the story is very funny and delightful.  It's also great to watch as the alien Stitch forms such a close relationship with the little girl Lilo and the way she teaches him to go from being a mean, nasty monster to acting more like a model citizen.  This one comes very highly recommended on my list."
"DonB-5","8","0","2","24 June 2002"," Worst Disney flick I've seen in awhile
","The previews and commercials were pretty funny.  The movie was not.  I'm a big Disney fan, but this one bored me to tears.  There were a few cute one-liners, but I don't understand how this could have an 8+ score at this point.  <br/><br/>The animation was sub-par based on recent Disney movies.  The facial features of the two Hawaiian woman were poorly done in my opinion.  I found them quite unattractive whereas the typical Hawaiian is attractive. <br/><br/>
I'll take movies like Mulan any day over this one."

","I just got back from the movie and it was FANTASTIC. I speak as an artist and longtime character-design fan. Stitch alone--his rapid, dangerous-looking movement, the construction of his amazingly expressive and yet pupil-less eyes, the sounds he makes and the effortless way he plows through, rips up and bites things much larger than himself--is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Some reviewers for fairly major papers (Atlanta Journal-Constitution comes to mind) have chosen to pooh-pooh this movie for no discernible reason. Some whine that the animation was ""dismal"". Earth to them: you have NO idea what you're talking about. Just what *do* you consider good animation? Or that the story was ""derivative"". Excuse me, nothing exists in a vacuum. This movie was WAY more original than 90% of the other movies out there (ummm, wonder if that critic thinks all the old-tv-show-remake movies are great cinema?!). Or that it was ""a kiddie movie that needs Ritalin and a decent script""?! Well, news flash: it's really not a kiddie movie, and this was the only ""kiddie"" script I've seen that dares to give us as a heroine a troubled, lonesome little girl (and her troubled, lonesome ""broken little family"").<br/><br/>If you truly enjoy animated films...IGNORE these taste-free, small-minded individuals and enjoy ""Lilo and Stitch"" for its refreshing character designs, beautiful watercolor paintings used as backgrounds, and best of all the cleverly realized, well-rendered movements of the characters. Also, its lack of sappiness, smarminess or gratuitous anything. It's well done across the board--a rare treat that some people, apparently, haven't got the sense to appreciate."
"orions_belt83","8","0","1","6 July 2002"," Nice, but just not...
","I recently saw LaS, I just wanted to say that in the first half of the movie I was amazed at all the animation and wonderous atmosphere that Disney created, and had forgotten how to do with 2-D animation. The character of Experiment 626 ( Stitch) was somewhat frightening in a way. When one sees the trailers, one assumes that he's perhaps a slave or some animal used in tormenting scientific experimentaions. When in fact, he's an artificial killing machine in a compact body. And my 5 year old nephew was first frightened of Stitch, and he really couldn't relate to him at first. Then, Stitch got domesticated and my nephew, Christopher, began to like him. But, his image I think has scared children and they just don't want to see him if he's not cute and cuddly. And the other half of the film was so-so."
"Matt-104","8","0","1","3 July 2002"," Entertaining little flick
","This is not the greatest Disney movie ever made. But it is a lot of fun. If you want to take your kids to an air conditioned movie theater, you could do a lot worse. The overall story isn't great, but it isn't that bad. The movie is filled with campy jokes that will go over your children's heads, but they don't get in the way of the movie. Well done, well written.  A fine film."
