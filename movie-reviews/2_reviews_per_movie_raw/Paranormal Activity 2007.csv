"VinceRocca","1","258","376","1 November 2009"," Paranormal Activity or Paranormal CRAPTivity is an illogical, dumb movie.
","Paranormal CRAPTivity is a great idea. I was so psyched to see it, but it doesn't play out. The marketing got me and a lot of other butts in the seats and I say good for the filmmaker, he made this piece of crap, sat on it for years, was told by everyone it was crap and they couldn't sell it, then along came Spielberg and finds the marketing angle, Let's pull a Jackass but show the audience terrified instead of laughing. I just wish they had a better movie to begin with.<br/><br/>Anyone who has had to canvas a house knows you turn on every light in every room you pass as you explore the room.<br/><br/>When a noise is heard he has the presence of mind to grab the camera turn on it's light but not bother to flip on the stair lights on his way down?<br/><br/>When you exit the couples bedroom there is a room on the left that was NEVER entered. The door is open, but they just walk past it.<br/><br/>At another point he exits the bedroom and b-lines for the far left room without turning on any lights?<br/><br/>When he looks in the attic his only light was the camera light, he then gives her the camera so he can explore the dark attic, HE HAS NO LIGHT???<br/><br/>Why wouldn't he want to call the Demon dude? Why would she be against the camera? Their motives are questionable.<br/><br/>If I have a camera on us and I find the misses outside in the cold (AND she doesn't remember it), I'm checking the footage the following day to see what time she got up. That's when I see her standing there. I'm thinking this chick is gonna kill me, and I'm calling her mother or her sister.<br/><br/>Another thing, they don't have a 9-5 job, why not stay up all night?<br/><br/>Top 10 things to do when things go bump in the night.<br/><br/>10. Grab the camera turn its light on but don't bother to flick a light switch when you pass it.<br/><br/>09. Give only light source back to girl and find photo in pitch black attic.<br/><br/>08. Don't examine tape when girl sleep walks. If you do don't worry that she's standing over you for 3 hours.<br/><br/>07. When you get phenomenal footage of your girl getting drug to another room, do nothing with the footage and spend another night in the room.<br/><br/>06. When your girl has a mysterious bruise/bite don't bother taking her to the ER. You probably don't have insurance anyway, this isn't Canada after all.<br/><br/>05. Don't bother to get a dog for protection. Despite the cat statue on the fireplace, you hate animals anyway.<br/><br/>04. Take a big interest in girl's demon, but refuse to call demon guy, you're too rich to afford that.<br/><br/>03. Find footsteps on floor and get great footage of it, but don't call media or police.<br/><br/>02. Make sure the 'chosen one' sleeps next to the open door. NEVER offer to trade spots with her or lock the door.<br/><br/>01. Don't Google anything until act three, research is a waste of time.<br/><br/>00. Keep the hardwood floors clean, because the most interesting thing about the movie was when I turned to the wife and said, ""Those are nice floors,"" and she said, ""I was thinking the same thing."""
"Zombafyed","8","448","682","30 October 2009"," Wonderful Under Certain Conditions
","PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is THE most popular movie of the year and will ultimately be regarded as one of the best horror movies of all time. Therefore, PA has warranted a HUGE debate on whether it sucks or not.<br/><br/>Under this pretense, I have divided this review into 3 sections: 1 for the things in the movie that work, 1 for the things that don't, and 1 for the summation.<br/><br/>******THE GOOD******************************<br/><br/>1. Originality - not a cheap knockoff or a member of Hollywood's non-stop horror remake/reboot wave. That is a game winner right there! Comparable to the Blair Witch Project, PA has received a lot of flack as being a rip off of BWP. Taken into consideration, the film's only real similarity to BWP is the use of home camera/1st person footage, and non-professionals inducing reactions from the supernatural world. That said, you have to answer yourself a question: Would you rather see another Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, or a completely original off-BWP type film?<br/><br/>2. Suspense and Tension - the film does not rely on cheap scares and loud noises deafening you to induce the desire reaction of fear. Nor does it have the smallest fraction of gore/sex/exploitation compared to most of today's horror movies. If you prefer horror movies that usually don't stick with you and follow you out of the theater, then skip it by all means. The film gives you a few inches, and leaves your imagination to finish the mile.<br/><br/>A suggestion on viewing the film: If you want to get the most out of Paranormal Activity, then DO NOT see it in the local theater on a Friday night. We all know what happens when you are in a theater with middle and high school kids during a horror movie. To fully immerse yourself in the movie, see it with your significant other, by yourself, or with just a couple of friends at a time when the theater is the least crowded. Try to see it at night, or at home in the dark. This film invades the sanctity of one's bedroom, and the old tactic of pulling the covers over your head doesn't work.<br/><br/>3. Special Effects - even on a small budget, the film provides some very impacting scenery. Some effects are blatantly obvious, and some of the best effects are actually the most subtle. <br/><br/>4. Acting - the movie is well acted considering it is full of unknowns. The characters are not obnoxious like most horror movie protagonists. They appear genuine and very convincing in most of the film. But in some scenes, not so much. More below.<br/><br/>5. Plot - there is a pleasant (oxymoron) surprise with the direction the film went regarding the source of the phenomena. It's not your typical ghost or haunted house story. I will not embellish on this as it will spoil the movie for those who haven't or are deciding to see the movie.<br/><br/>******THE NOT SO GOOD***********************<br/><br/>1. Writing - this is actually a 50/50 split. The 'supernatural' scenes are very convincing considering the subject matter, whether scripted or improvised. However, the dialog and character motivation/action during the 'down time' is unrealistic at times. This is a large complaint by those who didn't like the movie. Although the film is a large departure from teen filled slasher movies, the characters at times seem to be just as brainless as the teens getting whacked by Jason. There is a lot of ""WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST....?"" scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>2. Acting - like the writing, the acting seems to suffer in the 'down time'. Fortunately, during the important (scary) scenes, the acting is spot-on, and very convincing. However, you might be taken out of the movie when the protagonists are interacting with each other during the in-between scenes, and the authenticity of their relationship is questionable in some parts.<br/><br/>3. Scenery - granted that the whole movie is filmed in or on the characters' house, the static viewpoint of the camera gets a little boring. With all the phenomena going on, it would have been refreshing to see things from a different angle, especially in the bedroom. Fortunately, this doesn't hinder the movie, just a minor complaint.<br/><br/>******AS A HORROR FAN***********************<br/><br/>Follow the suggestions above regarding with who, where and how to watch the movie. Seen under the right circumstances, and with the right state of mind, the film can be very effective, and having you looking over your shoulder when you turn out all the lights in the house, and crawl into bed. For this reason, I fully endorse this movie as a new member of the horror family. Fresh and original, the movie deserves all of the attention it is getting.<br/><br/>Let this be a glaring message to Hollywood that originality is still the craved for in the movie industry. Horror fans have grown tired of having their favorite classics butchered and pointlessly remade. Directors and producers do not deserve revenue for just upping the violence and sexual gratification of old horror movies.<br/><br/>The film's success is also a great indication that as a population, movie goers respond better to thought provocative subjects than mindless in-your-face cannon fodder. It relieves me to some degree to see that tension-fear based horror movies still have the chance to take the cake. Especially on such a small budget. <br/><br/>Well Done, producers, directors, and actors. 8/10"

","OK. It's not at all scary and there is no gore except for a bloody t-shirt at the end. It would be a ""G"" rated movie if they didn't use the f-word for half the dialog.<br/><br/>Here's a transcript of the whole movie. (pretty much verbatim, stretched out over 2 hours) <br/><br/>Guy: Haha, you're being stalked by a ghost.<br/><br/>Girl: F@#$ you.<br/><br/>Guy: I bought a camera so we can see your ghost.<br/><br/>Girl: F@#$ you.<br/><br/>Psychic: I'm a psychic! ooooo....

That door closed on it's own. We should get a Ouija board.<br/><br/>Girl: F@#$ you.<br/><br/>Guy: I got a Ouija board! <br/><br/>Girl: F@#$ you.<br/><br/>Guy: Look it caught on fire (special effect #1) and now there's a demonic symbol on it. Help me decipher it.<br/><br/>Girl: F@#$ you.<br/><br/>Guy: I put baby powder all over the hall, and now there's big frog footprints to your side of the bed.

"bingandgeorge","1","96","139","29 November 2009"," Waste of my time and money
","What can I say about this film. After all the hype, i was expecting something good, a new Blair witch project, or a new exorcist. What I got instead was an awful episode of candid camera! The acting was shocking, My houseplants do a better scared! Her 'fear' was completely non existent. His acting of 'big hero out to save his girlfriend' was simply woeful, with little or no emotion shown by either of them. The plot made as much sense as a drunks ramblings. if a demon makes a shadow, then where is the demon, has to be there somewhere? 1 is too high of a rating. Of the 'scary bits', where were they? Doors opening ans closing by themselves, ooh thats so scary, if your 12. As an adult, i was expecting more of a horror show, not bad special effects, like the appalling baby powder incident. Just why? being hunted by a demon, great, show us something scary then. Something worth the entry price maybe? There are two scary bits, and they are only scary as a sudden shock, not a horror aspect. Truly, truly terrible Don't waste your time and money When i had to go to the loo. yes it was that boring, i saw a lad saying he'd rather see this film than new moon, i was happy to tell him no, this is a waste of your time. Oh, and if you do go and see it, pick your audience. Ours was shared with 20 pubescent girls, who screamed at the slightest thing, such as the spider."
"theodran","1","126","189","23 October 2009"," Boring, Lame, Not scary, not interesting, Do Not See
","Let me begin by praising those who marketed this film. My favorite myth is the one about how Spielberg (one of the producers) was given a DVD but couldn't finish watching it in his own home because he was too scared. <br/><br/>I GUARANTEE that I wouldn't be surprised if nearly every positive review on this site is part of the marketing campaign. I further GUARANTEE that I wouldn't be surprised if the advertisements you have seen of audiences cowering in fear contain at least some ""shills"" - - paid audience members. I further GUARANTEE that you yourself will almost certainly be bored out of your mind and wonder, during every single frame: WTF? Now to briefly describe the film: A boring couple sets up a camera in their boring house and when they look at the footage of what occurs in their sleep, they hear strange noises, see their bed cover lift as if someone had farted, see footprints made of talcum powder on their hardwood floor, see the woman sleep walk and stand next to the bed for two hours, and see a Ouija board catch fire. <br/><br/>That's pretty much it. Not only that, my telling of it is more compelling than what you would have seen in the theater. Now you owe me 11 bucks. <br/><br/>I saw it in a packed theater at 930 pm -- an ideal audience at an ideal time. No one jumped. No one shrieked. Hell, at one point I wondered whether anyone in the theater was even awake. I know I barely was. This movie will make an EXCELLENT case study for classes in marketing. <br/><br/>All I ask and pray is this: LORD, if you hear me, if indeed you exist, please don't let this director ascend through the ranks of Hollywood. Because if he is given a big budget to make a ""real"" film, there will be one more no-talent director flooding our theaters with crap."
"kasey-schram","1","88","133","7 November 2009"," Awful Movie
","All my friends told me how scary and terrifying this movie was. And how they were jumping every five seconds. This movie is full of lectures and boring talks between Micha and Katie. About twenty minutes into it (which seems like hours) is them just talking about the ""ghost"", with nothing frightful happening. At first i though it was just the introduction to the movie, and that it was going to get better....but it just got worse. <br/><br/>During the night, nothing happens except doors opening. yeah, so scary! Footsteps walking up stairs might freak you out, but it's really nothing. it's not creep at all and very stupid. Katie gets dragged out of the bed, but it's so unrealistic. <br/><br/>Don't waist your time watching this."
"pn1012","4","258","417","11 October 2009"," Overrated and Over-hyped
","Not one part of the movie scared me. Production values are obviously not there on purpose, and the movie feels cheap the entire way through. I went in expecting a lot from this movie based on user and critic reviews and I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>The story is basic and makes little sense when trying to tie back to another storyline about a girl named ""Diane."" The entire movie is about a couple teasing a demon until they tick him off enough to kill and possess the people inhabiting the house.<br/><br/>Cheaply made movie that looks and feels cheaply made with a corny, stereotypical storyline thats been done multiple times. The movie left me with nothing when it was done. Don't waste your cash."
"rubenbenavides626","1","283","464","23 October 2009"," I want my money back!!!
","98% of the movie was completely LAME! The plot sucked, the acting sucked, and the camera movement was exaggerated and made me want to throw up.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie I was hoping and praying that there was going to be something scarier that would happen. This is the entire movie summed up for you. <br/><br/>Something weird happening to the girl..the start recording themselves to see if they catch footage or weird things happening..they hear a noise..they go to sleep..the door opens...they go to sleep...something moves downstairs..they go to sleep..something bangs on the walls..they go to sleep..something breaths..they go to sleep..finally something a little bit scary happens..the movie ends...oh ya and at one point a demon with hooves leaves three footprints on the floor. <br/><br/>There was a scene that gave the plot a little bit of hope. They hear noises one night and find out that their attic has been opened. The bf goes upstairs and find a picture. The picture ends up being a picture of the gf when she was little and part of the picture is burned off. oOoOoOoOoo. then the plot going back to the same thing. When that scene happened i was thinking, ""oh o.... looks like it might start getting interesting"". Then all of my hopes were smashed as the plot less plot continued. <br/><br/>I felt very angry when the movie ended because I feel it was a sham and a rip-off. The whole ""vote the movie into a theater near you"" was a huge hoax they pulled to hype up the movie. I bet you the director and creators of this movie were laughing their asses off as people were blindly walking into the theater and throwing away their hard earned money. They must be profiting madly because these people must have only used about 75k for the creation of this movie. <br/><br/>Also I do not know what is going thru peoples minds that think this was an incredible movie. I read someones comment that this was just as good as the exorcist. These people must be paid bloggers because nobody in their right mind would ever think that about this movie. <br/><br/>To make matters worse I paid 19 dollars to watch this movie with my gf. We both agreed that even Drag me to Hell was better (I think Drag Me To Hell sucks by the way). I gave Drag me to Hell a 3 because it had a few scary/creepy scenes. <br/><br/>If its free then go watch it. If somebody is inviting you, then decline this movie and go watch something else. Trust me you wont regret it."
"Genevieve12","1","70","107","24 November 2009"," A masterclass on how to make big money out of junk
","That's about the only thing I must admire about this piece of patronizing crap.<br/><br/>It was made a couple of years ago and yet it only became popular now because of all the hype. The only thing that is worth it about this ""movie"" is its superb marketing campaign. It's funny how the ""the scariest film in the history of cinema"" formula works every single time, like throwing bits of food at a pack of hungry dogs, they're always gonna go for it, and it's really sad, specially how American audiences are apparently so amazed by this rubbish.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film I would play on Halloween to a bunch of 9 year olds with no criteria, but all these young adults flinching and getting their knickers in a twist with the cheap thrills from P.Activity? Good grief. Their lives must be really lame and gray to be blown away by this tripe.<br/><br/>Why is this film so sh*te? Well, it has been thoroughly explained in all the reviews with few stars, and I couldn't agree more. Acting is appalling, the movie doesn't really go anywhere, there's no big revelation, the scary bits consists of thumps, noises, cries, doors slamming, shadows, a scary video on the web, and a wee bit of fake blood. That's it. Special effects on a budget. And the movie has the quality of one of those crappy 1995 homemade pornoes. Complete rip off.<br/><br/>If you must see this for yourself, go ahead, waste 100 minutes of your time, but do not I repeat DO NOT pay for this movie."
"blu_pseud","1","56","85","27 November 2009"," Bored me to tears, possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
","I was HAUNTED. Haunted by the fact that there was NOTHING scary about this so-called ""horror"" movie. There is NO suspense build-up, NO plot development, NO insight into the psyche of the characters except useless banter that added no value to the plot. All the paranormal events (eg. Micah finding a picture of a young Katie in the attic, crack appearing on Micah's face in a picture, fire on the Ouija board) are so detached from one another that each serves no purpose in the plot development.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into cheap thrills- long period of silence, then a loud bang/ door closing on its own/ screaming/ chandelier shaking/ (insert your own horror movie cliché here).<br/><br/>Otherwise, you will exit the theatre dizzy and dissatisfied. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
"twoscoops6","1","447","768","22 October 2009"," I wont be able to sleep after this!
","That's right! I cant sleep now... because instead of sleeping i am sitting here pondering what could be going thru peoples minds who actually commented good on this movie.<br/><br/>Seriously one star is too much. I wish I could vote in the negatives. In fact I created this account just to write about this movie.<br/><br/>For starters I didn't buy into all the hype... why, because I just recently heard about this movie. I didn't hear anything good or bad just that it existed. Well I enjoy ""scary"" movies so figured Id check it out.<br/><br/>Nothing at all was scary. I repeat NOTHING at all was scary! I was bored out of my mind 80% of the film. 19% I was angered at the idiot boyfriend or the retarded GF. Seriously, Someone here said that they reacted realistically to the situations. What is wrong with you! The woman acted as if she just wanted to ignore everything and hoped it went away... yet claimed it had been happening since she was 8. They guy on the other hand pretended he had the slightest clue as to what he was doing. ""I GOT A PLAN"" as he sprinkles baby powder on the floor... WTH did he think that was going to do... show him something/someone was there.. Hadnt that already been established by that point of the ""film""? Where was the plan? He threatens the ""ghost/demon"" what ever the heck it was as if hes going to fight it... Really!? The only time the acting was good is... well never mind because it wasn't ever good. OK at best during the many arguments that took place in the film.<br/><br/>Oh I forgot to mention the other 1% of the film...well that was the ""scary"" parts. First. The Ouija board scene... scary? NO! Interesting or cool perhaps but far from scary.<br/><br/>Second. Doors slamming... um, perhaps I would've been scared when I was 6 but come on is this really what people find scary about this movie? Third. The girl getting dragged out of bed... perhaps the most scary scene in the movie as well as the best done scene. However it still wasn't really scary... WHY? Because just like every other nite the camera is sped up and then just before anything happens it goes back to normal speed... Completely ruining any chance for suspense or fright... not to mention how it slowly grabs her leg and gently pulls her out of bed...<br/><br/>Fourth, The powder foot steps... so are we afraid of the easter bunny as well? That may be scary in a real life situation, however in the movie it was just lame and boring...<br/><br/>Id enjoyed it more if there were a point to it all.. which I never did see... there was no real story line. Girl haunted by ghost since shes 8 follows her around.. bf pisses ghost off... both end up dead. THE END! Majority of the time were watching them sleep... wth is so scary about that!? Fast forward thru the sleep scene around 3ish each night... ghost does something ""spooky"" cut to next morning... ""OMG look the door closed! Granted if this were to happen to me in real life id need a box of adult diapers however... this is a movie and watching it on film... just isn't scary in the least. Its boring, drawn out (much like my post), comical(and not just the scenes that were meant to be) and well anything BUT scary.<br/><br/>On a positive note... I didn't waste any money on the film =] for that reason and that reason alone I guess it deserves my 1 star.<br/><br/>I've seriously come to the conclusion that all the positive comments left about this movie were made by family or friends of the people involved... I wouldn't be surprised if the director didn't sit down create 100+ accounts and leave all the comments himself as a publicity scam.<br/><br/>I think that a crime has been committed here... and I only hope and pray that no one else has to be victimized by this horrendous film!<br/><br/>oh and to cadillack ... ROFL! your kidding right? To me you sound like a case of the pot calling the kettle black"
"dancemacabre","2","257","434","21 October 2009"," A Big Disappointment And Waste Of My Time
","Well, I always writing reviews about movie which totally amazed me and I don't waste my time writing about some bad movie. But this movie is exception because I'm must say it's way too popular this days and I had a feel that I must react somehow. On the cover of movie we can see tag lines like 'scariest movie of the year or decade'. I think it's a too funny or some sort of commercial trick.<br/><br/>This movie is only scary for the population under the age of 14 or 16, or if you never watched horror movie or just a few ones, or maybe because you're are too sensitive or fearful. The similar movies like Blair Witch project, Rec, Quarantine etc are hundred times scarier and better. Even the you-tube videos about paranormal things are way too scarier than this. <br/><br/>If you're always hated the stupid paranormal videos from you tube and was angry about your wasting a couple of minutes of your life, then this movie will totally irritate and you will have a will to kill someone. I watched this with no expectation of effects, action, deep screenplay and other things. All I wanted and expecting was a just a little creepy atmosphere and dozen of chilling scenes. The most shocking thing about this movie was a just a huge IMDb rating. Maybe this sounds funny but it was true.<br/><br/>Movie timing is around an 90 minutes, only 2 minutes at total was scary, like dragging girl body from the bed or footsteps of the ghost or what there was.There's some very confusing and unconvincing things in this movie.<br/><br/>After the ghost attacked and wounded a girl (I forgot her name because she was such a bad role), male character rejecting for call help. Oh my god, is he retarded or what? He really thinks that demon or ghost will just passed away and leave them. Not forget mention that dialogs are bored and scenes are too repetitive and there's no tension in it. You just watching when this movie finally finish to see what is whole point of this video. This is not movie in particular, it's just a long video stuff. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all people who don't care about waste of their time. Maybe you will enjoy this but I think you are the same as the guy in the movie. I didn't like Blair Witch Project either, but now I fell it's a masterpiece compare to this. Avoid this movie, go and see the trailer and you see it all there is. Cheers."

","Just back from the cinema. Oh dear, what a straightforward story - no twists or turns. Just the irritating girlfriend and the absolute bonehead boyfriend - and how stupid and unbelievable they are! They really just go to bed normally after how many days of being visited on a nightly basis by a god-damn demon??? A couple of bits did make my hair stand on end but by night #18 or was it #25 I'd had quite enough. When the girlfriend got dragged out of bed I struggled not to laugh aloud: that was hilarious! I began to wonder if it was some sort of political allegory (it's the sort of film where you can drift off quite easily) - you know, perhaps it's a post 9/11 film and the boyfriend's reaction being somewhat dumb and blinkered is a parallel to our own rather ineffectual attempts to outsmart the bad guys. In that case, perhaps two stars?"
"IAN-Cinemaniac","8","263","448","26 October 2009"," A Reminder Why We Love Horror
","First of all I must say, living in Belgium, I have the benefit of not being caught up in the hype machine. I'm sure if I were living in the States, I too would be numb to the affects of this film.<br/><br/>I would imagine being in a crowded cinema would take away from the intimacy of the scares. I watched this alone on my couch in the comforts of my own home cinema. I am a huge horror fan, not just a gore hound, though I do enjoy some good gore f/x from time to time, but most of all I love a good scare...which is rather hard to come by. Films that have scared me are, The Changeling, The Innocents, The Ring, Inside (A L'Interior), The Brood, Blair Witch... I'm not easily scared, but given the circumstances in which I watched PARANORMAL ACTIVITY I was quite tense.<br/><br/>This film is a lot like Blair Witch, Cloverfield in the use of the home camera, but the way in which the characters in PARANORMAL approach their situation is rather realistic and believable. The characters are like normal people, not Hollywood types. The acting is fine and the characters are fun and likable. The only thing I had a problem with (as far as believability) was the exorcism footage they looked at on the net.<br/><br/>Maybe I would have been disappointed if I had driven half an hour to the closest English language cinema to see this film when it comes out in December. I love going to the cinema for the great image and sound quality. I wouldn't want to watch AVATAR for the first time at home. But PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is the film to watch at home with as few people and distractions as possible. It's not groundbreaking or amazing, but it works and it's good. I applaud the filmmakers for sending some chills down my spine. Thanks.<br/><br/>Lower those expectations and enjoy the ride."

","We were so excited about this moving coming out - I even ""demanded"" it on the website. Being fans of the horror genre, and also fans of ghost hunting shows and documentaries, we were pumped to see that it actually was playing in our city.<br/><br/>We went to see this 'movie' today. If there was a way to get our money back, I would probably be first in line. Who ever is writing these reviews that the movie was 'the scariest ever seen' or 'could be compared to classic' must be getting paid to say that crap, or must be on cheap dope... :)<br/><br/>There is only one horror thing about this movie, and that is that it's a horrible waste of time and money. There is no cast, there isn't even opening credits....but to make up for the time usually spent on credit, they instead make you watch 35 min's of coming attraction. When the movie finally started, we were sitting there in a crowded theater, with other anxious, eager people - no doubt waiting to be scared out of seats. We were very disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie and long and boring. There were more funny parts than scary. There is a 'twist' at the end, but it's right at the end. After it, there is a blank screen, and we were left in a audience of people just sitting there for a few seconds then literally everyone started laughing! <br/><br/>Save yourself time, money and pain. Watch the trailer and you will basically see the only 'scary' part of the movie. Again - that 'scary' part is at the end. <br/><br/>Should have stayed home and done laundry like I usually do on Saturday.

The shaky-cam is, granted, better than some others I've seen (*cough* Cloverfield *cough*) but when you hear a ""ghostly"" bump and you snort, imagining the crew member jumping up and down in the living room, there's a problem.<br/><br/>-The main characters are in no way sympathy-inspiring. The guy was a antagonistic ""tool"" (a word I often heard my fellow patrons grumble at the screen when they weren't too busy rolling their eyes), and the woman was in no way endearing, having a grating personality on top of the fact that she is not only the reason for the haunting, but by extension, the subject of blame for the movie even existing.<br/><br/>-Finally, there was not even a semblance of intelligence written into these characters. Granted, you are supposed to have the ""Don't go in there/do that"" reaction in a horror film, but this went to the point of absurdity. When said reaction becomes the backbone of the film, what you have is simply a series of escalations to an inevitability...which is fine...if you have more than one character perpetrating each escalation...which ""Paranormal Activity"" did not."

","A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.<br/><br/>I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a tri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theatre, only heightened my enjoyment of it. <br/><br/>The audience I went with, all had a collective ""Oh My God"". I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theatre holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.<br/><br/>Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice. <br/><br/>Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialogue, the ease the tension. <br/><br/>The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Bravo."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","40","62","26 October 2009"," I have not been this effected by a horror film since I saw The Exorcist over 10 years ago. Paranormal Activity is one of the most harrowing movies I have ever seen
","Not since The Blair Witch Project has a low budget film been so hyped up as Paranormal Activity. The only difference? Paranormal Activity is actually scary! I hate to say this because I know all the hype is turning a lot of people off, but I really have to say that this was an extremely effective film for it's budget. It's the Halloween season, what's a classic thing to do? Tell ghost stories. The thing about ghost stories that makes them so scary is that your mind plays tricks on you and something pitted against you that no Jason or Freddy or Michael could ever make you pee your pants, your imagination. Paranormal Activity takes those bumps, screeches, scratches and shaky noises of the night and makes you wonder what happens when you're asleep. I have to be honest, I could not fall asleep after I saw this film because I live in an apartment that makes a bunch of creepy sounds.<br/><br/>The reason I'm so scared to hype this film up is because I don't think it's going to have the same effect on everyone. The reason why is this is the type of story that just depends on what scares you. If a serial killer chasing the girl with big boobs scares you, this probably won't. If you believe there's more to that shadow you see before fall asleep and that there is something more to the after life, then this movie will definitely give you the creeps. The couple isn't haunted by ghosts, but something a little more scary, a demon that is feeding off their negative energy. Which I honestly think happens in real life and it's the supernatural that scares me. It's the things that require faith that scare me, something that you can't see, but you know exists. That is what terrifies me. From Night #1 in Paranormal Activity to the last night in the three weeks had me scared half to death and the ending that will stay with me for a long time.<br/><br/>Micah and Katie who claims that since her youth, a ghostly entity has haunted her, are a young couple. When strange phenomena occurs such as lights flickering and faucets turning on and off on their own, Katie believes the ghost has followed her to their home. Micah buys a video camera in the hopes of capturing paranormal activity on film. Each night, he leaves the video camera on a tripod in their bedroom to record whatever might be occurring while he and Katie sleep. On the first night Katie's keys are heard being thrown to the floor, where they are found the next morning. After this, Katie calls in Dr. Fredrichs, a psychic who assesses that they are being plagued not by a ghost, but by a demon that is intent on haunting Katie no matter where she goes. The hauntings continue. Micah suggests buying a Ouija board to contact the demon, as he is excited about the possibility of a real haunting, but Katie implores him not to. That night, the couple are awoken by what sounds like footsteps. Suddenly, what sounds like an inhuman roar and a loud bang reverberate from somewhere deep in the house. Micah finally borrows a Ouija board from a friend, infuriating Katie. While the two are arguing outside, a wind blows through the living room and the Ouija board's planchette moves on its own before a small fire erupts and extinguishes on the board. Katie agrees to allow Micah to try one more experiment. Micah leaves baby powder on the floor in the upstairs hallway, hoping the demon will leave tracks. That night, the plan succeeds; they awaken to the sound of footsteps and find three-toed tracks.<br/><br/>Like I said, I don't want to over hype this film, it's something you have to experience for yourself. But if you do see it, see it in the theater, because I think it's part of the experience. I know now that the film has a wider release, there are people who are not scared by this movie are just saying it's a bad film. Now while I understand that it may not have scared you, I think this was still very well made for what little money they had and was very effective. If you lived in my apartment for a night, believe me, you'd know a reason why it scared me. A lot of people have experienced some sort of paranormal activity, just depends on wither you believe it or not. Like I said, a classic ghost story is always about the strange noises you hear or how something moved that you know you put somewhere else. Believe me, a movie has not effected me this much since The Exorcist, Paranormal Activity crawls under your skin and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>9/10"
"TravisBickle8169","7","85","141","28 October 2009"," Good for What It Is
","Have not commented on anything in a long time. But after reading all the overly positive ""scariest movie of all time"" and overly negative ""two hours of my life I'll never get back (hour and a half actually)"", I had to comment. I heard about this in Entertainment Weekly and was waiting patiently for it to come out in wide distribution. All in all, it's a good movie for what it is. A low budget horror movie using the faux documentary premise. Compared to The Blair Witch Project, where you couldn't see a damn thing to be scared of, and Cloverfield, which just made me nauseous from the jerking camera, this film at least has steady camera work most of the time. If you are a die hard horror movie fan, will this movie terrify you? Probably not, except on a psychological level possibly. The notion of a demon haunting a person as opposed to a haunted house, while nothing truly original in the sense it hasn't been done elsewhere, is still not seen to much in horror (except in possession films), least these days in the days of Saw and Hostel and other crap. There are a few startling moments in the film. They are comparable to a friend sneaking up on you from behind and shaking you. But honestly, that's what I want from a horror movie. To be in suspense and have something shock me and get my heart pumping for a few. I can't remember the last film I saw to do that so at least Paranormal Acivity got my blood flowing a couple times. But mostly its disturbing. Some of the night scenes would be slightly shocking, others would just be creepy to watch. But in each something different happens. In terms of acting, nothing spectacular but hardly as terrible as some are whining about. And while the film suffers from all other faux documentary films with the ""'WHY ARE YOU STILL FILMING? TURN THE CAMERA OFF!' 'I WOULD BUT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE A MOVIE TO SHOW.'"" moments, there are actually times when the boyfriend gets yelled at to turn off the camera and does so. And his character is shown from the beginning to be stubborn, frat boyish, and egotistical. So, while his stupidity starts to wear on you, its a slightly more plausible reason for the continual filming than say Blair Witch Projects ""THE CAMERA IS ALL I HAVE LEFT!!!"" moments. To sum up, is this the scariest film of all time? No. But it is without a doubt the scariest film to be shown in the mainstream theater in the last few years. Its more terrifying then the endless remakes and sequels we have been plagued with. One thing I hope for with all the hype is that horror fans want more genuine shock moments than over the top gore."

","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The scenes were so lame and poorly acted. This movie seriously had not a single scary part. I felt like I was watching bad fake home movies. I cant understand how anyone could watch this movie and like it. Some movies can start off slow and pick it and finish fantastic but this was not one of those movies. From the first minute everything dragged, why bother with the Blair witch type of movies. The acting was horrendous. I laughed so hard when the psychic came to the house and immediately said oh no I cant be here. I mean come on and that stupid fire on the board and then the board didn't have any burn marks. There is no way that should have taken 10,000 to make. It pains me that I sat through it expecting some sort of good ending. Hears something, close the door when you sleep. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad horrible movie."
"ash2k","10","568","1057","27 September 2009"," First movie that has ever physically affected me...
","Not only is this gem-of-an-indie-film, 'Paranormal Activity' the scariest movie I have ever seen, it is the most horrifying experience I have ever been a part of. <br/><br/>'Paranormal' begins when a young man purchases a camera to record the paranormal phenomena that his live-in girlfriend has been reporting to have been experiencing. His purchase of the camera is out of naivety, and we soon find out he is more interested in electronics than the strange occurrences that seem to be haunting his partner. As the film progresses, the ghostly happenings become more and more apparent and intensify while the hand-held camera documents them and the terror of the young couple. <br/><br/>The genius, center, heart, and terror of this film lie in the realism of the performances. The actors who portray the couple are so convincing and so natural, you feel as if you are watching an actual homemade video. They do not follow the usual ""shaky-cam movie"" model of acting in which the performances often try so hard to be ""real"" that they are over-done and come off as a cheap imitation of as what is assumed would be somebody else's reaction to that scenario. Contrary-wise, we believe as an audience, that ""Paranormal""'s characters are true to themselves, and the decisions they make and the things they say are true expressions of how the actors themselves would feel if they had been placed in the same situation. Thus, instead of feeling like you are watching actors in a movie portraying someone else, you feel as if are watching two actual people in an actual haunting scenario. You recognize that everything they say and do would be an actual reaction you could imagine yourself giving in response to that scenario. This produces an extremely uneasy effect in which you cannot escape out of their terror-filled world because you feel, yourself, that you are in it. There-in lies the key to this brilliant film.<br/><br/>The other key is the agonizing, yet wonderful uses of suspense and the imagination. The director does not assume his audience is a dull, thoughtless bunch, dependant on gore, sex, and explosions to be thrilled. Rather, in true Hitchcockian fashion, he fully utilizes the concept that imagining the ""man with the axe"" is far more terrifying than seeing the ""man with the axe."" We are forced to constantly think about what we just experienced. In some cases, blink, and you will miss something. Subliminal shocks are everywhere, so not only are your conscious senses attacked, your psyche is brutally terrorized. This makes, in one instance, viewing a completely empty room in dead silence for 30 seconds or more turn out to be one of the most horrifying scenes in the entire film. If you think about, just seeing an empty, silent room does not seem scary at all, but there-in lies the genius of this film: That something that simple can scare you down to the deepest core of emotion.<br/><br/>If you've read any of the other reviews for 'Paranormal Activity', you will notice almost all of them mention that a viewer will not be able to sleep after watching it. I will make my review one of them. You will not sleep if you see this movie. Not only is it terrifying, it's thought-provoking. Then when you think about it, you are terrified all over again. Don't believe me? Go ahead, watch it. I dare you."
"IncrediblyDisappointed","1","35","56","3 November 2009"," Absolutely dreadful
","As many people I've seen commenting on this film, I made an IMDb account solely to inform people of how terrible this movie is. It is appalling to me that this movie has gotten the incredible hype that it has - there is not one moment in it that is considered, to me, to be ""scary"" or even ""chilling."" I will no doubt have no problem sleeping tonight.<br/><br/>While I felt that, yes, the characters were fairly easy to identify with (who hasn't known the egotistical jock who somehow snags the cute girl with good intentions?), they don't support the inconsistent and shockingly holey storyline. The first... 45? minutes I'd say pass by with little to no action or scares what-so-ever. I suppose the director figured this time allowed you to get to know the characters, but you still leave the movie knowing very little about them. You're introduced briefly to a character ""Diane,"" and you figure at that point that the plot must thicken and you'll delve further into paranormal activities. But, on the contrary, her name is mentioned once and after that you hear no mention of it again. Some time later a photo is found that belonged to Katie when she was 8 years old, but it should have been burned in a freak fire that burned her childhood home down. Again, there's mention of it, and you hear nothing further.<br/><br/>It pains me to say but I must commend Katie and Micha, I did find their acting believable to a certain extent. Together they are more talented and share more chemistry than some famous Hollywood stars who rake in 7-figures a year. Considering that for both of them this was their first movie, that is a huge accomplishment.<br/><br/>Any moment where there is a slight build-up of suspense, the viewers are incredibly let down when the scariest thing you experience is a slamming door or some webbed foot prints on the floor. They have effectively shown two of the most ""frightening scenes"" (for lack of better words) in the previews, leaving the viewer wishing for more. The creator tries to shed the ""fear of the dark"" cliché by causing strange things to happen during the day - the key word there being ""strange,"" not ""scary"" - the theme of this movie it seems. An hour and a half in, I had convinced myself that surely, considering all the attention this movie has received, the ending must be completely shocking? Wrong. The ending is incredibly anti-climatic and leaves very much to be desired.<br/><br/>I have never, ever left a movie angry as I am very easy to entertain, but I left this movie cursing. Any person who has given praise to this video or rated it more than a ""1"" must clearly be afraid of their own shadow. Please, please save yourself the money and more importantly the time - I can safely say it would be better spent in a field twiddling your thumbs."
"marissab826","1","54","91","26 October 2009"," I want my $13.50 back!
","I was extremely excited about this movie when I first saw the previews for it. Since I had to see what it was about, I convinced my husband to go with me, just in case I needed someone to hold onto if it got really scary. Boy, was I wrong!! This was the most pathetic attempt at a scary movie that I have ever seen. I'll admit, there were maybe two or three times where some loud noise startled me, but I never screamed, was never anxious, and felt like a complete idiot by the time the movie was over.<br/><br/>The idea of the movie was great, but really, what's so scary about it? So this girl is haunted by this demonic presence from the time she was 8 years old. She fails to mention this to her boyfriend Micah when they move in together and then this ""crazy"" stuff starts to happen. They hear noises in the house, like footsteps and loud bangs on the wall. The girl, Katie, starts going into these trances and stands staring at Micah for hours at a time while he sleeps. They film everything, track the demons footprints in baby powder on the floor, and somehow Katie ends up being possessed by this demonic entity. She ends up waking up in the middle of the night, goes downstairs, starts screaming for Micah and he goes running down to save her. He comes flying up the stairs, smashes into the camera, and Katie walks up the stairs covered in blood. Evidently she killed him and yes, it was a little creepy in the last frames of the movie when she looks into the camera and her face turns a little demonic, but ultimately, it was so lame. I actually laughed more than once in the movie and felt like I wasted my money by even going to the film. If Katie had become possessed much earlier in the film, it might have been a different story, but the noises and lights turning off and on were just very elementary attempts at being scary. It really only got good at the very end when Katie gets dragged out of bed by the demon and when she kills Micah. <br/><br/>Anyone else who's thinking of seeing this, think twice, or at least go to a matinée and save a couple of bucks. They made the previews look crazy scary in order to get people to go see it and make big bucks, but it was highly disappointing."
"roger-121","Null","54","91","26 October 2009"," What a bunch of bunk!
","Who says this is the scariest movie of all time? This film is so annoying, trite and clichéd that it is FAR from the scariest movie of all time, unless it's considered scary that these people would even THINK they had a great idea for a movie.<br/><br/>For instance, the producers of this movie want us to think that these events really happened and were videotaped by the couple as they happened. Please. I can believe that Micah and Katie would set up the camera at night to film things while they slept, but why would they film throughout the day -- while getting ready in the bathroom, or when analyzing the film from the night before? Why, when Micah woke up to find Katie missing and was immediately concerned, would he take time to unfasten the camera and take it with him to find her? She could have been in extreme danger! The only reason is to keep the movie audience ""in the loop"" as to what is going on. It's scripted! Duh. Even when the camera is left on the tripod, the action is always in front of the camera. For the producers to even think that anyone would begin to believe that this really happened is idiotic.<br/><br/>And how about at the end of the movie, when Michah's body hits the camera? A blow like that would have knocked the camera silly. But the camera stays right there on the flimsy three-leg tripod, ready for the entrance of the demon-possessed Katie, who gives a sinister look at the camera before trying to devour it. Huh? In the first place, why would the ""demon"" or whatever it was, bring Michah's body back up the stairs? Because the movie audience is there. Because of the restriction of the one camera, the movie audience would have been left out of the action if the demon had left Micah's body downstairs. Obviously scripted.<br/><br/>So, any possibilities of having a GOOD scary movie are ruined since we are confined (by this silly premise of ""reality"") to one video camera, alternately held by either Micah, Katie, or the tripod. This gimmick is cloying and annoying from the start. And this movie moves SO SLOWLY! My gosh, this was boring.<br/><br/>Anyone watching this movie with half a mind and some critical thinking has to wonder WHY. Why did this demon want Katie? Why didn't it just take Katie at the first (and spare the movie audience the misery of sitting through this rubbish)? Why did the demon want to kill Micah (besides the fact that he was annoying)? Why were things always going wrong with the electronics, like the lights and TV, but the camera always worked? Why did the demon wait for years before haunting Katie again (she remembered it visiting her as a young girl)? Why was there a picture in the attic? Why, when the psychic said that he couldn't stay in the house because he felt the demonic presence so strongly, didn't he take Katie and Micah with him when he left? (Obviously, it takes the demon awhile to catch up with Katie since she hadn't had any encounters with it since she was a little girl.) Why would the demon-possessed Katie lunge at the camera at the end of the movie? This demon had controlled electronics all through the movie without having to use a physical body. If the demon wanted to get rid of the camera, he would have (and SHOULD have) rendered it helpless at the first of the move.<br/><br/>Silly. Stupid. Annoying. Awful."

When the male lead died I wished I was him so I too could be put out of my misery. The ""acting"" was terrible. There was no suspense, there were no scares. Although there were a few chuckles, most were unintentional. The movie is all hype and marketing. Perhaps someday I will forgive the friend who dragged me along to see this.

In the endless stream of b-movies and even expensive crap, this movie really stands out. Paranormal Acivity is a scary and straightforward movie and it isn't boring. But of course there is the hype. After I heard this was the scariest movie ever, expectations evidently went up. Eventually resulting in a slight disappointment. This movie would have been much scarier, creepier if I hadn't had any expectations, if I hadn't read any reviews. I guess Public Enemy was right about the Hype.<br/><br/>The movie is scary indeed. After watching Paranormal Activity I noticed that the nightly sounds of my 200 years old house were louder and creepier than ever. But I did not let my good night's sleep for it.<br/><br/>The acting was good but sometimes slightly overdone, which made it difficult for me to connect with the characters. I understand that Micah, the bf, had to be annoying, the character was written that way. But their is something wrong if you start imagining in the middle of the movie gruesome ways he could die.

"otis von zipper","8","314","598","21 February 2009"," ""Paranormal"" is extra-ordinary
","I was fortunate to see this film about a year ago, and have become curious as to why it still has not seen the light of day. A little research has indicated it still might.<br/><br/>The storytelling here is simple but also inspired. Young couple Katie and Micah plan to film their home at night while sleeping in hopes of capturing evidence of a ghost that seems to haunting them, or more precisely Katie, since this is not the first time she has experienced these type of visitations. We watch the footage of the young couple sleeping and gradually things do start to happen. Katie and Micah also film themselves discussing the situation, a visit from a spiritualist, and a few other random moments. Doesn't sound like much, right? Or that it could possibly be the slightest bit scary. Well, Oren Peli's little indie film is everything a scary movie should be. In other words, it is indeed very scary.<br/><br/>Peli accomplishes the improbable through utilizing tension, character and imagination. The found footage concept used in the movie, a la ""Blair Witch"", ""Cloverfield"" and the recent ""Quarantine"", is perhaps slightly more effective in this situation. It's usually a still camera with things sometimes occurring just beyond what we can see. The result is a heightened sense of reality and a greater sense of dread as to what those sounds could be. We've all been there. We here a noise out in the dark and are frightened by the unknown. Peli seems to understand this greatly and uses it to great effect. When the camera does move it is often done slowly, perhaps in an effort to avoid the shaky-cam effect, but it also helps create greater tension.<br/><br/>But perhaps the one element most important to this film's success is the performance by Katie Featherston. In the beginning we meet a sweet young woman who has concerns about what could be happening to her. Perhaps a metaphor for fears regarding her relationship with Micah and their new home. As we approach the final scenes, Katie has been reduced to a person on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and we are deeply concerned for her well being. Each night as our young couple goes off to sleep we experience a deeper and greater dread that something bad is going to happen, and we don't like it. It helps that Ms. Featherston is an unknown (it's difficult to imagine caring this way about a recognizable actor) but her ability to create a believable and sympathetic character is remarkable and turns an effective thriller into something extraordinary.<br/><br/>It's not often that a movie will truly have me on the edge of my seat. Watching it I was reminded of those days long ago when I first saw ""The Exorcist"", ""Halloween"" and ""Alien""; movies that have stayed with me over time as moments spent in a theatre genuinely frightened. It doesn't happen that often anymore, movies are either too gimmicky or too unbelievable or too music video flashy to get to me. But a little movie made with no money and no special effects did. To the cast and crew of ""Paranormal Activity"" - Thank you! <br/><br/>p.s. with regards to the future of this movie, the latest news is that it will be released and not remade as earlier planned. No idea when that will happen, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this special little film doesn't get left on a shelf."

","My Fiancé really wanted to see this movie. I had my doubts but relented due to severe cuteness on her part. I should still have refused. It's terrible. Not the kind of campy terrible where the movie knows its terrible and is having fun with itself. The kind of terrible where you consider the only valid options to be: sleeping, leaving or killing yourself.<br/><br/>It's of the same type as the ""Blair Witch Project"" only not nearly as well done. Not that Blair Witch was the best movie ever but it had a certain something about it that was truly creepy. This movie failed on every possible point. The characters were basic ""Reality TV"" types. The guy who was purportedly a highly paid day-trader was a weak shadow of a man. The woman was a standard gold-digging, self-absorbed flake. I spent half the movie wanting the guy(appropriately named Meeko or something) to tell the chick to shut up, stop being such whiney bitch and start doing something useful with her life.<br/><br/>After all the boredom and pain of this movie I could still have been somewhat mollified if there was some kind of marvelous ending or twist or grand payoff. But no such luck. It remained pathetic to the very last second. If there is a saving grace to this crap, it's that it's only 86 minutes long. This would be too short if it was decent but was a blessing in the case of this clunker.<br/><br/>I've learned a lesson here. A bunch of people can get together and write enough reviews on sites to make anything seem like a good movie. I need to learn to read carefully and get the opinion of actual critics from credible sources before I toss my money in the trash like I did with this movie.

"daveray_jr","6","93","167","17 October 2009"," Pure Hype!
","The good news is: as a horror movie, this movie is watchable.<br/><br/>The bad news is: hype is what is driving this movie, and I can already see that by the sparse amount of movie-goers who were in the theater on a late Saturday afternoon, people are catching on that this is not ""the scariest movie you will ever see"" or that ""this movie will give you nightmares."" What a load of crap.<br/><br/>It seems like Hollywood is already struggling to profitably fill movie theaters with the garbage they are putting out these days. This is the first movie we have been to in over two years, and it was mostly due to all the hype, that we went to see this one. $32 dollars later ($14 to get into the movie and $18 for a tub of popcorn and two cokes!) it was at best, a watchable but mediocre movie. To put it very plainly, I wish we had ordered it from Netflix instead of blowing the price of a meal at a decent restaurant on an over-hyped B-movie.<br/><br/>There were some creepy but anti-climatic moments: when Katie stares at Micah for hours, and the scenes leading up to when he finds her out on the patio were rather suspenseful. But the very predictable ending was quite a letdown, and the acting was a tad atrocious.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, don't rush to a theater to waste your money paying ridiculous prices to see this mediocre movie; order it from Netflix (is it even available?) or wait till it shows up in the Red Box DVD dispenser.<br/><br/>""Steven Spielberg was apparently so scared that he stopped watching it halfway through."" Who posted this crap on IMDb under the movie's trivia? Who would honestly believe this after seeing this movie?"
"jellofluoride","1","63","110","18 October 2009"," This movie is slow,boring, and most importantly, NOT scary.
","I just made this account solely to tip the balance of positive reviews for this movie. I sat through this whole film trying to figure out why so many of you actually like this. I looked at the time 40 minutes after the start of the film, NOTHING scary had happened. There wasn't even suspense, just the female lead complaining about aggravating the ghost(keeping the movie boring). The psychic seemed to force the idea that it was a demon without any real evidence or thought. So much of this so called plot seems forced without making any real sense at all. The fact that Katie talked about the ghost/demon following her since she was 8 could have been cut entirely from the film to make room for more scares.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my point. There are no scares, I sat through this movie with a very solemn and angry stare. Every night scene is sped up and then is slowed down for every paranormal action, absolutely KILLING the suspense. And then during the next day we're forced to watch the exact same thing again as they look over the film of the night before. And these ""paranormal craptivities"" seem to take forever to build up momentum. Seriously is watching a door slam really that scary? The only real feeling of suspense came within the last 4-5 minutes of the movie, which seemed to fade very quickly with the anticlimactic end which is pretty much shown in the trailer of the damn movie! If you're a real fan of horror, classic or new. Do not buy into this hype and ignore this movie. I want my money back."

","Dearest readers, a film like this has not come along since The Exorcist. After listening to all the hype, and following this film until 2007 you could say I knew a lot about this little film. Nothing could prepare me for the climatic, scary ass situations that the cast and crew put on celluloid. Yes, my friends, it really is a scary movie. <br/><br/>I won't tell you what it's about because by this point you should already know that. What I want to tell you is how great this film really is. <br/><br/>Director Peli has succeeded in creating a masterpiece with little money and simple theme park haunted house gags. He does something that Hitchcock did so well in his prime-he creates a level of suspense so intense that the smallest sound makes your heart jump. <br/><br/>That, is great film-making, because it is made with an educated audience in mind. He doesn't cater to the general public he gives film lovers what they want and he gives it to them hard. <br/><br/>Don't go to this for gore. Don't go to this for Hollywood crap. Don't go to this with your kids under 15. Most importantly....don't go to this...alone."
"tburke85","8","37","64","13 January 2010"," Paranormal Activity A Creepy Horror Thriller
","Paranormal Activity is a creepy horror thriller with just the right amount of suspense from writer/director Oren Peli whose admirable in making this movie that doesn't rely on cheap scares and CGI effects to entertain the audience. I actually preferred this one over the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield because for the most part there weren't too many shaky camera movements. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are effective as the two leads giving believable performances as their characters. The suspense build up was good which doesn't quite pay off but isn't exactly a failure either. The sounds they came up with for the demon or ghost terrorizing the two leads were very effective and well paced throughout the film. It definitely helped add to the creep factor and the special effects are equally impressive for a 15,000 dollar budget. I think the demon or evil entity is seen only twice briefly as a sinister shadow proving that sometimes the things we can't really see can be far more effective than the ones we can. I enjoyed the fact that instead of relying on CGI and cheap thrills writer/director Oren Peli chose to use more practical effects like the sounds of footsteps, growls, a door closing shut, lights going on and off, and loud bangs to scare the audience. I wasn't very scared watching this but it definitely creeps you out. I suggest you go in not knowing too much about the movie otherwise any spoilers might ruin the experience for you. Overall Paranormal Activity was better than I thought it would be and it's worth watching. The ending is a little predictable but the good outweighs the bad. This film might not be up there with The Shining but its certainly no Shutter or The Grudge to name a few that weren't the greatest at least to me. So if you're in the mood for a suspenseful horror thriller than Paranormal Activity is the movie for you."
"SocialMediaFluff","1","14","21","5 January 2010"," Maybe if I wasn't rooting for the demonghostmonster to kill them..
","Let me start my review by giving you a little background on myself. When I was 20, I had to have my neighbor walk me down to our shared laundry room for 6 straight months because the ending of The Blair Witch Project turned me into a quivering, scary pants wussy. I cannot hear the music from the movie Halloween - we're talking a commercial in broad daylight - without getting immediately creeped out and double - checking my locked doors. I'm still waiting on evidence that the closet monster doesn't really exist. I'm that person.<br/><br/>Knowing this about myself and seeing the trailers, I was prepared to be really, REALLY scared by this movie. I even went to the bathroom while my boyfriend was putting the DVD in so I wouldn't have to make that scary, dark hallway trip during the movie if nature called.<br/><br/>Initially (as in, the first 5-10 minutes), the movie seemed on track. Creepy sounds and doors creaking aplenty. Then the characters started having these long, boring, stfu conversations and, at that point, I realized that I hated them both. I then zoned out for awhile to decide which one I hated more...<br/><br/>Sometime around night #8 (#18? #49?), I zoned back in and decided that I hated the guy more because he was an idiot and an all around dbag. Then after a few more minute decades of watching them sleep and have even more stfu conversations, I switched my vote to hating her more. Mostly, this was due to the hilarious way dbag guy kept running around that 700 square foot townhouse in the dark and yelling like a professional wrestler at the ghost demon. Yes, because I'm sure ghost demons are terrified of dorks with cameras shouting the f word at them. That earned Dbag the only comedy points in this movie. I ended up playing the ""who do I hate most"" game the next 30 or so minutes. Dbag just went against whatshernames wishes and brought in the Ouija board anyway? Wow, that's a jerk move, I hate him most. Whatshername has been haunted by a demon ghost (that specializes in slamming doors) all her life and, at age 30, it's just now becoming a major problem? And her solution is to whine about it with no real plan and not to have the bazoombies to call the demonologist herself because Dbag laughed at her? Now I hate her the most. Why doesn't Dbag get worried that whatshername is standing at the side of the bed, making crazy murder eyes at him, at 3:00 in the morning? Oh, because he's a moron and I hate him most.<br/><br/>It was right about this time that I started actively rooting for the demon ghost to kill them both so I could catch the end of South Park. Unfortunately, this didn't even happen until 25 boring minutes later."

","Never before had I eagerly awaited to watch a movie after watching the trailer. Within 5 minutes I was disappointed, 10 minutes I was disgusted and after 15 minutes suicidal! The only thing that kept me watching this so-called movie was morbid curiosity and the fact that the trailer made it look awesome. In my opinion I think the people in the audience of the first screening of this were paid to look terrified. I had high expectations of this film, even though it was compared to The Blair Witch Project. The only thing that stopped me from turning the T.V off was to see a particular scene which is showed in the trailer, when the bed sheets start moving on their own, again very disappointing. On a whole this movie sucks, in fact its the WORST I've ever seen!

You could sit there every time something happened and dissect how or what would cause the occurrences, and some of it was just plain stupid.

","Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) have been living together for three years and out of the blue, they are haunted by an entity while they are sleeping. Katie discloses to Micah that she has been haunted since she was eight year-old and the skeptical Micah buys a camera to videotape the paranormal activity in their home during the night. Katie calls the psychic Fredrichs (Marc Fredrichs) to help them, and he explains that he is specialist in ghosts; however he feels the presence of a fiend and advises the couple to call a friend of him and do not try to contact the demon. However, Micah borrows an Ouija board endangering their lives.<br/><br/>After the original ""The Blair Witch Project"", many low-budget movies made with hand-held camera have been released and the only exception that really worked is the Spanish ""(REC)"". ""Paranormal Activity"" is ridiculously overrated and I cannot understand the hype around this flick. The acting is reasonable, but the screenplay is ridiculous, with Micah filming their daily routine even in the most bizarre and unusual moments. I cannot understand how a viewer can startle or fear with the awful scenes and noises, unless those that are easily influenced by the marketing of smart producers that releases a cheap crap wrapped in advertisements and fake reviews promoting the movie.

","After just witnessing a special showing of this spectacularly terrifying film, I can say without a doubt, that I will not be sleeping tonight. What starts out as a somewhat slow paced film quickly turns into a horrifyingly intense portrayal of a young couple that is be ""visited"" by something sinister. <br/><br/>The tension builds ever so slowly, the camera roles on filming their day and night activities. This tension reaches the point where even the slightest flicker, movement, or shadow makes you want to fly out of your seat. The beauty of this film is that nothing is revealed too quickly the director lets the previous events simmer and settle with the audience before revealing more. <br/><br/>Rarely do films leave me so terrified that I am shaking after they have ended.

The ghoul makeup was supplied courtesy of the Wal-Mart Halloween aisle.<br/><br/>It has boring, repetitious and claustrophobic cinematography – if you can barely call it that -- given that most of the videography involves running up and down the stairs ad nauseam.<br/><br/>It's really hard to get spooked about the self-imposed cage the couple puts themselves inside in the middle of San Diego. Don't these saps have friends to stay with? At least take a walk!<br/><br/>The bedroom scenes are monotonous and predictable. The two-person cast is so whiny and bitchy they soon grate on your nerves and you're rooting for the demon to finish the job. The boyfriend's macho response to all the creepy antics is impossibly implausible. A wimpy psychic offers a brief diversion, but soon we're back to prowling the modest sized house that is anything but a haunted mansion.<br/><br/>This Blair Witch genre is so insipid I wish it would just die.

"aristjohn","3","23","40","1 November 2009"," By far one of the more disappointing films I've seen in many, many years...
","I'm going to get haters, I know, but I have to say it: there was nothing, absolutely nothing, scary about this film. My friend and I went to see this film tonight and drove more than 40 minutes to the nearest theater that was showing it. In all honesty, there were a few times where all I could do was laugh at it. There was only one scene that I could see where some could classify as even REMOTELY scary (essentially maybe just more a bit creepy than anything else), and I state that lightly. There are far more 'ghost' films that have had me laying in bed and saying a little prayer after hearing a bump in the night -- this is BY FAR not on that list.<br/><br/>The acting was somewhat okay for the exception of two characters: Katie's friend and The Psychic. The film was too short, deliberate I know due to the nature and style of the film, but in seeing how long it took to get to the point... the film was just FAR too short. My greatest moment of horror/shock was not on the screen but off. A young lady (around the age of 20 or so) went into hysterics with her friends staring back at her in horror before laughing. She hyperventilated (appeared to be in anticipation of what was fixing to happen) and then began to sob uncontrollably at what was supposed to be a 'scary' scene -- which was not IMHO. Immediately after the movie she went to the bathroom to console herself; with her friends trailing behind still laughing.<br/><br/>Now, I don't write that to positively promote this film (though I recognize some out of pure curiosity may want to go see it even more with the above account), but I'm writing it to say that for someone to react in the way she did is just incredibly strange and shocking to the psyche. I've had interesting experiences in my home that would not only make her mess herself, but probably have her just plain keel over.<br/><br/>Take it from someone who has seen a many of horror films this is NOT worth the eight bucks and the ten in popcorn and a drink; nor the time and gas for those who aren't privy to a local theater carrying their desired movie. It's ridiculous. If I didn't beat myself up for believing the hype and seeing this drek, I would have asked for my money back.<br/><br/>How so many could classify this as 'one of the' or 'the' scariest films they've ever seen is beyond me. I'm shocked at the amount of hype this film has gotten. It's reminiscent of the hype for Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield, and it's almost just plain shameful that so many would walk out after-the-fact of seeing this film and still believe the hype.<br/><br/>I give it a 1 for effort and a 2 for the producers of this film succeeding in making a film of pure drek and turning it into a gold mine for their own pockets at the expense of the movie goer -- all for a total of a big fat 3."

","I just saw this tonight and I'm positive I won't have any trouble sleeping. I find it hard to believe that there was so many people positively terrified after seeing this movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't scary. There was a certain amount of suspense, I suppose, but I kept watching in hopes that something really frightening would happen. I think the actor and actress who played Micha and Katie were excellent. The characters were well developed. At a certain point, Micha was aggravating the hell out of me. I understood his motives for certain behaviors, but still, there were times I just wanted to smack him. The ending was interesting and not really expected. I just didn't think it was scary. This movie comes off more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. Too be honest, I can't even remember the last horror movie that really frightened me. Anyway, I don't think I'd recommend the the price of a movie ticket to see this, but it's worth a look when it comes on cable. Maybe it's worth a rental fee. Perhaps I was expecting too much after all the advertisements and (so called?) testimonials to its scariness."

I found myself happy and scared out of my mind. This film is that great. The film begins with the usual introduction of characters, and the problem they are having. After the initial twenty minutes, the movie quickly picks up and we get a glimpse of the so called problem. What really makes this film shine above the rest, is the fact that the characters are really relatable (for anyone in a relationship) you find yourself feeling for the two. This and the simple fact that the gripping tension each night they fall asleep is the perfect formula to hold the audiences attention.<br/><br/>I caught this film at a screening in Glendale.

"jennblaze","2","28","51","2 November 2009"," Over-hyped overly-macho dizzy nonsense
","When it comes to riding coattails, this flick has got it in the bag. Cashing in on the popularity of The Blair Witch Project and its army of clones, Paranormal Activity attempts suspense with a camera technique I'd like to call ""I paid $10 to see a movie that looks like it was shot by a $50 camera attached to a run-away washer"" Plot-wise, the movie reminds me of being eight years old at a slumber party and telling creepy stories about white vans and ancient demons to friends to see who would get more freaked out. Being a big girl now, this genre fails to inspire any sort of fear unless it introduces something new. This movie doesn't.<br/><br/>The scariest part of the movie, aside from the unnecessary motion sickness, was how much of an unsympathetic idiot Katie's live-in boyfriend is. She tells him to stop doing something, he does it anyway. She pleads with him to do things her way, and he blows her off. She tells him to turn off the camera, he keeps it on. He even tries to keep it on while they have sex. Ahoy abusive relationship! Katie quickly figures out, however, that a demon that has been haunting her for years is angered by a dude stepping in on his territory. Because, ya know, women are totally the property of whatever scary antagonist is out there or a dude. Match-up: Demon From Hell versus Misogynistic Boyfriend. Who will win the ownership of the damsel? Very original. My third favorite part is when Micah gets mad at the demon and starts yelling about ""his house/ girlfriend"" and how he's ""going to take care of it"". Yeah dude, you're going kick the butt of something that doesn't have a corporeal form. Good luck with that.<br/><br/>Thus, every ineffectual stupid thing that Micah does angers the demon more. Katie doesn't want him to do it, he does it anyways, the demon gets angry and does more crazy, but not scary, things when they sleep. There, I just ruined the plot of the whole movie. You're welcome.<br/><br/>Coming in a close second for my favorite scene is when Micah gets mad again—are you sensing a theme yet?—at Katie because she tells him that she's really mad at him for getting an Ouiji board, after he promised not to, and tells her to ""go upstairs and hang out with her demon boyfriend"". Silly women, they should just go upstairs and hang with the demon that wants to kill them, if they're going to be uppity like that and think that they know better about how to deal with the something they've been dealing with most of their lives.<br/><br/>In the next scene, Micah is holding Katie on the floor of the upstairs hall while she cries and tells him she's sorry. He replies, ""it's not your fault"". Which, funny enough, it isn't. It's his. What the demon did, before Micah got his camera, against her wishes, and put powder on the floor to track its footprints, against her wishes, and trying to contact it with an Ouiji board, against her wishes, is nothing compared to what it does now. Micah evidently thinks that his pride and chest-beating he-man antics are more important than not angering the thing that you can't hurt but has really evil intentions towards someone you supposedly love. I told you this guy is an intellectual champ.<br/><br/>Instead of this being a good indication that Micah really ought to listen to his girlfriend and stop doing stupid stuff, he gets it into his head that's it's a good idea for him and Katie to leave the house. Micah won't listen to the people who tell him not to, because he's smarter than everyone.<br/><br/>And here comes my favorite part of the movie: the end. Micah finally shuts up. Yep, the Demon From Hell figures that Micah has stepped in on his territory for the last time. As they sleep, it possesses Katie, walks her down the hall, down the stairs, and makes her scream for her boyfriend.<br/><br/>Micah, like a champ, wakes from a dead sleep with a woody at the idea of saving his damsel, vaults over the bed, and runs down the stairs. There's a bunch of screaming, and then silence. Then, in the only part of the movie that made me jump, something is thrown at the camera, knocking it off the tripod.<br/><br/>That something is Micah's lifeless body. Finally! I felt relief more than fear. Katie stands over him, makes a creepy face, and this farce of a movie comes to a close.<br/><br/>So I leave the theater, enjoying the cold night air and letting the motion sickness fade. Just for an idea of how dumb the plot was, I spent at least 80% of the movie with my eyes closed trying not to throw up, and an additional 10% outside the theater and I didn't miss a thing.<br/><br/>But what really killed me, and just hit home how much I dislike this movie, is that the most discussed thing in the movie's forums here was not the horrible camera angles. It wasn't how stupid Micah is.<br/><br/>Nope, it was how ""fat"" the actress who played Katie was. Yep, the woman who walked around in barely-there pajamas for most of the movie, with nary a love handle or Buddha belly in sight, is a whale. She's just such an offense against the standards of grunting mini misogynists that the entire board is buzzing about what a fatty she is.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: you can attach a cheap camera to a washer. You can make your secondary character an annoying macho idiot. You can cash in on the popular genre of ""hurting women for fun"". You can forget to include a plot.<br/><br/>But all that anyone will notice is that the actress isn't a size 0."

","This is a prime example of marketing over substance. It is a tedious watch of low budget but also low on ideas film making. While Blair Witch Project was innovative both in marketing AND in execution, this remarkably successful flick is proof that marketing can do better when selling such low budget movies than establishment tra sh like Annihilation. It gets some redemption for this extreme low budget approach, but the only thing cult about this movie is how much money it made, or more precisely, how much money studio made buying the rights and then giving the flick to their marketing department. The ending was improved, and it is the single part that stands out a bit, but make no mistake, this is one boring marketing hoax, and the joke is on the unwitting paying viewers."

","Paranormal Activity (R, 1:29) — Fantasy: Supernatural, bargain basement, original<br/><br/>""Significance"" is one of several dimensions I use to categorize SF&F films. It refers to the amount of resources — writing, acting, sets, costumes, effects, promotion, etc. — thrown into any particular movie, and I drop things into 4 pigeonholes: biggie, 2nd string, 3rd string, and bargain basement.<br/><br/>Earlier this week I put The Age of Stupid into the last of these (movies that could have been made in somebody's basement), but Paranormal Activity is even basementier. In fact, compared to its siblings, The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, it may be the basementiest feature film ever released. You could make 10 of these for what Transformers probably blew on latex alone.<br/><br/>But that brings us to the ""bargain"" part. Dollar for dollar, you get about a zillion times more entertainment out of Paranormal Activity than you do out of even good blockbusters like Iron Man, let alone such overblown, overfrenetic, overloud crap as Transformers.<br/><br/>The movie is set entirely in a single house and features only 2 actors, both nonentities, aside from fleeting appearances by a couple of equally unknown supporting actors. It's all filmed with a consumer video camera, and much of the film is devoted to what that camera, mounted on a tripod in the young couple's bedroom, captures on its ultra-low-light setting as they sleep each night away for 2 weeks in late 2006.<br/><br/>As we learn in the opening sequence, it's a pretty expensive camera, and Katie Featherston (playing a character of the same name) is fretting over the cost, but her boyfriend, Micah Sloat (ditto), assures her that he makes that much money in a single morning. It develops that she's an English-lit student and he's a day trader.<br/><br/>Of more interest is why they acquired this geeky gizmo. Katie's been haunted by strange apparitions at least since she was 8 years old, and at the beginning Micah is humoring her by indulging his penchant for guy toys with a view toward capturing some of her more recent paranormal visitations on audio and video. He's pretty skeptical, but soon enuf weird poltergeistic effects start showing up on tape, just tiny little things, but inexplicable, and gradually he dials down the scoffing and (honest, well earned) chuckles and starts thinking this is ""cool"" (and, we are left to infer, possibly profitable). Katie, meanwhile, gets increasingly jittery and frightened. Neither is sleeping well, and they start snapping at each other, followed by regrets and reassurances.<br/><br/>The dialog and performances are absolutely, totally, 100% realistic. Katie and Micah behave and talk exactly as you would expect of any happy young couple. Nothing is forced or artificial. The film completely avoids all horror-movie clichés. No cats jump at you out of the dark. Every time they flip a switch, the lights reliably come on. There are none of those cheap tricks where you see a character all alone in a wide-angle shot, then cut to a close-up as a hand appears out of nowhere from behind. In fact, almost all the shots are long, fixed- camera, wide-angle perspectives, and you can see exactly what's going on at all times (including the time stamp in the lower right corner).<br/><br/>All of which make this the kind of movie that I'm always hoping for — an original story, well told, effective, using believable characters and, at least in this case, not needing a huge budget to get the job done.<br/><br/>Since I saw it the same day as Pandorum (3), with its seizure-inducing stroboscopic credits, I must also say a good word about the closing credits for Paranormal Activity: 3 minutes of total black screen. True to the producers' conceit, they maintain the illusion of documentarihood to the very end."

","This isn't your typical horror movie. Not flashy with insane special effects and buckets of fake blood, not some giant killer with a knife or chainsaw or machete.

This is now in my top 3 best movies of all time (If you don't have annoying people laughing in the theater while you watch it). Every moment was intense and breathtaking, a horror work of art. the supernatural is so unknown, movies like this have a way of forcing themselves into your mind and staying there.

","In his review of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" Roger Ebert said, ""The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark."" Indeed, that film terrified audiences 11 years ago by exploiting that fact. Now, Oren Peli has taken the same concept, and made a similar horror flick. And ""Paranormal Activity"" is a hell of a lot scarier.<br/><br/>Katie and Micah are two roommates who are witnessing some strange occurrences in their home. They decide to buy a video camera to record these occurrences, and that's when the film begins.<br/><br/>Plot is of little matter here. Neither are special effects. The camera is hand-held, but usually it is on a stand or resting (thank God). The actors are very real, which is the point. It doesn't take long before we believe that this is actual footage.<br/><br/>The construction of the film is genius. The occurrences are what in other contexts would be normal sounds, but without a visible source, they become frightening. But what really gets us is that many times we are unsure that anything happened at all. Oren Peli is a genius for making this all work so well. One could divide the film in three parts: slow, creepy then downright scary.<br/><br/>It's not perfect (the beginning isn't very effective, and initially the possible explanations seem downright silly, although once the film gets going, that all changes). However I'm giving it a 10 because it actually scares the hell out of us extremely well, and the tension builds to an ultimate crescendo. And the climax (the original...the alternate ending is pretty weak) is downright terrifying.<br/><br/>This is one film that goes beyond thrills and crosses the line into utter fear."

","Seriously, do not waste your time. This movie is neither original, scary nor believable. Complete lack of storyline, continuity or depth. Any movie that needs an Exorcist style rip-off scene to up the tension levels is really reaching. The characters do their best to carry the movie but its seriously beyond help - there is a complete lack of background and closure. We've seen these 'first person viewpoints' before and they worked, in movies like 'The Blair Witch Project' and to a lesser extent 'Cloverfield'. Paranormal Activity unfortunately doesn't have any of the suspense or tension that is needed to pull-off such a grand undertaking that asks the viewer to do the hard work; imagine the worst thing possible and supplant it into the situation. We're left wondering is that it? A short review, because there is really nothing worth mentioning."
"okusandman","4","35","71","4 November 2009"," Why this film is so big
","I wanted to mention why I think this film has been so profitable - and it's not because of the movie itself, which I didn't find to be that great or that scary. It's because of the marketing.<br/><br/>The extremely limited pre-Halloween release combined with the TV ads and internet trailers showing people watching the film and apparently having a jump-out-of-their seat fright-after-fright sort of time, created a demand that will probably go unchallenged in the future as moviegoers are unlikely to fall for the tactic a second time. But it was sheer brilliance to play on that human desire to want what we can't have, and their PR team deserves a few medals.<br/><br/>So that's why I saw it in spite of bad reviews. I wanted to judge for myself and at first I COULD NOT because it wasn't playing nearby, and so I spent a few weeks anxiously checking new releases hoping it would arrive in my area. Like many others - I got played.<br/><br/>Regarding reports of people running from the theater - they had motion sickness and were about to throw up. I initially thought reports of vomiting in the theater were from fear, because it's ""that intense"" but seriously people, it made me very queasy and I have never experienced motion sickness in a movie before. And yes, I saw Quarantine, Blair Witch, and Cloverfield. No sickness at all.<br/><br/>In a nutshell - brilliant marketing and the ability to make people puke doesn't make a movie great."

"tilky","2","16","29","7 November 2009"," Overrated. Anti-climatic. Possibly the worst attempt at a psychological horror/thriller film that I have ever seen.
","Having never heard of 'Paranormal Activity' before, I came in expecting nothing from the film, but usually had a soft spot for indie films. My friend, however, was hyped up about the film, raving on about all the previous positive reviews on IMDb. We both came out equally empty, horribly unsatisfied and in awe. We were both shocked as to why we spent 86 minutes on a film that had no element of thrill and was anti- climatic. <br/><br/>If you are a viewer who expects cheap scares, this movie is definitely not for you. You will never see the face of the 'entity'. You will only hear it, see it's movements and it's shadow (that looks like one of an old man). The film works around scaring the audience psychologically. It however, fails to achieve this in any possible way, except for the use of the handy cams, immersing the audience into the same situation as the characters.<br/><br/>One positive feature of film is the suspense that is developed throughout. Your feelings will, however, alternate between experiencing suspense during the night scenes and disappointed as it becomes day time. You are left at the edge of the seat at every night scene, expecting something horrible to happen but it doesn't. The scariest scenes in the film is when Diane wakes up at 3:14 am and stands there for a good 2 hours or so, and when she is pulled out of the bed by the entity. Other than that, it is only the movement of a vase, burning of a Ouija board, closing of a door, and sounds of footsteps which is *supposed* to leave you at the edge of the seat. <br/><br/>The film lacks direction and overall background story behind Diane's possession. Who is this entity that is following her? Why is it following her? The director tries to solve this all by leaving a partially burnt photograph of little Diane. Diane reveals that she has been haunted by the entity for 8 years. But what provoked the entity to possess her now? The photograph of her childhood explains very little about the entity which tells me that it is a failure in the director's part in developing the background story. <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment of all is the ending. After many days of recording their tedious lives, Diane is finally possessed and it is suggested through the non-diegetic sounds that Micah is murdered by his girlfriend. We do not see any blood or killing as the camera is left placed on the tripod in the bedroom. Seconds later, the same fate is suggested of their female friend. After a minute or so, the police enter to find Diane in a shaken state.<br/><br/>Now, I'm the type of person who gets scared very easily to the extent of experiencing sleep paralysis and nightmares of the wicked witch in Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Honestly? After watching this, I felt violated in the way that the director was able to steal away 86 minutes of my time. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, the movie was overrated, anti-climatic, lacked a background story, unrealistic and of course, not scary.<br/><br/>Now if this review didn't change your decision about watching it, go ahead and watch it yourself. I already warned you."

This movie dismayed my thought that this couldn't happen. People were literally screaming and moaning in the audience. The girl who sat next to me couldn't watch the last hour because it was too intense for her. One girl next to my friend was crying she was so terrified. I'd totally recommend this for anyone who wants a good theater going experience because it just heightened the tension.

Yes it does and it is a far better film with seriously chilling exposures and a fantastic and real appearance of a very scary ghost....totally unlike PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. Even more irritating, is the fact that if you have seen the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY trailer, you have seen the punchline of the film so their marketing is spoiling the film before you see it.

"Kashmirgrey","2","28","56","22 October 2009"," The Paranormal Activity is in the ratings...
","Ten years ago, two guys, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, put together a scary little film on a peanut-shell budget and utilized the still-fledgling Internet to create a seemingly ""paranormal"" phenomenon which became known as The Blair Witch Project. The film was shot from a first person perspective of an amateur film crew out to investigate ""paranormal activity"" stemming from a spooky little backwoods legend. The effects were simple, yet spine-chillingly effective and many folks began re-thinking the whole camping idea. It was an amazingly original idea and to this day, I still consider the film and its marketing campaign a work of genius. It was something new and without a doubt, prompted the whole ""reality"" scene we are all too familiar with today.<br/><br/>Now, fast forward to present day and we have been shelled with a film which attempts to capitalize on all the elements that made Blair effective. This time, however, the gimmicks are a mere hodgepodge of unoriginality from its shallow introduction of the protagonists to the dragging around on the floor REC (Quarantine) style, to the open-ended questions that are meant to linger in our minds when the final credits role. To boot, there is this very suspicious marketing campaign that borders on the edge of unethical where screenings and online reviews more than likely have been staged by greedy film execs to hype up that which just isn't worthy of the hype. Let's seeÂ… we have shadows, doors opening and closing, chandeliers swinging, sinister voices, and a whole lota' screams from the female lead. We even have a Ouija board. I am not kidding. They are pulling all the stops on all the haunted house gags this time. I found myself wondering when Abbott and Costello were going to run through the room chased by a dangling skeleton. The most fun you might have watching this little venture is if you bring along a pad and pen and jot down which film each of the overplayed ""scares"" are stolen from. Then, however, you still are forced to endure the most boring of sequences to make it to the next evening all the while dismissing all logic to believe a couple would even remain in this haunted house.<br/><br/>Frankly, I am very disappointed. I had hoped for a fun and scary ride with Paranormal Activity but it turned out to be nothing more than pretentious in an annoying sort of way. What is most ""disturbing"" is this clatter and clang of borderline heresy I keep hearing that suggests Paranormal Activity gauges up there with films such as The Exorcist. If you can look me in the eye and keep a straight face while trying to convince me that such fear can be derived here, I will most certainly wince with a disgusted perplexity and reply, ""Surely you jest..."""

","Horrors these days are increasingly all about the huckster sell; the fairground barker's vulpine cry. That's always been the way of course (see William Castle), but it has become more pronounced in the era where surface is depth. Rope the suckers in on a tide of hype; switch the lights on and off and few times; rattle those pots and pans. Count the money behind the tent. Don't give them the pleasure. <br/><br/>Which brings us to Paranormal Activity: AKA 'one of the least scariest movies ever made'. I dunno, there's a world of difference between reports of whipped-up, hyped-up crowds jumping out of their skins... and the more banal reality of the audience I attended this with tonight, yawning and sniggering throughout and peering round curiously in the dark to see if anyone else was finding this as lame as they were. (Typical post-credits moment: an elderly boho Chelsea - that's Chelsea, London - couple, who huffed stiffly out muttering, ""I can't believe I paid good money too see that...). In fact, most people left the auditorium with a shrug.<br/><br/>Perhaps the whole camcorder horror thing's been done to death, has lost its potency. As if to counter this, the film really pulls out the stops in the final 5 minutes, in which a possessed girl is suddenly dragged around the room, Exorcist-style, and starts speaking with one of those multi-tracked 'demon voices' familiar from Buffy, Charmed and the like. Up to this point, there had been a vague ambiguity about proceedings - was this a genuine haunting, or have they been scaring themselves? That 'demon' voice is a really dumb decision that instantly renders the film even sillier and more redundant than it already is. Even the vastly overrated Blair Witch Project didn't stoop to those levels of crassness.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you want scary, see Robert Wise's original 1963 The Haunting; a film Paranormal Activity freely borrows from, with its clunks and clanks, but is infinitely more ingenious."

","That was just about it. I heard a lot of awesome things about the movie and I watched it with high hopes but it failed miserably. What the heck is it about anyway? Yeah, some ghost/demon/whatever keeps playing with their heads at night, opening the door, lighting the Ouija board on fire, turning the lights off and back on, SO WHAT? The only part of the movie that was actually good was when the ghost pulled her from her leg and dragged her. That was made well.<br/><br/>And that Micah guy, yeah his character is an ass hole that keeps blaming his girlfriend for everything that happens, sometimes even in a direct way - he told her it's her fault, remember. Truly dumb movie and let's not mention the horrendous ending. She stood up for 3 hours, kept looking at him and then went down then started screaming and he ran and died, how? why? where? No effin clue. Her friend came in and died as well, how, why, where, when? No clue. But why didn't the cops die? Because they have guns? LOL."

","If you find the sight of grass growing freighting, do not watch this movie alone ! However, if you’re like the rest of humanity you’ll find this movie miles beyond boring. In fact, if this movie was available a few years ago I am sure the CIA would have considered it an extreme torture technique and suitable for use at all our fine concentration camps. I can imagine a press conference featuring the former vice president voicing his insistence that he did not order captured terrorist suspects be subjected to this film.<br/><br/>The acting was amateurish, the dialogue childish, the production values nonexistent. The chubby female lead however was quite effective in her role as a nagging, annoying young women who seemed to be caught in a perpetual menstrual cycle. I found myself rooting for the paranormal presence, creature, whatever it was to finally seize her up and gag her mouth. I won’t spoil the ending of course but I will say it ended in a quite satisfying way.<br/><br/>This is a Halloween offering but don’t bite this apple, someone put a razor in it."

","Save your money. This movie is a dud. It was hard to sit through. The actress that plays the female lead has a fantastic rack and that's about the only thing that kept me watching, unfortunately we never get to see her ""real talents"". Supposedly there's a demon of some sort that's been following the female lead since she was 8 years old. It walks heavy and slams doors, turns water faucets on and off and then gingerly drags her out of bed one night and down the hall, so carefully mind you she doesn't bump so much as a toe while being dragged. Maybe it's a demon butler? I guess if you're afraid of the dark or superstitious you might buy into the hype, but for me I'd welcome some demonic possession. I've always wanted super powers and do you still have to pay taxes if you're demonically possessed?... Anyway needless to say I wasn't scared, in fact Show Girls was scarier than this movie..."

","Honestly, this movie is one of the worst scary movies I've seen yet. There were some parts that kept me on the edge of my seat, such as the girl getting dragged, or the footsteps, but for 99% of the movie, I was bored out of my mind. To be good, it needed some MAJOR help. First of all, the actors were not believable at ALL. Like seriously, I watched the whole movie NEVER, not once, sympathizing with these characters, waiting for them to die. (It's pretty obvious that they're gonna die) Plus, I sat there after thinking if I were in Mikah's shoes, and honestly, this is the first thing I thought. If the demon followed Katie(his girlfriend), and I was Mikah, I'd bone out as soon as creepy stuff started happening. Like honestly, who would stay? Second, you can cut out more than half the movie. The whole audience, well when I saw it, was waiting for the night scenes. No one really cares about what they do during the day. Out of 10, I thought this was a complete waste of money."
"Likes_Ninjas90","3","10","17","9 December 2009"," The only scary thing to be taken from this laughably bad horror film is that it could be the future of Hollywood cinema.
","In 2006, a couple named Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) are living in a house together that they suspect might be haunted. In order to prove the paranormal existence, Micah insists on filming the house regularly with a hand-held camera, hoping to profit from whatever they might find. Katie soon reveals to both Micah and a psychic that she visioned a ghost when she was much younger in her old home, suggesting that the spirit has followed her into this new house. As the activity of the haunting becomes more obvious with each day, Katie's behaviour also becomes stranger, taking a toll on her relationship with Micah.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is the first film by director Oren Peli and it is based on his very experience of having his own home haunted. Shot entirely on a hand-held camera, this film was made on a minuscule budget of just fifteen thousand dollars and was heavily promoted on social networking groups, such as Facebook, before being distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film has been labeled by some websites as one of 'the scariest movies of all time' and a trailer was developed supposedly showing the audiences fearful reactions in the USA. Despite these endorsements, Peli's film should more aptly be called one of the most overblown films of the year and quite possibly one of the dullest horror films in recent memory. Although it is not as nauseating as some other films, the persistence to shoot the film entirely on a hand-held camera, similar to The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, is firstly contrived. Micah insists on filming even in the broad daylight of the morning, while Katie herself sometimes takes over as Micah is just looking at research on his computer, such as a sound wave he recorded. To force the camera into each scene consistently, weakens the immersive qualities of what is already a flawed sub-genre. It is beyond difficult for a film to immerse its audience so strongly into the belief that they are watching a series of home movies and to make them forget that they are in a cinema.<br/><br/>Aesthetics aside, the film is also marred by the same flaws of so many horror films, mostly notably its lack of attention to the depth of characterisation and character development. No matter how attractive younger audience members may find them, both Micah and Katie are increasingly unlikeable throughout the film. Micah is particularly annoying, coming off as an immature brute, most notably when he films his girlfriend asking her for a striptease or waving his middle finger to the camera. There is nothing particularly interesting about either of these two boneheads as they are devoid of largely any back-story. They are also not aided by a script where the dialogue extends little beyond the 'oh my god' and 'what was that?' variant. Their constant whining and sniveling grows extremely tiresome after a while and it is hard to care about what happens to them. The only character development – if any – can be derived from Katie as she grows tired of the camera in her face and starts to decline as she is taken over by this force. It could hardly be called in-depth or original and still fails initiate our sympathy for her.<br/><br/>What will disappoint many pure horror fans though is just how derivative a lot of the film actually is. Not only is the film visually very dull because of the limited lighting, but the nature of the story, in being contained to just a few levels of the house, limits the number of ways that the narrative can really develop. Director Peril, who also wrote the screenplay, relies on all the clichés of yesteryear, with creaking doors closing by themselves, chandeliers shaking and unseen footsteps tapping on the floorboards. The unsubtly of this, and the fact that we have seen it so many times before, makes these moments largely ineffective. Audiences are more likely to derive more fearsome sounds from the fall of armrests in the cinema or the footsteps of people walking out through boredom while they are left to watch this mess. The repetition of filming Micah's bedroom at night, with the camera setup by itself on a tripod, is particularly tiresome too, as apart from an admittedly brief jolt at the very end of the film, barely anything eventuates. A noise is heard and then a character wakes up to ask 'what was that?' It is difficult to take many of the films supposedly dramatic moments seriously, such as footprints appearing or an Ouija board setting itself on fire, because of their sheer ludicrousness. In one scene a doctor who was invited to investigate the house walks in and then immediately says that he has to leave because the presence of evil is too strong. Maybe he just felt the great danger his career was in with this abomination and got out while he could: lucky him. It is the lack of drama, climaxes and scares in so many of the films scenes that will baffle some and just frustrate others.<br/><br/>The only scary thing to be taken from this laughably bad horror film is that it could be the future of Hollywood cinema. The minimal budget and maximum profit from soaring ahead of established franchises like Saw, has meant that a sequel has already been confirmed for release next year. It will be interesting to see how audiences respond to a sequel following such a thoroughly dull and unimaginative affair. Suspend your disbelief once more and hope the only way from here is up. Paranormal Activity is a real disappointment."

I went in hoping that if I opened up I might actually be scared, but about a quarter in I had given up even being as entertained as I was by Cloverfield.<br/><br/>This movie went directly from potentially suspenseful/spooky to outright cheap, blunt, heavy handed schlock. The (adlibbed?) acting is initially convincing, but the protective boyfriend becomes the ""when is this d-bag going to die"" boyfriend in next to no time. I saw it with my wife, who is a lot easier to scare than myself, and she was laughing before I was.

","This is just a boring, terrible horror film which was held back from theaters for 2 years because it was bad. It's Halloween time though and they thought that they might get some poor suckers to pay their hard earned cash to see this slow moving, poorly filmed, non professional film.<br/><br/>But it won awards at Independent Film Awards ! What does that tell you ?<br/><br/>Ghost stories are really easy to do and they have been pulled off on stage by magicians since the 1700's. A mirror, a string on a door will close it, blah, blah..blah. The one good effect was the moving planchette in the living room (I am sure that cost 3/4th of their budget), but there was no one else in the room to react to it, so it just lays there flat. They use the old banging on the door gag from the original ""Haunting of Hill House"", but unlike that movie; this film doesn't have actors who are able to pull off terror-at all ! When things are unseen on film the actors must be able to convince us that they are real. Every actor in this film does a terrible job in suspending disbelief. I don't even believe when the male lead is making fun of the Ghost Buster. Next the music is really...really important, and with these ""Reality"" type horror films it just has to be lacking to keep it ""Real"" (I have quite a bit of spooky songs on my laptop just in case I have a real ""ghost"" situation in my house so I can play some theme music to get them, and me, into the mood HAHAHA),the lighting is important, also a difficult choice for Reality horror movies as is the editing; here we see only wipes and fades.<br/><br/>It's hard to make a movie, there are so many things that go wrong every minute of the production. New film makers look for something to cash in on, some hook to make their film stand out. The Reality horror market has been Blair Witched out, leave it alone, and find a new way to approach these wonderful benefit to society. Everybody loves to face death (in a safe theater, at home on TV, or even in an amusement park), it fills us with a release that is robbed from us in modern life and is a service to humankind.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that this film, and many others of late, will someday be considered the bad films of their time. Reality is mundane, for the most part, my friends, real horror is mundane, unless you are there to witness it.

The theater was about half full so all of the ""elements"" were there and after about a lifetime of trailers the no-frills film began. All I can possibly say is do not believe the hype. If this is the scariest movie someone has ever seen than might I sneak behind said person and pop a bag full of air. I have now surpassed Paranormal Activity on the terror scale. The sheer silliness of Katie and Micah's video documentation of demon harassment elicited more guffaws than gasps of horror. When the film ended abruptly the audience sat in silence for about five seconds before someone asked incredulously ""Is THAT it?"" to which I replied ""we all got duped"". On a side note might I lobby Hollywood now to discontinue the nausea inducing shaky camera films. If I want to wretch at the theater I'll go see a Michael Moore ""documentary"". The fact that this movie was made with only $15,000 should not be a source of pride rather a main reason this film is so boring to begin with. Because it's a budget film did I get to pay a budget ticket? The media hype surrounding this movie is pure marketing 101 as there was not one moment where I was even remotely intrigued into what was going to happen next. I found myself however more interested in Katie's bustline as it appears that she has natural D-cup size breasts. Only horror movie I ever left with a hard-on. Oh well, another lesson I should have learned especially after seeing ""The Happening"" that cinema is actually getting worse by the year. Soon to be followed by Saw VII: Citizens on Patrol."

","Interesting mix of reviews here. A lot of one or two stars, and others saying that the film is great. I think it all depends on how you approach this film. If you're coming into the theatre with the attitude ""I'm a horror movie fan, lets see some shock scenes, gore"" etc, then maybe it's not what you're looking for. If, however, you approach with an open mind and take it for what it is, is can be very frightening indeed.<br/><br/>Approach this film with an open mind. Don't hide behind your ""knowledge"" of horror films, or with your movie-critic hat on.<br/><br/>The film, as mentioned in other reviews, is seen through the eyes of a video recorder. This imparts a unique sense of voyeurism, realism, immediacy and believability; but also -crucially- a sense of protection, as we (as the audience) are kept ""behind"" the main characters or ""behind"" the lens, maintaining a subtle distance from the action. The most frightening part of the film is when this illusion of distance is shattered."
"drunkenhopfrog","4","21","42","18 October 2009"," Disappointment Not Hype Related
","The movie had an auspicious path to release. Initially there were whispers about the tiny budget indie movie that could; there was the hokey (and almost certainly hoax) claim by eventual producer Steven Spielberg that his screener copy of the movie was haunted; then there was the nearly unanimous clout given by reviewers of the festival scene claiming the film contained unimaginable fright; and finally there was a purportedly grass roots effort that ended in propelling the movie from its limited midnight only distribution to wide release.<br/><br/>'Paranormal Activity' takes on the style of a ""hidden footage"" film. Recent movies of note to use a similar style were Cloverfield (2008) and Rec (2007). The entire movie takes place in one house and most of the ""activity"" is in one room. It uses a combination of sound based and off-camera activity to help build tension and heighten the sense of the unknowable. There is very little by way of visual horror.<br/><br/>The film opens with the viewer being introduced to the main character, the camera, as well as the main human participants, Kate and Micah. The viewer is never to forget that the camera is present and that there is no doubt that the camera is an intrusive presence. It seems that every other dialog part in the movie is Kate, in some form or another, complaining, ""Micah, turn the camera off."" The redundant exchange is grating. And oddly familiar. Then one recalls the same device being used ad nauseam in The Blair Witch Project. At that point the familiar becomes hackneyed.<br/><br/>One could argue that the entire execution of 'Paranormal Activity' has been done once before in the decade old 'The Blair Witch Project.' It may be the limitation of the ""found footage"" medium, but other than the considerably longer runtime of 'Paranormal Activity,' the pacing, style of tension built (sounds, character reactiveness, off camera action), and even the sequence of events including the finale are almost exact.<br/><br/>When the camera goes live, we are slowly told the story of Kate and her life-long battle with disturbances around her. The manifestations started when she was eight, always seemed focused on her, but even her sister could see the disturbances. She describes her fifteen year ordeal in great detail to a psychic who agreed to visit the house and hoped to help. The psychic, however, informs the couple that he deals with ghosts and reconnecting with the dead. Kate's problem is something else entirely, according to the psychic, and he refers her to a colleague in a field that might be able help. (The psychic has one more scene later on and it is one of the best in the film.) <br/><br/>At this point Micah pulls some kind of daft hissy fit where he forces Kate to ignore the ""fruit"" of a psychic and let him, Micah, deal with the problem. Micah, see, is a Day Trader, and he has access to this thing called the ""internet"" which allows him to visit, over the ""word wide web,"" a web page called Wikipedia as well as some Angelfire and Geocities web pages that has precise information regarding this little problem of Kate's. It would be no problem for him to figure this thing out. That, in its entirety, is inferred. Kate, as tortured and near breakdown as she is, agrees.<br/><br/>The movie will sputter, catch, rev, stall, and eventually die. There's no question that one must be able to suspend his disbelief to catch fright in a movie like 'Paranormal Activity.' I'm usually able to do that well enough to enjoy any film, but not this one. After a few taunt moments about halfway in, the movie gets so caught up in its tired repetition that one ultimately gets bored with the thing.<br/><br/>Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion. Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion. Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion.<br/><br/>Whatever is behind Kate's problem could be burning entire villages in Tanzania and dumping the charred bones on their bedroom floor and Micah would still Have this covered, babe, armed with a Ouija board. Micah's character arc, or lack thereof, is a woeful disservice to the movie. It is not until the last moment that Micah thinks that whatever is happening is beyond his expertise as a day trader.<br/><br/>The scenes of occurrence themselves have very little cumulative effect. Each, individually, are barely nerve-wracking but are underscored with a single note of subtle deep resonating bass. The nearly subconscious suggestion of the note whispers, ""wait for it wait for it"" Awesome idea. I thought so when David Lynch did it in the BOB and dream sequences from Twin Peaks twenty years ago as well.<br/><br/>After the brief tension at the little before half point, the viewer must wait until the last act for a few more possible chills. In this act it is all in Kate's hands. Micah has gone into Day Trader Retreat and keeps maniacally fiddling with the camera, so Kate does what she does best and carries what little quality there is in the film. Her fear is palatable (which makes one wonder even more why she let Captain Day Trader attempt to save the day) to the viewer and what gut wrenching one feels in the film can directly be attributed to Kate. The final few occurrences are as close to scary as the movie gets.<br/><br/>In summary, if one keeps the perspective that 'Paranormal Activity' was made for something like twelve grand, then it would have to be considered a strong effort.<br/><br/>But is 'Paranormal Activity' is an unqualified success and extraordinarily scary without caveat?

","I'm sorry, but there have been so many people at my school saying that this movie was so scary, and they can not sleep at night. I go to blockbuster and get two movies ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Saw V"". I go home and watch Paranonormal Activity first with a couple people thinking it will be scary. If somebody saw this movie with out knowing anything about it, they probably would have thought that it was a comedy. The acting, the production, the saying that the movie was ""based on a true story"". Giving facts about the criminal investigation, was just awful. This movie was completely thought up by the writer, none of it was based on anything, but somebody's mind. After watching this and laughing, I was so glad to see Saw V. Saw V was a good movie. To anyone thinking of seeing this movie, just don't, or you will be afraid of a pile of crap coming at you with a knife."

I am fed up with this pretend to be made on a camcorder films. the story was very boring, the bits i was able to watch without being sick. who ever compared this film to exorcist, needs their head examined. it was rubbish , no story, no actors, only one scary bit at very end. not worth the wait. don't go and see it. and i was feeling ill for two days afterwards, just like sea sickness. they should have to have signs out by the ticket office telling you it it will make you feel nauseas."

","This is known as one of the scariest movies of 2009. Quite how it gained this reputation, I am unsure. Maybe a load of old heart attack patients where used in the test-screening. Because my horror friends, this movie is really not scary. The whole movie is just loud bangs and doors slamming shut, building up to an extremely predictable climax. In fact, some moments were more laughable than scary. For example,(SPOILER CITY) near the film's climax the female character Katie is pulled quickly out of bed by her ankle. Although this is meant to be scary, the entire cinema howled with laughter at this moment. But it isn't just the horror that makes this film so utterly appalling, the acting in some cases is absolutely dreadful. the young woman playing Katie cannot pull of scared realistically. This may not be so bad, however, we are supposed to believe that this is all real footage! In some cases the acting was so awful that i felt i was catapulted back to the 50's B-movies. OK, that may be a little exaggerated, but believe me, the acting is terrible. There was also a whole character who just felt thrown in for no reason. In fact at one stage we are supposed to believe that this man has come from miles away to simply say to them, ""I can't help you'"" and then leaves. Also, i promise, you will want Micah dead by the climax(lucky you). He is such a stupid a**hole that you cannot believe he is so dumb. ""I know, lets contact this evil demon and anger it instead of getting help, that will solve all our problems duh!"" clever guy... So this Halloween, don't bother with Paranormal Activity, get something scary instead. i recommend the Shining or Halloween."

I felt like throwing up at times due to the camera handling.<br/><br/>Many things did not work in this movie but I'll spare describing all this in details. Only, when the demon - or whatever it is - finally kicks some ass in the end, I was really relieved: this joke of a couple was so damn irritating, they deserved the spook. In fact, I thought this demon was a bit of a pussy. It took this thing quite a few nights before the final act (nothing paranormal about the conclusion though: demon bad so demon kills, basta). I mean, why is this stuff so slow to show off its badness ? just an excuse to make this film last 1h40 instead of 5mn."

When something that was supposed to be scary happened, I just laughed my butt off. Yes, I know that they mentioned that, all the events actually happened. No, I don't even care about it. My advice to anyone that wants to see this is: Don't let anyone fool you! This movie is probably the weakest movie ever put in theatres! I normally don't put any spoilers in my reviews but seeing as it would be too short if I didn't I'll post the two scenes that were probably the scariest compared to most of the film (Which I was also found myself laughing):<br/><br/>1. The girl lies in bed and appears to have fallen down the bed. The girl realizes that she is being dragged by the ghost haunting her, as she slides across the bedroom floor to the hall.<br/><br/>2. That same girl leaves the bedroom, screams, her boyfriend runs after her. The girl returns to the room with a bloody knife. She appears to be possessed, as she sides beside the bed.

","I will admit I had a string of emotions for Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>First, and foremost, it was a deep laughter. I couldn't stop laughing. I kept thinking they got the title wrong because you wait sooo long for any activity to happen in Paranormal Activity. Then, I was simply bored and began to fall asleep; so I guess that was a mixture of boredom and exhaustion. Finally, I was upset that, even at its extremely minimal length (and action) that I even bothered to waste about an hour and a half of my life watching a poorly made 5-minute YouTube video stretched way too long. We'll call that one frustration. (Another emotion I simply made up, and thoroughly annoyed my roommate, was whenever something bumped or ohhhh moved on its own (like those scary keys or that door!) I shouted out a fake scream, or the old ""OHHHH"" like the ghosts in cartoon past.) I guess if one is scaaared of what bumps in the night is a demon that follows you around, then maybe, MAYBE you might be frightened. But really, watch The Exorcist for more depth, horror and suspense.<br/><br/>I'd like to go back to my initial reaction. I seriously laughed my ass off. I am so glad I didn't see this at one of those midnight showings. I'm sure they would have kicked me out.<br/><br/>In addition to the numerous ""MICAH!"" shouted out every few minutes – finally someone topped the number of times ""JACK!"" and ""ROSE!"" was screamed in Titanic, there were an abundant of funny lines spoken. My personal favorite was: ""Maybe we shouldn't have the camera."" I shouted ""YES! I agree! I'd rather watch the old snow on TV like in the much better Poltergeist!"" We have this enormously dysfunctional couple who, just as partners, decide to move in with each other. I've been told prior to the viewing that he's mean to her, and she carries some demon with her from place to place. I agree with the second part, though I wish the demon would've got to her before the movie began. I don't agree with the first part of the synopsis. He is not mean to her; he reacted like any rational human would (as I would have.) In addition, she held back a huge part of her – this ooooh floor stomping demon, and he called her on it. Her defense was: she didn't want to tell him on their first date, so he asked why not up to the 30th date or when they decided to live together. That's right. She was wrong.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie too much air (screen) time. It's a very boring, very slow and very funny movie for someone with $50 and a camera. Virtually nothing happens, but this male-half decides to film anyways. For 86 agonizing minutes we hear and see something that could be part of any Junior High Haunted House kiddie fundraiser. If this was just that and my fifty cents went to help the kids go to college, I would still ask for my money back.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say that's nice about this is that I applaud yet another fantastic ad-campaign, like Blair Witch's, I am happy they avoided trickery in making the audience believe this was real. Fool me once Don't see this movie. Don't see the inevitable sequel. As in the movie where a lot of the video shown was fast-forwarded, that's what you'll want to do as well."

It seemed everyone in the theater that we attended left wanting more and feeling short changed dollar for dollar. Simply put..A big let down after hearing positive reviews from someone who obviously saw a different flick. When I think scary I think The Omen and The Exercist.

If it happens on the screen, I would hope to see something in the basement, even if it's a faint reflection on a window. But no... there was nothing in the basement. - If I set up a trap for a ghost or a demon and the next day the trap proves that there was something there, it would be scary as hell.

The film starts with the two main characters who are terrible at acting, they were trying too hard to be ""normal"" and seem like their relationship was real, which they fail at.

In the night the camera is set up and predictable enough things start to happen and gradually build up and up more each night. One part was scary when the girl is dragged from her bed, but even this wasn't all that amazing and happened around and hour and a half into the film by which time i just wanted to sleep. The woman gradually gets more and more weird and you expect her to turn into the girl from the exorcist, but just as the film starts to get interesting it ends. It was a big waste of my time.

","Far from the promise of its puzzling hype, Paranormal Activity is not scary, suspenseful, or even particularly interesting.

Since I had an old gift card for the admission, I could sit back and watch a truly rare example of pointless and bad cinema.<br/><br/>This movie was quite funny in parts, although I doubt the makers intended to keep the audience laughing, as the one in my theater did throughout the picture. The fairly annoying main characters mouth the humdrum script unenthusiastically, never managing an iota of development, and without establishing a modicum of concern for their fate, which is fairly obvious early in the game.

Paranormal Activity provides an eerie atmosphere and it all felt very real; the main characters were incredibly relatable and I couldn't help but feel a great deal of empathy for both of them throughout the entire movie. While there is a great lack of jump scares, the atmosphere and build up of suspense more than makes up for it. I felt a sense of dread take over me as the story progressed to a point of what I can only describe as sheer hopelessness. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that the antagonist is never seen, so your imagination can take off in a variety of directions which for me personally makes it all the more frightening. If you're into found footage horror films and have not seen this yet, you're missing out."
"indigo-09227","7","2","2","11 December 2016"," Scarier for Men?
","I remember watching Paranormal Activity with my sister and her friend during high school. Yes, they were fairly scared during the film, but nothing compared to how effected I was. I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Any other horror movies I watched I easily laughed off and got on with my life. I wondered what was so different about this one. While asking around, I realized how many of my male best friends were legitimately scared by this film compared to others. Paranormal Activity challenges its male viewers more than its women viewers by introducing an unwinnable situation that takes the power away from the masculine. <br/><br/>A simple summary of the basic plot: a wife is being threatened by this invisible, other-worldly being whose increasing power begins to take over her body. Her husband, filming the entire ordeal, vocally contests it and attempts numerous times to fight it. Eventually losing, the wife becomes completely possessed and murders her husband. <br/><br/>So what makes this different from most horror movies? Firstly, the antagonist of the film seems virtually unstoppable. It is somewhat physical and never actually shows what it looks like (all we know is that it has claws). This expands the imagination for both the characters and the viewers. Throughout the entire movie, there are several attempts to stop this thing but none of them are even remotely successful. <br/><br/>Then, we have the husband we must analyze at a strictly primal level. As the male, it is engrained in us to protect our mate from any threats. Through this natural kind of thinking, it is assumed that all threats are somehow beatable (a bear, the cold, etc.) but this demon breaks the bounds of nature and frequently demonstrates its invincibility. This is incredibly emasculating to the husband, and through him, the male audience. <br/><br/>Men, at their most primitive nature, are intended to safeguard the women and provide for them. Any hopelessness in that sort of category can make a man fearful. This is why serial killer movies tend to resonate more for women rather than men. The males, although probably unrealistic, believe that the serial killer, as a human, is physically beatable. They convince themselves that in the character's shoes, they would come out alive and on top. It is less plausible, however, when squaring up against an unstoppable and intangible demonic presence. This is, of course, entirely theory and does not encompass all male and female mindsets."
"gratiste76","1","2","2","17 October 2013"," Horror Hoax
","I heard so much about Paranormal Activity, the movie that so many listed as the scariest movie ever. There is even few sequels made. I tried to watch it when it was released, but gave up after few minutes. Meanwhile, after huge marketing campaign and all of the boom how scary this movie is I give it a try for a second time. After approx. an hour of watching I could not stand it anymore. There is more lame and dumb scenes in the movie than scary one. Those scary moments are too short and there is more stupid and boring scenes with two for me very repulsive characters than interesting one. Just when I was hooked during night scenes it rejects me to a boring state, an awful daytime scenes. It is like someone puts you in a tension of one genre, and then cut that in a different kind of genre. By that action whole concept falls apart. It is all related but awfully connected. Like some bad amateurish work. Horror at the night scenes, soap opera through daylight. And horror part is not actually that uber scary. Yes, the characters is very repulsive for me, especially the girl. The storyline is not original, it is like repeating well known clichÃ© from many established movies about ghosts. The camera work is awful, yet it is supposed to be kind a footage type. There is also so much unlogical and dumb actions, for example: during the scariest moments those two experience, the male character grabs his camera and tried to record it. I suppose the logical reaction would be panicking and be too scared to grab the camera for recording, even thinking rationally. Nothing realistic. Overall it is very bad movie and I would not recommend it to anyone who are experienced horror fan. For bunch of kids that wants fun and have no experience in movies at all might be good for watching. Otherwise waste of time. I am glad I did not buy this DVD or ticket i the theater I would probably sue them for selling horror hoax."

","The hand-held camera records to people sleeping. Then they wake up because they think they heard something. The tension build,and builds, AND!... nothing happens! Repeat this with some horrible acting in- between during daytime, and there you have Paranormal Activity, folks. Hands down the least scary horror movie I've ever watched. I'll admit that the found footage-take on the otherwise worn-out haunted house- genre sounded like a good idea, which is why I thought it would be more realistic and frightening. But my suggestion: try to add the creep- factor. People are more scared of a sneaking, claustrophobic feeling(Insidious) or the a creepy entity subtly lurking around (Sinister)than a door shutting itself... Do something about it. If you add the aforementioned, it would still be paranormal, and it would be all the more frightening, due to the ""this is real""-perspective. When the movie begins, the first that thing hits after five minutes is a feeling of doubt regarding whether this is real or not, and kudos for that. But the end can be seen coming from the second Katie reveals that some sort of demon has been haunting her since she was eight. And guess what, you are right. *SPOILER* The demon DOES possess her, and it wins a battle that you realize from the start that is lost for the good guys. The unpredictable is scary, NOT the stuff you see coming from miles away! At this point, I advice anyone reading this to see the message boards for this movie. There is a description of how you are supposed to watch this movie. Really? Do you have to follow a description to make it scary? Why can't it just be scary in the first place? Yeah, that's probably it. YOU don't understand that it's absolutely horrifying, but it IS! Last time I checked, nobody can tell me ""now you are scared"". When something scares me, I know. And Paranormal Activity doesn't. Grab some popcorn and watch a zombie-slasher instead."

Then we have the girl who you will constantly wonder if she is actually hot or if it is just her big boobs. 90% of this film is watching people sleep...oh yeah, that is freaking horrifying *rolls eyes*. The whole movie is about as interesting as listening to someone talk about their day at the office and about just as scary as well. Most of the stuff this demon does seems not evil or scary but just silly and petty like the demon is a middle school kid. I am starting to wonder if this was a fake documentary on raising a kid in middle school but they edited out the kid and re recorded a few lines to try to make it a horror film about an invisible demon.<br/><br/>Bad acting, terrible writing and laughably bad dialog. This film does do one thing right which is that it can put you to sleep. I after finishing the film last night realized it was getting kind of late so I should head to bed and since I like to put a movie on to watch I decided to put on Paranormal Activity again since it did a good job of making me drowsy the first time and sure enough I fell asleep no problem and I normally have pretty bad insomnia.

"Hey_Sweden","6","2","2","23 February 2013"," A fairly effective movie for this genre.
","""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those polarizing movies that, for the most part, will simply either work for the viewer or not. While scanning the most popular reviews, one can see comments ranging from quite positive to quite negative. In any event, it certainly developed a winning formula for success, having been filmed on a VERY low budget and generating huge revenue, proving that big budgets aren't necessary to create a box office sensation. It takes no name actors and puts them in a ""found footage"" scenario as a boyfriend (Micah Sloat) stubbornly insists on documenting just about everything when he and his girlfriend (Katie Featherston) start experiencing strange phenomena in their large and opulent San Diego home. As can be expected, things start out small and become creepier as time goes on. Eventually, things end with a big bang. Director Oren Peli manages to create a good atmosphere for the many night time scenes, and some genuine shocks, and does all of this with a noticeable lack of special effects. Our two leads are able to consult with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), who gives them some valuable knowledge, but he's still not exactly an expert in matters deemed to be demonic in nature, so there is little that they can do to protect or arm themselves. The very minimal level of performers also helps to achieve a level of intimacy, and the movie never leaves the one location of the house. Understandably, it's kind of hard to sympathize with the somewhat annoying Micah, who keeps up a pretty cavalier attitude towards the whole thing, and he's one of those characters in these types of movies who keeps the camera going even when implored by another to stop. Katie is definitely a more universally appealing character, but she does bring some baggage to the relationship and scenario, as strange things have been happening to her for much of her life. Ultimately, this viewer gives this moderately positive feedback because, while it never gripped him the way it did so many others, it still managed to come up with some good and eerie moments, and does a fine job of giving off that whole vibe of a house in the early hours of the A.M.

"noway234-1","Null","2","2","31 October 2011"," I'm sorry, what was the scary part again?
","I'm not a horror snob. I like movies that have a long build up to a big payoff scare right at the end. I like movies that take their time and are willing to take a chance... here's the catch, they have to be worth the wait. If I'm going to sit through an hour of build up, the last half an hour better shock me to my very core.<br/><br/>In terms of scares, this film had surprisingly few good ones, and absolutely none that were in any way truly shocking. Doors slamming and things moving randomly can be scary if done right, here it was just done randomly. There were some creepy moments like the woman standing beside the bed and I'll admit that the ending kind of made me jump... but not because of tension but because it came out of nowhere.<br/><br/>A good horror movie will do one of two things, it'll either make likable characters that you want to survive if it's a small movie with only a few main characters, or they will make a large amount of unlikable characters for a high body count. This movie combines the two, no likable characters so we don't care if they survive, but there's only 1 confirmed kill in this movie, and you don't even see it that well.<br/><br/>Now the alternative ending is genuinely unsettling. The shot of the woman just walking into the room and then slitting her own throat, that was genuinely unnerving. What we got, weird CGI, another jump scare that confused instead of unnerved and a text ending that tries to pass the whole thing off as real... yeah I could live without that, not scary at all.<br/><br/>This is a horror movie for people who don't like horror movies who want to say that they've seen a horror movie. If you grew up watching actually good horror movies, chances are you won't be scared by this. The only t hing that it did right was word of mouth marketing... and that's not enough to be considered a good movie"
"raoulgomezmorille","3","2","2","5 September 2011"," Well... It's not the scariest film ever made.
","Just a quick summary of the film: After moving into a suburban home, a couple becomes increasingly disturbed by a nightly demonic presence.<br/><br/>Okay, If like me, you have seen the trailers and the ads for Paranormal Activity, you see the audience jumping and hiding behind friends or clothes. Then a man says in a deep voice ""One of the scariest films ever made"" and I watched it thinking ""oh my god, I'm going to sleep with the lights on"" or ""I'm going to s*** myself"" and after I thought ""What the fudge is this?"" but thinking about it, I can understand why people were jumping or hiding behind clothes but honestly, ""Coraline"" or ""The Corpse Bride"" or ""The nightmare before Christmas"" is scarier. Okay, back to the story. Paranormal Activity is about a couple living in a house, thinking there is some sort of demon there and the husband or boyfriend ""Micah"" videotapes his experiments and their experiences. That's right ladies and gentleman, it is like the ""Blair Witch project"". Now, this film is very tense I'm not going to deny that but it is not scary and that's what a horror is supposed to be. WARNING, THIS IS A SPOILER! WARNING THIS IS A SPOILER! near the end, that's where it gets jumpy. I wouldn't say scary but jumpy. I credit the film makers though as the way it was filmed was smart (even though there is mistakes easily spotted). And the acting wasn't to bad as well, considering that it must of been hard to be the center of the film without a lot of co-stars. The ads and the trailers murdered this film I think and it did not live up to the hype for me (especially when the guy with the deep voice in the ad said ""this horror would go down in history"" or something like that, its should not be in the same list as the exorcism, the others, SAW 1, Shutter, Trick r treat, let the right one in and many more) A very tense film but not scary,"
"petra_ste","6","2","2","27 February 2010"," Morons versus haunting - cue $$$
","Perhaps best described as The Blair Witch Project meets the Exorcist meets the Darwin Awards, Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity is one of those ""love or hate it"" movies - some praise it as the scariest thing ever committed to celluloid, others claim it's boring and uneventful. Personally, I found it a passable effort, although my patience with the series has grown thinner with each successive episode. ""One-trick pony"" pretty much describes it.<br/><br/>Low budget can excuse many things - repetitive structure, no special effects, a single location, a tiny cast - but not lazy writing. If something starts haunting your house and dragging you from bed in the middle of the night, I'll guarantee you will at the very least LOCK YOUR BEDROOM DOOR.<br/><br/>Economically, however, this was a work of veritable genius. This stuff cost less than a used car and made like 10000% of its original budget at the box office. Young movie-makers all around the world are probably salivating at the thought.<br/><br/>5,5/10"

","98% of this film is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. The other 2% is contrived and pointless. Right, and I just sat through it.<br/><br/>Its a substandard mix of Blair Witch and Exorcist with the plot quality of your average teen slasher movie. Strangely enough, that makes most of this almost believable as a straight edit of a home movie. Then, in the last 2 minutes, either the director or the film editor made a really bad decision on the final scene, threw away any shred of common sense and went for a contrived ending.<br/><br/>What I really do not get is how anyone thinks any of this film is even slightly scary, or will stop them sleeping. Had any of the themes or plot devices been original, it would have helped, but since the sole selling point of this is the BWP style hand held camera, it fails.<br/><br/>The one part that had me thinking at all was the sequence where Micah spreads powder to catch the demon's (NOT A GHOST!!!) foot/hoof/paw prints. The ploy works, until you see them. Chicken feet? What???? Even worse, the short sequence played back to show the marks being made very clearly shows three exact prints being made, by a biped, no powder kicked around, no impression of the feet (etc) rolling from ball to toes.... Why didn't he try and cover the demon with flour or something instead? I was guessing on a four foot tall, bad tempered, be-horned #something# for the dramatic irony, based on the 8 inch long feet. <br/><br/>What would have helped the film a little, if ram raiding the Exorcist plot a bit, is the concept of actually bringing the demonologist in on the scene. Instead we get the very obvious demonic possession followed swiftly by the murder and the silly ending, that makes the whole unconvincing.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but unless you really want an excuse to fall asleep for two hours, simply avoid this film."

In fact if I was pressed into a movie comparison I'd choose Blair Witch 2 because at least the first had some originality upon its emergence, this stanky mess is more a poorly related sequel than any original horror.<br/><br/>The story would have been better served up as a conventional horror instead of trying to steal some reality TV steam (which has long since lost itself) through a poor poor poor reasoning as to why so many mundane activities were being filmed; bad idea that crippled this film.<br/><br/>Save yourself the effort; rent it when it comes out, skip the first hour and scan through the 'scary' bits."

"thefilmguy7","3","14","27","1 November 2009"," Predictable Activity
","Films that used to garner this much hype lived up to it. Now days audiences seem easily impressed by mediocre films. I am very rarely bored during films of this genera but I found myself looking at the time in between fits of yawning. This film has nothing scary to offer except some moments where things jump at the screen. The tension of the scenes poorly builds up and rarely if ever delivers anything memorable. The dialogue is atrocious and unbearable in most of the scenes. In all of these types of films, people always ask the camera man to turn off the camera and why is he still filming, and as an audience member I'm wondering the same thing. Repeatedly in this film his girlfriend asks him to stop filming and yet he continues. Even going so far as to push the camera into her face when she is emotional or scared seeming more interested in capturing the moment than showing any care or compassion for her. They continually go over the same points and the same arguments in between every haunting. Their reasoning and solutions are both predictable and ridiculous. This film just follows the conventions that Blair Witch and Cloverfield established before it and has nothing new to offer the genera. All of the films pretty much begin the same way and end the same way. You'd think that they would be interested in mixing it up and surprising the audience but apparently they take their target audience for suckers. I guess they judge their audience correctly seeing as some how this garbage has made as much money as it has. All it does is rip off much better films before it in hopes of luring an ignorant audience to the theater. Classics are no longer made but just copied. I'm beginning to wonder if we will ever again see anything truly original from films or if we are trapped in a void of cinematic butchery. The sad truth is that as long as ignorant audiences keep flocking to see this ripped off trash then Hollywood will continue to shovel them out."

It's not scary, it's not funny, it's just plain ridiculous and boring. Nothing happens, the characters are utterly annoying, I'm not sure about the acting, the situations aren't very realistic (the characters never turn the lights on after the mysterious event, but the entity does, though not all of them). In a way, I'm being unfair. It's an amateur movie, and this is how it should be treated, I guess. But it's been very well marketed by smart people who've understood they could make a huge bang for the buck by creating some buzz around it. And it's worked. A totally cheap movie with a not so good scenario and not so good actors has earned its creators huge sums of money, all astute marketing. Thumbs up for that. Thumbs down for the rest."

","This Movie Sucked. I went in to it wondering what the hype was all about and that in itself is what lead to its downfall and why I didn't give it a lower score. The story is quite simple, a couple has recently moved into a house and began to experience Paranormal Activity. The entire movie is shot similar to Blair Witch and Cloverfield by using 'Archive Video Tape Logs' they tell the story through the lens. You also learn that the woman has been haunted since childhood and that's its not really the house that's haunted, it's her-kinda. A few things happen and I did get a little scared on a couple scenes but it wasn't enough to save the entire film.<br/><br/>The Acting isn't that good either. The lead characters have no chemistry and both come across as boring and dull, if I knew them in real life, I would only hang with them if they brought the spirits cos that's the only thing that's interesting about those two leads.<br/><br/>The movie ends quite nicely and that scene alone is probably the best in the film but again, too little too late.<br/><br/>So, don't believe the hype and save this movie for a boring Sunday afternoon or when you have time to kill.<br/><br/>peace."

","This was originally an independent film that Paramount bought out. Even though Paramount bought it out, they kept the movie exactly the same. After finally being able to find a theater that wasn't sold out I prepared myself to have the hell scared out of me due to the media hyping up the movie so much. I watched trailers and people's recorded reactions to the movie and it seemed absolutely terrifying. Yay for me! Or so I thought.<br/><br/>The movie was a total of 99 minutes long and the break down was this: 90 minutes of the couple sleeping 7 minutes of the couple arguing 2 minutes of ""action""<br/><br/>The style in which the movie was filmed was unique and actually very well done and helped the audience feel as though they were there with the couple in the movie. The couple in the movie were the ones who actually filmed it and it gave such a realistic feeling to it. You saw everything they saw and didn't go out of their way to hide the camera in view of the mirrors to add to the realism. The special effects, even though there wasn't many, were very believable and nothing was computer generated. It used a very well done stop motion for majority of the ""action"" scenes. The acting wasn't bad at all considering this was an indie film.<br/><br/>Beyond what I said in the above paragraph, this movie had nothing else to offer. There was a very underdeveloped plot to the point where Napoleon Dynamite looked like it had a more developed plot. The storyline was extremely predictable which isn't always what makes a movie bad but since this movie was so poorly developed it was one of the reasons why it failed to be a good movie. There was a complete lack of action scenes and I'm not complaining about the pretty much zero blood and gore content. You find more blood and action in your daily soap operas/stories. The language was mild so it is beyond me how this received a ""R"" rating. There were no scenes that made you jump at all and this isn't just from my opinion and experience. My best friend who is scared of her own shadow didn't even jump or find anything scary about this movie. Unless you are scared of breathing, then you won't be scared of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie had so much potential and the only horror that I found in it was that it lacked so much for all the hype it got. Had this movie been developed more plot wise and action scene wise this could have been an amazing movie.<br/><br/>My Rating: 2 out of 10"

The distributor is trying to use word-of-mouth to turn this into a runaway blockbuster. If the movie wasn't so bad I wouldn't mind.<br/><br/>Don't pay to see this at the cinema - it isn't worth it.

I was quite bored with the first 1 and 15 mins. of the movie. There were some parts of the movie should of been more emphasized.

People really really think of what you saw and you people that haven't seen this movie yet you really don't have to rush out to see it wait till the hype of it all slows down better yet wait till the DVD in a couple of months and rent it for a lot cheaper then going to the movie theater.

Truly, this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen which is saying a lot. The pseudo cinema-verite style -- so effective in Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield -- only underscores the lack of any real plot or believable leads. The schoolteacher here behaves like a stereotypical schoolteacher, the day trader like a day trader, right to the end -- nothing normal or paranormal puts some flesh on their shallow characterizations. Even the supposed entity was a cipher -- no face, no form, no motivation. The ""action"" crawls and creaks along so slowly that you actually keep on forgiving it because it has to be building up to one enormous scare, or something.

Paranormal Activity is an hour and a half of two very uninteresting people laying in a bed on a handicam talking about ghosts.

I'm an easy scare, eyes covered, head buried in neighbors' shoulder if ever there is the slightest hint of approaching horror tension. I sat thru this movie arms folded in front of me, chuckled a few times, never once jumped or gasped. The first hour is extremely slow and boring. The guy character is dumb as a rock. The girl plays her roll better, but as someone else said above, couldn't they call in a priest, rabbi, maybe Another demonologist in southern California?! The progression of anticipated fear and terror is not as described in previous reviews. It's just not done well. It's just silly. And my boyfriend, 56, totally called the whole ending to me 15 minutes before it happened. It could be that 20-30somethings see this movie with different eyes, which is why I would like ages included with reviews.

I'm not sure what movie that test audience was watching, but it surely could not have been Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>I also had a hard time caring for the female character.

I'm paranormal obsessed and this was a total fluke. If you see it, leave after one hour because the ending will spoil any thoughts you may have had about it being real.

"kosmasp","3","6","10","21 November 2009"," Flavor of the week
","Or year, whatever suits you best. One thing is for sure though: This thing gets hyped as ""Blair Witch"" was hyped when that came out. While Blair Witch had a clever marketing campaign (or not, if you think people shouldn't have believed it to be a true story), this one grows by word of mouth.<br/><br/>While it really is original and stands out for that, that is no reason to give it high points just like that. Apart from the fact, that nothing much happens in this movie (which would be fine in general, but combined with weak characters/actors is a very dangerous unhealthy mix), it also fails to be gripping most of the times. While Japanese movies have walked that way since the 90s, it seems the western world just realises that the ""real"" world can be real scary.<br/><br/>Well it would be, because seeing situations that could happen in your home or maybe have even happened in similar fashion, might make you feel weird and uncomfortable. Having said that, it would have been great to have stronger performances and characters. Especially the male lead is not only annoying, but just plain stupid. It's common that people in horror movies behave strange and do things they shouldn't do. But this guy beats them all in just one movie. There is doing something stupid and then there is suicidal. Well this guy is suicidal.<br/><br/>Not only that, he's acting strong in one scene, just to break down in another (similar) one. There is no consistency to it at all. There was no actual sense of fear for me, because I just couldn't care less. The only time I was really scared, was when (almost at the end of the movie) something scary happened. And I wasn't scared because what happened on screen, but because a few girls were screaming right next to me! I almost had a heart attack because of those screamers! <br/><br/>Talking about the ending: There was an original ending (the movie actually was ready to go in 2007), but was deemed not scary enough! So they shot the ending that can be seen now in cinemas. If rumors are true than Mr. Spielberg himself suggested the filmmakers should re-shoot the ending.<br/><br/>I didn't even go into other flaws (story/script/editing), especially the latter, because it's a general problem with all those movies that are being shot ""for real"". Who does edit them? Romero found a nice solution to that, which is integrated into the Diary of the Dead and REC/Quarantine is too powerful for you to notice. With the slow moving pace of this, you will be reminded painfully every other second ..."
"Quinoa1984","8","19","42","16 October 2009"," what scares us all is what we can't see...
","Paranormal Activity arrives to us in the multiplexes already becoming a hit. And how easy it is: its budget was ten grand, looks like it was shot for ten percent of that, and made a profit in just the first night of its limited-run midnight screenings across the country. Now as a bonafide hit (if not yet the Blair Witch sized phenomenon, though it's on its way to be just that), it comes as something one may be a little curious about at first but not entirely sure. Does it live up to the gargantuan hype? That depends on what you've heard: some adore the movie, have been scared s***less by it, and others, frankly, laughed at the end. But what it is is an effective ghost story put to film, taking with it the same 'it's not there but is it' film-making approach that made the original Val Lewton Cat People so scary.<br/><br/>Seeing it in a packed audience has its ups and downs. The big up is that the audience, if properly primed or the right crowd (i.e. young people), will react to it like a ride in the guise of an minimalist exercise in suspense and tension. The big down is that... you're seeing a movie with a huge obnoxious crows that can't shut up or put away the cell phones. But those who want to be attentive to the movie do get rewards. Paranormal Activity provides its audience a ""this is happening"" style movie. It's not in the same this-is-how-we-found-the-footage editing of Blair Witch or Cloverfield. It's more like a collection of clips and scenes that do add up, where Micah and Katie are living in a house and are (to put it nicely) bothered by a demonic spirit of some kind.<br/><br/>Where it came from, why its hounded Katie for so long, why it hasn't taken her or done more damage over the years, are questions (if not entirely logical gaps) that will come to the viewer. One may even wonder, until its answered for us, why the couple just doesn't leave the house and get away from the spirit. What makes it work as a movie utmost is that it's a fresh take on familiar subject matter. We've seen stories of a possessed house, we've seen movies with possessed people, but not in a style that calls to mind Andy Warhol's film of a non-stop movie of a person sleeping on a bed for six hours straight. Paranormal Activity isn't as arty as that, but it does provide the same frame of reference: every night, it would seem, that the camera records in that same spot the tri-pod is on, things happen of a disturbing sort, from creaks in the night to lights turned on/off, to shadows, and finally slammed doors and bodies pulled out and bitten.<br/><br/>The acting, for this kind of docu-horror movie, is pretty good if not always great or totally believable, and the set-up of the characters early in the film makes them sympathetic, simple middle-class characters. The director puts the audience in their shoes- or more-so Micah's shoes as someone who looks at this whole ghost/demon event night by night half-jokingly- and then lets it rip for what we don't see to be far more terrifying than showing anything (albeit the final shot of the movie is a true stunner, oddly enough it being Spielberg-inspired since it's a call back to Jaws by the way the audience reacted). Filling in the blanks and things-in-the-dark-what-the-hell-was-that scenes make up some of the best moments in horror movies, and first time director Oren Peli milks this style for all its worth. At its best, it's on par (or better) than Blair Witch.<br/><br/>If nothing else, while not a perfect movie, I would hope that its chances at the box office top the upcoming fecal money-shot of Saw VI. I don't know how much either will make, but it would be nice if real horror and real scares won over torture porn with audiences again. A-"

"DonFishies","8","11","22","28 October 2009"," One of the most suspenseful and thrilling theatrical rides you will ever take
","I never saw The Blair Witch Project (I saw it's very rarely mentioned predecessor Cannibal Holocaust, which I try to forget), but I imagine the pandemonium and terror that filled theatres back in 1999 was nowhere near what anxiety and horror has been brought ten years later by Paranormal Activity. The faux documentary about a young couple Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherson)'s attempts at documenting nightly disturbances by a demon in their new home is every bit as frightening and scary as you have heard. It has taken me days to figure out what to write about this heavily demanded film, and I remain just as much on edge now as I was after seeing the film.<br/><br/>For just under ninety minutes, Paranormal Activity acts as the ride you really want to take but immediately regret hopping onto. Filmed for an incredibly small amount of money, this two-year-old indie horror flick falls into the same company as District 9 in how much it accomplishes for its genre with so little. It offers an excessive amount of pulse pounding scares, and two fantastic leads that we actually care about. We only learn a small amount about either character, but the performances by these two amateur actors is more than enough to make us feel their pain and dread as they try to figure out why the demon is tormenting them night after night. This is what true horror is, and now that it is has struck gold at the box office, I can only hope horror films in pre-production take note on what this film does right.<br/><br/>The reason the film works is right in its set-up. The film takes place entirely in and around the couple's house, and is all shot on a camcorder that Micah purchases at the very beginning of the film. Right away, director/writer/editor Oren Peli sets up the film to jump between the couple's interactions with each other and guests during the day and their sleeping during the night. The audience acts as voyeurs for the majority of the film, watching the two sleep while the unexpected takes place with little notice. It makes for a very uneasy picture, as the pair does not always wake up to scary things happening in their bedroom. They frequently only discover the same horror we have seen the next day as they examine the footage. The times they do wake up lead to some of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.<br/><br/>But the sequences are only terrifying because of how the audience reacts to them. I saw the film in a sold out theatre, and you could hear a pin drop during the night time scenes. Everyone was filled up with trepidation and breathlessly expecting the worst each time. And while the film is merely only freaky (and slightly boring) for the first half hour before kicking into high gear, the audience reacted the exact same way to each scene at night. The collective exhale as the day scenes began is something that simply must be marveled at. I do not think there has been a movie in recent memory that has impacted an audience so unified the same way Paranormal Activity does. It practically screams that it needs to be experienced with an audience in order to get the true effect of what Peli and crew envisioned when they made the film.<br/><br/>Another source of wonder is the special effects. While many of the effects are practical and are pulled off with ease, some of the later effects will simply horrify you into trying to figure out how they were possible on such a small budget. They are so simply and effectively done that they make Michael Bay's bloated effect-filled epics like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen pale in comparison. They are just so tastefully done and used so well that you have no choice but to try and figure out how they were pulled off with so little an amount of money. They look far too real to be fake.<br/><br/>While I really enjoyed the ride Paranormal Activity provides, I cannot help but be disappointed at the fact that the film will never provide the same experience more than once. It was clearly not made for repeat viewing, and it hurts the film as a whole in the end. The scares and effect of the film was not made to be seen in the same way as a Saw film or a Friday the 13th film would be. Sure, there may be some new things to discover that you did not see before, but the film is ruined ultimately by only being effective enough to scare once. I imagine a lot of people will think one viewing is enough, but for someone who watches movies more than once, it will no doubt sadden you. If I did see the film again, I imagine I would be watching simply to see the reactions of the audience, not feel as immersed into the film as I was during the first viewing.<br/><br/>The triumph of Paranormal Activity is in the fact that it was made for so little, but has the ability to terrify so many. It works on so many levels that its few faults are more than easily redeemed. The film is short enough to not overstay its welcome, and scary enough to make even the most hardened film-goer wince in fear. It's the most suspenseful trip to the movies I have ever taken. And if not anything else, it speaks to a young generation of future filmmakers the same way District 9 did. If you have an idea for a story, the equipment to pull it off, and a little bit of time and money to invest into it, then there is no stopping what you can create.<br/><br/>8/10."

I have just lost an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back. Add to that the 10 minutes or so it takes to write this review. Yes, it is that bad. <br/><br/>Who on earth, except for 5 year olds, can be scared by this pathetic excuse for a film? I hate horrors, for the simple reason that they fail to scare, but that's my beef. I loved horrors as a child, but then I grew up. They're not real and for that reason they never scare me. However, I can see why some may be scared by them or just enjoy them for thrills - although I think the point of horror is to scare. My daughter is terrified when she watches horror movies. She gets so completely wrapped up in them. For instance, Haunting in Connecticut scared the living daylights out of her. To me it was laughable, but I could see that it was well done and capable of inducing fear in people. However, my daughter and I have just sat and watched Paranormal Craptivity together, and she has just asked the questions: ""Seriously, is that it? Who hyped this film? Utter gash, absolutely dreadful"". It has to be really really bad for her to say that. It is completely unentertaining and remarkably dull. Perhaps the point, some may say, but it has to have something of interest if it can't be entertaining. There is nothing to hold your attention whatsoever. <br/><br/>I actually liked the way it really did feel as if it could have been filmed in your own home. It did feel like the people were just having normal conversations like you and I would have, so I think they got that part right, but that cannot excuse what is an utterly dreadful film. That's really the best I can say about it and it definitely doesn't justify having to sit through it. I'm truly glad that I never listen to movie hype, because 99 times out of 100 the hype always lives up to it name and is just that - hype, or perhaps just tripe."

","i don't believe in ghost's or demons or anything like that but when i watched this it really Creeped me out. i was actually scared which i never normally get. the only films that came close was The Ring, The Descent, Switchblade Romance and The Mist. this film really overpowered the scare factor over them films by a long shot. even if nothing is happening in the film it somehow makes you very tense due to the thoughts that something incredibly scary will happen. some of the scenes in this film are very disturbing. not in the violent way, in the mental way !!!! it will have you gripped to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>i like that the movie has been shot by a video camera. it adds depth to it and really played a key role in making the film much scarier than it would if the film was shot normally. if you've not seen this film already i'd advise you to watch the original theatrical version over the unrated version. both version are the same but the endings are different. don't get me wrong because both endings are good but the theatrical version is a lot more horrifying than the unrated cut that to be honest dumbs it down at the end. i am a little startled that this film is only rated 7.0 on here. this film really does deserve better. this film basically done what Blair Witch couldn't. i'd rate it as one of the best horror films ever made............ 10/10..............j.d Seaton"

The boredom that comes from this movie is the true suspense horror! About 95% of the movie is just them talking, 4% is a little tiny bit of weirdness (a door slamming, footsteps, a bang here and there... woopity!), and the last 1% of the movie makes you roll laughing because it's so stupid! I'm sorry, I definitely will never understand the hype on this one. I was told it was really good... *sigh*... it's about 2 hours of my life lost.....

This movie was made for mindless women and any guy that gets suckered into it. If I had paid any money for this crap, I would have had to kill someone. This was not even scary at all the previews lie and my pulse was normal throughout the entire movie. I think I came close to dying from boredom! I don't know why I didn't shut it off after the first 5 minutes I guess I watched it all the way through so I could legitly say it was the worst movie ever! I have never made a review on this site.

","If you are into the paranormal field and have done any research on the paranormal, then this movie will only make you kind of angry and leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. SPOILER- First of all this movie is not about paranormal activity, it is about demonic possession. Ya demonic possession is paranormal, but will never be described by anyone as just 'paranormal activity'. The guy in the movie handles the situation like an idiot and things that go on just do not match up the way they should. <br/><br/>Although I am a firm believer in ghostly and demonic events, I personally found this movie to be very uneventful and it lacked a lot of build up to the ending, which was just amateur compared to what I heard about this flick. I sat there for 2 hours getting this slow build up and I kept waiting for a little bit of real suspense and it never came. DO NOT mistake me for someone who needs a lot to keep them occupied, if a movie is scary and creepy, then I will give it credit. I thought that Blair Witch was slow, but the ending creeped me out and I actually was semi pleased. This movie just did not do it for me. SPOILER- When you find these big chicken like feet with talon marks on your floor and its like, night 18 of events, you do not just go back to sleep or keep living your life, you go get some help. Usually I let people in movies be idiots without criticizing the movie too much, but when it is a movie that is built on realism and things that people actually experience regarding hauntings, I tend to take off the gloves and I get a little peeved. I mean the dude finds a picture of his girlfriend in the attic all burnt up on the edges from her old burnt down house, and he quote is,""Something is not right here."" Really? Really?! DUHHHHHHH. SPOILER- the scariest part was when she would get up in the middle of the night and just stand by the bed. So ya...I will not be recommending this movie to any of the people I know."

","Where to begin, where to begin. My first question is since we voted Paranormal Activity into a wide release in theaters, is there a way that we can vote it out? I haven't felt this let down by a film in a very long time. We're talking let down by epic proportions. I was so completely disappointed, I almost wanted to stand outside the theater door and warn people going in to save their money, don't believe the hype, go trade your ticket in for Zombieland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but wait a week and go see Saw VI. It has too be more entertaining than this.<br/><br/>Before I go on, let me get the one good thing about this movie out of the way. It won't take long, believe me. The movie does serve as a warning to people to not mess with the supernatural and occult which, in my opinion, is a very good position to take on the subject. A lot of movies make it look fun to play around with the occult and such, but this is definitely not one of them.<br/><br/>Now, on to the rest of the film. I guess I'll just start from the top and move down the list. I may have to abridge some of this since if I actually went into what all is wrong with this movie, I would have to start another website. We begin with the filming technique. The shaky cam is something that was first used as a horror gimmick for film in The Blair Witch Project. This film wishes it was The Blair Witch Project. Never mind the comparisons - it truly WANTS to be that film. I'm over it. Done with the shaky cam crap. I'm tired of leaving the theater feeling like I want to go blow chunks on the director. It was cool the first time. But to keep making movies like this for me to watch is like asking me to keep riding that roller-coaster that I know is going to make me want to barf half-way through it.<br/><br/>I don't know why Oren Peli is being praised for this thing. All he did was walk around with a video camera and shoot stuff. There is nothing even remotely artistic about this. You set a camera up in the corner of a room. People get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff. Wow. Now that is art. The rest of it is shot like a home movie, just focusing on a room or a certain person.<br/><br/>What you get with this film is 20 minutes of footage that has some very quick scares and then 50 minutes of people talking about what's going on. Honestly, I would have felt better and been more entertained if they would have just released the 20 minutes of bed footage and been done with it.<br/><br/>Scariest movie ever or of the year? I think not. This entire film is made up of cheap thrills and loud bumps to make you jump. It's like that bad remake or rip-off of The Exorcist you accidentally rented off of Netflix last week. The only people who will be scared from watching this movie are moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with horror films and do not go see them regularly. I mean real regularly. There's no way if you've watched even two scary movies this year that this thing would get more than a cheap momentary jump out of you.<br/><br/>Paramount and everyone involved in this thing has done quite a number on the public. It makes me wonder if this wasn't planned from the very beginning. That it was somehow orchestrated from the get-go. All I can say, I got taken. If you don't feel like you've gotten taken when leaving the theater after seeing this, then they've truly done a number on you. I walked out not believing that renowned websites that I rely on for my movie news have actually been promoting this thing as truly scary and brilliant. Has everyone bought into a big lie? Not me. I do have to applaud Oren Peli, though. He has somehow taken an $11,000 heap of film project and used it to rise to the stature as of being the director of The Blair Witch Project of the 21st century. We saw how well that panned out for the original directors of that film."

","Paranormal Activity and its further installments are, without a doubt, despicable creations that shouldn't have existed or continued down the line. Unfortunately, that was and still is the case as the fifth sequel was released just last year. Paranormal Activity, alongside its predecessors, claim to be derived from true stories. Yet the directors seemed to have absentmindedly inform us that their films are loosely revolved around real paranormal accounts. I couldn't stomach the other one-third of this movie as it is rather bland and stale in taste. I couldn't relate to the characters and they weren't likable in the slightest. Character development was severely lacking as was the thin and recycled plot line. No scene convinced me that any of the proclaimed footage was actual evidence. I don't understand how people enjoyed this film or the sequels."

The movie was so lousy that I see no reason to watch the other two DVDs in the set. Maybe when I have absolutely nothing to do, I'll watch the other to ... if that day ever appears ... God, I hope not.<br/><br/>And the credits are still running. Two people in the movie, and a million people in the credits.<br/><br/>By the way, I do love a good ghost story, and I don't like gore!

","I really didn't care for the long drawn out random video surveillance footage in which there was no activity. Then when there was any activity it was so painfully obvious that it was fake and phony. Their acting was terrible too. It doesn't even seem like a real family so much as bad actors hamming it up. I actually never really watched any of them series until now and just really disappointed in this film. I think this movie might interest very young teens but even they see cheap tricks like this on every day television. Also a lot of their reactions to activity doesn't seem like anything real people would do. I can't give any spoilers but there is one scene where one of the girls ran up stairs instead of out of the house. In real life someone that scared in a house alone would naturally run outside. I also resent how the TV trailers all made these films seem like they were real to trick people into going to see these stupid films. I wouldn't call them stupid if they hadn't played up how great they were. I mean they are mildly entertaining but the hype is what has made this series so popular because these CGI gags aren't anything people don't see each and every day on TV or internet clips. I'm seriously surprised that this terrible movie has been turned into a series of movies. Anyway as someone who does believe in the Paranormal I feel that silly films like this make anything supernatural seem laughable. I'm very dismayed that the American movie industry the last decade has leaned heavily on CGI as a crutch and there is a serious lake of anybody that can actually act. All I can think of is the movie Idiocracy when the fake movie called ""@$$"" was the top film of the year. ha ha ha"

Modern suburban architecture. Talcum powder. Shaky camera movements, and Coma-inducing dialogue.<br/><br/>Allow me to preface this by saying that I love paranormal/scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, The Conjuring, etc. I had heard that Paranormal Activity was chilling, suspenseful, and filled with the kind of jumpy delights that only a good horror movie can offer. Well, I was egregiously misled. This movie is truly snooze-inducing, and by that I mean that I literally fell asleep. This movie is painfully slow, has no plot development whatsoever, and there is nothing even remotely scary within the entire film. The film's lack of scares could perhaps have been forgiven if the movie was actually entertaining, but it is NOT. This is by leaps and bounds the most boring movie I have ever seen - it is 90 minutes of watching two people sleep and bicker. Please do not waste your time watching this dud."

"caitaintdead","Null","3","4","13 October 2011"," Disappointment
","This will contain spoilers... Probably about how utterly AVERAGE this movie is.<br/><br/>I spent probably a good 3 or 4 years hearing about this movie from many people. People told me it was ""terrifying!"", they ""had to sleep with the light on!"", they ""keep thinking about it!"" I had hopes that it would be an indie, blue tinted combination of The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Both movies genuinely shocked and frightened me on the first viewing, and contained imagery and ideas that have stuck in my subconscious till this day. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film started slowly and I stuck with it. There were some interesting ideas that they could have worked with in this film. In particular, I thought that they could have addressed modern day consumerism through the male lead, Micah, who has just purchased a very large black (ooeer!) camera. His girlfriends first comment upon seeing it? ""What happened to the little hand held ones?"" Hehehe. More of that subtle humour would have carried this film a little further into the realm of unintentional giggles, and to be honest? I LIKE that in a movie.<br/><br/>Although I found the two leads believable enough in the roles I couldn't feel myself engaging with them enough to truly care about them and I really can't find anything much to say about them... At least let me dislike them! When a filmmaker chooses to do the 'found footage' schtick it becomes almost impossible to make the movies cinematography attractive, and this film suffers from it. Watching it only 4 years later it already feels a little bit dated, and just doesn't hold enough interest of the era to make this interesting.<br/><br/>All in all? A disappointment."

I don't believe in the paranormal, perhaps that is why this movie didn't scare me, or I've come to realize that door slamming ISN'T scary... Anyway, the plot to this movie is thin, and terrible. A couple moves into a new house, only to find that it is haunted. It is then revealed that the man's wife, Katie, has been followed by a demon all her life. It should be said that the man is an idiot. His first dumb decision is to stay with her. They try a plethora of bad plans to get rid of it, all his ideas, and record all of it. Also, why does he care more for the camera then the girl...? And why do I care enough to review this...? Finally, we come to the end, a horrible ending too, as now the girl is possessed and kills her husband. She moves towards the camera, he face looking like a Marilyn Manson fan, and attacks it. The end.<br/><br/>Wasted money is what this should have been called. The plot is stupid, the acting is terrible, and both characters are equally stupid. It's not even scary, it's just doors slamming, which if you live with a teen girl, you come to be familiar with. The movie moves slowly, with very little ""paranormal"" occurrences happening.

Maybe I just don't get scared that easily anymore like I did with ""The Exorcist"" and the original ""Halloween"" or the original ""Last House on the Left"". I don't know. But I do know one thing -- this movie, to me, was boring. Oh sure, the last several minutes were not, but on the whole I found it not to be scary at all. As a matter of fact, I found it boring. It was so boring that my husband nodded off and I had to wake him and tell him it was ""getting ready to be good"". After doing this three or four times, I just let him sleep because I didn't feel it was going to be getting any ""better"".<br/><br/>The girl in the movie, Katie Featherston, was a really good actress and we should all see more of her because she played this part with all her might and tried to be convincing. But even she could not save it. I've seen many movies where ""things go bump in the night,"" so the storyline was not new and, to me, the plot never really thickened until the last 60 seconds of the movie. Luckily I went to a matinée and only paid $8.50 for the ticket. I believe that if I had paid $12.00 for a ticket I would have demanded my money back.<br/><br/>If I were you, I would wait for a better movie to come along like ""Shutter Island"" which will soon be released."

","I have never posted about a movie before, but this stinker really prompted me to write. This has been such an over-rated flick. I respect the fact that they had a budget of $11K, but that is where the good ratings, in my view end. Guys, if you seriously held your girl's hand in fear while watching this bomb, please turn in your man card. The movie was slow, the camera movement becomes annoying quickly. This was almost as annoying as Blair Witch. Please, do not even put this snooze fest in same sentence as Exorcist. Not only did I not have a problem sleeping after this movie, it was this flick that HELPED me get to sleep. I looked over and my girlfriend was actually chuckling at some of the scenes. Seriously, this movie sucked, it was slow. That was 2 hours I will never get back"
"magkasakay","10","13","28","24 October 2009"," Get Ready To Get Scared
","I would like to start giving my comments about this film by saying ""WOW...IT REALLY SCARED ME !!"" & Believe me it did.<br/><br/>I have always been a fan of horror - mystery kind of a film since my childhood, well 'Paranormal Activity' has reached the top of the charts of my listing. I wouldn't want to be lame by putting in the names of my favorite horror - mystery movies out here, but would like to mention that it has certainty crossed the limits of what we have seen so far in other flicks.<br/><br/>It all begins with a couple in simple live in relationship, living in their routine life. The guy purchasing a camera to record the paranormal activities which are being happening to his girlfriend since her childhood. As the days go by the guy starts picking up some of the paranormal activities with his gadgets i.e. the EVP detector and the camera. So it turns out to be a success when he collects the paranormal activities on his gadgets. Throughout the film, the guy always intents to capture all the possible things with his hand held camera.<br/><br/>Although in the beginning of the movie you might find these characters to be Noobs & show that they might lose it in the acting department but they prove wrong. The actors Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat, have performed so very well that it always looks real to you portraying the exact events happening with them all the way through. The events are shot in such a way that we always feel as if they are happening exactly in front of you as if they are being shot with a homemade video. Thanks to the way the movie is shot with the hand held camera.<br/><br/>There will always be difference in the way you think about the movie depending upon your age & gender. For all those who are fans of the famous ""Ghost Hunters"" series, this is just like finding the evidence about the paranormal activity but with a difference. This is exactly what the people face before contacting the professionals. I have read a comment somewhere stating that Ghost Hunters is better than, well let me tell you that this is different than that. Though the tricks used by Micah in order to find the ghost always prompts you to the techniques used by the Ghost Hunters guys in their cases, they are the basic things which anyone will do.<br/><br/>The character of Micah is so dominant that he always wants to take control on the activities all by himself. Doesn't want to take any help from anyone else, wants to prove he can deal with the situation by doing his own research.<br/><br/>The suspense of the movie always keeps you grab you seat all the time. The slow & steady progress of the activities makes you think what next? what next? When I saw the movie the first time, I first thought the entity must be jealous of Micah, but it turns out to be wrong. The progress of the movie simply blows your mind & shows you what you have never seen before.<br/><br/>I have heard & read the comments of other people who have become suspicious & more cautious before they sleep at night after watching this flick. Many are not able to sleep well at night feeling as if they are haunted.<br/><br/>For all those people who are scared of everything & having a weak heart, Please do not watch this one.... you might lose your life.<br/><br/>In the end ... for all those who want to get scared....go watch it & get scared. Enjoy the greatest ""Paranormal Activity"""

","If you're really excited to find out who was kicked off the bus, out of the house, or off the island on whatever Reality TV show you're into, then you'll love Paranormal Activity. You'll also love it if The Blair Witch Project was too complicated to wrap your head around.<br/><br/>I can see spending, maybe, five minutes on an idea this one-dimensional if someone e-mailed me a link to it from YouTube. Unfortunately, I sat through the whole thing hoping that it would show some depth at some point, or at least that my friends were enjoying it more than I was.<br/><br/>It's a fallacy that a no-budget film can't be based on a decent screenplay. Kevin Smith and Robert Rodriguez both directed no-budget films that make Paranormal Activity look like a 90-minute flipbook. The people who spent years working on and pushing this movie could have made it a horror film to be reckoned with if they'd simply asked for help on the screenplay.<br/><br/>If you know someone who puts a lot of thought into the existence of ghosts and demons, then point them toward Paranormal Activity. No, strike that. If you want a funny, scary film with depth of character and plot, track down Lars von Trier's The Kingdom. It's a miniseries that's almost five hours long, but it's an adventurous five hours that even your friend who's into ghosts will enjoy!"

","The title of my review is open to your interpretation. I am a fan of small films, so I went in with an open mind and high hopes. Maybe that was the problem, I bought into the hype, or wanted another Blair Witch. Now that I have taken the time to really look at the trailer for the film I should have known. It is rated R for language; not for disturbing images, mature thematic material, intense sequences of violence. Now I like a good scare and the original ""The Haunting"" or ""When A Stranger Calls"" proves you don't need blood and guts to scare. But I was left wanting, from what I have read the first ending shown at festivals might have made the movie for me, just my 2 cents."

DO NOT RENT THIS FILM. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. if you do you will be sadly disappointed. i think i would rather chop off my own testicles than watch this mockery again. it is absolutely unbearable in every which way. all they do is turn off the lights with night vision on the camcorder and have someone hide in the bathroom or other rooms and make retarded noises that sound ridiculous and shut a couple doors. that basically sums up everything about this abomination"

","Silly. Just silly.<br/><br/>Most of the film was just BORING. We were literally yawning while waiting for something to happen, and when something DID happen, the ""paranormal activity"" was silly, like the pranks my brothers played on me when we were kids. Perhaps the film would have been more interesting had the two actors been the least bit captivating, but alas, my husband and I found ourselves rooting for the ghost.<br/><br/>For those who question how we watched the film, we rented the DVD and were home, alone, watching it in darkness but for the light from the fireplace. We even watched it with our cinematic surround sound, which DID actually enhance the experience as the deep vibrations signifying the ""presence"" were felt in our living room, but that was the extent of the film's effectiveness.<br/><br/>We couldn't wait for the movie to end, and if I could get my $1.08 back from RedBox, I'd use it to rent something more entertaining than 86 minutes of what seemed like some stranger's failed attempt at making a ""scary"" home movie."
"chatnoirC","2","7","13","13 December 2009"," ...from a die hard fan of the genre - this simply wasn't a good movie
","Okay, first it gets a 2 because it wasn't awful... but it sure wasn't good! Our characters weren't set up enough for us to really care too much what was going to happen, and due to sub-par acting I wasn't convinced of anything happening. Conversations held in down time (as posted by another viewer) were particularly dull. When the ""scary stuff"" was happening my attention was drawn more to a timer on the screen than to the actual events taking place. Oh, and I mustn't forget the same old sounds starting each time our demon was about to do something - what drudgery. The handycam, 1st person shot footage was a mistake here - really, filmmakers - please don't do this if there isn't any real point to it! Splice your footage between it and what will be a more professional, watchable & effective production! So, so much could have been done with this great idea... but frankly I was glad when it was over. The genre remains my favourite, and my reason stands to be disproved. It is a very difficult genre to succeed in - thanks to Paranormal Activity for proving that point."
"OrdinaryDay","2","7","13","7 December 2009"," Not nearly as scary or clever as it thinks it is!
","It would be wrong to say that Paranormal Activity is a failure on every conceivable level. If you watch it with really low expectations and for a quick, cheap laugh, you might end up feeling that you got your money's worth.<br/><br/>But if you go and see this movie thinking that it will live up to the hype of being the ""Scariest movie ever made"" you will end up being severely disappointed! When all is said and done, this movie relies on cheap, obvious scare tactics that horror viewers have seen 100 times before! Creaking doors, eerie sounds and an unconvincing Ouija Board scene all try to trick the viewer into thinking that they are seeing something original! If you try not to let the awful performances and clichéd ending bother you too much, the film actually works intermittently, but not as a horror movie, but rather a comedy! Many of the scenes are unintentionally hilarious as they are so poorly scripted and acted, that it feels like you are watching a sketch comedy, rather than a scripted movie! The scene with the footsteps leading into the bedroom is the funniest scene in the movie, and seeing Micah and Katie overact to the extreme in response to it is the highlight of this movie! If you are in the mood for a poorly written comedy movie, then Paranormal Activity may be just the movie for you. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere."
"MartinPh","3","7","13","8 November 2009"," Amazingly overrated
","I've heard people say you won't sleep after seeing this movie. I almost fell asleep watching it. Though PA is often compared to the Blair Witch Project, and though superficially it may seem to share a few of that earlier movie's strengths, in fact it makes the one mistake that BWP so carefully avoided: of showing too much. BWP doesn't show you a single thing that is obviously supernatural; but PA goes all out on fleeting shadows, self-incinerating ouija boards, swinging lamps, billowing sheets, windy living rooms and demon-victims being dragged across the hallway.<br/><br/>This is all so terribly over the top that instead of being scary I found it quite ludicrous. Of course the haunted couple never does the obvious things, like switching on the light, closing the bedroom door, or changing sides in the bed (the girl is the one targeted by the 'demon' yet sleeps next to the open door.) I'll grant that the actors aren't doing a bad job, but a lot more is needed to make the antics of this particular demon even remotely believable. Especially as some inconsistencies are pretty glaring. e.g., the paranormal expert Dr. Fredrichs makes it clear he can't do anything for the couple, yet the demon is very angry at his being in the house. Why? The fact that at least three different endings were filmed doesn't say much for the integrity of the entire concept either. It feels pretty much random; a lot of things could have been added or left out without it making much difference. From what I read the original ending is probably more in keeping with the concept of the film than the one now shown in cinema's, that has a demon that's a bit too keen to play for the camera and provide a good, old-fashioned shocker.<br/><br/>Great hype. Big yawn."

Ohmygod, a swinging chandelier??? Okay, so where's the monkey that set it in motion? Gee, must have been somebody with a long stick. The two lead actors do have good abilities but they're wasted in a non-story that really needed ramping up on the action and suspense. I don't care if the movie only cost fifteen grand to make, when I pay my money and sacrifice my time I want some degree of emotional involvement and this just didn't cut it. Major, major question: who on earth sleeps with their bedroom door open every night??? Nobody but these dopes. Doors creak (hinges need oiling), door slams (somebody yanked the dental floss), lights go on (who's out of sight flicking the switch?). Bits and pieces of so many other horror movies, snippets of conversation referring to the supernatural, the devil ad infinitum. Kudos to the studio execs who ran with this movie and put one over on the American movie-going public. Yes, a sucker is born every minute and this movie is proof of that.

"JaysonT","3","7","13","30 October 2009"," The Most Over-Hyped Movie of the Year!
","Oh how I so wanted to be scared of this film. And truly appreciate its ""artistry"". But sadly, I am mundane and skeptical. Here is a film made for less than $15,000 that is now on its way to grossing over $100 million domestically. It is pretty much ""The Blair Witch Project"" ten years later. While that film captured true horror by never showing us anything remotely 'horrific', it was the idea of the horror that led us to find the movie chilling and heroic.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"", which by the way should read 2009, not 2007, under IMDb, is a loathsomely tedious experience. It builds nicely- I admit I was nervous in the first thirty minute cycle. We meet the couple. He is a salicylic investment banker, she's his clingy girlfriend. They move into a nice house that has a pool that's apparently larger then their turf. But we know from the start why this is shot on a handy-cam. He has been videotaping their life because of the ""activity"" that has been going on. Weird noises at night. Bumps from downstairs. And worse of all- unexplainable happenings like fires starting, footsteps appearing, and actual levitation miraculously occurring.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes this synopsis so frightening are two things. One, the couple appear to be real. Its like watching your friends on home video. Two, no music soundtrack. So you basically have to endure long periods of silence while their sleeping, ultimately wondering what will happen next. That part's scary. What's not scary is what actually happens. (Do not read further if you don't wish to be informed).<br/><br/>Without giving away too much, let's just say the happenings become more hokey, and if you're not religious you'll really laugh a quite a bit of what happens (there's a scene where the woman is dragged out of bed by the ""demon"" and flung to the floor, where the door slams behind her.) Many screamed in the audience. I was trying my best not to laugh too hard.<br/><br/>The conclusion of this over-hyped fiasco is what really makes me cringe. Without giving too much away, let's just say too much is revealed in too scarce amount of time for us to care, or sympathize, or even understand. If you've seen ""The Ring"", you'll get a general idea of where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" has been dubbed by some as the most frightening movie ever made. Hardly. It's not even the scariest film of the year. It's clever at best, but not scary or frightening except maybe when you dread what will happen. The critics who knight it the best ever have either only watched movies that have come out in the past decade, or simply have not seen ""The Shining"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Psycho"" or ""The Exorcist""- let alone ""Rosemary's Baby""- which is still the best horror film to contrive the idea of demonic happenings without revealing it. Save your money on this dud and rent it on Netflix. You're sure to conjure up more ""paranormal"" activity in your own work life then what is presented here."

This movie is basically one and a half hours fighting the feeling of falling asleep. There is just nothing that happens on screen.

"mfisher452","5","6","11","24 October 2010"," Movie, shmovie, it still looks like a home video
","It's a perfectly ordinary suburban house, and when Micah and Katie move in they seem to be a perfectly ordinary young unmarried couple. However, their nights are disturbed by things that go bump. There is an unseen presence in the house that seems increasingly malevolent. Then we learn it's not the house that is haunted, it's Katie. Apparently she has been stalked by this presence for about ten years, ever since she was fourteen. Or is it just the imagination of a disturbed young woman? Micah, brash and reckless, decides to investigate matters by making a movie of it (it's called ""Paranormal Activity""), Either he or Katie is behind the camera, filming almost everything. There is a stationary camera in the bedroom that keeps them under video surveillance while they sleep. For all his puffed-up bravado, Micah is actually thoughtless and self-centered: He is less in love with Katie than he is with having a live-in girlfriend, and as Katie becomes increasingly frightened, Micah withdraws from her emotionally, becoming increasingly determined to finish his film. What to Katie is the threat of demonic possession becomes to Micah a project. The bedroom camera records bizarre, inexplicable phenomena while they sleep, which are all the more chilling because they occur in silence and stillness. The inevitable climax nevertheless unfolds suddenly and unexpectedly.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" was ""filmed"" with a digital video camera held by the actors themselves, or fixed on a tripod for some scenes. It's meant to look like a home video much of the time, and it does, although the special effects, though minimal, are really quite effective and scary. Unfortunately, the filmmakers make the mistake of assuming that because it COULD be made that way cheaply and quickly, it SHOULD have been made that way. Forty or fifty years ago, ""Paranormal Activity"" would have been an innovative experiment in cinéma vérité. But in the age of YouTube and ""America's Funniest Home Videos,"" with television sinking ever lower into the fetid ooze of banality under the weight of relentlessly proliferating reality shows, and with billions if not trillions of hours of home videos filling closets all over the world, a film made this way is just niggling. A number of scenes are also spoiled by the intermittently totally illogical behavior of the characters. However, one objection by other reviewers is unjustified: Why didn't the couple just up and leave when spooky things started to happen? Because, Katie explains to Micah, there's no point in leaving the house because the entity that is threatening her will just follow her wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Like a lot of reality shows that pad 10 minutes out to half an hour, and like a lot of home videos, the film is slow and draggy a lot of the time. I've just watched ""The 4-D Man,"" a moldy oldie sci-fi movie from about 1960, and I noticed that the pace of the film was much slower than films made today. ""Paranormal Activity"" runs, or crawls, at the same slow pace. The filmmakers could improve it considerably if they hacked about 20 minutes out of it."

"ryveatch","1","6","11","10 January 2010"," Mostly a waste of a movie
","I've begun to question the pathetically weak perceptions of people being ""terrified"" of this ""brilliant"" movie. The reason this even got so much attention, was because of an experimental marketing technique of making people in each state 'vote' to have the movie viewable in their state. Those who believe in the ""horror"" of this movie lower my faith on humanity.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I was talked into watching the movie by a friend as compliance with it being her birthday. I had never heard anything about it beforehand, either. The only thing that made the movie worthwhile, is the comedic quality of the audience. Other than the laughs they gave me, this movie was a waste of a part of my life I would much rather have spent doing other things.<br/><br/>Spoiler warning (if there is one). The movie was completely pathetic with all of its ""scary"" moments. ""OMG!!! MY KEYS ARE ON THE FLOOR AND NOT THE COUNTER!"" ""OMG!!! THE DOOR SWUNG MENACINGLY!"" ""OMG!!! BABY POWDER FOOTPRINTS!"". The movie had two good scenes: When Katie gets dragged out of bed (which is anti-dramatized by the demon doing nearly the whole thing in slow motion) and when Katie throws Mica's body at the camera at the end. By including those two scenes and a little bit of other material, you could create a 10-15 minute video that has the same effect and would actually be better, because people wouldn't get so ticked off about the movie wasting their life, the pathetic quality of the movie's horror, and the feeling of hopelessness that builds up in us as we are brought aware of all the antsy 10-year-olds who were scared by the movie."

"PrimitiveScrewhead","1","6","11","3 January 2010"," The funniest film since The Wicker Man remake!
","I am sitting here, gorging my own retinas out as my mind sits in total dismay and hilarious bewilderment. This glorified home-movie contains the supernatural ability to challenge the master that is Uwe Boll. I am of course, talking about the shaky, the dark, the grainy, the amateur, the one and only, Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is 'apparently' a horror movie; I'm not sure where the horror is located. Perhaps it's the comedic, 'Airplane (1980)' performances or the 'camera on a leash' duties that intended to terrifying the poor, unsettled victims out of their uncomfortable cinema seats.<br/><br/>The film attempts to recreate the classic television series, Most Haunted, by offering the viewer a smattering of obscured camera angles, lack of a tripod and lots of big-lipped and enlarged eyed expressions, all tinted with the trusty gamma-ray night-vision exposure that even the Incredible Hulk would cringe at. Unlike the wonderful and beautiful Most Haunted, Paranormal Activity attempts to harbour a plot that can be summed up as follows: Man buys a new video camera. Man and Girl investigate haunted house. Man follows girl around with camera. Lots of giggles and other mindless traits before we get to the real action - a bed. Yes, for about an hour, we are treated to more sleeping than a regular episode of Big Brother would show. It's as if the actors became bored of the unimaginative screenplay (was there even a screenplay?) and just conveniently fell asleep, to which the director shouted action and captured his cocooned actors in their hibernating periods...and occasionally opening a door or making loud noises to wake them up.<br/><br/>Before I drain my senses anymore, basically, the girl becomes possessed by this unexplained entity, kills her boyfriend by throwing him into the camera and then crawling up to the screen in her best 'Ring' impersonation. That's it. Not a lot happens. Fade to black. The end. They have our money. They have those 90 minutes that we can never claim back. I'm sure lots of pretentious 'arty' people will salvage this thin layer of botched film-making and attempt to rise up in its defence against my negative review, but Paranormal Activity represents almost everything wrong with cinema and film-hype (and Transformers 2, but that's another story, a story more terrifying than this).<br/><br/>This slew of picking up a camera and copying Cannibal Holocaust but forgetting the exploitation and hilarious nature of that 70's classic just shows how misunderstood film is, and how audiences haven't woken up to the realisation or even questioning what is delivered to them anymore. True, not every film needs to be intelligent or seminal (Commando, 1985, is a magnificent classic) but for the love of cinema, start waking up a little more. Paranormal Activity (or Paranormal INactivity) is a botched attempt at realism and even thought its cutting and pasting elements from every other known ghost film, instead of re-inventing those ideas, they are executed terribly from a director whose brain cell can't operate on a subtle and inventive level, instead gluing together creepy-crawly nasties as seen in other films. If the film-makers bothered to read a BOOK, then the film may have stood a chance at being a little more intelligent.<br/><br/>As it is, Paranormal INactivity is a poor student film, that is misguided, no sense of direction, no sense of format, no sense of style, it just has no sense. But as a comedy, oh crikey, it's a laugh riot. I'm laughing so hard, I've forgotten about those precious 90 minutes it took away from me. HAHAHAHA. Actually, no I haven't. I wish I could have claimed that golden timeframe back. I could've been doing something so much more constructive, like, watching a better movie....<br/><br/>0/10"

","...or, to be more accurate, how a very cheap and silly film was repackaged and pumped-up to fool an audience and make an absolute fortune.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" is truly about as scary and believable as an episode of ""Scooby Doo."" Nothing more than a brutally cynical, major-league exercise in hype, marketing and ultimately a result of mass-audience gullibility for such things. Along with the plebian tendency to concur about the Emperor's New Clothes being everything they were led to believe.<br/><br/>Whatever people see in this ""film"" of any emotional or creative worth, I'm afraid I don't, and I'm going to stand up, point and shout: ""But the Emperor hasn't got any clothes on!"" Let's face it - old hat, badly done. Liked the string pulling the door closed though. Was that included as an in-joke do you think?

"3xHCCH","2","6","11","23 November 2009"," Ruined by the Hype
","This is the typical example of a movie wherein too much hype actually ruins the watcher's movie experience. So much fuss had been raised about the excellent word of mouth, and how it propelled this movie to top the US movie charts during the Halloween season. Some reviews even called it the best horror movie out there. Of course, with all these in mind, we go in with very high expectations, hoping to be scared out our seats.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the hype given this movie. There was no real horror in this very roughly-made film. The concept was like ""The Blair Witch Project."" Boyfriend Micah uses a hand-held camera to track the ghost that is haunting his live-in girlfriend Katie as they sleep. Good thing was it wasn't as dizzying than ""Blair Witch"" (a movie that I could not keep my eyes on in its last half hour to vertigo from trying to watch it). But bad thing is, like ""Blair Witch,"" it was much ado about nothing at all.<br/><br/>All those daytime scenes only show the couple discussing or arguing about what happened the night before. In short, definitely fast-forward-able. In those night scenes, you literally watch the clock tick while waiting something scary to happen. These may give an uneasy feeling but not all those waiting times were so rewarded with something substantial. Several events (some actually quite interesting) do not really lead to anything.<br/><br/>I think this movie would be best watched alone, in the house, in the dark, unhurried (the best conditions). Only then can this movie effectively deliver its goods. It is all about proper atmosphere and attitude while watching which will make this movie work."

","Everything bad or good as already been said about this so-called movie (video fraud in fact).<br/><br/>I first wanted to give it 1 star because it really should deserve such a rating as this is not a real scary movie but the most important fraud that ever occurred in films history.<br/><br/>The plot could have been quite frightening, but though both of the main actors are nice (they're at least good looking, this helps a lot staying in the theater...), their characters aren't convincing because they're just overwhelmed idiots who go on living their without-any-activity-life instead of taking real actions to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Your GF stands for 3 hours next to you while you're sleeping and you just don't do anything at all about this. No wonder she kills you in the end ^^ you're so dumb that you just deserve this ending ^^<br/><br/>Though there's a ""but"" to all this... because this video-made-into-a-movie gives you the creeps anyway, when you realize it made it to the top of the box-office only by playing on your naivety and your hopes of being well entertained. THIS is the scariest part of this story.<br/><br/>What is really scary, and Indeed now i can't sleep at night, is because i can't help asking myself : how could I be so easily cheated ? Well, maybe because it makes me realize that in some parts of my own life, i just act like Kat & Mika and don't take actions......<br/><br/>For example (and this is the only example i accept to reveal here ^^)... i waited until the end of the movie instead of collecting my wits, stand up and get out back to sunshine to solve the problem I was confronted to... which was mere boredom... except when she appears on the doorstep and I wasn't expecting her to be there... This surprised me but this didn't scare me ;-)<br/><br/>So this is what's deeply frightening!... OK I got caught by marketing and hype... but i also was confronted to my sometimes own personal inactivity... Now I'm scared to death... ;-)<br/><br/>And... because there's an ""and""... while writing this review, my bedroom door suddenly slammed...... ^^ <br/><br/>Maybe I should check what's in my attic... huh, i mean... brain... ;-) <br/><br/>My demons are still haunting me and by not seeing a shrink I let them settle themselves into my life... Now i know what to do... The exact contrary of What Mika & Kat did... ;-) Lol ^^ <br/><br/>OK, then let's give it 2 stars, because it's involuntarily (?) a sort of f**k-your-brain-paranormal-psychotherapy ;-p <br/><br/>Just kidding about the 2 stars ;-) No way this movie should deserve 2 stars (am I in denial here of my own problems ? Which are hiding up this ladder in the closet ^^ arghhh ^^), let's give it what it deserves : only 1, as I'm rating the artistic value of it. And let's all go back to our lives now ;-) <br/><br/>And, no way shall I check what's in my brain... huh, i mean... attic... ;-) <br/><br/>Please, don't waste your time and go enjoy Saw 6 or The Box real-life-questions instead ^^ ;-) <br/><br/>Damn, my review is becoming completely paranormal...... ^^<br/><br/>I need some fresh air and I need to leave this house right away...

","Basically this film is the Blair Witch Project in a house. This means that it is a shaky cam movie. A man buys a video camera to document the paranormal activity that his girlfriend has been experiencing. Most of the film is shot from the boyfriend's point of view, but the night scenes are shot from a tripod. There is a bunch of boring dialog during the day scenes and when they go to bed at night a couple of seconds of noise or a slightly creepy light turning on. You sit there enduring the film until the last 3 minutes which I would genuinely consider worthy of a horror movie. My suggestion, wait until it comes out on DVD, rent it from the Redbox, skip the first hour and enjoy the last few minutes."

I get it, he's a good boyfriend. Him making fun of the situation was the only thing keeping the movie going. I will admit that the acting was good - they were pretty believable.<br/><br/>However, although the concept has potential, it is not novel and they did nothing to make it any more interesting. I kept expecting the movie to take a turn and become more intense, but it never did. I'm curious about how much of that movie was just them sleeping in bed.<br/><br/>I'm just really disappointed. If anyone is freaked out by paranormal behavior, it's me... but this movie was slow and didn't play on my fears enough. I feel like it's a huge scam. The whole ""demand this movie in your area"" thing, and some of these comments, it seems like someone was paid to write positive things about this movie. I saw this tonight and the movie theater was packed - and more people were making fun of the ""scary"" moments than actually being scared by them... but those moments were so few and far between that it's kind of hard to say. <br/><br/>I'm upset that I paid $10.50 to see that movie when I imagine it cost them practically NOTHING to make.

"alecwest","1","15","36","22 October 2009"," Huh???
","I'm almost suspicious that the film company hired professional ""screamers"" to visit local showings of this film and scream at least three or four times at random moments. Because when I heard screams in the theater when I watched this film, I quite honestly didn't see or hear anything worth screaming about. The screams were all coming from the same people, too. Perhaps they're part-time theater employees (grin).<br/><br/>Sadly, this isn't even a new movie. It was first shown at the ScreamFest 2007 horror festival - where they probably ALSO had paid (or volunteer) screamers planted in the audience. I suspect that Paramount was short on horror films this year (2009) and canvassed the ""indy"" scene for likely films they could buy up on-the-cheap. Then, they over-hyped the film in such a way as to attract people most likely to see a horror film. Mea culpa. I fell for the hype, too, just like everyone else.<br/><br/>In any case, this movie left me flat - and $7 poorer, not counting the popcorn."

I can see how the concept of the film could be quite scary, because most of the time you watch a horror film your not truly scared until the dreaded 'bed time' occurs. The lights go straight on and you're too scared to blink just in case something happens! And as this film is based around the bedroom i can see the scare factor... BUT it was boring!Nothing really happened in the film apart from the occasional thump in the night, which just repeated itself several times until the end. <br/><br/>It started off really slow, and continued to stay slow. The only reason i stayed in the cinema was because i thought it was going to pick up into a terrifying nightmare that would actually make me at least jump a little bit! I was wrong.. BIG TIME <br/><br/>If you want to go and see a half decent 'documentary style' film then watch the Blair witch project or rec.

Trailer featuring some potentially interesting premise.<br/><br/>3. Trailer also featuring a covert cam that recorded the reactions of a cinema audience.<br/><br/>4. A curious number of IMDb ""Comments"" that praised the film, and actually used the exact same soundbites as the ads! I mean, I must have been really really stupid to have expected a frightening film after all that. I was suckered in, and I am hoping that this review of the movie might in some way prevent someone else from falling for the same mistake that I made.<br/><br/>If you're into the whole 'reality/shaky-cam' Blair Witch type of film, you might enjoy this, despite the fact that ever since the Blair Witch Project, you've had several copycat movies that rely on shoestring budgets and internet hype to propel them into the mainstream.<br/><br/>Personally, I generally don't enjoy the shaky-cam genre. I give props to Blair Witch for the originality, & the viral method of extending the film onto the internet. Cloverfield was more satisfying movie, and the puzzles & cool hype building the movie up was well-thought. Paranormal Activity on the other hand is nothing more than a load of empty words, and an aggressive ad campaign. Honestly! It is exactly what I felt when I read some of the reviews here, and wondered if I had watched the same film.<br/><br/>My main problems were these. <br/><br/>The couple in the movie were very bland &unlikeable. There was absolutely nothing of interest about them. It's one thing to want to make a horror movie as real as possible, but at the very least, put some characters with a bit of charisma.<br/><br/>The couple act stupidly. - At what point did the male have his common sense gland removed, and decide to stay with this drab woman who seems to be the centre of this haunting, instead of just dumping her and finding someone without any demonic issues? Why do they act either like loons, or completely blase about the phenomena? <br/><br/>The demonic source - One of the things that drove me crazy about the whole Blair Witch thing was that people were saying how scary it was because you NEVER GOT TO SEE THE WITCH. - Ermmm...I must be missing something here, because I was under the impression that a horror film needs a good solid protagonist. Ultimately, I felt that this film just didn't have one.<br/><br/>The usual jump scares. - If you've never watched a horror film, you'll definitely jump. If you've watched a few horror movies, you'll see them a mile off.<br/><br/>The ending - I won't spoil it here, but the 'twist' is really poor. It borrows heavily from another movie I may have mentioned a few times in this review *ahem*, and it doesn't even do that very well at all. There's no psychological head-game, or campfire-tail twist. Just a bit of screaming, a predictable (and terribly handled) denouement that most movie buffs would guess anyway, then a blank screen & the mercy that it was all over.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would like to say something redeemable about this film, but I wouldn't even bother to watch it again if it was on TV and I had nothing better to do, let alone pay good money for tickets.<br/><br/>Please please PLEASE do not fall into the hype & soundbite/slogan-riddled ad campaign.

"fjura-1","2","7","14","11 November 2009"," worst ""horror"" of the 2009
","Hi, this is my first comment here and it will be really short. I just saw this movie yesterday and thought that i should write something here so at least some people wont kill 1.3 hours of their life like i did when i watched this. This movie was bad, no question about it. If you really want to see a good horror featuring ghost or demon stories, i strongly suggest you will watch better horrors like The Mirrors, Drag me to hell or good old The Exorcist. First of all...there isn't one single scary moment. In like 70% of the movie nothing is really happening, then they try to add some quick ""possesion"" story that didn't fit there one bit. I suggest you just watch the trailer and...yea..thats it. Although f i would have to say at least one good thing about this movie then lets say that the acting wasn't that bad. All in all....not worth watching."
"Jonny_Numb","7","7","14","10 November 2009"," The Horrors of Banality
","It seems no mere coincidence that a sleeper so far below the radar it took two years to find big-time distribution and commercial success has come on the 10-year anniversary of the innovative (though somewhat thin) found-footage footsteps of ""The Blair Witch Project."" Also familiar is the carefully calculated hype machine (which began as grassroots chatter that slowly garnered major interest) used to land the film in as many theatres as possible, with the beaming, always-hyperbolic blurbs of impressed bloggers lighting the way.<br/><br/>When it wants to be (and it often is), ""Paranormal Activity"" is an effectively extemporaneous haunted-house freakout. Like ""Blair Witch,"" it takes a simple premise (young couple encountering a restless, unseen presence in their home), and builds around it a claustrophobic vortex of suspense, where our (not always) sympathy-garnering protagonists become mankind's last stand against forces far beyond its control.<br/><br/>In an interesting narrative choice, the film begins with Katie and Micah (she's the reserved student; he's the cocky day-trader) already complicit with the strange happenings in their new house, to the point where Micah is actively recording the proceedings in hopes of catching an ectoplasmic curveball. Their banter possesses a slice-of-life realism that helps ground us in the banality of suburban America, complemented by the house's own lack of production-designed, artsy flourish. The consumer-grade camera work, while already a well-established avant-garde cliché, is fittingly abrasive and starkly honest.<br/><br/>With his shoestring budget and limited resources, writer-director Oren Peli has created a film that (yes, like ""Blair Witch"") requires the viewer to drop all expectations of a slick, glossy gorefest and embrace the lost art of the subtle, slow-burn scare. This is more of an Unease Film than a Horror Film. And while the sense of psychic disturbance in the air is indeed palpable, ""Paranormal Activity"" plays like an intriguing short subject stretched beyond its capacity; by the time the disappointing, jump-scare conclusion rolls around, it feels like an out-of-place shock in a film that doesn't quite know how to combine its parts into a satisfying whole (Katie's haunted past, for instance, is left dangling). And once the screen went black, I was just wishing Peli had pushed the supernatural elements even further. In the end, ""Paranormal Activity"" is a risible (yet not superior, especially in the wake of ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Quarantine"") contender bringing up the tail end of a cinematic fad.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"
"moselekm","9","7","14","28 October 2009"," Finally, a movie done right
","Everyone kept talking about this movie for the past months. About how some people have already seen it on it's original release date or how they are going to go see it. And the talk about it was just constant. I am not a fan of scary movies, because I am easily scared (or at least I think I am). So I held off on this movie for some time. Not to mention whenever I asked what sorta movie it was they always compared it to the Blair Witch, which I thought only had one good part (the ending scene).<br/><br/>I finally saw it though (with the alternate ending, I have no clue what the real ending is. I saw the Spielberg suggested ending). This movie was amazing. They did pretty much everything right. The scenes were perfect for escalation, the length of the movie was just right. The way it was shot was very well done and everything seemed to have it's purpose.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about this movie is it pretty much proved to me that my scary movie theory is correct. And that is that scary moments in films make it all that less believable because it's trying to hard. But creepiness and suspense is really what gets at me and has a much lasting effect. This movie has NO SCARY PARTS. It's all just very very disturbing and creepy.<br/><br/>As you watch the movie you'll be wondering, ""WTF, how did they shoot that?!"" And as the nights continue in the movie, it just gets more and more disturbing. This movie is probably the best 'scary' movie I have seen in a long long time. You must go see this movie!"
"KineticSeoul","3","5","9","24 October 2011"," Yeah it was made with basically a shoestring budget but that still doesn't make a great horror movie
","My friend really liked this movie but I just can't understand how anyone can find this movie to be a great horror flick. My friends constant remark was that this movie was made with basically a shoe string budget and that is goes in a direction that it's somewhat believable. Yeah this movie is made with basically a shoestring budget but I didn't find the premise believable at all and seemed like it was trying a bit too hard to make it seem like it's all real. With constant dry interactions with characters that will bore you to tears. And seriously where does the creepy music come from in the movie anyways if this movie is suppose to go in a realistic direction. Like everything in this movie actually happened. In a way this movie is worse than the ""The Blair Witch Project"". Now I know this movie at least has something going on but I found how the characters try to investigate what is going on when crazy stuff happens in the house to be funny and ridiculous. It would have been more entertaining to be with a couple of friends and talk about ghosts and supernatural stuff than to watch this movie. Because that is basically all they do in this movie, constantly going on and on talking about supernatural stuff and weird noises going on later on. So yeah just talk about ghost stories for a while yourself and couple of other people and than go hide and smack pots and pans and that sums up this movie. The movie isn't even original this premise with the videotaping of what is going on while the characters knowing they are being videotaped has been done before. The trailer to this movie is unbelievable at how it tries to sell itself as being the scariest movie ever made. Cause it's not, actually it's far from it, in fact it's more boring than actually scary. The movie even lacks tension and it's composed of mainly two boring than real life characters. It's just sad to see how this movie became notorious and actually a hit in theaters when it came out. I am just glad I didn't see this in theater and just saw it with a couple of friends on a television screen. I give this movie a 3.6 cause there is at least something to talk about or even laugh a bit while watching this with other people on TV although the movie itself is bland, dry and not scary. I heard even the audiences that did see this in theater was rolling there eyes after cause they felt cheated. It would have been somewhat watchable if the characters weren't so bland and was actually relatable and if the direction wasn't so predictable.<br/><br/>3.9/10"

Her boyfriend Micah starts to believe her but also wants to record the behaviour of this paranormal entity.<br/><br/>It was allegedly based on a true-story. Yeah, it was good in the final parts. But, the director has made 3 endings to it. So, how could it be a real story? The first part came in 2007. The 2009 theatrical ending was suggested by Steven Spielberg!! Moving on, you can see that these two actors were not professional actors. Some of the scenes were scary I accept, but I won't lose sleepless nights over this. I respect this film for having a budget of less than 20000$, but honestly how did anyone get scared like they showed in the trailer?<br/><br/>I have watched similar programs on Discovery Channel & I believe that such things actually happen. But as a horror fan, I didn't like it, as it wasn't scary enough. I watched this at 11 in the night alone in the dark. Over-hype does that sometimes. I had sky high expectations. It didn't deliver.

Why not get that girl sectioned, she's obviously nuts? Why sleep with the door open? Why didn't the boyfriend sleep on that side of the bed?<br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't bother, this film (in my opinion) is total crud and should never have been hyped up, because it is not worthy of all the glowing reviews from media types, who jump on bandwagons and kiss film's backsides, because they have no minds of their own."
"beau-645-893969","1","5","9","29 January 2010"," A Pair's Normal Activity
","How Paranormal Activity can be listed as a ""horror"" film worthy of distribution or even attention is mystifying. It can be more accurately compared to being a security video of a home. As most people know, watching anyone but your own personal home videos usually drags on to the point of being frightening when forced to watch, but to pay for that kind of torture is haunting. This ""Pair's Normal Activity"" drags on even more, as you desperately wait for something, anything to happen, which sadly never arrives. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity tries to build on the same recipe of hype, genre and style as the Blair Witch. They both play on the premise that if you believe hard enough while watching, you may get just what you wished for. But with Paranormal Activity you have to force yourself to try to be intrigued to get some kind of drama. Which really means you are abnormally doing all the activity. Unlike Blair Witch, this film has no originality, drama, tension or suspense, and is of far worse quality. <br/><br/>They carry a camcorder around, trading off filming each other, followed by using a tripod during their sleep. After an hour of seeing nothing, you start to go to sleep yourself.<br/><br/>Human nature often invites us to slow down at traffic accidents to possibly view something unexpected. When horrible stuff actually happens we wish we had not looked at all. This movie has nothing unexpected or even entertaining to see, but you still wish you had never watched it.<br/><br/>I would normally only recommend to NOT SEE a horror film to avoid the costs of your possible psychological counseling. For those great films, that is a compliment. Even the worst horror films are so bad they are at least fun to watch. However for this home movie, ""Paranormal Activity"", should be retitled, ""A Pair's Normal Activities"". In any case, I would still recommend a NOT SEE, but only because it is horrible.<br/><br/>SUMMARY <br/><br/>1) The trailer is scarier, and has all, yes all of the suspenseful shots from the movie anyway. <br/><br/>2) There are so many other real entertainment choices on IMDb to pick from, hopefully you will go elsewhere. <br/><br/>3) Remember ""The Emperors New Clothes"", well with this film, despite the hype, the king is naked!"

Mind you I was a big fan of Blair Witch Project, and a lot of folks didn't care for that. Here we have the mere power of suggestion, the shadow on the wall, the 'thing that goes bump in the night'. It works and it works to perfection here.<br/><br/>Katie has been haunted by a demon since childhood - Micah, her new boyfriend, who she has recently moved in with, just found out. So Micah decides he's going to take charge of the situation. When the psychic they consult tells Micah that, whatever you do, DON'T p*ss this thing off by talking to it, what does Micah do? In good horror movie form (""Don't open that door!!!"") he TAUNTS it. The feeling of ""Oh no you DIDN'T just say/do that"" is wonderfully creepy and you just know this fool has opened up a can of worms. I mean, a Ouija board?! Weren't you listening to that guy, Micah?!?!? LOL Fun and scary, the movie ends with quite a bang, and that was the theatrical ending... I haven't seen the alternate ending but I hear it's even more disturbing. Highly recommended to purchase on DVD because you will want to see this more than once."

All four of the associates would have been in their element here. I should at this point like to thank the hysterical females just behind my right shoulder who made me jump more than what was happening on screen in the final seconds, which were admittedly pretty spooky but didn't make up for sitting through 90 minutes of a boring no-score draw between two poor teams, to coin a metaphor. The rest of the film is tedium incarnate. How are we supposed to believe in these people? How are they meant to get to sleep after two or three nights of this? Impossible to believe in these poorly sketched characters. Any resemblance with the Blair Witch Project is entirely fortuitous (and a godsend for such a lame movie)."

","I watched this movie in the cinemas since i wanted the full effect and to be horrified like never before as the youtubevideos suggests. The movie was so hyped i hoped it to be that scary movie I've been waiting for since my experience with Rec. <br/><br/>The setup is a house, two people in it and a camera. Starts off promising with fairly good acting. It almost seems they are a couple in real life, that would be my guess. Micah(Micah) does what you would expect from a boyfriend after his girlfriend tells him she hears noises and sees things after midnight - he sets up a camera in the house and starts taunting. As texts in the middle of the screen shows the process, day1..day12 etc. things escalates from day to day. People in the audience are getting nervous and i feel the tension rising and building up my expectations. However the movie is never really kicking off and nothing is ever happening, its like Scream without the guy with the knife. Its like your lover giving you a lapdance and leaving in the middle of the show. Its like i pay 15bucks to get scared but i get angry instead. The whole movie felt like the first 30 minutes of a good horror movie, then all the sudden texts start running down the screen and the cinema is lit up - the movie is actually ending after 30 min? oh well my clock tells me I've been sitting here for 1½ hours. <br/><br/>Taking the budget into consideration i would say its a great horror movie. I guess i was just expecting something more frightening. Want to know how the audience was reacting? They reacted like me, laughing and complaining when walking out.<br/><br/>I could almost promise you the hype is mostly made up and the videos you can watch online are promotion and bullshit. I cant imagine anyone leaving the cinema or getting freaked out. OK, maybe if they are bored and leave or angry and freaked out."

Let me say, it really wasn't that good. I don't understand what people saw in this movie. What was so scary about it? What was so interesting about it?

","Paranormal Activity (2007)<br/><br/>Don't you hate it when a preview turns out to have all the great moments of a movie? Well, that's sort of true here--and they are great moments. But there is a lot of waiting around, and a lot of suspending disbelief to make this simple movie fly.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a super low budget effort, and good for them. I love the spirit of it, and the plot proceeds steadily, if with a lot of deliberation, a steady progression to more and more horror. The format, showing the main couple sleeping each night in a kind of home-brew surveillance camera is clever, and builds suspense each time. It's a smart situation, and if it had been smart all through, it would have succeeded even with its beginner's credentials.<br/><br/>But oh well. Why, for example, do they refuse to turn on the lights in some scenes? And why do they refuse to just leave--at least to go to MacDonald's or something for a breather? The lead young woman is a student, but you wouldn't know it. I like her in general, and that helps. And he's likable in his annoying ways, too, and he does what for a living-- daytrading? Is that still a job? Enough to pay for a big house in San Diego? Well, you get the point. There are holes in this cheesy movie to make the Swiss proud.<br/><br/>Does it work anyway? Sometimes. You won't be angry leaving the theater. But you'll be happier watching it at home--it's all about being afraid to go to your own bed, and so might as well make it too close for comfort. The obvious precedent in Blair Witch Project is tough because that earlier movie is so much better--better in concept, better acting, more range in the filming, and an amazing ending. Here...well, give it a whirl, with all these doubts in mind. It ain't half bad."

The most disturbing part was what the characters DIDN'T do when they had evidence. No one would react the way they did. If you had video evidence of a presence in your house, wouldn't you tell just about everyone? If you bore the marks of being attacked by an invisible presence, wouldn't you have them checked out? If you were one of the few friends that they did tell, would you really let them stay in that house another two weeks? If you were the girl and your boyfriend lied to you as much as this guy did, would you still stay with him?

I would not recommend anyone to spend money watching this in the cinema, save your money and go and see something better! In all, the film for me, lacked any atmosphere, likable characters and in fact, I couldn't have cared less what was going on by twenty minutes in.

","Me and my friends, true horror nerds to the core, could not wait for this movie. Much like with Cloverfield, we saw the advertisements and viral campaign on the horror blogs and youtube, and were crazy in love with this movie. Also much like with Cloverfield, we left the theater with a cold feeling of hatred deep in our hearts -- hatred for the mainstream turd that is the modern horror.<br/><br/>The movie itself was wonderfully presented. The ""less is more"" approach to this movie -- both in special effects and in scripted dialog -- is exactly what most modern horror films need. The ""acting"" was well enough (if improve really can be considered acting), and the tastes of comedy during the daytime portions of the movie truly amused me.<br/><br/>Good production, good comedy and acceptable acting only make a mediocre film at best. The idea of demon possession has been done before, the fauxumentary approach has also been done before -- and with the Exorcist and Blair Witch Project as obvious comparisons, one needs to perfect their pizazz in order to compete.<br/><br/>This is where Paranormal Activity fails.<br/><br/>The pacing was unbearably slow. Knowing that the movie was just outside of an hour and a half, I was expecting a lot more supernatural and lot less ordinary. Instead, I painstakingly awaited a scene where anything happened. Once it came, it was another long wait for it to have any significance on the plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>The characters were unlikeable. When you present a victim in a film, you're supposed to make the audience feel connected to that person so that they have an emotional stake in the outcome of the film. Micah comes off as nothing more than a big immature jerk; the girl (can't even remember her name) comes off as whiny, controlling, and helpless. Neither one of them contribute to the story in any way, and when you sever the feeling of ""this is me"", you get an audience that doesn't care what happens to them. Or somebody who starts cheering on the bad guy, which really ruins that feeling of tension all that slow pacing was trying to build.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and a tried and true trick of the trade? Your lead characters are supposed to lead your audience's emotions. When your lead characters respond to a haunting playfully, indifferently or by goading it, then your audience is going to fall into that mindset. ""This is a game; this is fun; this is not scary."" Paranormal Activity will probably provide some cheap scares for the timid, unexperienced (with horror movies in general), or those with pre-existing phobias to darkness, close spaces or hauntings. I would not recommend this film to anybody else."

They are in no way related except in tone and emotion.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie last night with a good friend and both of us left the theater totally creeped. The actors were phenomenal. The director was hugely successful in creating an atmosphere of real suspense and fear. If I had been watching this movie at home, it would have been one that I turned off for a while about half way through to bring myself back to reality. Keep in mind also, I love scary movies. I watch them all the time and this one was the first in a LONG time to actually send chills down my arms and make my stomach sink from dread.<br/><br/>Okay so why then did I give it a nine not a ten? Two reasons first: the ending while apropos and good could have been stronger. (this is really a nit-pick it was very good). Second: I should have sat farther back in the theater. The shaky-cam stuff gave me a bit of a head-ache until I got used to it.<br/><br/>Other than that go see this movie!! Or at the very least rent it, I think this is one movie that will work very well in either setting.<br/><br/>N.B. Yes this film is ALL shaky cam, which means low quality filming.

","I'm sorry, but no! This is not the scariest movie of all time, nor is it guaranteed to leave you experiencing nightmares...unless you are already predisposed to being very sensitive to these types of films.<br/><br/>Long story short: a haunted woman and her boyfriend of 3 years, living the American dream, are being tormented by a presence which opens and closes their doors, leaves three toed foot prints around the house, and apparently has been burning an effigy for the wife in the attic.<br/><br/>They consult a psychic who tells them that this isn't a ghost, but rather a demon, and it feeds of negativity. He recommends a demonologist, which of course leads to an increase in tension in the relationship because the stereotypical boyfriend doesn't like the idea of having someone else solve his pet project. This, in turn, leads to fighting, which in turn leads to more substantial paranormal activity, and so on.<br/><br/>Before you know it, the girlfriend is showing all the signs of possession, which in turn culminates in a finale that is only mildly creepy for those who have seen the Spider walk scene from ""The Exorcist."" The performances in the film seem rather authentic, and so one has to admire the film maker: after all, it's not everyday that a film that cost just $15,000 can generate this kind of buzz.<br/><br/>However for me, this film just wasn't effective or scary!

Some people even think it is real because of rumors, much like those of the blair witch project. This movie was SLOW! Even when there would be some action it would last for about 30 seconds and then cut to the morning and again it would be slow.

There was all that buzz going around ""Paranormal Activity is SO scary, its the best horror film ever!"" Well, this film is definitely not scary, and I can barely even say that it qualifies as a horror film. The only reason it was rated R was for language. Take out the language, it would have been PG.

","... and that of the audience that buys into it.<br/><br/>A little over a decade ago, as Hollywood blockbuster budgets were getting blown out of control, many of us predicted that someone was going to pick up a camcorder and create a blockbuster at a shoe string budget. Shortly afterward, we witnessed a misfire (The Last Broadcast), and a bull's-eye (The Blair Witch Project). The genius of the latter was not only in its simplicity but also its believability. The paranormal connection was left open to debate. It was a clever little film.<br/><br/>Not so with Paranormal Activity which insults its audience's intelligence and apparently manages to get away with it. Roger Ebert's 3.5-star rating of this movie is testament to the old man going senile. Real terror is the result of identifying with characters who make the same decisions that we would under similar circumstances. What can you say about an audience that actually identifies with the endless string of bone-headed and utterly idiotic mis-steps of the two main characters, as well as the contrived and highly questionable plot-moving claims of the ""expert"", such as ""leaving the house will not help at all""? Oh yeah? Then how about calling 911? Or sleeping in another room? Or taking shifts sleeping? Or just staying the hell awake one friggin' night?! Or just going some place where there are a lot of people instead of insisting on being cooped up inside the house? ....<br/><br/>It's been almost four decades since The Exorcist, and this is the state of the sensibilities of the modern moviegoer? <br/><br/>In the distant future portrayed in the film Idiocracy, a blockbuster is a movie called simply ""Ass"", which consists of 90 minutes of a man's butt making a variety of noises.

"jamesharrah","1","4","7","29 January 2010"," We actually turned it off........after only 45 minutes.
","""Paranormal Activity"". What can be said?! Well, let me see. I kept hearing from family and friends about this movie and how scary it was, (yeah o.k.) and in all reality I had no intention of seeing it even though I LOVE scary movies. Then I saw a commercial for it on t.v. and saw a magazine heading saying...""Scariest movie of all time""...(VERY boastful statement wouldn't you say?). Curious, I decided to stroll down to the video store to rent a copy and was prepared to be scared to death!!!........Turned out I was actually bored to tears.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. To me, it is the ""things that go bump in the night"" and ""shadows lurking in doorways"" that make for a WONDERFUL scary movie. Not blood and guts and gore, but the ""unseen"". IF they are done correctly that is. And in this case...they weren't. <br/><br/>This whole ""camcorder concept"" has been done to death. I think that is what ruined this movie. ""Blair Witch Project"" proved that, and in itself another awful movie. Then came ""Cloverfield"". Even though it too was shot in the said mentioned concept, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that good either. In other words: QUIT WITH THE CAMCORDER CONCEPT! It ends up looking like something you would see on ""Americas Funniest Home Vidoes""! <br/><br/>But, I digress.<br/><br/>Anyway, after only 45 minutes of annoying chatter between the couple and a few sounds of ""bumps in the night"", disgusted, I actually turned it off and watched ""T2"". Then the following day I felt I would give it another shot, since I really didn't give it a chance the prior viewing, so I turned it back on and watched it from start to finish plus watched the ""alternate ending"". Still, I wasn't impressed. The entire process was like watching some silly paranormal show on the History Channel or something. You know those shows where these people go heading into haunted houses with their night vision cameras and jumping out of their skins to any sound they hear and any spot on a lens they call a ghost? A ghost, when in fact it is a bug? Silly and UNscary stuff. That is what this ""movie"" is.<br/><br/>The story is of a young student who lives with her day-trader boyfriend in a suburban home, who since childhood, has been tormented by an evil ""entity"" and her boyfriend goes out and buys a camcorder in hopes of capturing the spirit on film and rid her of its presence once and for all. Then what follows is a series of events which proves the entity does in fact exist. (Looks good on paper).<br/><br/>I am not sure what bothered me the most: the irritating annoyance of the boyfriend or the lack of actual scares! The ONLY sequence that got me was ""Night 20"": the entity pulling the girl out of bed by her foot and dragging her down the hall. ""Kinda"" chilling, but not very. In any event, to call this the ""scariest movie of all time"" is an insult to the whole genre of film making. The acting was less than believable and it was NOT terrifying. It looked like something a couple of kids might make. And the endings were just terrible...both of them. <br/><br/>What really astonished me was seeing the commercials on t.v. (yet again), and seeing the audiences responses: screaming, gasping. Whatever. Plus, the ""too frightening to be shown in theaters"" business? Who thought thought that up? It just shows the mental capacity of todays audience and leaves one wondering, ""Why would you pay to see garbage like this when you can turn on your t.v. set and watch the same thing for free?"".<br/><br/>So, I returned the DVD to the video store and demanded my money back. Which I got.<br/><br/>SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch ""The Amityville Horror"" (the original, not that ridiculous remake), if your in the mood for a ghost story. As bad as ""Amityville"" was...it is STILL superior to this dredge.<br/><br/>No wonder it sat on the shelf for awhile. I can see why."

","Paranormal thriller similar to 'The blair witch project' and as just as boring, maybe even more so. This movie was incredibly slow moving, almost crawling at a snails pace, and over all not very scary. If you are particularly susceptible to ghost stories you might find this scary. I will say that the camera work was slightly better then blear witch, but not much. You basically wait 40 minutes before anything happens, and when it does it is no more then a small bump in the night. I can never understand why people would remain in haunted house. Maybe they feel their property value would drop if they ran out screaming into the night? and why did they keep sleeping in the bed room after each incident?

","I saw this film completely unaware of its marketing campaign, so I can only evaluate ""Paranormal Activity"" based on its own merits. And thus, I have to agree with Mark Savlov from the Austin Chronicle: this is a sorry excuse for a movie, and it's hardly scary at all. The story is preposterous, and the acting didn't impress me at all, but the worst thing is that the thrills aren't many to begin with, and when the supposedly creepy stuff finally starts to happen, it's not so shocking. Some people might say that it's more realistic this way; I'd say it's mediocre and shows the lack of creativity from the filmmaker. Too much hype, in my opinion... I wish they had gone all the way with this idea and really scared the heck out of us, ""thrll-junkies""."

Yes, he's insensitive to Katie's concerns and just a huge jerk. Whether he was written that way or the fault falls on the director's shoulders, since Oren Peli did both, it's his fault. For me, Micah's obnoxiousness was a distraction.<br/><br/>SEMI SPOILER ALERT (No details but hinting at how the movie ends) Finally, there was no payoff in the ending. A real letdown.

","Trailers for Paranormal Activity claim it is the scariest movie ever made, but does it really live up to the hype?<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity features a lot of first timers. This is Oren Peli's first film as a director and features first time actors Micah Sloat and Katie Featherstone.<br/><br/>The film cost only 15,000 dollars to make and has currently domestically grossed 107,219,682 dollars according to boxofficemojo.com.<br/><br/>Paranormal was filmed entirely using a hand-held camera. Peli most likely did this to give the movie a more realistic tone and he succeeded in that aspect. Other movies such as Cloverfield and The Blair Witch Project were shot like this. The camera work was done well, it really added to the character of the movie.<br/><br/>Featherstone and Sloat's performances were not exceptional but could be expected from an actor or actress's first film.<br/><br/>The movie features very little special effects with added a good touch to the movie. It lets viewers imagine instead of creating its own images. This is probably more because of the film's low budget than artistic direction though.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie itself was only mildly interesting. It was difficult to like the characters. Most of the movie Sloat's character was trying to agitate the ghost most of the movie which didn't make his character very likable and Featherstone's character was annoyed or scared the entire movie which didn't give much for character development. <br/><br/>The scares were good and well done but was it the ""scariest movie ever made""? I don't think so.

","Well, I finally got to see this and all I can says is ""genius - brilliant!"" Not the film - no, that's awful - I mean the marketing campaign. Hype in it's purest form and I guess you have to pat someone on the back for that. To sell a film this bad has got to be some achievement. I had seen the tagline 'is this the scariest film ever?' and as an ardent horror fan I just had to see it. The answer is of course, no - it's not the scariest film ever. It's probably number 345 in my list, just behind 'Carry on Screaming'. It's a pretty poorly plotted, badly acted mash of Blair Witch style Exorcist - haunted house stuff. If you have never seen a horror film, or are 12 year old, then maybe it's a little creepy but for the rest of us it's a non-event.<br/><br/>The idea is pretty good: a couple set up cameras to record the activity in their home. They capture (or rather don't) paranormal activity. The pay off can be seen in the trailers. The version I saw was the one was the police bust in at the end. The thing is - it's just all not very well done. I am not talking about the effects - I realise its a low budget effort - the film is just awful. This is an opportunity missed.<br/><br/>The problem is that the acting is meant to natural but just sounds so stilted and comes out as even more dumb dialogue than the ""typical"" horror scripts.<br/><br/>The feeling of dread that is built is quickly dissipated and these is no sympathy for the characters - they are just silly.<br/><br/>Probably like you I read the glittering 10 star reviews and was intrigued (I wonder who posts those reviews - hmm???).<br/><br/>You pay your money and you take your choice. All I will say is buyer beware.<br/><br/>It's a bit like unwrapping an Xmas gift you have been waiting all year for and discovering there's nothing in it."

","I can see right off the bat why people claim this to be ""boring and repetitive"". It isn't a gory movie that is aimed to only physically make you flinch at what's showing on the screen. It is playing for a more observant audience, targeting them using senses you can't avoid. You can try all you want to block the sound, but the only way is to leave the theater (which many choose to do). It makes you flinch mentally, as well as often jumping out of your seat, because not once do you literally see the demon. More in-depth clues are used to reveal it's presence. The camera cuts to a night scene around 3 in the morning. Katie and Micah are sleeping soundly in their bed. You feel the suspense as the creepy background sound comes over the speakers, signaling something bad is about to happen, but you have no idea what. The majority of the theater that doesn't find this movie a complete joke is holding their breathe, waiting for something to happen. It is dead silent. You then hear the footprints approaching the bed. You see a sleeping Katie being pulled to the hardwood floor, but it doesn't hit you until you hear her helpless shrieks only growing louder as she is dragged farther away from the camera. It's truly terrifying and emotionally disturbing on many different levels. A lot of the reason behind this is because the film has you indecisive as to whether it's fiction or a real home video. The actors are incredibly realistic. They don't appear to be playing a character, but to be strictly themselves. The raw emotion from the two is as if there were no camera at all. The basic premise of the movie itself is ordinary, if not a tad cliché. The film itself is very realistic on account of the acting , the intense imagery, and the utterly believable special effects, especially given the tiny budget."

Some filmmakers can do it and many can't. Here I think they have it down pretty good with the result its being billed as one of the scariest movies ever made, I don't think thats the case. I do think this is going to have a long life once it hits home video where teens will sit around in their houses and watch and freak themselves out. To me it's better than Blair Witch, but probably not as good as the best parts of Cloverfield. Certainly it hangs together better than either of those two films. The film will make you feel uneasy.

First and foremost the film goes on way too long. Several sequences, while building character, go on way too long. There was more than once when I was bored. Sue me I have a limited ability to stand home movies, even my own, and this is sometimes really dull. I also have problems with several things that happen. Just once I'd like once someone not to do the one thing they are told not to do. The husband didn't have to pull out the Ouiji board. Is it me or doesn't it seem odd that when the couple is woken up by events, they never turn on the light? The grab the camera, but they don't turn on the house lights. I also am not too happy with the rapid progression toward the end.The man who comes to help is in and out so fast its not scary but silly, why didn't they all go outside and talk?. Lastly has to do with the camera's ability to record...there has to be a limit to how much it can record.(I can't say more than that). The visual effects are an uneven mix of good and bad. I'm not sure why the real special effects, the shadows, the door, the being pulled out of bed are all really well done, but things like the Ouiji board bursting into flames or the exorcism on line are laughably bad.Its jarring and breaks the spell.<br/><br/>(Spoilers End) <br/><br/>Its a good enough film to recommend. I'm pretty sure its going to give you some sort of rise, though how big will probably be determined by how and where you see this- if you do watch this at home make sure to leave the lights on."

Then stuff is supposed to happen. The problem with this movie is nothing ever happens. The characters talk, and bitch, and moan, and groan, and knit, and read, and bead, and watch TV, and sleep, and walk, etc etc. Occasionally, a door will move on its own, or a blanket will blow, or the woman will sleep walk...ooooo scary stuff. It's like watching a film of a normal person's life: deadly dull.

The characters are completely unlikeable though, and very boring. The man is an a-hat, and very dumb, and thinks way too much of himself. The woman is completely humourless, acts stunned most of the time, and spews inane dialogue. She lets him use her back door though, so I guess shes not all bad.<br/><br/>Oh, and the production values are abysmal. If you have any problems with shaky cameras, stay far away from this movie. It made my wife sick and gave me a headache. She actually stopped watching half way through, but I kept thinking something cool/scary is about to happen. There were virtually no special effects, unless you think having a door move by itself is special.<br/><br/>I am also thinking that these 8/91/10 out of 10 reviews have all been astroturfted, and it makes me reconsider using IMDb as a guide for movie reviews."
"spidermandel","1","7","15","29 October 2009"," Deserves an Oscar for hype
","Sorry to say I believed the hype and blew 8 bucks. I shoulda gone to the cinema next door and seen THis Is It with Jacko. Paranormal Activity was an absolute piece of crap... predictable, slow, slow, and slow. The scariest thing about this movie is that so many people have bought the hype and gone to see it. I've seen student films that are much better. My fault - I'm too trusting in reviews. What are these people smoking? I've seen scary movies before, all the way from the original The Blob to Blair Witch. Scary should be an emotional reaction, a complete involvement with the characters, the story, the premise. And every movie needs a story and a premise, not a one line summary like ""this couple is in a house, the guy's a geek about video cameras, and his girl friend is possessed."" Out of the 90 minutes, 80 of it seemed like they were sleeping, as I was. There should be federal guidelines on how much you can fool the public, kind of like the financial meltdown when rules were broken and ignored. If that were the case, everyone who worked on the publicity for this film would be doing time."
"cursemymetalbody","10","7","15","24 October 2009"," Possibly the scariest film I've seen in my life
","This film is quite possibly the scariest film I have yet to see in my life.<br/><br/>There are a lot of people on IMDb that will say it wasn't scary, or that it is over-hyped. It's all in the eye of the viewer. Some one may say ""how can someone find a door moving on its own scary?"" or ""how can someone find random footsteps in baby powder scary?"" Well - I suppose why this film scared me is because it just felt very real. Sure some of the stuff the characters said or did weren't things I would particularly do if I was in this situation - however, why did I find ""the door moving on its own"" scary? Maybe because the door was moving on its own! If I was having issues with someone possibly haunting me, and I saw my door moving on its own when I knew there could be no possible way for it to do so - then yeah I'd be pretty freaking scared.<br/><br/>I think some people don't understand subtle scares anymore, we have become so used to gore and forced horror that when a gem like this comes along you either appreciate it or don't.<br/><br/>This movie genuinely frightened me, not because of what was shown - more because of what wasn't shown, what wasn't answered, and the silence and suspense between the quick moments of fright. That's what made this movie so scary, and so great to enjoy."
"Connieeye","10","7","15","19 October 2009"," An Hour Later and I'm Still Shaky
","Honest to Pete, this has to be the most frightening film I have ever watched. Right now, an hour after leaving the theater, I still have that jiggle-y feeling in my chest, like all my organs are made of Jell-O.<br/><br/>The entire movie was filmed on a standard hand held digital video recorder, and the majority of the footage was shot in the master bedroom of the couple's townhouse condo.<br/><br/>As most of you know, one's imagination can conjure up far worse terrors than what any cinematographer can capture on film. The atmosphere of this film is heavy and foreboding from the opening scene, shot in broad daylight, as Micah (pronounced Mee cah) films Katie pulling into their driveway, showing off his video skills as well as his new toy.<br/><br/>We discover that Katie has been experiencing paranormal activity the past few nights, and Micah has decided that he can handle the problem himself. So, a la Ghost Hunters, Most Haunted, etc, he has purchased digital recording equipment with night vision capabilities and audio recorders to capture EVP.<br/><br/>Katie is skeptical, wanting to call in professional psychics to deal with the problem before it gets out of hand, but Micah is insistent that he be allowed to try his way first.<br/><br/>So, over a three week span, we watch Micah and Katie deteriorate; the relationship, their emotional well being from the nightly terrors, as well as lack of sleep. As the strife and discord increases, so does the activity the couple experiences.<br/><br/>Katie reveals that this is not the first time she has encountered this sort of phenomena, that she has had several episodes throughout her life, starting at age eight. That particular event ended with the family house burning down.<br/><br/>Micah, becomes more aggressive, claiming his house and craving something tangible that he can fight. If possible, he makes matters worse, by bringing in an Ouija board, assuming that if he can communicate with his adversary, they might reach a more level playing field.<br/><br/>The most terrifying scene in the entire film consists of thirty seconds of things happening out of camera range. You can hear. Something, you know, I mean you positively know in your heart, that it is bad. I'm getting a little short of breath again, just remembering what I 'didn't' see.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend this film to anyone who is fond of suspense and psychological terror. However, go to the theater for the full experience. Con and I got there just after the Sprint blitz of commercials had started. The crowd was talkative and excited throughout the previews of coming attractions. Once the lights dropped completely and the film started, you could have heard a pin drop.<br/><br/>No one spoke aloud, no one laughed inappropriately. Not a single person left the auditorium for snacks or to visit the restrooms. It was almost like we were held in thrall. I kid you not, we sat there like crash test dummies, cringing and covering our faces, peeking through our spread fingers at people sleeping.<br/><br/>When the film ended, the very second the screen went blank, we stood as one and started walking toward the aisles. No one spoke, no one stood and watched the credits roll, we just left.<br/><br/>Not since the Blair Witch Project, have I felt a film to be worth all the hype being generated to sell tickets. Paranormal Activity exceeds the hype. It scared the crap out of me and I do not think I will buy the DVD nor rent it, simply so I won't be bringing any of that sort of activity into my home."

Literally 86 of minutes of my life that could have been spent watching paint dry, getting a root canal, or having my privates smashed with a sledgehammer would have been infinitely more enjoyable than watching this filth. The problem has to be the ""hype"" surrounding the movie. The only thumbs up I can give the movie is the fact that they had their minions out there promoting this movie to the hilt. I personally heard numerous people call my favorite morning show, Eliot in the Morning in DC to vouch for how scary and excellent this movie was.

OK, the budget are really low but this is not excuse for the lack of fun, suspense or fun stuff. On the good side: it's not a long film. If you dare watch it you only have to do it for about 90 minutes. Some people say this movie its kinda Blair witch project... well, you can say its similar yes, even in ""the grand finale"", but BWP have some scary parts and the history its more attractive than this one.

"djeng64","1","5","10","11 December 2009"," Complete Garbage
","I have never in my life hated a movie or a video game or anything so badly that I gave it a ZERO out of 10. Paranormal Activity changed that. (Well okay, technically I gave it a 1, but in my mind, I just gave it a zero because there is nothing good about this movie.) The movie was absolutely terrible. I was bored out of my mind for the entire movie. Half the scenes in the movie were the two main characters (a couple) bickering (and no one pays for a horror movie to see people bicker--unless they die as a result of or shortly after they bicker). The other half of the scenes (the ones that were supposed to be scary) was just sitting around for a few minutes waiting for something to happen. And then something incredibly lame (on the order of furniture moving by itself) would happen. I actually found myself checking my watch every few minutes to see how much longer I'd have to suffer through this. (30 minutes into the movie, I considered walking out of the movie as a result of the excruciating boredom, but I decided against it since I was here with friends and they needed to give me a ride home.) The ""scary"" scenes themselves were pretty underwhelming. Aside from the fact that they were so few and so short and so lame, they were completely predictable, completely cliché. Every ""scary"" thing that happened I could see coming from a mile away, and my reaction was more of ""seriously, that's the best they could come up with?"" rather than one of fear. The sole exception, the one time when something happened that I didn't expect, it actually amused me to the point that I burst out in laughter. Only the most sheltered of people would find this stuff scary. Either that or people who come in with the mindset of wanting or expecting to be scared. But someone in that mindset could also be scared by your friendly neighbor saying ""hi"".<br/><br/>The movie has been described to me by multiple sources as ""weird sounds in the middle of the night"". Yeah, I hear weird sounds at night every frickin' night, and I'm still not scared. Maybe if a monster jumped out and dragged me out of my bed, then I'd be scared. But I'd be scared of getting dragged out of my bed by a monster with or without this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe all of this garbage would have been worth it if there was a nice payoff at the end. But no, the payoff was literally in the last few seconds of the movie. And to top it off, that payoff was something I'd already predicted as soon as the movie began.<br/><br/>Now don't misunderstand me. I love horror movies. I even enjoy the really really bad ones. But even I hated Paranormal Activity. It was painfully boring, predictable to the point of cliché, and simply not scary at all. I'll even take a page from the book of Comic Book Guy and call it the Worst Movie Ever.<br/><br/>I don't regret it, though. I actually love writing reviews about grossly overrated pieces of entertainment where I just completely trash them. And Paranormal Activity gave me that opportunity."
"edula","2","5","10","4 November 2009"," Two marks for effort, zero for everything else...
","Whilst I have to admire the fact that Oren Peli made this film for around $15,000, and is now, very probably on his way to becoming very, very wealthy as a result of the films current box office performance in the US, this does not mean that the film is actually any good. Usually, a key factor to liking a film is having some kind of emotional link to the characters - you like them, you don't like them, you love them, you don't. With 'Paranormal Activity', and Katie and Micah, there is simply no connection. What we are presented with are the two biggest half-wits ever to grace the cinema screen. Within five minutes, you are almost willing the entity (or whatever it is) to harm these people so that it can all be over and you can leave. Unfortunately viewers are then made to sit through watching two wooden, unrehearsed actors giving unrealistic performances in a situation than should be striking real fear in their hearts. Eventually there IS a bit of excitement, but by this point I was past caring - it was far too late into the film, and very anticlimactic. True, the new ending (showing in the theatrical version) is better than the earlier one, but only marginally. There is much more that I would like to say, but this would give away spoilers, and I don't wish to do that. Believe me, though, that if I did, it wouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this movie, because there is no enjoyment to be had. OK, people are throwing around comparisons to 'Blair Witch' and 'The Last Broadcast', but those two films were skillfully made and this one simply isn't. Very dull indeed."
"mmkpn","8","5","10","30 October 2009"," Haunting Silence
","I give Paranormal Activity 8/10 because its the totally different experience of HAUNTING and Fear and top of that natural acting. What i like the most is the simple scenes which can shake you down to deepest core of imagination as if you put yourself in the actors shoes and experience the mental situations. The most scariest scenes in the movie are without any noise and disturbing images they are just silent moments which are more scarier than with scenes from other films with noise and CGI. It force you to think and think for it and you will become very anxious about what will happen next... For those who didn't like this movie i suggest them WATCH it ALONE...AGAIN"

Was quite disappointed in the ending, it didn't reveal enough, and was kind of supposed to let the watchers imagination do all the work, maybe this film will be more scary to people who are more open minded to the possibility that supernatural things are real (whereas I'm not), wasn't my type of film."

Even though I didn't let the images and shadows and sounds get to me like those others in the crowd, yet that's expected of teenagers. Anyway ""Paranormal Activity"" may not be a good old fashion gore feast of blood and guts, still it's just spooky enough with it's images and sounds to keep a viewer interested and on the edge of your seat. As it's true many times as legendary director John Carpenter said it's not what you see that scares you the most, but what you don't see that's coming around the corner that frightens you the most.<br/><br/>The film stars a young married couple who go by their real life names as they neither are well known stars you have Katie and Micah who live in a suburban San Diego, California home. The couple's use of a hand held camera moves and paces the film along well as everything is told from their points of view. As they record nearly everything from their conversations to the visits of friends. Yet the main purpose that they use this recording device is to document the strange happenings that they feel is going on in their home as they feel are ghostly and one expert even tells them it is a problem with demons. As the tape rolls on all during the night hours of filming the couple's tossing and turning in bed in which many of us do unaware.<br/><br/>And to keep viewers on the edge of their seats this night footage shows strange shadows creeping under the cover, you see doors slam hear groans and moans with wicked screams! These strange things cause fear for both Kate and Micah even one scene takes you back to your childhood nightmares as the under the bed monster(that you knew as a kid)drags Kate underneath pulling her away from bed! What more must I say I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it as you find out what a shocking twist it takes in the end.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" is certainly a well done film that's interesting and gets the viewers attention for the way it was made and self paced with suspense that you don't really see. This film probably will be a cult independent classic that stands the test of time for years."

","I was scared throughout the majority of this film. It is an excellent piece that had me gripping the arms of my chair the whole way through...until the ending. I thought the ending with the girl being possessed and screaming into the camera ruined the fear that had been instilled by the fact that the audience could not SEE the villain. Giving the demon a form took away a lot of the terror of the unknown it had presented. Now, instead of being an invisible demon, it was a girl, covered in blood. Despite the ending, I thought this was an excellent film and do recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare or is fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal."

","Well acted, delivered, believable and somewhat disturbing.<br/><br/>Disturbing because this kind of movie reverses the hierarchy of good and evil and reinforces the fear many people have of demonic forces while reducing (in the minds of such people) the power God has over these forces. <br/><br/>In simple terms, I see this kind of film as an opportunity to illustrate that the ""bad guy"" in this movie has no power over the those who have invited the ""good guy"" into their hearts (and houses). Many other movies use a similar theme of demonic forces effortlessly being able to reach us in the physical world. Usually, such movies require a certain suspension of belief -- enough to inform us that we're seeing a product of a creative storyteller. Paranormal strokes our belief system just enough to make us suspect that if we were to all film our house at night, we might be in for a nasty surprise. <br/><br/>This also rates a disturbing because not once did Katie seek church assistance (not exorcism)...not even as an unbeliever. There could have been a little back story to her faith or lack thereof, since this had supposedly started when she was 8 years old. Of course, the story would have ended right there had she received the proper guidance!<br/><br/>***************POSSIBLE SPOILER****************** <br/><br/>Near the end, you know what will happen next, and you may think you know how it will happen.

","When I was buying my ticket for this movie, there was a kid who had just seen it at the counter asking for his money back. I figured he was just a crank, but I walked out agreeing with him. <br/><br/>I don't understand the hype around this extremely forgettable, not-very-scary movie. Somebody out there is obviously a top notch marketer, because this film doesn't deserve any sort of buzz whatsoever. I'm fine with low budget/low production values - I loved Blair Witch Project - and even very slow, subtle horror films that work more by what they don't show than what they do. But this movie is mostly long, drawn-out sequences of absolutely nothing happening. There's a lot of scenes of a couple arguing, though, if you find that scary.<br/><br/>There are a tiny handful of quick ""jump out and say boo""-type scares, most of which you can see coming long in advance. No suspense is built, unless showing a stock campfire ghost- story trope every twenty minutes or so is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for an hour and a half. I certainly heard many more people in the theater laughing at this film than sounding frightened. I was not scared or entertained, at all. It's just a poorly-told story.<br/><br/>I'm looking at this and hardly believing I find myself writing such a negative review, about anything... I love movies, and I really love horror movies. I have almost never seen a movie that really I thought wasn't worth paying money to see. But this was one of the most disappointing, least rewarding movie-going experiences I've had in a long time - and given the buzz, it was bad enough that I really felt I wanted to spread the word. If you're a horror buff, and heard this was the ""scariest movie ever"", prepare to be very disappointed."

Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity is the first that actually does deserve its praise.<br/><br/>I drove 70 miles up to LA to see this and, without a doubt, I would've driven more if necessary. I will not lie. I do not scare easily, but this one had me going. The tension was palpable throughout the rather slow beginning. At first, it seemed as if the film simply wasn't going anywhere and the same tricks would be used over & over again. But no. The crew knew exactly what they were doing. They knew how to play with our minds and deliver truly superb suspense. For about half or two-thirds of the film, I felt mainly just creeped out, on edge, etc. But, once it's cranked up, it really gets going and does not stop. There is one scene in particular, and those who have seen it will know, that is truly one of the scariest ever. I am a man, but I will admit. . . I did get a bit teary eyed in fear watching this particular scene. And there was another that, quite literally, made me duck in my seat.<br/><br/>So, all I have to say. . . well done. For once, fan approval and desire is really getting to the studio and they're doing the right thing to release this phenomenal little film.

","Took me 10 years to watch it. I remember the commercials it looked like the audience was frightened to death. I found this movie to be extremely boring. Nothing scary about it whatsoever. Normal bumps and sounds like any house has. Most nights nothing happened so why did they have to drag it on to show nothing happening. What a yawn-fest. I actually could not wait until it was over. And by the way, if someone was looking up in their attic why would a little piece of paper halfway across the attic floor be such a that you have to crawl up in the middle of the night retrieve it? Really dumb, boring, a waste of time. I cannot believe they spent $15,000 to make this. Misleading commercials is what made it over $100 million. Everyone should've gotten their money back."

"ammsarhan","9","3","5","10 August 2010"," Simply a Masterpiece
","The most scary films are those that reflect something so scary, and yet so realistic. We all know there are numerous incidents and proofs of the existence of ""Paranormal Activities"", or as some might refer to as ghosts or demons. Yet we chose to block and deeply bury the thoughts of the possibility that someone (or something) might be watching us and sharing the same space. First of all I just want to say that this is the ONLY horror movie (and I have watched a lot), that has literally made me lose sleep. I just watched the DVD last night, alone, in the dark, and I can tell you  BIG MISTAKE. Before watching, I thought it is another first-person camera movie with some regular shockers like Blaire Witch Project. So I sat and watched, and in a million years I could have never imagined a film like that could scare me to my very core. The difference between this and any other movie is that it respects the viewers' intelligence and build upon their imagination. Paranormal Activity has a lot of missing pieces that requires the viewer to fill, especially the ending, where you need to imaging what the screams were all about, did they finally see the demon, what did it look like, what did it do to them, how was the guy killed, what happened to the girl, etc. Most horror movies rely on traditional methods like scary music and sound-effects, tons of blood, torture scenes, etc, with the usual amount of nudity or sexual scenes. The beauty of Paranormal Activity is the novelty of the approach, building to its exceptionally high level of realism, and successful engagement of the viewers, to the extent that you are cautious when blinking so as not to miss anything. I always thought the scary music in most horror films is a key that builds up the tension and warn the viewers something is wrong, or something is going to happen. In fact, the lack of music proved to have an even bigger effect, there is no warning, you simply don't know what to expect and when to expect it.<br/><br/>It was also a winner relying on unknown actors, adding to the level of realism by convincing the viewer this is an actual home-made film. I found the acting spot on, and thankfully refraining from the ""overdone"" screams and shaky moments. How can you imagine that you can get scared to your very bones by watching the digital clock pass by and then suddenly stop over an almost still image? Or by a light turned on in the room at the end of the corridor? Or by someone standing still for 90 minutes staring in space? Just didn't see this coming. Finally, I notices many people were disappointed, and under-rating this movie (they might have been expecting another ""Hostel""), however, I believe ""Paranormal activity"" is a classic, and a masterpiece, that will change the future views and approaches to horror movies."

"thescruffy1-652-569325","1","3","5","3 February 2010"," Scariest movie ever? Not even close......
","It was with baited breath that I awaited the release of 'Paranormal Activity'. I had chanced upon the trailer online, and I had to agree that it did indeed look scary. 'The Blair Witch Project' had really scared me when that was released, and while there were obvious similarities to be drawn (documentary style, hand held camera etc) I was glad to see a horror film that was not a sequel or a watered down remake of a Japanese film. How disappointed I was though, when instead I was presented with an attempt at the horror genre that missed on nearly all counts.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with the film is that the characters are so irritating. Micah is so smug and arrogant that i almost feel sorry for his vacuous girlfriend. I have no problem with filmmakers using unheard of actors, in fact it can sometimes be a breath of fresh air, SOMETIMES. Forgive me for comparisons to the 'Blair Witch', but they were good actors, and genuinely terrified at their situation. In 'Paranormal' it never gets believable because they never seem really scared, which is a big deal in a film that documents such a terrifying situation.<br/><br/>The special effects are well done, although nothing that Yvette and Karl couldn't muster on Most Haunted and there aren't enough of them. The whole premise of the film is that a couple capture 'paranormal activity' on camera, so where was it all then? Most of the film is made up of the (not so) happy couple's deteriorating relationship, (ok, i appreciate that the 'demonic force' is emotionally testing them to feed off the negative energy, but really, Jeremy Kyle is scarier, and better acted). And besides, can anybody tell me what is supposed to be scary about watching a woman rocking backwards and forwards for the last 10 minutes of the film? You may detect an amount of vitriol in this review, but that is only because I feel conned. I have been a fan of horror films since I was way too young to be watching them and have recently become disillusioned with genre that is content to ruin classic films with rubbish remakes for the sake of making money. This film could have been so much better, I honestly think they decided to be clever to compensate for the low budget, but ended up over thinking just about every aspect of this film, and the result seems bloated and clichéd, and shame on Mr. Spielberg for playing along with the hype too.<br/><br/>Ultimately, people have no business calling themselves horror fans if they find this remotely scary, not only that, but I would recommend they watch 'REC' instead for an example of how low budget horror can be done. It seems that at the moment, everything Hollywood touches turns to crap. I am going to stick to world cinema for really inventive and truly terrifying films for the time being."
"toledo_da_glass_city","2","3","5","5 January 2010"," To much hype for a movie that was not that good.
","After all the hype this movie got I thought to myself I had to see this. The movie has such a slow pace and nothing really happens in my opinion. Besides a bunch of sleeping and a door opening and closer, footsteps being heard for the most part which is just lame. The movie was way over hyped.If your the type of person that is scared really easily then this movie will probably be right for you.... if it takes you a lot to get scared then this is by far not for you. Also If I was the boyfriend there's no way I would stay with my girl if stuff like that was happening with her...I mean seriously I would have just left instead of acting all macho to something he couldn't even see....he was literally trying to fight the demon or whatever it was which is just stupid."
"Fingerforyou","6","3","5","5 December 2009"," Looks good, but disappoints a bit.
","While the movie itself has great potential to be good if you want to be scared, it can disappoint. Here are the main points that I noticed:<br/><br/>Good: * It's believable that it is a home-made movie, suits the found footage genre rather well. * You can see the actors not faking it and over-working themselves, the amount of realism in the movie is just right. * The emotions are expressed really well.<br/><br/>Bad: * During night-time scenes, the tension is being built up, however, when it's time to release the tension, it's not done effectively enough. * Again, during the night-time scenes, when the shadow creeps across the door, it's hard to notice it. * The story with the ""Diane"" woman, isn't linked into the main storyline well enough, even though it's considered to be important. * The movie is only scary in a good atmosphere * Long boring start. <br/><br/>The movie was actually good enough to be called a horror movie, however, there are better films out there. A good horror movie in my opinion should have either a good amount of the ""boo"" moments, OR a good amount of weird moments during which you go ""OMG, that's creepy"", and I believe that the director attempted to balance both in there, but as a result neutralised the horror. As well as that, the scariest moments are put into the trailer, and the rest is more or less irrelevant."
"dondanhernandez","4","3","5","5 December 2009"," Boring, uneventful and cheap. (spoilers)
","I really don't see how anyone found this movie disturbing in any way. The scare moments are either way too predictable or the characters just act in such an idiotic fashion that the scene loses its suspense and it all becomes a laughable endeavor into the unknown abyss of demonic hunting's.<br/><br/>I will give the film credit, at least it had an original idea and an interesting premise, but it just doesn't work with the characters and their completely moronic ideas and their reactions to the situation at hand, the guy thinks he's fixing everything with a camera and baby powder and she thinks inviting experts over (who by the way openly admits that it pisses the demon off) will fix the problem.<br/><br/>Also the ending, I know some people may not have seen the movie, so hopefully they don't read this. But what's the point in trying to have this realistic gritty horror movie and then suddenly girl gets possessed yada, yada, yada, and attacks the camera before credits roll. Yes because possessed crazy demon women attack cameras on a whim, it was a last shot at another cheap scare, and the audience I was so lucky to see this movie with were surprised and startled at a scene that was so obviously going to happen.<br/><br/>I don't have much else to say about this movie other than that if you're lover of horror and you want a good scare you can do better than going to see this film. Rent Exorcist or Jacob's Ladder or something, get a movie that actually messes with your head and makes you think, cause this, well lets just say it doesn't cut it. Jump scares were old when they were first implemented into film."

","I was really looking forward to this movie after the dramatic advertising, but I was left wondering when the haunting was going to start. When it did it was hard to understand as all the action was outside the 'camera zone' apart from one or two things that happened, presumably on the 'real' video shots. There didn't seem to be any real explanation of what was happening and nothing was done to clarify what was possibly causing the haunting. The ending was just so confusing and was left to the imagination. All in all, I felt like I was watching an episode from a series I had missed most of!

"IMDBer100575","7","3","5","1 November 2009"," I enjoyed this movie
","I caved in and decided to watch this movie, alone with the lights off, on Halloween night. :) The commercials / trailers I've seen online and on TV all say that it's the scariest movie since blah-blah and that people at the theater watching the screener jumped out of their seats, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>I liked the acting in this movie and it did make me feel like I was watching a home video. It felt like something from porntube.com except there's never sex. The two main actors did a fine job portraying a young couple in the prime of their lives, living together.<br/><br/>Atmosphere was great, but that goes along with what I said in the first paragraph about the acting. It really did feel like an amateur home movie, except they used a really expensive camera instead of your standard Canon Powershot or at best, Sony Handycam.<br/><br/>Emotionally, I will admit, I was scared at a few points. I was scared and I really felt bad for Katie. She's hot and I hate to see hot women not happy. :) Her boyfriend, I don't remember his name but he was stupid at certain points. Why men try to be macho, I'll never know. There were a few points where I felt the blood rush through my body. An awesome feeling for when you're watching horror, not so awesome when you're running from the neighborhood thugs.<br/><br/>Questions I had to ask myself: why does he always have the camera with him, even when checking for intruders? Why is the bedroom door still open when they go to bed, heard of a lock? Why are they still in this house, machoism? Why is she still sleeping on the side of the bed closest to the door, obviously not machoism? Why has this man gone to bed for two weeks without getting some from this hot chick? I'd recommend this movie to the Hitchcock fan. Slasher and gore fans probably are better off filming their friends dive off a bridge. If you believe in angels and demons, don't watch this...go to confession and beg for forgiveness for all your sins (I know you have at least a dozen). And if you like porntube.com, definitely watch this and then go right to porntube.com afterward. Let me know if this movie changes your mind about homemade porn."

"BigBabe0","Null","3","5","18 October 2009"," For those of you who recall feeling nauseous towards the end of ""Blair Witch Project""....
","....You'll probably feel the same at this movie; maybe not quite as bad since the camera doesn't jump around quite as much. It's a shame since I probably would have ""gotten into"" both movies more if I hadn't kept feeling like I might have to bolt for the bathroom at any moment. Well, as you've doubtless heard, like ""Blair Witch"" this is presented as ""found footage"" but as former President Bush eloquently put it, ""Fool me twice... uh... we can't get fooled again."" Also like ""Blair Witch,"" there are moments when I thought ""Uh, who's supposedly filming this?"" but again, it's less obvious here. (If you really want to see a ""film within a film"" done exquisitely, see ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Man Bites Dog."") Basically it's yet another haunted house story, with a young couple in San Diego (again like ""Blair Witch,"" the actors use their own names) noticing things going escalatedly bump in the night. Other than calling in a psychic who (in a nice twist on convention) proves completely useless, their response to the spooky things happening is to buy a camera to record everything while waiting for more spooky things to happen. Years ago when Eddie Murphy was a stand up comic he had a bit about ""The Amityville Horror"" and why it couldn't have been about black people, because if the latter had bought a beautiful home and then heard a voice in the walls growling ""Get out,"" their response would have been ""Too bad we can't stay!"" Mr. Murphy's humor unfortunately has ruined every haunted house flick for me since then: ""Why don't they just get the f--- out?"" ""Paranormal Activity"" tries to get around this by suggesting that the ghost/demon/whatever is after the woman personally, so it wouldn't matter if they went somewhere else. It's hard to believe, though, that they wouldn't at least have tried a change of venue. But as someone else posted on IMDb, if I were 18 maybe that wouldn't have bothered me.<br/><br/>I do want to give Oren Peli credit for remembering classic movie wisdom about the power of suggestion. He also seems cinematically unique in recognizing that a steady unedited image (like in a dream) can be a lot more effective than so many movies nowadays that are so frenetically cut that it's impossible even to tell what's happening, let alone be scared by it. The most unnerving bits are of the couple asleep in their bedroom where every night around three a.m. a door will move by itself, a light will go on and off, then a sheet will move as if someone or something is under it. I wondered how they managed to get to sleep every night with all this happening (presumably they watched each video the next day). After the woman is literally dragged out of the bed one night, I thought ""That's it, they're outta there"" --but no. Sound effects are used very effectively (the demon's arrival is signified by a loud humming). Also the couple in question seems realistic in terms of getting on each other's nerves etc. There's definitely a lot here to like. But little things kept picking away at my ""suspension of disbelief""; the Ouija board, the powder on the floor, the broken picture frame all seemed somewhat corny, maybe based mostly on budget restrictions. Some of the sequences didn't really ""pay off"" for me, particularly when the guy ventured into his trap-door attic (I have the same kind of attic and hate going up there even with no demons around) where I thought maybe something really juicy would be discovered; instead it's just a partially torn/burned photo from the woman's childhood (when she also saw spooky things, then their house burned down). It's impressive, I guess, that a demon would hang on to a souvenir that long (in his invisible demon lair somewhere?) and then plant it in their attic and wait for it to be found--but what if the guy hadn't ventured up there? I suppose the demon would have needed to retrieve the photo from the attic and put it under their pillow or something. Ultimately I can't get around the lack of more initiative from this young energetic couple in terms of response to the threat; as in umpteen previous movies (and presumably more in the future), they have to stay there so they can be victims. (In the recent ""Pandorum,"" by contrast, the heroes had to face the menace because there was literally nowhere else to go.) But ""A Plus"" for effort from Mr. Peli, I look forward to his future work. No, I don't think he'll be ""corrupted"" by having more money available. I think too many film fans make too much of a ""virtue"" of the ""necessity"" of new directors working with limited funds. If they have the chops, more funds will only enhance their ability to show their chops off...."

This thing stinks so bad you'll need a gas mask just to enter the theater. <br/><br/>Some moron couple in San Fran get bugged by ghosts in their house. So they try to film the ghosts.

This is Blair Witch Lite, a regurgitation of what was a low-rent gimmick to begin with. They have the nerve to use that tiresome jiggly camera routine, invoking nausea. And that stupid ""night vision"" effect. When you can actually see someone, they're tearfully whining or f-bombing. Meanwhile, the idiot boyfriend character films on and on, and nobody thinks of leaving to escape the danger. Idiotic clichés like this one will have you rolling your eyes so much you'll get a headache. It's easy to see why the ghosts got sick of these two clowns. <br/><br/>The advertising for this offered no actual footage, and it's obvious why. Instead they showed Beevis and Butthead types pretending to react in mortal fear. If they were actually scared, then they were watching something else. The tension level of this thing plays out more like Scooby Doo meets Casper meets the TAPS Ghost Hunters (on a bad investigation) meets the Great Pumpkin. <br/><br/>All hype, no substance.

I bought the blu-ray just a few days ago, and decided to check it out on my laptop that same night. So there I was laying in bed watching it, not too many parts made me jump, but there were a few in there, a lot of them are just ""OMG! I can't believe that just happened"" type moments, but when it came to the ending of the theatrical version where Micah gets thrown at the camera, and Katie sniffs his body, and then her face distorts and she leaps at the camera, I'm not gonna lie, it made me jump a bit. After the movie was over after that part, I proceeded to fold my laptop up, and lay it on the side of my bed, where I normally do, while I was doing this I did not see or hear my wife get up to check on our daughter, I leaned back up to lay down, I saw my wife standing there and for a brief second she did not look like herself and I damn near shat myself, and almost fell out of bed. lol My point of stating that was, after viewing this movie or at least for me and my wife, things will make you jump by seeing their shadow, or just turning on a light and something popping out at you. It will also make noises in the middle of the night seem so much louder then normal, and will definitely having you wonder if that really was the furnace kicking in, or the fridge turning on, you will definitely be second guessing on what really went bump in the night! This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and would've rated it more then 10 stars if I could! I am a firm believer in ghosts, demons, paranormal phenomenon, and the such, and that is why this movie effected me so much. I've seen doors open on their own, and close, i've seen cupboards open up, and have had cups fly out, or have had my things move from one place to another, even heard whispers in the night. Not only have I've seen and heard this, my wife and other family members of ours have witnessed these types of things as well. So if you believe in ghosts, demons and the such, or have witnessed any thing like that, this movie should/will scare the crap out of you!"

","I found the movie rather realistic - what facilitated the view was the fact that i didn't know if the movie was a real footage or something like a ""Blair Witch"". It did give me scares and at times i was even shaken.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is it does what it intends to do. The only thing which creates the suspicion about reality and takes a bit of scare out was the exorcism footage of the girl on internet.<br/><br/>To me the movie is a fine piece and different in itself. My suggestion - do watch it, but alone as far as possible at home, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY with earphones/headphones."

","I have gone to the cinemas, i have sat through some of the scariest films made by Hollywood, I must have seen at least a good 20 or more horror films (Only the best) and few have even made me even shake, The Shining didn't scare me the Unborn made me laugh, but this film made me f*cking scared, i don't mean slightly scared I mean full out scared, the movie is well done with its camera techniques I have always been a fan of one camera films like Cloverfield & The Blair Witch Project, I feel that despite some occasional dizziness from the camera it is one of the greatest ways to film a movie it brings you into the film as if you're right there and it gets even better with horror, this film is outright scary, sure it takes a long build up but when it gets to the early morning and the haunting starts then its a non stop road of scares, the end of the film will leave you confused and scared, the last 30 seconds will make you jump out of your seat it did for me!

"Darkcloud_the_vortex","10","4","8","22 December 2009"," Really not for everyone...
","I first saw this movie last Saturday, alone at home, in the basement, lights off. I had high expectation about this movie and honestly I was impress. I've seen many horror movie in my life, almost one new movie everyday or two days, any kind, any nationality and I don't care about the budget and the hype.<br/><br/>I was curious about this one. Even the bad critics wasn't stopping me. I couldn't watch the whole movie lights off and I was very paranoid after the movie, looking in every dark corner of the room. But I did sleep well that night.<br/><br/>The next day, I gave the movie to a friend. If it could had been a 10 star for me, it was a 0 star for him, he hated it. So I spend most of the days reading critics and tried to understand why people like me love it and other don't.<br/><br/>First, We need to really want to believe in the story. And we need to believe that this was real, like a documentary, cause it is what they want us to believe. If you don't, won't work. But I could, so work for me there.<br/><br/>I'm a writer so I got, I must admit, too much imagination for my own good. What was unseen on screen was in my head, cause you NEVER see the Ghost. I know a lot about paranormal activity (not the movie but the subject) and experience a few of them to actually believe in it cause everything make sense, everything is mostly logical, except maybe for the end.<br/><br/>But my friend is the kind of guy who love to watch a movie, sit down, relax and have everything ""free"", without having to guess what is going on off screen.<br/><br/>The other point is that this isn't a movie to see in a theather. But alone, at home, a few people around, the less the better, lights off. This way the movie do work.<br/><br/>Has for the actual good and bad of the film : actors are great, Katie is wonderful, love her. The home made movie idea work fine with me. The Ambiance is perfect too. The Bad : I understand the necessity of filming everything for the viewer but this isn't really... realistic. The medium do not have enough air time. And the final, (yes there is at least 3 ending) but the one when Katie turn evil was a bit too much...<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie we love or hate, no middle."

It is the INEVITABLE! It WILL get them, they can't leave, it WILL follow them.

","Everyone who is giving this bad reviews must be under the age of 25. They don't understand that your own imagination is far scarier than any Jason or Freddy and any of these lame remakes that Hollywood is putting out which all suck. For me, the original Halloween (1978) is the scariest movie ever. Paranormal Activity is really creepy and if this stuff was happening in my house I would be freaking out! The setting is an ideal upscale San Diego housing development where Day Trader Micah and his girlfriend (The fabulous) Kristy (This girl can act!) find themselves at the mercy of a demonic force, which has attached itself to Kristy. This film IS very low budget, but its suppose to be, your watching someones home video of things moving in their house. It was totally believable. The bedroom scenes are just so creepy, after seeing the film and going home, I was not really thinking much about it. Then I went to bed and I thought ""What if stuff happens when your asleep and you don't know it""? That is scary and I thought this crew did a fantastic job putting this together. On a 11,000 budget they have grossed 9 million so far, that is because most people over the age of 30 want something good not some lame Michael Bay crap. I can't stand his work it is so bad and Rob Zombie, horrible. Paranormal Activity is worth the money to see in the theater. Is it the most scary? No, its not. It creeps you out and makes you look at your own home in a very different way. I did have to get up and check the closets and behind the shower curtain before I went to bed. And I left the TV on. Its just disturbing more than scary and it stays with you. The acting is great and the character development is excellent and it is very funny as well. The two actors work well together and are a realistic couple that does realistic things. The last few minutes are SO creepy that I just thought I would be out the front door running down the street if it was me. 9 out of 10 just for showing Hollywood it takes IMAGINATION not millions to make something good."

","It wasn't awful. I'm not going to give any true spoilers. The movie did not ratchet up suspense. It did make you wonder what exactly was going to happen, but that's about it. It was slow and dragged on and on. It provided no answers, which can really work. It simply did not. The audience was left with questions throughout, the most prevalent: Where is this going? The main characters made completely stupid choices. The most climactic scene was the last one of the movie. It had some shocks but not the ones like I've read about in these reviews. I like this style of filming. It can work, but this movie is so hyped. I say wait for the DVD."
"Sox575","8","4","8","11 October 2009"," Great *One* Trick Horror Movie!
","PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a pretty decent horror flick based on a deceptively simple idea.<br/><br/>Like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" PA is basically an ""amateur"" film that has been discovered after some horrific events befall a young couple. As the audience, we don't yet know what that is but the video tells us that the guy is a tech-gadget junkie and he decides to make home movies to document his live-in girlfriend's story about being visited by ""something"" ever since childhood, which she feels is still making regular visits (and we're not talking about her monthly visitor either, lol).<br/><br/>There's a slow build up of minor events happening, as they continue to grow in scope and weirdness, to the shocking ending. It had me and others jumping at certain points and so it definitely had its moments.<br/><br/>The film is a lot like those cable reality shows where people go into reputed haunted houses and other places, flick on the night-vision camera, and end up scaring themselves half-silly.<br/><br/>But the main difference between those shows (and even ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie) and PA is that ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" actually shows you the strange and spooky stuff that's going on and it's not just the people suggesting it or showing dust specks and claiming that that's a spirit. You will see what's going on and it's pretty odd and frightening.<br/><br/>Creating an amateur-ish like quality, most of the film is shot in a locked-off camera point-of-view, although there is a little shaking and swinging in the beginning and peppered throughout--not too much or long enough to cause motion sickness--only adds to the movie's mystique. Some shots are shot with the character's head only in partial view which lends to the idea that this is just a candidly shot home movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a fun and frightful film that's great to see with a packed audience and perfect for this Halloween season.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the filmmakers this can't be repeated (like ""Blair Witch""), because everyone will be jaded to this clever filming and marketing technique."

","I haven't experienced a night at the movies like this in I can't remember when. Paranormal Activity gave me chills, goosebumps, and made the hair on the back of my neck raise frequently and uncomfortably. <br/><br/>We watched it in a crowded Manhattan theater and it was a fun, responsive audience, every one of us laughing nervously after every jolt. Much worthy of the price of admission, more so than anything I've seen at the movies in a long time.<br/><br/>I totally enjoyed the pace of the narrative as it slowly built the tension throughout the entire film and broke it with the next encounter. The filmmakers brought back the 'subtle touch' completely missing from every contemporary horror movie. This approach sustained the creepy atmosphere and created a sense of dread that was almost, for me, unbearable to watch at the very end. <br/><br/>The video visual effects were exceptional and seamless. Again approached with a minimalism that proved to be unbelievably realistic (oxymoron?). The filmmakers should be proud of their accomplishment as PA deserves all of the buzz, hype, and awards it's received since it premiered at a film festival a couple of years ago. Congratulations and thanks for bringing back great and effective horror movie story telling. <br/><br/>I woke up in the middle of last night to the sound of movement in my house and again, even as I type this, the hairs raised all over my body because of how fresh PA was in my head. I listened until I was convinced it was my dog and then spent the next 45 minutes trying to get back to sleep. Things that go bump in the night indeed.<br/><br/>Peace Now"

","For a mere budget of $15,000 the job done making this movie was amazing.. If you are expecting tons of special effects and big budget Hollywood type movie, don't waste your time. However, if you are wanting to be freaked out, then go watch this film. I am a huge horror buff, and I have never seen a film that scared me as much as this one. I think, in part, because it seems so real. The actors do a good job of making it seem like a true documentary. I never once noticed any bad acting or corny clichÃ©'s in this movie at all. I had a good time and am still jumpy an hour later. I would give this film 100 stars if I could, but I'm only allowed 10. Please go watch it. You won't regret that you did. I am unsure why there are some negative comments about the movie, unless they were made by people expecting a big budget film. The thing that makes this film unique is that it serves its purpose without spending millions to do it. It will scare you and leave you scared out of your mind."

In most movies the music builds up the effect and tells you something is going to happen. Also the 30 seconds of silence that just makes you tighten up in fear of what will happen.<br/><br/>Not only was this a great film, but the actors and actresses had a flawless performance, especially being behind a hand held video camera the entire time.

We were so very disappointed to find that this movie is basically a rip off of the Blair Witch idea with there being no real substance to the movie. The special effects were not special at all and I could have produced these same effects myself. The suspense was not there as every action was predictable and right on cue. The only thing that startled me at all was when other people in the audience (teenage girls) would scream out when one of the predictable occurrences happened. I would say this is only a movie for teenage moviegoers who have not yet honed a real sense of what horror should be but even some of the younger couples who were exiting the theater with us were complaining that they wished to have their money back.

"chains01","9","5","11","24 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity
","Low budget indie films have been a good way for amateur filmmakers to break out for a long time. Kevin Smith broke out with a black and white movie made for $67,000 called Clerks; El Mariachi, made for only $7,000, turned Robert Rodriguez into a big name rebel director in the 90's. Horror is a harder medium to make it in the low budget arena. A field dominated by gory and effects driven movies these days, horror saw a mega hit in 1999's Blair Witch Project. Made for only $11,000, Blair Witch Project has often been duplicated, but the success was never repeated. Here we are, 10 years later, and a new phenomenon has come around with Paranormal Activity, a movie that doesn't try to be Blair Witch, but exceeds expectations. Made also for only $11,000, Paranormal Activity has made a huge splash in the mainstream breaking records in the process (in it's first weekend it broke $7 million in only 200 theaters), but is it really worth all the fuss? After a series of ""supernatural"" events have happened in their house, Micah, decides to get a video camera to substantiate their claims of a haunting. Katie (who's engaged to be engaged to Micah) has had these supernatural events happen to her since she was 8, she wants them to stop, and while she's not entirely comfortable with Micah recording the events, she goes along with it. They meet with a psychic who feels they're dealing with a demon and suggests a demonologist to help them take care of their problem. Micah doesn't take it seriously, and believes they can get rid of their visitor without outside help. Despite Katie's warnings and worry, Micah keeps trying to provoke the entity. Tensions build, tempers flare, and the paranormal activity gets more intense till it finally reaches the breaking point.<br/><br/>Originally bought by Paramount with the intention of owning the rights to remake the movie with a better budget and bigger names, Paranormal Activity fares better without the higher production values of a big budget film. Shot with one hand-held camera and without a score, the movie feels completely real. The use of unknown actors also gives the film a more authentic feel, and it helps that they don't really feel like they're acting as well. As each day unfolds, we find ourselves prisoners in the house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. We learn every nook and cranny of the house, so we notice the moving shadows, and the changes that occur all the more later on in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, Paranormal Activity is a very well done horror film, stripping away many of the conventions we see in horror film, relying on real scares rather than gore or music cues to instill a sense of tension and fear in the audience. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you have the opportunity, the atmosphere of seeing this with others really helps with adding fear to the proceedings as large groups intensify the feeling among those in the group. For those of you planning on taking the children, there is foul language, but on top of that the film does start off slowly and the more nuanced scenes may be lost on a younger audience. Definitely give this film as a chance as it is worth the hype, even if only for the last scene of the movie!"

Makes you reconsider those BO numbers for J.J. Abrams' universally panned Star Drek and Michael Bay's hideous Transmongers, doesn't it? In any case, this is an amateur hour movie that was produced by a bunch of Hollywood insiders eager to pull wool over the public's eyes.<br/><br/>They were playing the usual ""little movie that could"" card (not a bad idea given the dreck that the studios are producing these days) and deliver nothing except poorly framed shots and a complete lack of film-making knowledge (the filmmakers proudly stated they didn't go to film school... They should have).<br/><br/>In other words, another film that will turn people off from going to the movies. Thanks Paramount... Great job (if your goal is to kill movie-going)!"

","First thing I want to say is that although it is cheaply made, the effects are very well done. Way better than I expected, the film actually looks pretty good.<br/><br/>The idea is good. The script is however half-baked. I didn't like the characters. The female character reacted pretty believably, but the male character, despite the acting being pretty good, was so unbelievably written. Honestly, I wanted to yell at the TV it was so bad.<br/><br/>There is also no character development at all - we never discover anything about the couple's life apart from a) they have a sexual relationship (duh!), b) he bought a camera and c) she hates the camera.<br/><br/>I mean what do they do during the day? What are they doing about the weird crap that's happening? Or even simple things like: what do they do for a living? where did they meet? What bonds them together? I can't answer any of those questions... which is pretty big holes in the writing.<br/><br/>As for the ""paranormal"" character, practically nothing is revealed except for identifying what it is (thanks to the token appearance of the ""psychic"" - what that has to do with spotting paranormal activity is beyond me).<br/><br/>After it is identified, there is no information about why it's there or what to do about it. And they make no further effort to find out anything or even do anything about it (oh let's just go back to sleep) - it's so stupid that I want to scream at the TV.<br/><br/>So that means that every scene outside the scary bits is just a bunch of completely irrational, stupid behavior and conversations between the two leads that go nowhere.<br/><br/>So honestly, the only interesting bits are all the frightening scenes at night when the two characters are mostly asleep. That is where my 4 stars come from, because the idea and events are pretty creepy and really well shot. It's just the rest of the story has no substance - unlike Blair Witch for example, where we see very little, but learn a lot about the witch from the other character's research.<br/><br/>I enjoyed half the movie, but I unfortunately can't recommend it. I will not touch the next 3 (3???) movies that have been made since."

What it haunted to start off with. This film, whilst creepy and suspenseful requires darkness and no talking to get a feel for it.

","This movie has no scare factor whatsoever. I'd suggest changing the tagline from ""don't see it alone"" to ""don't see it at all"". Unlike Blair Witch it just isn't scary or tense or suspenseful. The idea of a demon is laughable anyway but you can suspend belief and enjoy the story if it's done well, as in The Exorcist or The Omen or the aforementioned Blair Witch Project. This had a stupid demon with the power to make doors move and things creak. That's it. Those Japanese horror films, such as The Ring or Dark water, where a scary face suddenly jumps out at you at least have that roller coaster type fun going for them. This had none of that and instead relied on a bedroom where the door had been left open during the night so that you could see the top of the stairs. This is a little bit spooky and most people, as children, would have found this scary and closed the door while they slept. What a shame this device wasn't exploited as it was the most effective atmospheric effect. To sum up, this is a way over-hyped yawn fest with no good adrenalin kicks. Don't see it. At all."

But these moments can spoil a film just like a bad performance or script can.<br/><br/>For PA, one of the ""clang"" moments (actually, a steady stream of them) is that Katie wears a bra all through the movie. It's not that I want to see her braless, it's that I know that well-endowed women don't wear bras ALL the time. My mother is busty, my sister is busty, my first wife was busty, my girlfriend is busty, and I've dated a lot of other busty women. Contrary to what's shown in these ""home movies,"" you'd have a hard time keeping a busty woman like Katie in a bra at all when she's at home. She certainly wouldn't be wearing one when she's asleep in bed, brushing her teeth right after arising in the morning, or making love. It's a small thing, I know, but this is supposed to be actual amateur footage and that's a key to the success of the movie.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other similar problems. All in all, it's a good effort, but it does not match the subtlety or coyness of Blair Witch."

","This is a ghost premise (not a story) that is all about raising the tension.<br/><br/>Good cast, but...<br/><br/>This is about a hundred and thirty eight minutes that could effectively be reduced to about twelve to fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>There is not enough material in this to go into details, even for genre fans, so I won't.<br/><br/>If it had been reduced to a short film, I still would not have liked it, but I would not have hated losing all that time.<br/><br/>Recommendation: If you must watch: Increase playback speed and just skip anything that happens in daylight for the first hour-ten to hour-fifteen.<br/><br/>Sleep well."
"cameroncox53","3","2","3","31 July 2010"," Definitely not the scariest movie of all time
","The only reason that i even bothered watching this movie was because of all the hype ""the scariest movie of all time"" This movie did not even come close to its name. The first problem was the camera view which was taken from the perspective of somebody videotaping the whole time, had the same problem as the movie Clover field, shaky camera, distorted view of the whole set. The second problem was that it was just not scary, period. Over 45 minutes into the movie I was still waiting for something remotely frightening to happen. Most of the scenes were taken in the bedroom, where the sheets would move, or the door would close, lights would go on, I was expecting levitation, sounds, shadows etc or maybe even the appearance of the demon, i have seen scarier things on the discovery channel. Most of the time the ""paranormal activity"" would happen out of the shot, leaving the viewer staring at a empty bedroom for several minutes. The biggest flaw of all was the commercial, everything that would even be considered remotely frightening was seen in the commercials. So all in all this movie will make you jump a few times due to startling sounds, but fails in comparison to other films of the same genre, it even fails in comparison to the ghost show on discovery, to be honest that show does a much better job of actually frightening the viewers."

","It's funny, before I was going to watch this movie, people were telling me ""don't watch it alone, it's so scary!"" Ha! I am a fan of the paranormal and ghost stories. I like being scared. Fear is a wonderful thing because it challenges you to be brave. So when I heard that this movie was scary, I had to watch it.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go through what the movie is about fully, but it's basically two annoying people recording creepy things happening in their house. So annoying, at times I had to mute my TV and look away. Half the film consists of Katie and Micah drinking coffee and brushing their teeth and talking about stupid things and blah blah blah WHO CARES! Show the damn scary parts already! Yeesh! Overall the film is not that scary. I will admit I got spooked a bit at the end, that's about it. If you don't believe in ghosts, this won't make you a believer. In fact, this might actually make you even more of a non-believer. A skeptic would laugh through out the film. Even I did and I'm not s skeptic. Getting pulled from your bed and dragged across the house, HA! The best part of the film is Katie's breasts, and I am being serious here. If it weren't for her breasts and the ending, this film gets a 1/10 from me."

I remember seeing previews that showed people in the theater jumping with fright. I don't think I jumped once. In fact, I remember distinctly being incredibly bored and confused by this film!

I am not a die-hard horror fan but I do enjoy a good suspenseful scare.<br/><br/>And that is not what Paranormal Activity is, interesting yes, but scary no. While the acting was sometimes good it was mostly bland and it didn't seem realistic at all. The few exceptions to this were a couple of the ""action"" scenes in which I could actually emphasize with the characters.<br/><br/>If you want a good scare then in my opinion try Signs, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or The Village.

Being a trooper, went along.<br/><br/>Story~Found footage of a couple battling an entity.<br/><br/>Knowing that this took place entirely inside the same house and involving 2 main characters really made me want to stare clear. How much horror could be expected ? Maybe Micha and Katie would have a slew of guests and/or relatives over ?!?!?!? Would have been nice but no....We're stuck with 2 annoying people. That means 1 thing; TONS OF LIP FLAPPING ! HUGE FLAW ! Reasons for the lip flapping, only way to stretch the movie out. Not enough characters for the demon to snatch or invade.

Nothing happens for 80 odd minutes. How much money is 15-20 minutes of night noises suppose to cost ? 2 ''stars'', 1 location, no MTV soundtrack, minimal equipment....any more than $15,000 and the producers would have gotten ripped off.

"cegiles","3","2","3","22 January 2010"," Boring from the beginning
","In reading some of the reviews of this movie I am aghast that it scared so many people. I found myself laughing through most of this because of the absurd antics of this young couple. Especially the boyfriend character.<br/><br/>My main issue is this style of movie making that consists of all hand-held camera shots from consumer products that is supposed to convey a sense that we are watching actual real-time footage. Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield used the same style with similar disappointing results. As with Cloverfield, are you telling me that as strange events occur around you, you cannot put that camera down for a bit to figure out what is going on? <br/><br/>The boyfriend tells us, he is going to use this camera to catch on tape ""proof that strange events are really happening"". Hence, we have to sit through the couple eating, getting ready for bed, the boyfriend playing guitar alone, the couple arguing, and my two favorites - when the psychic visits we find the boyfriend at one end of the room filming the scene and not comforting his girlfriend during an obviously vulnerable moment for her, and when the boyfriend is editing his footage he is taping himself doing it? <br/><br/>The character development left me wondering why, if this woman is a student, we never see her studying until the end of the movie; what does the boyfriend do because he is always home during the day; doesn't the boyfriend have any friends; when the demon kills the boyfriend it has to carry him upstairs and throw him in the bedroom? <br/><br/>To sum up, I love scary movies. My personal favorite being The Haunting from 1963. I will never watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose again because that freaked me out for about four months. So when I find that movies like this one are scaring people it surely makes me wonder how? Too many plot holes and poorly developed characters and a filming style that is unrealistic.<br/><br/>I also want my money back!"

I'm not joking here.<br/><br/>Wow. We truly have become a nation of morons. Maybe the first clue that it wasn't real was the title itself? I give up.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film was pedestrian obviously. But that's what you get for 15K. Kudos to Oren Peli for scoring such a hit nonetheless. Hope my fellow San Diegan pocketed some serious cash.<br/><br/>Not a big fan of these types of hand held Blair Witch sort of things. And the audio almost made me turn it off in the first few minutes. Micah in particular is really hard to understand.<br/><br/>With that said, I found the whole thing rather comical, particularly the predictable escalation of events. Then again, I suppose to truly be scared by a movie like this, well, maybe you're one of those people coming into your local Blockbuster asking the clerks if it was real. Good grief people."

","I was minimally scared watching this movie. I agree with some of the other comments about how this movie was WAY over-hyped. I would say the last few minutes were somewhat scary, but the movie as a whole was laughable. The the woman playing the main character was annoying, and you could tell she has limited acting experience-I guess you have to start somewhere though. This movie does not come close to being a horror film, or ""scary"" movie-so I'm not sure how they could advertise it as so. I will say it was ""ok"" to watch, but the script was dry, it needed more of the ""scare"" factor throughout the movie-not just the last 20 min or so. I especially liked the tag lines for the movie-Don't see it alone, and Don't go alone-you're kidding me right. The concept of the film is good though, but there weren't many ""scary"" parts, that's why I give it a 3 out of 10."

","Just as it was the case with ""The Blair Witch Project"" a decade ago this horror mockumentary is clearly a matter of love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the earlier pic despite its flaws and I've got the same opinion about this scary little shocker. (Yes, it IS scary! Don't listen to all those desensitized film geeks who get their kicks from chainsaw massacres and the likes.) I agree, the character actions are entirely too dependent on the visual and local limitations and thus seem partly forced and loose, and basically the script's just playing with old-hat spooky house clichés.<br/><br/>But the narrative arc is quite effective, the central issue is treated with a certain inner logic, the performances are natural and the sparse use of special effects and gore is welcome in times of mindless slasher trash.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 footsteps in the dark"
"alastair-51","1","2","3","9 January 2010"," Scary? I was suckered in too.
","Rarely do I review films on this site. A film has to be particularly amazing or particularly bad for me to go to the time and trouble to post a review. Unfortunately Paranormal Activity belongs in the latter category.<br/><br/>I had heard a little of hype about this film but hadn't fully bought into it. I thought this could be a fun film to watch, and something to get me out of my seat. I spent the entire film waiting for the excitement, drama and fear to build up. I was utterly disappointed when it finished and murmurs of ""I want my money back!"" was heard throughout the cinema.<br/><br/>I don't claim to be any kind of Internet Tough Guy or that nothing scares me, but the reviews on IMDb about this film claiming this to be even remotely scary, I can only assume they were written by the marketing team of this film. I am absolutely serious when I say this film was not in the slightest bit scary. The final scene did make me jump a little, but much in the way you jump at some of the spooky clips on youtube. The difference is those youtube clips didn't cost me $16.<br/><br/>It looked to be quite professionally produced for the budget, and some of the ""scary"" special effects were well executed but beyond that, I can't say anything positive about this film. Watch it on DVD or download it, but save your money for something else at the cinema."

","When I saw previews for this movie, it looked like it had some potential. Then I heard it was pretty much the same idea as the Blair Witch Project. Well, I watched it anyway, despite the *glory* that was the aforementioned film.<br/><br/>In case you somehow happened across this review without any prior knowledge of what Paranormal Activity is about, here it is in a nutshell: It's about a couple experiencing strange happenings where they live, mainly while they are sleeping. They decide to film what is going on in the house and the movie is meant to give the feel of watching a home video.<br/><br/>Although I didn't predict everything that would happen in the movie, nothing was unexpected. Just because this movie isn't a cheap scream-in-the-camera fest doesn't make it an original concept. In fact, I would go out on a twiggy little limb here and say that there was practically no originality, just a lot of reasons to compare it to The Blair Witch Project (sorry I brought that up again).<br/><br/>I've seen much scarier movies than this, scary movies that made me pee all over myself because I was too afraid to get up to go to the bathroom. Paranormal Activity didn't make my heart skip a beat or make me jump even once and it left my undergarments clean enough to wear for at least another day.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, Disney's Pinnochio was scarier than this. Remember the donkey scene? Terrifying! This... not so much.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity does deserve some credit, though, since I did actually get through the entire movie even if it was just to see if anything exciting finally happened. Not that I wanted to, but I can't even say I was disappointed, only that I wasn't surprised."

","There was not one moment in this film that was the least bit scary. Just two people (Katie and Micah) who live together in a nice house that is haunted by some type of demon that wants to have its way with Katie. The film is only 88 minutes long but it took forever to make it's point. Micah follows his girlfriend around with his camera in the house so that he can document a possible presence that might be there. A presence that is trying to reach or possess Katie. They set up the camera at night while they sleep with the door to the bedroom open. At first I was ready to be really scared but then nothing happened. Then the next night they set up the camera again...the door slowly moves a little and then its morning again. Only in the last 15 minutes or so does something really start to happen with Katie being pulled out of bed and dragged out into the hallway screaming and ghostly footprints showing up on the floor. Also there would be sounds of someone walking around the house at night while they sleep with doors closing, and old photos of Katie being found in the attic that Katie claims should not be up there. Kind of reminded me a little of the Blair Witch Project only indoors. But why was the demon trying to get to Katie? It is never really explained except that it was mentioned that she has had these experiences in the past and it is now again coming back. There are several attempts to reach the demon with a Ouija board and even a demonologist coming to the house but nothing happens except the Ouija board catching on fire and the demonologist says the demon wants him out and he never comes back. I will not give up the ending except to say it had no shock value and provided only a cheap thrill."

I find it hard to believe that anyone is gullible enough to believe this garbage anyhow, but even worse is those who think it is ORIGINAL. It is nothing more than a poor remake of a great movie (The Entity - 1981) with Barbara Hershey, that actually showed some creativity, had a believable script and was more than a ""one thought"" endeavor. That there are enough people willing to waste their money to sit through a movie like this will never cease to amaze me.

"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","3","18 December 2009"," The mouths were wrong...
","For the life of me I can't understand how this film generated such good word of mouth. No doubt if the stuff that happens in this film happened to you in real life you'd be scared witless. Doors open and close in the middle of the night, loud bangs disturb the peace in the dead of night, hapless victims are dragged by their ankle from their bed as they sleep – it would be enough to drive you crazy with fear. Trouble is, when you transfer all this to the big screen and use Blair Witch-style home video recordings to show it all, it all comes across as a little 'so'what?' <br/><br/>It doesn't help that Micah, the boyfriend of Katie, the girl with her own demonic stalker, is the kind of smug idiot who films himself strumming the guitar and seems intent on irritating whatever it is that his girlfriend has bought into the house at every opportunity. He films everything, and ignores her repeated and increasingly short-tempered pleas to switch the damn thing off, and he prolongs arguments by refusing to answer questions with answers. Together, they're the kind of couple you might enjoy seeing once or twice a year, but any more and you'd really start looking for ways to avoid them, regardless of whether their demon was in tow. Add to the fact that they refuse to take the obvious steps any normal person would take, and you end up being too irritated with them to care what fate awaits. I know if the demonologist the ghost guy had recommended couldn't make it the first thing I'd do is rustle up a small army of parapsychologists (or whatever those crackpots are called) on the basic principle that there's safety (and comfort) in numbers. I'd phone the local TV station too, and the local papers. But these two bozos seem to be cocooned in a world of their own and choose to simply tough it out alone when the demon guy is out of town for a couple of days.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film's well-made on a tiny budget, and the two leads perform well, but that's about all it's got going for it. When the film finished the audience in the cinema remained rooted in their seats, not because they were terrified or stunned by what they had seen, but because they weren't quite sure whether the film was actually over or not. It's the only time I've ever known an entire audience (although it was pretty small, admittedly) sit through the credits and the minute or so of blank screen that followed waiting for some after-credits clip to somehow make it all worth while. Only when the lights came on and we all blinked at each other with a kind of bemused disbelief that we'd actually sat through the entire film did we begin to file dejectedly from the theatre."

I've been more scared and creeped out watching Ghost Hunters and, for that matter, Ghostbusters. My new way of judging whether I can be someone's friend or not will be to find out how they felt about this movie. If they liked it I just can't hang out with them. I'm shocked and dismayed by the comments and reviews left here about this waste of time. Did only people under the age of 12 see this so-called movie? If you really want to be scared by a film check out ""The Entity"" with Barbara Hershey. Oh, and I was so glad she killed that jerk in the end, what a d-bag he was to her through the whole movie."

","Very disappointing after all the hype it received and all the brilliant reviews. The people I went to see it with, were disappointed too, and thought it was completely awful.<br/><br/>The film is put together quite intelligently, I like the home-video idea, builds up well, starts off with little things which then lead to actual physical 'damage', but it doesn't stop it from being quite boring most of the time. I sat there thinking 'ok, something seriously scary will happen now and I will feel the need to swear loudly'. I was just getting my hopes up, unfortunately. I did not jump once. I just sat there looking at the time in the corner of the screen. Waiting. I think it needed more tension. I know that the footage from the everyday life was a key part to the film in a way, but I just felt that even though the everyday life/peaceful night footage was shown, and the sense of vulnerability was present, I also had to question myself why the characters made some of the decisions they had made. Why choose the worst possible option? Ouija board? And again, at the beginning you do feel the tension. After a while, the footage is just repetitive and you are not on the edge of your seat anymore.<br/><br/>Micah and Katie are very believable asthemselves in the film. They're not actors trying to play OTT characters that feature in most horrors, they are just a young couple with the exception of Katie being haunted by a demon. I think the fact that it wasn't scripted helped greatly-it really feels like a documentary.<br/><br/>Yes. I did see the ending coming from quite early on.<br/><br/>SIt wasn't too good. I have to say, I didn't mind watching it, it was mildly entertaining. But I didn't get what all the reviewers and critics promised me-the scariest film ever made.

","After so much ado, and though I am not an habitué at horror movies, I went to see it, and I came out convinced that if such a monumental bore has had such success it must be due to the times of great emotional distress and susceptibilities we are going through. The movie is essentially a monumental bore, dull,filmed in the way of 'cam on hand' type,a couple trying to film the alleged paranormal phenomena taking place in their home. These phenomena are indeed quite sparse, restricted to a few thumps and footsteps,and one or two other minor effects,which I don't reveal in order not to reveal spoilers which might spoil those few unaware of the film's boredom that might want to go watch this monumental barbiturate of a movie. I couldn't really go into further detail, since I slept through the last third of the picture.By this I don't mean it doesn't have a good starting point: taking advantage of the subconscious fear of the dark, those noises we hear in our own homes, etc. But the final product doesn't work: what really diminishes and mines it's credibility is the way it was filmed,with the camera jolting all the time, and the absolute ineptness and inefficacy of the actors, of whom I read great reviews saying they are allegedly natural, but to me of amateurish awkwardness, especially the female character, of the young hysterical type of woman during her menstruation, and whose performance robs the movie of any of it's credibility. So little is the movie credible, that when I finally woke up at the end, because of a final major thud, I laughed my heart out, since the epilogue is the major joke(no one seriously believes that what is written on the epilogue really happened!) One of the worst films I've ever seen, and frankly, by the reaction of those in the room, I was thoroughly convinced that most of them agreed with me; besides I didn't hear in the room any reaction similar to that shown on trailers which included images of the spectators reacting to the film. I can't understand the success of this picture other than caused by an excellent marketing campaign, and because of the times we are living,when everybody seems to be emotionally unstable and impressed by these lacklustre stories or those of vampires with very little interesting points other than the bodies and alleged physical beauty of the young actors and actresses peopling those movies. My final advise is to go see something else and spend your money in something far more interesting, or if you want to overcome a sleepless night, just go get there and sleep all through this monumental bore!"

","The film is a cheap rip-off of 'The Others' and 'The Exorcist' done in the style of the Blair Witch Project which while not good is far better than this film. The film held no surprises, the acting was poor especially the dialogue which is worse than Blair Witch Project when it comes to characters randomly saying the f-word. It is terribly clichéd, especially how the characters are always ridiculously 'over-curious.' When it turns into the Exorcist in the final third it just turns completely ridiculous and while the ending nearly made me fall out of my seat I felt cheated by it and ultimately made it an even worse experience. Steven Spielberg came up with the ending and while this shows i'm sure he can then direct horror better than the real director Oren Peli but it belonged in another movie and felt out of place. It runs for an hour and a half and quite frankly in the first hour I was completely bored. It has been terribly over-hyped."

Not seeing what was going on was a very positive way of telling a haunting story you imagine your own fears in replacement to this.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity uses these same techniques only it mixes them in the wrong way, it bumbles along for the best part building up, back-story etc which is fine with me as long as it has something it's building to, something to deliver.<br/><br/>This is where it fails. It brings in elements that were un-necessary (won't elaborate as to spoil) and almost brings in ideas that weren't thought of at the beginning, making it feel like it really was made up as it went along. OK so maybe it should feel like it's made up but watch the film you'll see no structure was pulled together at all and it is still a film, which should hold some sort of narrative even if it is supposed to be real footage.<br/><br/>Not to give away the ending, i really must say i didn't see it coming, simply because there was no cause for it to happen it came out of nowhere and just left it there, so ye i really didn't see it coming and was more blundered by the ""what the hell was that"" factor not shocking not anything. Almost like the director said ""hey! hurry up and end this we're running out of battery"" I really like to see small films do really well and can't blame the success of this film, though i think this is highly due to the marketing not so much word of mouth. There are many ways i would have done this film different but as you'll read above i know the industry and i know how to make films so i'll always look at it from a different perspective than the average cinema goer. So perhaps i'm wrong on all aspects.<br/><br/>As far as i'm concerned this film was marketed well and didn't pull any punches not nearly as much as was promoted, not scary on any level and fell flat. though i still expect a sequel this is Hollywood cash cow now."
"Scarecrow-88","6","2","3","28 November 2009"," Paranormal Activity
","Paranormal Activity concerns a supernatural presence, perhaps demonic, terrorizing a couple, not married, with them recording the events on camera. We are privy to the footage and see how the presence consumes their life until it has what it so desires.<br/><br/>While I do agree that Paranormal Activity is little more than a glorified you-tube video, I can't completely dismiss it because it has some genuine spooks here and there. I do admit to finding it a bit tiresome after a while, there were others in the theater where I went to see it who were quite gripped and frightened out of their wits as the ""ooga booga"" moments transpire, pretty much late at night and early in the morning as the camera allows us to see the evil with effects like thuds, loud noises, shadows, wind brushing hair, sheets moving, lights going on and off, with other supernatural hi-jinx plaguing the couple, Michah(a day trader)and college student girlfriend Katie(Katie Featherston). Katie foretells how she has always been afflicted by this mysterious presence, no matter where she moves to, it follows. A psychic(Mark Fredrichs)attempts to provide advice, but it's his opinion that the thing living among them is demonic, and his expertise are more towards haunting. He provides them with the phone number of a demonologist, but Micah pooh-poohs such an idea as calling such a person. In not doing so, as we see what kind of influence Micah has over her, Katie may've put herself at greater risk regarding not seeking the assistance of the demonologist. Micah is sure he can keep Katie safe, not knowing truly what they're up against.<br/><br/>While the predator is indeed the supernatural presence, Katie it's prey, Micah is surely the antagonist. Micah seems excited about the idea of recording such a fiend on tape, not knowing that the camcorder is assisting in motivating the evil presence to continue, and it does grow more and more confident and powerful. We start to see Katie changing, behavioral shifts, and strange instances where she moves from the bed, as if controlled by something else, just standing, looking down at Micah, even leaving the house not under her own accord, remembering nothing. Perhaps if they had contacted the demonologist sooner(..a later call is in vain for he had left the country and the psychic would not remain in their home due to it's strength in power for which he felt immediately), help could've been provided to Katie.<br/><br/>The fact is, Micah is a prick. The camcorder is always on even when Katie's in a devastated condition, her emotional state in turmoil. He wants everything on tape and will go to extreme lengths in order to do so. Late into Paranormal Activity, Katie's visibly shaken and deeply traumatized, and it's only when the presence may've taken control of her that Micah opts to leave. Riding the coattails of The Blair Witch Project(..they resemble in fascinating ways), PA takes the ""shot on tape"" approach, capturing strange goings-on, as those affected by the evil, psychologically and otherwise, lose control, after what seems like an amusing joke where the ""participants"" aren't very serious about what they're up against. Katie, to her credit, does take the evil seriously, and she's the one who falls victim, thanks to the man she loves. Micah treats it as an amusement park ride, toying with an evil which will upend him in the end for his handling of this entire situation costs them dearly."

The characters are very believable and their escalation with the demonic spirit is quite fun to watch.
While the film didn't scare me often when it did it worked a lot better than most horror films I've seen within the last couple of years
My biggest complaint is the ending. The end jump scare and face morph just put me in an automatic negative mood. The idea of Micha getting killed was fine I just think his body getting thrown (as a jump scare) then another jump scare just makes it feel like they slipped together an ending in 10 minutes.
To clarify I think the ending is great but the way they presented it was weak in my opinion
Overall I can respect this movie and really see why it paved the way for more found footage films and became the second film to really push this version of the horror genre"

","""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those movies that you either love or hate I presume. It has amassed a huge cult following over the years. But to me personally this movie just didn't deliver. It was, dare I say, the most boring movie I've ever seen. Most of the time nothing happens and you're basically just watching a couple do mundane things. I guess one could argue that it makes the movie more ""realistic"". As the movie progressed the acting performances didn't quite attest to the supposed realism of the movie. What I mean by that is that there were a handful of scenes where the protagonists seemed to hold back a grin. As if they realized how ridiculous certain scenes were. Just to be fair about it; the acting wasn't the worst I've ever seen but it surely wasn't the best either. More on the weaker side of things. <br/><br/>The finale of the movie aka the ending did spook me with two consecutive jump scares but still. By that time I've already given up on the movie since it made me feel like I just wasted a significant amount of time (that could've been invested in a more meaningful way).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The Blaire Witch project is apparently the only good movie that ever emerged from the ""found footage"" genre. Together with ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"", that is."
"lunchboxattacks","9","1","1","11 March 2017"," Possibly the most frightening film I have ever seen.
","And the title of my review isn't hyperbole. I've seen a lot of the horrors that would be considered essential viewing for a fan of the genre. That is, The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, The Shining, The Ring et. al. The list would be too long to go through here, but you get the idea. All very good, but none have haunted me in quite the way the original Paranormal Activity did. All of the above I have seen more than once. More than a few times, really, but no longer would I have to brace myself in order to sit through a late night viewing of the films on the list of horror films that would commonly be considered seminal. Except for Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>It's easy to forget in the wake of the franchise it spawned just how good and how effective the original was. Where the sequels eventually went the route of CGI and cheap scares, the original relies on that brooding tension. That fear of the unknown. Simply put, the original PA has that ability to put across to the viewer the terror that a malevolent but unseen entity is inflicting in the home of a young couple and almost puts it into the room with us. We get to witness as they become increasingly fearful and mentally unraveled as events unfold. As things become increasingly sinister and bizarre in this home. <br/><br/>I saw it back in 2009. Being that it is 2017 at the time of this writing and I'm still compelled to write a review, you can tell it has stayed with me."
"zkonedog","5","1","1","10 March 2017"," Slides By On Interesting Concept
","After being told that ""Paranormal Activity"" was the ""next big thing"" in horror movies (in line with The Ring and Saw), I wanted to experience the phenomena first-hand. Unfortunately, despite the film's knack for making you continue to watch just to ""see what happens"", it left me disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a young married couple who begin experiencing some strange phenomena once their heads hit the pillow at night. It starts with little things, like creaky noises and bumps in the night, but eventually escalates into footsteps, moving sheets, and slamming doors...too obvious to be anything ""naturally occurring"". The young couple then must decide what to do next...run away, or stay and fight this invisible force.<br/><br/>The interesting angle of this movie is that it is shot in a format not seen since The Blair Witch Project...handy-cam (for lack of a better word). However, the manic flailings of ""Blair Witch"" are tamed down this time into a simple camera on a tripod recording all the action. Whereas most traditional horror movies try to scare you with disfigured antagonists or bursts of well-timed creepy music, this effort just lets the ""camera do the talking"". It is a very unique way of creating suspense, and thus at least held my interest until the very end.<br/><br/>The big problem, though, is two-fold: repetition and incredible annoying characters. Every night, the same thing happens: a noise startles the man, who curses a few times, which wakes up his wife, who pleads with him not to go downstairs (which he always does anyway). That same sequence happens literally every night until the very end of the film. It doesn't help that both characters (played by Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat) do nothing but annoy each other (and thus the audience) for the duration. Micah treats the whole ordeal as a joke, even when the visual evidence is too much to deny, while Katie is reduced to little more than a scream-machine (albeit a very attractive one).<br/><br/>Thus, although Paranormal Activity is indeed a novel way to create a horror film, I can't wholly recommend it due to the shallow characters and repetitive plot. Up until the final couple of minutes, the plot is so tired and slow as to almost be boring at times. Let's just say that when PA 2 premieres this October, I won't be in the theater."

But I guess that's just it: A lot of viewers don't get anything at all out of a movie that was cheaply produced and doesn't have a lot of special effects, gore or monsters.<br/><br/>Then there are the others like me: In the back of my head I seem to believe in demons, because this movie left me with the deep conviction that I'm not safe in my own house and in my own bed anymore. I didn't sleep well for a number of nights after having seen it. That's all I have to say because most of the rest there is to be said about this film is common knowledge.

Katie Featherston sleeps uneasy with an unwanted presence about. Her boyfriend Micah Slout doesn't take her seriously but experiments by setting up a camera to monitor their sleep. Doors open and shut. Lights flicker on. Katie emerges in sudden trances she cannot recall. Directed by Oren Peli with creepy lighting. What is truly interesting is how little is needed to render effect here. No big effects or a blood bath. Just a creepy sensation. Katie and Micah are believable as they attempt to figure this out. Katie gradually descends from a conscious state while Slout provides a good dose of comic relief. The film leaves amble opportunity for a sequel, which seems to be the kicker for these films. The only memorable supporting player is Mark Fredrichs as a psychic who takes the hint during his second visit. On the negative side one wonders why they wouldn't populate the rooms with a large party of people or call authorities? They had the evidence. And if all else fails, why not just leave? It would seem like the logical reaction to finding sh*t moved around and having your sleep disturbed by demonic home wrecking. Perhaps this film is only going for the scares over logic. We can at least give it that. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","The film begins with Adam Carolla as Micah and Monica Lewinsky as Katie living together in a well lit San Diego suburban home. He plays a blue electric guitar which is not hooked up to an amp. She knits. They continue doing boring things throughout the entire film. He is recording their goings on, trying to capture proof of paranormal activity so that he might figure out and fix the problem. He's handy like that and if he can't fix it... at least it's been a learning experience. She calls a ghost hunter who tells them they have demons, he can't help but gives them the number of a demon hunter who can. As the ghost hunter leaves Micah rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath something about, ""and the horse you rode in on.""<br/><br/>Katie wants to call the demon hunter but Micah insists that he can handle it, his house, his girlfriend, his demon... This is where a boring movie gets stupid. Little by little paranormal stuff happens, Micah show Katie zero respect and she being the ever obedient girlfriend (I mean aren't all girlfriends obedient?) whines but goes along with his excellent plan which he never explains. And things get worse.<br/><br/>When this film came out there was hype and comparisons to The Blaire Witch Project. I believe demons exist. I believe that many of the events that happened in this movie could actually happen in the real world. Go ahead and laugh (I wish I could have at least laughed during this flick) but I actually think I've had a demonic experience in my life and no, it would not make a good movie!<br/><br/>Nothing was scary about this movie. I imagine if you saw it in a theater filled with morons that the energy of combined stupidity might make someone afraid, but that's it. In the theater I didn't find The Blaire Witch Project frightening. It was afterward thinking about the film, thinking about the nature of evil as a living force, and appreciating the way the story was put together that allowed me to like the film. Paranormal Activity only makes me wonder why? Nothing was good about it. It was poop. As the movie continues it is no longer well lit and in fact ends in blackness. The use of light in this movie was (I want to say retarded here... like they thought they were so clever... instead I'm just going to stop). Adam Carolla's body was found several days later.

"masterandcommander","4","1","1","20 December 2012"," Entertaining but far from anything special
","First of all, there is no concept or premise for a film that can't be done well. The trick is what you do with that concept. The problem with Paranormal Activity is that it simply does not do anything with its concept. Furthermore, it does not have strong enough presentation to transcend its lack of originality. For these reasons the movie is fundamentally unoriginal and approaches gimmick.<br/><br/>""Found footage"" is usually used sparingly in most movies for good reason: it is hard to film an entire movie in this fashion without growing repetitive or sluggish in its pacing. Some of the movies that used this successfully were Cloverfield and obviously Blair Witch. Cloverfield brought the concept of ""found footage"" to ""godzilla"" and it managed to work as something that had not been tried before. Blair Witch had the advantage of being the pioneer that brought this concept to the mainstream so it felt ""fresh"". Paranormal Activity draws attention to the found footage, and beg questions like ""WHY DO THEY NEVER TURN THE CAMERA OFF?"" or ""WHO TOOK THE TIME TO EDIT THIS?""<br/><br/>The actors are not particularly good or bad. Since you are watching these characters for the duration of the movie, this does not bode well. In order to keep an audience entertained by watching two people talk the entire movie, the performances need to be exemplary. These actors, simply are not exemplary.<br/><br/>Watching this movie for what it does without any preconceptions I thought it began well and ultimately did nothing special. In fact, it did a few things very poorly. <br/><br/>There are no themes to glean from this movie. There is no point. There are no memorable performances. The camera-work is intentionally poorly done. The only element that was well implemented was the sound. It is a safe bet that the only reason this movie is so successful is that the human instinct to jump at loud noises still works. At least the creators understood this concept and used it to their advantage.<br/><br/>The characters have no depth. I don't know what either of them do except get tormented by demonic forces. I remember the guy was a day-trader. There is no past revealed to either character except that the lead has been possessed her entire life anyways. The only personality trait is foolish aggression on the part of the boyfriend, who actually does nothing with this aggression except yell on occasion. This is the greatest flaw of the movie. When you have characters with no personality, no depth, no arc, and they are played by amateur actors, it is virtually impossible to make the viewer care about their plight. It actually magnifies their stupidity because it is the only thing we are presented with.<br/><br/>This movie is sort of like a glorified haunted house ride. You sit down and wait for loud things to happen. Once they happen they don't exactly make sense and there is no rhyme or reason as to how everything fits together. You jump, and then wait for the next scare. You hop off the ride with your heart pounding for a few seconds, and then you go buy some cotton candy. Yet, there is nothing truly disturbing about the experience, and the only thing that scared you was the anticipation of hopping on a ""scary"" ride that is actually not scary on its own without the reputation it carries.<br/><br/>There are innumerable problems with this movie's internal logic. It would be one thing if the movie did not delve into what made the ""villain"" work. However, the entire movie seems to be about two people trying to figure out what this supposed demon is trying to do. They scour the internet and hire ghost whisperers making the audience pay a little too much attention to the details rather than the atmosphere.<br/><br/>For a movie that is attempting to rely on the fear of the unknown, way to much emphasis is placed on the ""lore"" or ""mythology"" about demons which only exposes how little the filmmakers actually know about such beings. If the demon's desire was simply to possess the lead character, no tangible reason is presented for why it insists on blowing doors closed, rustling covers, or walking around the house for no understandable reason. If the demon is trying to take over a soul it does not stand to gain anything by dragging its subject's body around the house. The only questions this raises is why none of the characters think to even arm themselves.<br/><br/>Unlike superior movies in this genre like the Exorcist where the demon's goal is to cause humans to despair, this demon doesn't seem to know what it wants. In fact, neither do the main characters. It would seem obvious that these characters would not want to be possessed, yet, they both seem very content to coax the enemy into attacking them further without becoming anymore creative than placing some dust around the house.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie has some good moments. Yet, these moments take a long time to arrive and when they do it leaves the audience with no reason as to why they did not happen sooner.<br/><br/>This movie can certainly be entertaining for its jump scares. Yet, this movie can't offer anything else than cheap thrills. It is perhaps a classic example of style over substance. It is simply madness with no method. The only impressive thing is that, after numerous sequels, the creators still have not done anything new with the material.<br/><br/>My subjective breakdown of the movie's major elements: Cinematography 5/10 Editing 2/10 Art Direction 5/10 Sound 8/10 Special Effects 6/10 Acting 6/10 Pacing 2/10 Characters 2/10 Theme 1/10 Overall 4/10"

","I'm afraid that this is one occasion when the hype surrounding a film did it a great disservice. All this business of 'don't watch it alone' and 'the scariest film ever' is so much tripe. I love good supernatural horror films - and I enjoyed Blair Witch and Cloverfield. This is not a patch on either. Personally I got fed up with all the screaming and door slamming and found the couple irritating. There are one or two half decent moments, but it really doesn't have enough to scare. A much better film of this kind - and one that is TRULY SCARY - is 'The Entity' with Barbara Hershey. When it comes to a house haunting by an invisible force, 'The Entity' is light years ahead of 'Paranormal Activity'. I can't believe they have actually made two sequels of this nonsense."
"kaptaind","4","1","1","11 December 2010"," More Disturbing Than Scary
","Apparently, I'm psychologically susceptible to the ""reality cinema"" style. I rented this movie from Netflix and watched it last night at home by myself. I missed all of the viral marketing buzz and hype about it when it first came out, so I didn't know that it was supposed to be an ""astounding"" horror film. I didn't have any real expectations before I watched.<br/><br/>So I watched it, and then went to IMDb afterward to see what other people thought of it. I have to say that reading all of the reviews trashing this movie is fun. I never knew there were so many clever ways to say that a movie stinks! I won't try to write one of those reviews, as there are so many already.<br/><br/>Basically, I have to agree with them. Overall, this move is a mess. There is minimal character development and minimal plot development. The storyline is so fragmented and underdeveloped that it's almost non-existent. The dialog is lame and mostly consists of the lead couple yelling at each other. Like all stock horror movie characters, the couple inexplicably does one stupid thing after another that puts them further in harm's way, and fails to do obvious things that might give them more safety and more control over whatever they're dealing with. If I were judging the movie on those attributes alone, I would give it a ""0.1"".<br/><br/>And yet, I have to admit that the movie did succeed in giving me the creeps. It didn't ""scare"" me but it definitely got under my skin. A lot of reviewers here have said that the movie isn't scary at all. If it were a ""standard"" horror film, not reality cinema, I'd completely agree. Except for a couple of incidents towards the end of the film, nothing truly ""scary"" happens, and even those scary incidents in themselves are pretty trite by horror movie standards. Even my eyes rolled at some of the ""paranormal activity"" such as the scene where the Ouija board catches fire. And yet, taken as a whole, the movie really did creep me out.<br/><br/>I guess it must be the reality cinema that hooks me. And that's strange, because I really don't like that movie style. The shaky and omnipresent camera is annoying, and the visual frame gets claustrophobic way before the movie ends. But, at least this time, it worked on me. If this were a standard horror movie, its paranormal activity scenes would be laughably lame. But the reality cinema style puts me in the frame of mind where I feel like I'm watching something that's happening in real life. And if this stuff was happening to me in real life, especially in the middle of the night, I'm sure I'd be ""on edge"".<br/><br/>So, in fairness, even though I think the movie is bad overall, I have to give at least a few stars. Also, I have to give the actors some credit too. Other reviewers have trashed their performances, but I think they did as good as a job as just about any professional actor would have, given the dialog and script they had to work with. I thought the male lead, Micah, was especially convincing as the cocky, grown-up frat boy who thinks he can take any problem by the balls. Too bad he couldn't have done that to the writer and director. And the female lead, Katie, lets loose the most blood-curdling screams I've ever heard. <br/><br/>My recommendation is, if you're susceptible to the reality cinema style like I am, and you enjoy a movie that creeps you out more than bludgeons you, go ahead and watch it, preferably alone and in the dark."

","What a huge disappointment. There I was, expecting a scary film which would stay with me so that, when lying in bed, I'd ensure my feet are under the duvet and worry about 'bumps in the night'.<br/><br/>How could it fail? It's a simple idea, a haunting recorded on camera. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Well, for starters, it had the feel of an over-produced amateur effort, maybe by a film school student. Secondly, Katie Featherston is a terrible actress, completely unable to convey any sense of empathy with her character and I wouldn't be surprised if she was reading her lines from the underside of cups, etc, in a subtle effort to hide the fact she couldn't remember them. And, in a film which only features 2 people (the parapsy is hardly in it) that is a real problem - there's no hiding for her. Thirdly, they obviously shot too high. A plain, old fashioned haunting was called for. All this 'demon' stuff was pointless and tacky. Fourthly, in dealing with a film about bumps in the night SUBTLETY is called for. It's all about the imagination doing the work. THe crescendo through the film is OK, but the final scene just wasn't scary, I'd had enough by then. Fifthly, WAS the end supposed to be scary? He runs downstairs into the pitch black but she does away with him without a fight? . And 'She's still missing'. Right. And that's immediately before the screen telling us it's all fictitious. Tacky, clichéd and boring. We know know she killed him with a knife, right? So THANK GOODNESS she didn't rip his face off with her teeth, or pull his heart of of his chest with her hand, etc etc, all those other things that would have been EVEN WORSE...<br/><br/>And, while I think about it, what the hell is that about the powder and what looked to me at least to be hoof-marks?! As if the 'demon' is just invisible, but otherwise has a physical presence?! It's the kind of story a child would come up with.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the plot worked anyway. In a film where the answer is staring the participants in the face - the Church - the whole subject of exorcism is all but ignored. Instead they draft in a parapsy who is of no use and, even more sadly, the only other person who could help them is away. Right. The only other person. There's no one else, is there? A Priest? Or just look in the phone book? Equally, the protagonists persist in doing things which are contrary to common sense but necessary to drive the story forward. <br/><br/>So disappointing."
"geniuskentyk-1","6","1","1","9 July 2010"," Doesn't live up to the hype
","I expected too much out of Paranormal, that, despite it being a decent movie, I left the theater disappointed. I expected to be frightened and to s*** in my pants, but that didn't happen. I appreciated how different the movie was, and how the director used small, but clever scare tactics, being his first film and all; good thing this wasn't a Hollywood movie, too! That would've ruined it. The movie had wonderful actors, and the couple had realistic chemistry with one another. The thing I didn't like, though, was the fact that the movie was too slow trying to get to the scary moments. The slow parts dragged my patience for so long that I ended up bored for most of the 'scary' moments. Lots of people in the audience freaked out (mostly the women) and hollered at the scary moments, but I didn't', and I'm not that hard to scare. Most of the audience laughed during the scary moments, because everyone expected to be scared out of their minds. Yeah, the movie was funny, because of the guy, Micah, and his humorous attitude, but after a while, I stopped laughing. The best part of the movie, though, is the final act. Things really started to pick up near the end, but the ending was anticlimactic and disappointing. The movie didn't deserve such an ending, but the moment RIGHT before the ending was amazing. The minutes before the movie ended was the truly intense, freaky, creepy part of the movie. If only the film was like that the whole time, I would've been scared and loved it! Although I was disappointed, the experience as a whole was absolutely fun. With the movie theater packed and stuff, and everyone expecting the same thing from the movie, it was fun and exciting. If you truly want to be scare, though, I'd suggest going alone, or maybe with a few other people, on a day when the movie theater isn't packed. Go on a weekday in order to get an empty theater. Hopefully that would heighten the scary parts of the movie."

","Paranormal Activity may very well be the scariest film you will see all year. So turn off the lights and grab a pillow, and don't forget your camcorder with you as you never know what may be crawling pass your feet as you watch this very intense horror! <br/><br/>Gore fans turn away however, as this film does not employ gruesome tactics to disgust the viewer, rather it uses clever suspenseful scenes to keep the audience on their toes throughout. The film moves quite slowly via a day-to-day account of the events that took place, but every day feels like a piece to the jigsaw puzzle that is Paranormal Activity as every night, something new as creepy as the events that took place the night before will unravel. This will certainly make you feel weary after each passing sunset in the film makes you more and more fearful of what is to come.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for a film that uses a documentary style filming to add a sense of scare to its viewers, it fails to be convincing in this aspect due to the horrendous acting. Probably the most paranormal thing in this movie is the male lead. Throughout the series of stressful events, the character manages to keep his cool throughout and never losing control. There were so many situations in which you would expect the male lead to just completely lose his mind and act accordingly, but he was unusually calm throughout. For a human being to act this way under such stressful situations is quite inhuman and I find it a tad bit scary to be honest! <br/><br/>All in all, Paranormal Activity is a good enough horror flick for all you horror-seeking zombies to feed upon for the time being, but it isn't anything special in terms of modern film-making. What it does manage however is to provide tense-scary moments that the big budget horror directors out there fail to create.<br/><br/>In summary, Paranormal Activity contains:<br/><br/>Mind-numbing horror<br/><br/>Suspenseful scenes<br/><br/>Scary calm actors"

","I post few comments on the net, but for this title I needed to express disappointment for this movie. I get that it's a good PR trick, a ""real"" situation camera, unknown actors and being bombed with commercials and beforehand being lead to believe that this truly happened. But in order for it to work you must believe its real and in my opinion it fails totally in doing so. I presume this movie can only work on the younger audience, who are made to believe this truly happened and then grasp in awe at every little thing the ""deamon"" does.

","As an avid movie buff i hardly say that i wasted my $12, but in this case ... The only thing driving movie goers to the theater is the ingenious marketing done by Paramount, kudos to them. Some people are calling it the best horror movie made in a decade. Common fellas, is this really the highest standard we can set? Honestly, I had more laughs than scares, all thanks to the Micah. He was the only reason I could sit through this ordeal. Katie's acting was woefully artificial. Cinematic suspense is a tricky thing, you stretch it too long and tedium starts to creep in. And here it went so long that when the good thing started I wasn't even interested. It will just give you a few scares and nothing else. Don't waste your money, and if you still want to see it wait for a DVD, you might and I say might receive a few more scares on your BOSE headphones.."

I totally agree on the fact that, it is not what you can see, it's what you can not see that scares the crap out of you. I am a movie fanatic, this movie with the budget that they spent on it, and the fact that you can see the documentary, and someone just like me and you with curiosity is filming it, that is crazy. Mic, did his part very well, joking and making funny comments threw the movie which made the movie realistic, like me and my girlfriend are to each other. Katie, did it great to, they both made the movie so much realistic, and great.<br/><br/>I recommend to spend 8-10 bucks on this movie, I think this movie needs more ratings, and it deserves props.<br/><br/>Put it this way, me and my friend, had to go to a bar to get a drink after, because we did not want to go home with the thought of the movie, in mind."
"lymond01","10","5","12","20 October 2009"," Indeed a scary film
","So to gauge my review, consider the other movies that have kept me up at night: Poltergeist (that &#$! clown); The Sixth Sense (imagery and suspense); The Ring (the well...). And now Paranormal Activity. If you've got an over-active imagination coupled with at least a slight trepidation over things that go bump in the night, you'll be more than a little indecisive over whether to leave the bedroom light on after you watch this.<br/><br/>During the film, the screams of the younger crowd at the BUMPs or the door slams definitely broke the tension. I wasn't cringing or covering my eyes -- I was usually eyeing that empty doorway to see if anything was out there in the dark of the stairwell. I think that's what the creators were going for -- making you afraid of the darkness. Or at least genuinely concerned about it. And while in the theater I wasn't terrified, it was when the sun set that I had problems.<br/><br/>That night I avoided the openings of dark hallways, didn't really want to go into the garage to turn out the light, and did indeed sleep with the bedroom light on -- when I finally fell asleep from nervous exhaustion around 3 AM after going to bed at 11 AM. The movie served its purpose -- it made my ears pound with the sound of my pulse as I strained to hear the slightest noise in the house: the breathing of the sleeping dog, the breeze in the trees, the click as the door handle to my bedroom engaged.<br/><br/>Not everyone, of course, is bothered the same way. But certain movie imagery gets me wondering if something is indeed merely waiting for me to disbelieve in it, so it can prove to me it's real. Congratulations, Orin Peli, on completely freaking me out. Kudos to the actors who did a great job distinguishing their personalities -- taunting Micah, and not-wanting-this-to-go-on-any-longer Katie. Well done.<br/><br/>The last second of the film was a wee too Hollywood considering the rest of the film. But the only real flaw in a simple, very scary, movie."

"wowheymaple","10","4","9","10 December 2009"," Not for those lacking imagination
","I've read a few negative reviews stating disappointment in this film due to various elements- poor film quality, lack of suspense/gore, etc.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is NOT your typical Hollywood horror film. You WILL be disappointed if you're going for a quick scare. Many of the scenes from this film stick with you, haunt you while you're trying to sleep at night. Whether you're a believer in paranormal activity or a complete sceptic, this film is going to have you on your toes. If you have no interest in paranormal activity, you'll likely take nothing from it.<br/><br/>I hadn't heard much about this film before going to see it, just a quick (disappointed) review from a co-worker. Within minutes of being in the theatre, I'd put down the popcorn and my eyes were wide. Because of the way this was filmed, and because I hadn't been subjected to any hype, I thought this film was a true story. The characters were incredibly natural and convincing. <br/><br/>The spooky scenes in this movie, like I said, are not typical Hollywood scenes. I don't want to give anything away, but when the character sets up his camera on the tripod, and the couple tuck into bed, your heart race increases. Time fast forwards, and stops, and you quickly catch on to the fact that something is going to happen. There's no blood spatter, no guts, and monsters aren't jumping out of closets. And that's what made this film for me. It suspends your nerves, and gives you just enough to leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>I still have to re-assure myself that it was fictitious to get to sleep at night."
"Le_Freshmeat","3","4","9","7 November 2009"," A total mess
","This movie doesn't deserve the hype it gets at all. The plot is, as is oft the case with horror movies, rather trite and unimportant, but as long as its genuinely scary, it's all good. To say PA falls flat in actually being 'spooky' would be quite the understatement.<br/><br/>The 'spookiness' (which I'm putting between 'sarcasm' tags for a reason) takes a page from the Blair Witch Project style of suggestion. Unfortunately, PA suggests very little and what it does is just plain cheesy, predictable and completely cliché. We get some doors moving and some curtains ruffling, but for the first half of the movie, PA is simply a borefest. By then the mysterious shady assassin who we - of course - never really get to see, has stepped up his repertoire of douchebag tricks to slamming the door shut. Wow. ""What a tweest!"" would M. Night Shyamalan say, if by that he meant 'what a load of crap!'.<br/><br/>The characters' stupidity is only matched by the sheer amount of annoyment they instill upon the viewer. Cheap drama and impromptu bravado go hand in hand as the plot advances like a trainwreck to the nearest clichéstorm while the viewers stops wondering 'who or what is the demon torturing these people?' and 'when will these morons actually die?' While this movie may not deliver many chills, it will certainly give the viewer a sense of relief when the credits at last, mercifully, roll.<br/><br/>In short: this stuff wouldn't scare a toddler. Some would say this movie isn't for the faint of heart. These people are right, but seek their refuge in an understament: this movie isn't for anyone with half a brain. Avoid at all costs."

"adairchaballa","1","4","9","30 October 2009"," Hype and marketing. Nothing else.
","First of all, let me say that every great thing that is being said about this movie is completely understandable. I love the camcorder horror format--REC and Cloverfield are good examples of the genre, as is The Blair Witch Project. In all three films the writing is believable, the characters are likable and the suspense is drawn out.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity has none of that.<br/><br/>""Filmmaker"" Oren Peli uses the strengths of the genre (realistic hand held shooting and the feeling that the characters could easily be you) as a crutch for bad, bad writing and a lack of any camera work whatsoever. This couple is supposed to be so ordinary that we're drawn into a sense of realism, but the dialogue Katie and Micah have is so banal I was annoyed immediately, and throughout the film.<br/><br/>The fact that Peli had to shoot this film in his own home due to the constraints of an $11,000 budget opens up plot holes that are patched over, actually with single lines of dialogue: Why can't they move to a new, unhaunted house? Because the ghostdemon has been visiting Katie for her whole life and follows her everywhere. So they must coexist, but why can't they? Because the psychic whom they meet with tells them they might be killed. Why can't he expel the ghostdemon? Because he just can't--after the haunting escalates and when they need him most he actually tells them he feels overwhelmed and can't be in the room with it, and also that he's very sorry. He says he will try to help them later, but he just can't be there right then. That must mean it's time to get scared, everyone.<br/><br/>I could have forgiven the extremely annoying characters and plot holes if the spooks were delivered with any sort of timing or suspense, but as has been explained in many other negative reviews, the ghostdemon comes in the middle of the night, immediately after the camera footage is fastforwarded directly to the events which we're supposed to have been startled by, completely ruining it. But this is what must happen if the film is to take place in the couple's home and the supposed terror must come while they are sleeping. We can't just wait all night for stuff to happen, right? Oh, and after each event the couple simply goes back to bed, and the the next day comes where they bicker about the haunting exactly the same way they do every other day. This is the whole movie, and then it's over, thankfully."

","Read Andrew (ash2)comments first, as this was one of the highest views. I give all credit to the marketing genius of this movie, by getting us to want to demand this film in our theaters. I give it slightly better than mediocrity in suspense, vis a vis Hitchcock, as so many others have compared. I agreed that the imagination and anticipation here alone makes this a fun movie. However, it ends there. No horror whatsoever. I will sleep very well tonight, thank you. Hearing a lot of other movie-goers leave the theater makes me confident that most agree with me here. Blair Witch was a better film, but I think there should be many more of this type. Had this been a big-budget film, it would have NONE of the suspense as the demand for special effects would have ultimately ruined what otherwise was an excellent concept. Nice acting despite some flaws in the plot, i.e., in real-life, I would have been outta that house midway through the movie."

Other than that, I just can not imagine. There are so many movies that did a far better job of creepy haunted houses, ghosts, paranormal activities and/or realistically hand-held camera's!<br/><br/>The good things: Let me think... there were a few bedroom moments that were a tiny bit unsettling. But not more then one or two, and nothing more then a little. The last 3 seconds of the movie were a bit creepy, but really too predictable. <br/><br/>The bad things: Most of it. There were hardly any scares, no surprises, and the whole pace was too slow. I do not mind a slow paced movie, but then there has to be at least a build-up tension. In Paranormal Activity they have tried to, but miserably failed. The acting was also quite terrible. For a woman who has been followed by a 'demon' almost all of her life, there was hardly any fear in her eyes. She screamed a couple of times, but for me, totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>Let me not waste too many more words on it. If you want to see a creepy Blair Witch kind of movie, watch the Blair Witch.

","I'm sure most of us have heard the term ""less is more."" Alfred Hitchcock helped bring this term to fruition by keeping the forces of evil hidden from us, but obviously with us, near us, and trying desperately to get in.<br/><br/>First time writer/director and renaissance film-make Oren Peli took the ""less is more"" to heart and decided to do his own version of a Blair Witch Project, but with much greater success in my book.<br/><br/>I am not an easily spooked guy. And I've seen my share of horror films that did absolutely nothing for me. Although some of them I still love, they didn't give me goosebumps. One of my favorites, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956), was creepy and it made me think, but it never made me jump in my seat. The same could not be said for PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It is, without a doubt, a true minimalist horror film that strikes at the heart of our psyche. And when I say ""minimalist"", I mean minimal. Made for roughly $15,000, it's first week out in theaters it grossed over $9 million. I can't even imagine how many tens-of-millions its made now that its out on DVD. Peli took the minimalist approach on time, too, as the entire film runs only 86 minutes. And they filmed it all in ten days. And in Peli's own house! The best thing about the film is that it gradually builds tension, never letting us in on what it is that's stalking Katie. This unknown is frustratingly freakish, and we can really feel the stress Katie and her boyfriend Micah are under as they lose sleep, hear doors slam, see footprints appear out of nowhere, and helplessly watch as more and more ""things"" begin happening to them.<br/><br/>Those who hate the hand-held camera movements of The Blair Witch Project and CLOVERFIELD, will want to avoid this one, as it, too, uses a hand-held. But if you love to feel your heart beat faster, your breathing speed up, and to cover your eyes when you know something really bad is about to happen, then by all means please watch this.<br/><br/>I heard rumor that a sequel is in the making.

I find myself more in the love-it camp, though I have to admit that it might because I was less bored with the many chatty scenes in which nothing happens since I was at home and multi-tasking some. And I quite enjoyed the scenes in which stuff did happen. It was really quite simply done - a video camera set up in the couple's bedroom to monitor unusual occurrences - but sometime simple works great. I found myself tensely watching, waiting, and when paranormal activity did happen - even when they weren't big scares - I wasn't disappointed, especially since they built up to a doozy of a finale."
"Rob11086","9","3","6","14 February 2010"," Psychologically Terrifying
","Let me begin by saying that I generally hate horror movies. I view them as stupid, gratuitous wastes of time that are recycled time and time again.<br/><br/>Having said that, I've seen quite a bit of them. This movie is the only movie I have seen in the entire genre that has legitimately scared me. As someone who loves movies, I can honestly say that this is the best horror movie I have seen, simply because it is absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>The movie premise is simple. Micah and his girlfriend, Katie, have recently moved in together. After a few months they start noticing strange happenings around the house, IE lights turning on and off, faucets turning on when no one is around, keys falling to the floor randomly, etc. After things get worse and worse, they determine it is no normal haunting of a house...<br/><br/>It sounds like the same old thing done again, however the key here is all about how the events unfolding are executed. The movie is done in the same presentation as The Blair Witch Project, or more recently Cloverfield, in that everything is filmed as a home movie. As cheap as it sounds, it does not skimp on the terror factor. The effects of when the ""activites"" happen are subtle but very very effective. From a simple humming sound to air blowing on someone making hair move, everything is done very professionally.<br/><br/>I can not overstate how suspenseful this movie really is. Get through the beginning. As the movie progresses, it gets more and more terrifying. If you let yourself really get lost in the movie-- as a movie should make you, you will truly be scared for what is happening on screen. This movie stuck with me days after I watched it, giving me strange dreams and second guessing sounds in the middle of the night if I was awakened. This is what Horror Movies should be. This is what horror movies should accomplish! I highly recommend this gem of a movie to anyone who needs reassurance that there is still a proper horror movie out there."

And I came to the conclusion of... realism. This film is so real in how both Katie and Micah react to what is going on around them. The fact that there really was no script and it was mostly improvised blows me away. Most people complain how boring it is. Let me ask you something: in an average person's life, how interesting is a typical day? For the most part... not very. So this film is dead on with how these two normal people go about their normal routines and how, at night, the normal suddenly becomes PARAnormal.

","Was i watching the same movie as every one else, put a camera in the hands of monkeys and i think i would have enjoyed watching that more than this load of tripe. I was waiting to be scared, but a few doors banging, and powdered footprints didn't do it for me, did I also mention, it is the most boring film I've ever watched, sorry but if you where scared of this load of rubbish you must be scared of your own shadow, please don't pay to see this, in fact don't watch it for free, truly awful. It is not on par with some of the really good ghost story,The The Changeling 1980 staring George C. Scott now that is a truly scary film, makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The Haunting 1960 another classic,these where good ghost story's, now people grab a camcorder and film any old rubbish and the sad thing is people enter into the hype they hear people saying its the scariest movie ever,don't watch it alone,i'd let my five year old granddaughter watch it, in fact Scooby Doo is scarier than this so called movie"

I don't have to reiterate the general consensus about this ""movie,"" it's been done pretty thoroughly already...

","So this movie is so scary people were fainting in the cinemas? WHY? is the only question I can think to ask. The only scary part for me was when they found the huge spider in the bathroom; being an arachnophobic I had to look away. However beyond that I found it to be about as frightening as cute puppies playing with fluffy kittens.<br/><br/>A few times I nearly nodded off I was so bored; all the while though I fought to stay awake with the fervent belief that it would get better soon.......it did; when the end credits started rolling.<br/><br/>The 'Blair Witch Project' wasn't scary; 'Cloverfield' wasn't even scary. The only remotely chilling 'docufright' movie I've seen that was a bit hair raising was 'Rec' - if you can't recreate the mounting paranoia, isolation and desperation that that movie had then please DON'T BOTHER trying!! STOP forcing these boring 'docufright' movies on us, when they're anything BUT frightening.<br/><br/>A woman dripping snot is not scary - gross, but not chilling; a woman standing in the middle of her bedroom for two hours watching her boyfriend sleep (even on fast forward) is not scary - even if it is, bizarrely, meant to show she's possessed.<br/><br/>Even a 'self' moving Ouija board plentel is not going to shock anyone when the stop motion used was so obvious; burning it isn't scary either when you can clearly see an accelerator was used to ignite it. I mean surely a demon of all things can set things on fire without using lighter fluid? <br/><br/>Micah was an idiot that just made me want to slap him; and Katie's piercing screaming made me fear for her throat. I wondered at how she hadn't lost her voice half the time.<br/><br/>DON'T bother if you haven't seen this movie already - the only demon involved is the studio who made this tripe, and stole your money when you actually paid to see it. I wouldn't watch it again; in fact I'm wondering about suing to see if I can get compensation for the 86 minutes this has stolen from my life.<br/><br/>If you truly want a movie like this that DOES deliver on the spine chillers then rent 'Rec'; at least that film had an inkling on how to make a REAL 'docufright' movie."

Take this movie. Lady says weird things are happening. Boyfriend, the idiot skeptic of everything, decides to record them sleeping. Boyfriend watches results. The couple argues. They go back to sleep. Repeat. That's the WHOLE MOVIE.<br/><br/>The other thing that I realized was that I was rude to the movie. At the end, the boyfriend gets hurled into a wall and killed.

","So before seeing Paranormal Activity, I was getting ready for what I thought would be the scariest movie I'd ever see. And that was because of what everyone was saying about it and blah blah. Movie starts, very slow..like it doesn't get scary till mostly the end. There's way too much ""filler"" time in this movie, but the characters are somewhat believable. If doors shutting, big booms, and lights going on scares the crap out of you..then do not see this movie. Because that is all the happens thats SUPPOSED to scare the audience. I was actually waiting for the moment for myself to be like HOLY CRAP!! But it just didn't come..ever. I really don't understand how people are saying that this was the scariest movie ever..because it was not at all. The actors are not very good, not that they are real actors anyways. And just certain scenes do not make sense to me at all. You will most likely see for yourself. The psycologist that comes in and goes ""I can not be in here"" Umm..too staged and just not believable at all. Overall I gave it 4 stars because it was stupid, but it was still scary. The acting was bad, and yes I understand how this movie was made so cheap, we can all tell. Its just the hype that gets this movie billions of dollars not the actual film."
"poetellect","9","3","6","29 October 2009"," Guidelines for Building Aura and Feeling: Excellence
","Truly good film- very anti-much of what Hollywood spews out nowadays; truly creative and innovative in many, many ways, but mostly in the way the camera and actors interact and decide what and which ways to see and not see what is going on- truly brilliantly done film. I feel having a scene with the demonologist would have added a great deal to the overall knowledge and eeriness of the film... This work vacillates between suspenseful and frightening, however some moments are not so much scary as they are comical- a true panoply of emotions here. All in all, well worth your time and money.<br/><br/>I found myself wanting to converse with the actors at different points in the film, which doesn't always happen in explicit Hollywood-produced fare, which I think attests to the naturalism and reality inherent to how this was done."
"rockinkettles-1","10","3","6","28 October 2009"," You Will Sleep With The Lights On
","Paranormal Activity is a well done indie horror film that will not appeal to today's generation who are used to sickening blood and gore. This is a scary film in more of a psychological sense. The couple in the movie, Katie and Micha, did a very good and believable job in making it look so natural and real. This really did look like an actual scariest home videos that gave me the creeps. I jumped more than once and the ending gave me chills. For a movie that did not cost very much to make, I found it to be scarier than these other big budget horrible films like the Grudge 2 and the Ring 2. If a sequel to Paranormal is ever made, I only hope it is as good as this indie gem. My guess is if it scares you as much as it did me, you will sleep with the lights on."
"Quebec_Dragon","9","3","6","28 October 2009"," Paradoxical paranormal chiller
","Paranormal Activity (PA) is a rare anomaly, the extremely small budget indie flick (15,000$, the price of a car) filmed in one week with one hand-held camera and unknown actors that ends up being very popular. Many will compare it to the 1999's Blair Witch Project, which is not a bad comparison but it's different in the fact it takes place in one location (a suburban home) and that I found it much better and especially scarier. I've seen lots of horror movies and I've grown rather blasé and hard to please. PA actually gave me chills and I don't think it was because of the air conditioning. It slowly instilled dread and shocked me a few times. The story alternates between daytime sequences in the house and nighttime sequences with one night-vision equipped camera stuck in the corner of the bedroom. I quite suspect many people will find the day sections boring and banal but without them the night sections wouldn't be so suspenseful. It's the art of creating tension, releasing it and recreating it again. If you have constant tension, then people get used to it and it's not as effective.<br/><br/>So although it starts rather tame with nothing or little happening, I was soon dreading the nights and hoping for them to end quickly. The day-night routine cycle is one of the secrets why PA is so effective as well as the unnerving low-frequency bass noise used sparingly instead of a standard soundtrack. This is not special-effects oriented nor does it have professional cinematography. It looks amateurish and intentionally so. It relies on the Hitchcock philosophy that it's scarier to hear, glimpse and imagine than to see everything. I think it also works because most of the eerie stuff could easily happen in our homes. It's those strengths that will appear as weaknesses to jaded audiences. We can also expect the usual backlash seen with highly hyped surprise hits. You go in expecting one of the scariest movies of all time and you prepare yourself unconsciously for this so in the end you can brag that it wasn't that scary.<br/><br/>Fright is subjective. For what it's worth, I'm not easily scared but I have no choice but to admit I became emotionally involved. If you're interested in seeing PA, then try to go in open-minded and preferably with someone else in a crowded theater. You run the high risk of having to deal with noisy undisciplined groups of teens (as I did) but hopefully the rest of the public will eventually placate them or the scariness eventually will. Rarely have I seen a movie-going public being so scared and tense, and not because of gore (none here). Seeing this in a crowd is a great experience if you're lucky enough but on the other hand, I can see PA being quite effective late at night at home with a significant other with the added benefit of not having the first part of the movie ruined by hecklers. Actually, although I rate this movie highly, I'm not sure I should recommend it because it's insidious. It does tend to get under your skin, linger in your thoughts afterwards, particularly before you sleep perhaps provoking insomnia and nightmares and it could make certain normal house occurrences much creepier. Avoid this film if you live alone and in a creaky/drafty home.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10<br/><br/>P.S.: I quite suspect this would be a great date movie. It would favor closeness during the show and your date (or yourself) might not want to sleep alone afterwards. ;-)"
"coldscooter","8","3","6","26 October 2009"," Not for all... but blew me away
","I heard about this movie through all the hype and so had my preconceptions elevated before viewing. Almost always this results in an underwhelming experience, but I have to say this turned out to be the most involved viewing of a horror film i have sat through in years.<br/><br/>I grew up in a big, old house and as a child with an exuberant imagination, was convinced that the bumps and strange occurrences at night were more than simply creaking floorboards, or the wind slamming doors shut. It was as riveting and exciting as it was scary, and I truly missed that childhood sensation as age brought with it rational thought and the knowledge that the truth was far less interesting.<br/><br/>This movie tapped into that primal, infantile fear with such vivid precision that I almost felt 10 years old again, with the same exhilaration and fear that I so thrived on as a child. <br/><br/>I really believe the experience will differ vastly between viewers. Some will have very little relation or interest to the hauntings (which is fair enough) and consequently become quickly bored with the slow pace and shallow character development. Others will join the i-wasn't-scared pissing contest and criticise it for not scaring them as it had others (i could also understand their frustration). Some who scare easily and actually believe in paranormal happenings may be scared sh*tless and not be able to sleep soundly for weeks. Others (like myself) will be swept away by a hugely atmospheric and brilliantly suspenseful fictional masterpiece where the scares themselves pre-exist in the viewers imagination and not in the film content itself. <br/><br/>SPOILER: That being said, the dragging-from-the-bed scene was truly horrifying and goes down for me as maybe the most enthralling scene in all of horror history.<br/><br/>Thank you to the director for an unforgettable ride."
"jesse13788","8","3","6","26 October 2009"," Not as great as REC, but good enough!
","To put myself on an objective plane before writing this review, I should admit that I consider 2007 Spanish zombie thriller Rec to be THE scariest movie I have ever seen. Now, contrary to whatever my co-watcher says, (who reportedly still has nightmares about a teenage Linda Blair scaring the whole world in 'The Exorcist') Rec scored over all other films thanks to its pseudo-original footage format, where a camera crew gets stuck in a zombie-infested Barcelona apartment building. <br/><br/>Oran Peli's Paranormal activity, however, has a different premise; but here again, the camera is operated by a protagonist: an over- enthusiastic man (Micah Sloat) who is interested to find out the truth after a host of spooky occurrences in his house, that are somehow connected with his girlfriend's (Katie Featherston) past.<br/><br/>Screened for the first time in late-2007 during the Screamfest Horror Film Festival, it took two years for the film to find a proper distributor. After a slew of incidents that included proposals to re- shoot and even a hassled Steven Spielberg claiming that the DVD of the movie was 'haunted' (but he ended up liking the movie too), DreamWorks and Paramount finally released the film, 11 years after the first horror pseudo-documentary film of its kind, 'The Blair Witch Project' hit screens. <br/><br/>Even though my co-watcher decides to go to sleep each time I begin one of my history lessons, cinema-goers have been tastefully acquainted with this 'style' of film-making in 1998, thanks to 'The Blair Witch Project'; the success of which, however, did not generate a string of below-average films of the type (Thank heavens!). Rec came in 2007, its not-so-good Hollywood remake 'Quarantine' came a year later and in 2008 itself, a similarly shot 'Eco-terror' film (""What's that?"" my co- watcher asks. ""Films like Godzilla"", I reply) 'Cloverfield' took home a fair amount of dough. <br/><br/>So is Paranormal Activity special, or different, or better than its predecessors? To put it fairly, it is a heck of a scary film. The amateur footage looks amateurish enough to make you believe as if you are really watching 'the real deal'. The slow (albeit, steady) curve of the story has everything from low-key titillating shock-effects like small sound distractions whenever 'the demon' is around; to nerve- wracking sequences where doors are closed with heavy bangs and protagonists are dragged away by a scary and invisible force. The acting is effectively natural, Katie is easy on the eye, Micah is effortless; the fact that Katie is called Katie and Micah is called Micah within the film boosts the authenticity factor as well. <br/><br/>The real kicker is perhaps the ending which has the potential of a fairly harsh kick in the 'Courage Guts' of the more 'gallant' viewers (Like 'me'). But on a totally personal level, the original 2007 ending was much more 'complete' than the new one. (""We all know Hollywood. The new ending nearly guarantees a sequel."" my co-watcher explains. And I guess she is right. Paramount has already made public their plans for a sequel)<br/><br/>So Oran Peli does strike gold in his first directorial venture. And maybe its not as good as the 'sleekly planned' and 'budgeted' Rec (Let me see Michael Bay or Peter Jackson pull off a movie like this with 15000 bucks!), but its sure to go down in the history of Horror as a really good 'Screamfest'. After all, a movie which boasts the presence of a talented screamer (Katie was good!), it's only fair that the movie gets a fair share of scared screamers from the audience as well."

I won't give anything away if you haven't watched it yet but there is one really scary part near the end of the movie that really made me jump. When you watch the movie you will see what I'm talking about. I thought the ""no name"" actors did a really great job in this movie. It's a lot like ""The Blare With Project"" only you can actually see something other than darkness. Again it's not a movie that will go down in history as the best but it's sure worth watching!"

","I saw this film earlier today, and I just want to start by saying that I also watched Haunting in Connecticut right afterwards; I wanted to see it and I had seen the two movies compared. The thing I noticed is mostly only people that disliked Paranormal Activity compared the two, calling Haunting scarier. Apparently those people don't know what makes true elements of horror. It isn't a bunch of unrealistic and quite frankly senseless plot lines and effects; it's SUSPENSE.<br/><br/>This movie builds up like none I have ever seen. It starts VERY subtle, but it gains momentum. People calling this film boring must simply be void of senses in favor of mindless horror films with special effects. The name of the game here is REALISM. The acting is excellent; you really get a feeling that this is actually happening to them.<br/><br/>The movie is shot as a mockumentary, and that's what makes it effective. Many things in this movie probably wouldn't be scary on a high budget film camera, but since it is real, even the most subtle thing is terrifying. The final 20 minutes of this film are beyond disturbing. It builds upon terror based on realism and as such is the ONLY horror film to stay with me after viewing besides Halloween, and that is one of the most effective horror films ever made. I'm not trying to compare the two as the film has its quirks (a few parts are really cheesy), but it does the job. The suspense grips you each night these two go to sleep, and by the next night you wonder if you can handle any more of what you are seeing. And the beauty is that that DON'T see very much; much is left to the imagination. And THAT, ladies and gentleman, is what a good horror film does. Again, it has that Halloween-esquire technique in terms of suspense and realism that keeps you scared after you watch it.<br/><br/>Ignore the haters; they simply do not understand that it's a combination of SUSPENSE and realism and/or abstract visuals that are actually psychological. You won't get that from the lowly Haunting in Connecticut, which is simply not in the same LEAGUE as Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>This may sound strange, but I LOVE getting scared out of my wits because scaring me is a challenge. So, if you want to be disturbed, creeped out and afraid of the dark, watch this movie."

I actually wanted to leave half way because I wanted my money back. This movie was the pits. I'm sorry but Quarantine had the same camera like effect and although that was just a good movie, it was MUCH better than this Paranormal clump of whatever. I cannot believe that people lost sleep over this movie... that same night I slept like a baby. I've seen much more scarier movies than this (The Exorcist and Amityville Horror LOL.)

","I was skeptical about seeing this movie because of all the hype about it being 'the scariest movie of all time' but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was filmed in the same hand held camera style as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, but this movie was unique.<br/><br/>Katie has been living with paranormal activity on and off since she was a young girl, and after she moves in with her boyfriend Micah, the events begin to happen again. Micah decides to film all that he can around the house to see if he can catch anything useful on camera. The film shows the couple's day to day life as well as the couple at night trying to sleep, which is when most of the activity happens.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good moments of suspense and little things that make you jump, as well as moments that are just plain eerie. I love the no frills filming style and the realistic, not over the top acting by the two leads. Overall, this movie definitely has its scary moments and is a well done film."
"garrettderose","9","3","6","19 October 2009"," Best suspense/horror film of all time!
","I am truly impressed with this film. I'd like to have seen it under the context of not knowing it's reputation. Maybe it was just because I anticipated it being so scary? I had a slew of people and reviews that told me it was the most disturbing film they've seen.<br/><br/>I couldn't pass it up. Me and my fiancée hit up a late-night showing of this film. It was worth it. I couldn't sleep that night.<br/><br/>The production is hokey and unimpressive. About as unimpressive as a home movie/documantary... hey wait, isn't that what they were going for? This movie pulls off a very legitimate 'documentary' feel. Most of the scary parts of this film aren't even action-filled. There's no goopy-goblins jumping out at the screen, to follow their 'rising tension' synth-string cues. There isn't a big chase scene. There isn't even a fight/battle with an antagonist. It's simply a film that gets it's scares from the viewer itself.<br/><br/>My heart was racing even before any sort of ""Paranormal Activity"" was on the screen at all. The build-up to these horrific scenes of ghostly-shenanigans is gut-wrenching. The characters react in a very personable way to their encounters with the paranormal. The male character is a 'tough guy' when it comes to this stuff. He think's ghosts are 'cool' and 'interesting'. You begin to realize that this is a defense mechanism. He's just as scared as anybody would be.<br/><br/>The film goes from scary to uncontrollably frightening in a well-paced manner. Some of the eeriest things I've ever seen happen in the most subtle ways ever. In most movies, ghosts put on this big laser-light show with tons of CG and spooky tricks. The ghost in this film behaves in a very calculated way. It feels like an antagonist character, although you really don't get to see it on-screen. You get an idea of what this 'ghost' looks like, given the type of activity it presents throughout the film. The film utilizes the imagination of the viewer to a great level of success.<br/><br/>I'm one of those guys who watches Horror films for gags. I rolled my eyes and scoffed at the first 5 minutes of this film, I admit. There were people in the theater who were actually yelling things at the screen, showing off how non-scared they were.<br/><br/>When the ""Paranormal Activity"" occurred on the screen... the theater was SILENT. The peanut gallery were trembling just as hard as the characters in this film.<br/><br/>I have YET to have such an exciting cinematic experience. I give this a 9 out of 10. I would give it a perfect 10/10 had this film had a more well-thought-out ending.<br/><br/>Go see it. Take your friend that 'isn't scared of anything'.<br/><br/>Intense. Realistic. Eerie. Great film-making.<br/><br/>How does somebody with a gazillion dollar budget like Michael Bay make movies that I don't react to in any way (as if I were just looking at an advertisement in a magazine) - and some inexperienced production can make me lose sleep... on like $10,000? Filmmakers should take notes from Paranormal Activity."
"J_Trex","8","3","6","18 October 2009"," Things that go bump in the night
","This was a film that cost practically nothing to produce yet offered up a host of scary moments and a plot that kept the viewer on the edge of their seats right up to the wild ending. Kudos to the writers and producers who made this film. They struck gold and I'm sure they already have their next project funded and in the works.<br/><br/>This type of movie is similar to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that it's a documentary with the main characters filming themselves while attempting to prove the existence of paranormal activity in their house. Katie has been haunted most of her life by a ghost or demon, and the ghost follows her regardless of where she lives. Now the ghost resides in the home of her boyfriend Micah, with whom she now lives. Micah is initially skeptical but then comes to see that the ghost is a real presence. He isn't intimidated, but wants to show the ghost ""who's the boss"". A big mistake on Micah's part, as things later prove.<br/><br/>This was a very good movie and as horror movies go, this is one of the more clever ones I've seen. There's not the blood & gore of the typical horror movies, but a very subtle type of tension in the development of the plot. The tension builds throughout and peaks at the films ending. <br/><br/>The release of this film during the Halloween season was a smart move. I'm sure it will do fabulously well, as word of mouth gets around. I definitely recommend this movie."

There was just something missing and I can't put my finger on it.

I was not jumping, screaming, squirming or WTFing or squeezing my boyfriends hand. It wasn't creepy enough or evil enough. Demons are evil and creepy and so dark and this movie didn't capture that for me."
"Ketzel","6","3","6","9 October 2009"," Fun and scary, but not ""great""
","I definitely enjoyed watching this film, and there were some scary moments, for sure! Worth seeing, especially for paranormal and horror buffs. That being said, this might have been a great film except for two things. <br/><br/>First, Micah is nearly devoid of personality. He is so much Mr. Average Young Adult that he ends up being nobody at all, and it is hard to immerse oneself in a film where one of the two main characters is boring and undefined, yet irritating. The female character compensates with having a more defined and complex personality. <br/><br/>Second, the style of the ending doesn't fit well with the rest of the movie. It feels like it was spliced in from a different film altogether. But the ending works well enough that the film is not spoiled by the abrupt shift.<br/><br/>Following the shaky cam action on the large screen was a bit much when I sat near the front of the theater. Moving toward the back of the theater helped me to see what was going on much better. I recommend that you find a seat at least halfway up from the front if you don't want to be overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Go and enjoy!"

"sarra1833","10","5","13","12 October 2009"," How horror SHOULD be
","I read on IMDb mixed reviews but decided to go see it tonight. AMAZING movie and then some. It was done on an (I think) $15,000 budget on a camcorder to beat all camcorders. It's the tale of a boyfriend and girlfriend who have a demon in their home. It's been following her since she was 8 from home to home. Anyway, they set up the cam in their bedroom while they sleep and he carries it around the house to document stuff.<br/><br/>I'm not ruining the plot, but I CAN say that THIS is how horror SHOULD be. Alfred Hitchcock did the same idea of ""Will people be more scared seeing the man holding the chainsaw, or will they be more scared HEARING the man with the chainsaw and never seeing him?"" I full out think that Paranormal Activity did this angle perfectly. The viewer is at the mercy of the camcorder; they hear things; sometimes soft, sometimes loud... they always hear movement, footsteps, breathing, pounding, etc (and sometimes see things that will shock you to the core) but never do you SEE it. And that is what makes this so frightening. You know the evil is there but you don't see it, just like normal real life hauntings are usually.<br/><br/>I jumped, I chuckled, I cringed, I mantra'd over and over, no no no no no oh god no..... and was VERY satisfied throughout the entire movie. I think those who give negative reviews are used to seeing the evil, seeing blood, violence, gore, cgi crafted ghosts and entities and so on. This movie gives none of that in the visual aspect - but it fully delivers in the 'hearing and the minds eye IS believing'.<br/><br/>Go see it, folks. Google it up and go see it. You may think a movie that takes place 70 percent in the bedroom on a tripod and the other 30 percent walking around a house won't be enough scenes and so on, but that is so far from the truth. The beginning is a little slow BUT it paves the way to what happened to that point and what's going on as far as they know. We know as much as they do, they hear and see as much as we do, and THAT is what makes a top horror movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's the whole 'what if' and 'what IS it' factor that does it. I'd rather have the mind set of not wanting to know what's doing the horrible stuff than see someone's idea of what it looks like and have it not ruined but not to MY own imagination, if that makes sense. I mean, movies like Freddy, Jason and The Haunting and so on are good in their way, but THIS.... this is TRUE horror in my opinion.<br/><br/>Nothing is more scarier than ones own imagination, after all, and Paranormal Activity makes you use just that and nothing more."

","It may sound a bit weird, but unlike most people who see horror movies for the thrill of being frightened, I go for the laughs. I find horror movies to be funny, I can't help it. So when I say that this movie was I laugh out loud riot, I mean that you will come pretty close to wetting yourself by the time you have reached the tension soaked finale. This movie is frightening, creepy, but above all it feels real. It will make you afraid to go to sleep and more afraid to date. This is an instant independent classic, and, unlike most ""shaky cam"" movies that use the technique to cover up for the lack of quality, it has true substance that, if you are anything like me, will keep you laughing to the very end."

","This is my first actual written review on movie and i have been a member on IMDb for a couple years now. The reason i am writing this is because i want people to know that this movie is indeed a GREAT film. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but this is in fact the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life. I am still trying to grasp the whole thing and i saw it a week ago. Me and my wife would pretty much refuse to talk about the movie for the first few days, but we eventually got over it and discussed our thoughts on the film. The main reason i am writing this review is because i am already noticing the IMDb rating going down, it started at a 8.9, and now it has plummeted to an 8.1 with only 2300 (ish) ratings. The reason i think that this is happening is because some people cant stand movies that are hyped up to be great and they get on IMDb and they rate it a 1/10 without even seeing the movie. Or they see it and think that the ""cool"" thing to do is to give it a low rating. In my opinion this movie DESERVES the top 250, it really does. From Start to Finish the movie taps into your inner child and scares you the way you were as an 8 year old kid after just seeing ""Halloween"" Or ""Friday the 13th"" for the first time. This movie is making ADULTS feel like that again. And that is horrifying. The last thing I want is for everyone to jump onto the ""Paranormal Activity Sucks"" bandwagon, and the movie drops to like a 6.0 or even a 7.5, it deserves more than that. If you are skeptical, please take my word for it, go see it."

","This is definitely a movie to be enjoyed in the comfort of your own home. Turn off all the lights, put the kids to bed, crank up the surround sound, and put yourself in the actors shoes. This movie is off the charts creepy.<br/><br/>Yes, there are definitely several ""come on"" moments where that will require you to suspend logic in order to play along. Overall, this movie rocks.<br/><br/>For my wife and I, this was the fourth movie in four days. I saw 'Avatar' in the theater Sunday and was completely and totally blown away. Then, we were tortured, as we slogged our way through the painful experiences of 'Extract' and 'The Goods'. These two mind-numbingly bad movies waste talent and resources worse than the Unites States Congress.<br/><br/>Then last night, 'Paranormal Activity' put a fright in me that I hadn't experienced since I was a kid. I found myself saying a little prayer as I tried to fall asleep. And, when I strangely awoke at 4:44am for no apparent reason, falling back asleep was next to impossible.<br/><br/>Any movie that keeps me thinking about it the next day has on some level succeeded. This movie is definitely better than 'Blair Witch' or 'Cloverfield' or any of the other recent horror entries. I definitely recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Well done!"
"Yakrakus","8","3","7","30 December 2009"," Somewhere between Hostel and Child's Play
","This is one of those classic love it or hate it movies. If you liked Blair Witch, check it out. If you liked any of the recent crop of ""torture-porn"" movies (Saw, Hostel, Last House on the Left, anything by Rob Zombie), avoid it. While some of you will be exceptions to the rule, I'd say this is a fairly adequate dividing line. A more complete distinction would include ""see the villain"" (Cloverfield & Quarantine) or ""don't see the villain"" (Blair Witch).<br/><br/>This movie isn't perfect. No one is as dense as the boyfriend or as flighty as the girlfriend. The selling point is the creepy atmosphere. It's what you don't see. It's the implication that ""this could happen to you"", without the the disturbing ""this has happened to someone and we're gonna show you how"" feeling of torture-porn flicks. Even if you don't believe that something like this could happen, there are more than a few real world accounts of similar happenings. If nothing else, that makes it a little scarier than killers in hockey masks, vampires, and zombies. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely, despite some major flaws. But then, I'm on the Blair Witch side of the line. As much as I enjoy a good zombie flick, this is the kinda film that gives me the heebie-jeebies. It's obviously not for everyone. But, if your fear meter falls between horrible things that can happen and bizarre things that could never happen, check it out. Everyone else will probably be a little (or a lot) disappointed."

"Samiam3","8","3","7","29 December 2009"," Plot less but clever, and absolutely terrifying
","What does it take to make a scary movie. If you were to reply by saying that Suspense is the key, I would ask you to be more specific. It is not what you DO see in a movie that provokes fear but rather what you DO NOT see. With the possible exception of Jaws, I can think of no better example than Paranormal Activity to support the argument. Following in the footsteps of Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity is a story told not from any character's perspective, but rather from the viewers perspective. We are practically inside the camera, which is a great feeling to have, but an equally terrifying one. Though the film is not without fault it is definitely one of the scariest movies of the decade.<br/><br/>Ever since she was eight and her house burnt down, Katie is convinced that she is being followed by unnatural forces. Fifteen years later, she and her boyfriend move into a new house in San Diego. The boyfriend sees this as a good opportunity to document the supernatural activity in the hopes that he can chase it away. He sets up a camera in the bedroom and leaves it running at night. In eighty minutes, Paranormal Activity, covers twenty nights in the haunted house (although we don't see all twenty of them) <br/><br/>This is a film that grabs you by the throat and squeezes. It is not a fun scary movie, it is scary scary. Repetitious as the story it may be, the film is never dull. There is nothing cheap or superficial about the shocks in this movie, it felt very real and I was indeed scared"
"leemarkk3","10","3","7","29 December 2009"," Destined to be a Horror Classic. Deeply Disturbing.
","To be quite honest, some of the opinions claiming this film to be dull or awful are quite frankly laughable. I believe this to be one of the most terrifying films ever made. I would easily put it in my top 5 horrors with the likes of The Exorcist, The Shining and Blairwitch Project. I usually wouldn't bother myself to write a review but just reading some of the reviews with people giving the film a one star, started to grate on me very incessantly. Are you lot the same imbeciles that rate mindless, gory dross like Saw and Hostel as scary??? I know the U.S. isn't renowned for having the most intelligent of people habituating in it, but to call this film funny?Dull?A scam? For Christ sake, exercise your imaginations. We don't always have to be told when to jump, when to be scared. The terror in this film often lies in the Hitchcock-esquire fashion in which we the film subtly weaves many chilling suggestions into our unconscious. Is the thing really whispering her name in that terrifying voice? Were the footprints really shaped to suggest that we are dealing with an unimaginable monster? Why was she staring at him at the end of her bed for hours?How long had this thing possessed her?What is it we are dealing with here, if it isn't a spirit of a dead human? Where did it come from? I think like many, the film really sunk in to how disturbing it was, when you would lay awake for nights afterwards pondering some of the aforementioned questions. People try to claim that this film is marketing driven genius. There wasn't any marketing for this film. The film grew more infamous since 2007 from word of mouth. People who are literate and have half an imagination are the people rating this film highly.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this to most people. Destined to be a horror classic. However, not recommended for brainless, moronic, fans of 'Dude, Where's my car?', 'American Pie 6', and 'Saw 7'. If you are the latter, please continue stuffing your hot dogs and popcorn and stick to movies that don't involve the use of any thought processes whatsoever. Thanks."

Move an object here or there....more terrific to the core horror. NOT. Add to this the all to familiar dizzying hand held camcorder and lack of any sub-plots or other serious cast members. Then, to cap it off they toss out a clear as a bell spoiler that let us know well in advance exactly how the film would end. So much for the surprise finale scene that was NOT.<br/><br/>In one scene the boyfriend Micah spends a minute or longer checking out the hallway. Who was holding the camera? Since girl friend Katie yaks her hatred of the camera in almost every scene it certainly was not her. Bit of continuity problem there. In fact, I should add that Katie spends about half the film kvetching screaming at Micoh to turn off the damned camera.<br/><br/>We saw this 2 for 1 so we fared better than most. But really the comparison of this film to horror classics is shameful.<br/><br/>Want to experience real horror right now?

"benmcfee","7","3","7","4 November 2009"," Has some problems. Has some scares. Worth a look.
","This is certainly one of those movies that will either scare you out of your pants, bore you to tears, or have you discussing it until the wee hours of the morning with whoever didn't agree with you.<br/><br/>The premise is familiar. One person described it as a rip-off of ""The Entity"" which can be a fairly accurate criticism, although ""The Entity"" didn't do half as good a job at building suspense as did ""Paranormal Activity."" Katie has been tormented by a malevolent spirit that until recently has confined its actions to hovering over her and making her very nervous. Lately it has been plaguing her with vivid, violent dreams, and making things move. Then her not-so-bright boyfriend Micah decides he knows what to do. He gets a high definition video camera and places it in their room and records the goings on. Although one expert in paranormal activity warns them that documenting this thing may actually aggravate the situation since the demon clearly wants Katie, and is starting to make a move for her, Micah insists Creepy stuff ensues.<br/><br/>WARNING! THE NEXT SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS! READ ONLY AFTER SEEING THE FILM!<br/><br/>What the film did right: <br/><br/>(1) The acting was spot on, and I dare say is the only way that this film had any impact whatsoever. You really feel just horrible for Katie who is clearly in a truly helpless position, and knows it, since this thing is fixated on her and has been tormenting her with horrific dreams when asleep, and subtle (and eventually not-so-subtle) scares when awake. As for the boyfriend Micah, one reviewer commented that he couldn't believe the performance because Micah was just so stupid, controlling and overall frustrating. He was stupid. He had an egotistical attitude that made him think he had control. He never really takes the haunting seriously, in spite of the mental anguish this is clearly causing Katie. He was so frustrating that I found myself wanting to sock him in the face. The actor performed this brilliantly. I had a friend in high school that was the exact copy of Micah; right down to how he handled situations over which he had no control. He's an infuriating character, but real nonetheless.<br/><br/>(2) The special effects, simple and cheap though they were, were incredibly effective (*spoiler* I defy anyone not to get a little chill when the thing drags Katie out of bed *end spoiler*). <br/><br/>(3) The director knew the power of suspense. Something as simple as a light being turned on can be utterly terrifying in the right context. (4) Things happen off camera. Those things are far more scary than slamming doors, or footprints, or Ouija boards, for the same reason that ""Pontypool"" was terrifying in its first hour: what we hear is far more horrific than what we see.<br/><br/>What it did wrong: <br/><br/>(1) The entirety of the terror of this film depends upon a sense of utter helplessness. To create an environment like that, the characters must first do everything they can to remedy the situation only to end up at square one. This didn't happen in ""Paranormal Activity"" largely due to the character of Micah. He just didn't seem to notice, or care, or... I don't know, but he was disconnected from reality in the film, making him a barricade to trying some actual solutions to the problem. He'd just try the same old ""Let's prove there's a monster before we do anything. I'm in charge. This is my house. You're my girlfriend. I solve the problem... by not doing anything."" There's no sense of helplessness here, only a sense of anger with a character who is clearly causing more harm than good. People aren't scared when they're angry (sometimes they're angry when scared, but the two emotions don't always go hand in hand - a mistake that many horror writers are guilty of). I think this is where a lot of people had a problem with this film. Had Micah clued in earlier, brought in the demonologist, discovered that not only was there nothing to be done, but that the monster would keep upping the ante until a very brutal finale, this film would have been ten times scarier. <br/><br/>As it is, there are a lot of good moments, some very scary scenes and sounds, and an overall chill left in the back of your spine. I however, left the theatre feeling pleased and cheated all at the same time."

","First off, there is definitely something to be said about bringing back the camera-in-hand technique that made Cloverfield and Blair Witch such feats of visual and emotional entertainment. This movie, however, stopped short where I feel it could have done so much better. The concept was excellent and creepy. The photo in the attic was exceptionally freaky and actually made my skin crawl a bit when they did that scene. The sound was excellent but I think they took the movie down a wrong turn about 3/4 of the way in. This would have been so much freakier if they had continued along the lines of the entity harassing her physically (when she was pulled from the bed by her ankle, that was extremely powerful) instead of going the ""she has a knife and gets shot by the police"" road.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see more paranormal activity in paranormal activity.

Being a fan of almost every type of horror movie from the old B movies to the best of the best, I enjoy watching creative talent at work and I will have to admit that this was fairly well done for what little it did, Though the idea that the premise of the camera operations were taken from the Blair Witch, I think they could have done more while Katie was holding the camera to get Micah back for his lack of belief and basically being an a**hole."

This film has that ""this is real"" feel to it. And it really does creep you out. There tons of on the edge of your seat moments. I had tears in my eyes from the anxiety and the chills I got from knowing something was going to happen but I didn't know what, when, or how bad the something was going to be. I think what made this film even more creepy and scary is the ""There's no way to avoid it"" feel. The happenings didn't just stop at night, they occurred in the day, which makes any person feel like nothing is safe and that is the worst feeling in the world. Hitchcock would be proud of Paranormal Activity. <br/><br/>My opinion is, if anyone didn't like it... they probably wanted cheap ""jump at you"" scenes, or tons of blood and gore.

I would liken the experience to watching a home movie of complete strangers. Nothing imaginative, including the ending.

","I was very excited to see this movie after hearing all the hype. but as the movie progressed i found myself more and more disappointed. it wasn't scary at all, there was not excitement at all. i would have to say it was one of th worse movies i have ever seen. worse than The Ruins and We are Marshall. i was very disappointed in the overall quality of the movie. there were many useless scenes and numerous attempts of suspense that resulted in emptiness. i'm amazed by how many people thought this was scary. i found myself laughing in situations were i feel i should of been scared, but the movie wasn't scary. normally horror movies don't totally terrify me, but they have me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will happen next, you know suspense. but this movie had no suspense what so ever"

","The movie sucked! Who's writing these reviews, the crews family? There were only two parts in the whole move that were ""scary"" and they were both in the commercial. They call this the scariest movie ever! Is this the only horror film you people saw! I was in a packed theater and no one even screamed. We were actually laughing more at some of the one liners Micah says and the comments the audience made about how bad the film was! It took so long for something paranormal to actually happen and when it finally did it was just a door moving. This movie is a scripted version of Ghost Hunters that costs 10 bucks. Save your money and turn off the lights at home and pop in a real horror flick like Texas Chainsaw Massacre!"

","Okay. I saw the trailer for this movie, and I was shocked at the hype it was receiving. I ""demanded"" that it be released everywhere in hopes of seeing ""one of the greatest horror movies ever made"". I missed Where the Wild Things Are (a movie i have eagerly awaited since i heard of its production) to see Paranormal Activity with some friends after a long week of college classes. It starts off so slow that I literally almost fell asleep. When it gets to the creepy parts, they are more funny than frightening. I will admit that I jumped a few times, but it was still the most hyped/worst movie i have ever seen (Transformers 2 is included). I highly recommend that you don't see this movie. Spend it on something that will actually entertain you, like the Hangover when it comes out on DVD."
"trypanophobic34","7","3","7","10 October 2009"," Worth seeing...
","FOR ME the scare factor for this was highly overrated. It's kind of creepy, but it's never really outright scary, it nowhere near plumbs the depths of terror. I would say the movies that have scared me the most are The Ring and The Orphanage. I think maybe why it isn't very scary is because it's not visually explicit/vivid so it lacks real terror - that doesn't mean every horror movie needs to have an actual monster depicted or ghastly-looking things happening, but it is why Paranormal Activity isn't anywhere near as scary as horror movies can be. This does have tension building up sometimes, but trust me, it's not exactly a visceral, super powerful, heart-pounding kind of experience like people have been saying. I would say the scariest part of it was in the last few minutes.<br/><br/>I don't think what this movie does is that original, the personal-camera-perspective thing is a bit like movies like Cloverfield. And the dialogue is not super intelligent. But I do applaud their making a movie entirely without special effects, other than a few visual tricks, and leaving the horror entirely implicit. It's not really anything like The Blair Witch Project, I don't know why people are comparing it to that other than the minimalist/non-explicit aspect.<br/><br/>The guy, Micah, is kind of stupid and annoying, grossly insensitive to his girlfriend at times, and therefore not realistic in that way. I don't think he should have acted as he did, and he's just not a very strong part of the movie. That's not to say he's just totally an idiot that we can't relate to. But I think the strongest part of it is actually Katie's performance towards the end, her reactions to the hauntings as they become more personally targetted and escalated; it really is how you would feel and act. I really felt for her then, I was sorry for her. To see someone in so much suffering and horror is very moving.<br/><br/>So is it scary? Not really. But it's still worth seeing, pretty enjoyable, and a little bit different, despite the moderate weakness of the dialogue and Micah's acting/behavior."

'Paranormal Activity' is, hands-down, the scariest atmospheric horror movie I have ever seen, and is the scariest ""shakey camera"" film, having more thrills and chills than 'The Blair Witch Project'. In addition, I can safely say that this film is one of -- if not THE -- scariest movies ever to grace the big screen. It is right up there with 'Les Diaboliques', 'The Exorcist' and 'Psycho'. If you are truly a fan of horror films, this is a film you do not want to miss, as it is a gem of a film, for such a small budget -- $15,000 is what was spent to make this film."

","I just have to give this a ten. It absolutely scared the crap out of me and as far as horror movies go, that is the result I want and hardly ever get. Is Paranormal Activity a ""perfect"" film? No. It does have flaws, but the intent was to creep the viewers out with the thought possibly, just possibly, hauntings are not only real, but could be demonic and cause great harm. The suspension of disbelief is very effective in this film for those who allow their own fantasy and imagination to take over - able to consider the plausibility that something like this could ACTUALLY happen to them. For those who hated this film, I don't think they got that. All the claims that it was ""boring"" indicate to me that these individuals lack the will to give over to the seduction of their own imagination. That said, I do think that a movie can be built up too which can ruin the viewers experience. This is why I try to know as little as possible before watching a movie. My husband and I really had a minimal concept of the basis of the film and definitely had no idea as to any reviews or that there were people who were raving about the film (or otherwise).

Other than that, all it was was alternating day scenes of the couple arguing over camera usage (which you know is going to be kept on as that is what the ""movie"" was shot with) and sleep scenes which were mostly nothing with an occasional scary sound effect or cheesy visual effect. After about the 3rd one of these sleep scenes, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief as I kept thinking, ""How are they able to stay in that house, let alone try and go back to sleep?""

","Probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. I've been more scared listening to static.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes nothing happens. Then the demon starts harassing the young couple. But the only harassing part is the boyfriend. His girlfriend is obviously terrified and instead of supporting her and protecting her, he keeps filming her constantly and he refuses to stop when she asks him to. The guy is an a**hole. I was not scared at any point, just wanted to beat the hell out of the boyfriend for being such a d*ck towards his girlfriend. At one point he is actually jealous, because the demon likes the girlfriend and not him. How retarded is this guy? Then there are all the dumb dumb flaws. The couple calls a demonologist (a con-artist) before anything has happened at all. The audience should be as scared as the couple but we're not. And because of that we could not care less.<br/><br/>They film a lot during the day and then it looks like a reality show. If they wanted it to be scary they should only have filmed at night and the couple should have acted like rational normal people living in a haunted house.<br/><br/>When something finally starts to happen, it's a door closing all by it self. So lame!! And speaking of the door. The demon always enter the bedroom through the door. Why don't the couple just close the door at night?? It would at least make them feel safe. And if they're really so scared how come they can sleep like babies every night? Except when, they're awaken by noises and the girlfriend acts possessed.<br/><br/>Why don't they leave the house a lot earlier? Why don't they ask friends to sleep over and keep the lights on at night? When the boyfriend finally stops being a selfish pr*ck and finally decides, it's time to leave, he instead, burns a wooden cross in the fireplace and they stay in the house after all. I could go an and on about the countless plot holes in this moronic movie.<br/><br/>At the end the boyfriend dies so it ends happily. All though the lame cgi should have been avoided.<br/><br/>The only thing that kept me and my body awake through this snooze-fest was that the girlfriend was pretty and hot with big boops.<br/><br/>Why it is considered one of the scariest movies ever made is completely beyond me."

"Hiculi","10","2","4","27 October 2010"," In my opinion, one of the scariest movies ever made.
","So, the reason why I'm writing this review is because I'm seeing way too many bad reviews given about this movie. It makes me really wonder, how many of those reviewers did really EXPERIENCE PA, not just SEE it.<br/><br/>Sadly, I have noticed that one of the main reasons people don't like this movie is because they didn't ""watch"" it properly. Yes, I'm talking about people who download it, then watch it from their computers and wonder why it was so boring and not scary at all. If you watched it like that, no wonder you hate PA.<br/><br/>I saw PA in the cinema, and if possible, do the same thing yourselves. If not, grab the DVD/Blu-ray (or computer if you downloaded it, but I'd recommend either DVD/Blu-ray) and be sure to watch it with proper audio, not some silly computer-stereos or similar. A quality home-theater with at least 5.1 audio should do the trick with the volume at MAXIMUM. This movies tension is so much based on the atmosphere the sounds create, and thus watching it with low-volume will only ruin it. I'd prefer watching it in dark too.<br/><br/>If you saw it (or will see it) at movie-theaters or watched it at home in ""the most movie-theater mimicking environment"", and still didn't like it, there's no helping it. People tend to like different kind of movies, different kind of horror etc. For example, I liked this movie a lot, and the movie I hate the most is Martyrs, which many people seem to like and which is a big-piece of crap in my opinion. PA and Martyrs are horror movies worlds-apart from each other. Note, my point is not to say that Martyrs is ""the worst movie ever"" nor that PA is better than it. My main point is that people like different things.<br/><br/>There is one aspect still left that can make this movie a scary experience for you and that is: the less you know about the plot and happenings, the better it is. My tip is not to even watch the trailer or any similar media about it. I'd be stupid if I said that ""the better PA is the less you know about it"". Why would I be writing this damn review then? <br/><br/>I you have already seen PA, I highly believe it won't be scary anymore on the 2nd watch, even if you liked it the 1st time or not. At least thats what happened to me. I found it scary only the 1st time I saw it in theaters, and after that it hasn't been that scary though I've watched it several times at home, volume maxed out and at night (had the volume so high that things started falling because of the bass, lol). It scares you to the bone only the first time you watch it.<br/><br/>I didn't focus on certain things in the movie, like acting and stuff, because everything that matters to me in a movie is the entirety or ""big-picture"" it creates.<br/><br/>I personally recommend this movie to any horror fan or average-Joe, but under the circumstances that you watch it in the PERFECT atmosphere and environment this movie deserves."
"Seventy7","1","2","4","26 October 2010"," There's no such thing as a bad film...
","Unless you're talking about the Door by Tommy Wissau, but this is not what we're talking about.<br/><br/>I believe this movie was the most over-hyped movie I've ever seen. It uses the ""shockumentary"" style in a very unique way. The cam isn't shaky, and for 85% of the film, the camera is stationary. That usually doesn't make for a very exciting movie, but to see things unfold when they do is what makes the movie interesting. It doesn't rely on guts, gore, sex, and explosions to make the movie shocking, though calling it ""Hitchcockian movie style"" is an exaggeration. But I must admit, not knowing what the thing looks like (The only thing we know is that it has frog feet), and how it's threatened over and over again that we're going to see it is what keeps the viewer interested.<br/><br/>Now the bad points. The relationship, even though it does come off as genuine and cute, the common sense of both characters just astounds me. Though it does boil down to the curiosity of the boyfriend, either he was curious as hell to see the demon in it's real form, or he was just flat out stupid. If you're warned it's a demon, you don't get a Ouija board... If you KNOW that it's best to let the demon alone and run it's course and not to let anyone with any clairvoyance in... You don't. You don't try and antagonize or goad it on by leaving powder on the floor or even speaking to it, hell even letting it know that you fear it.<br/><br/>Though I don't blame Kaity, I just wish she weren't such a weak individual. The way he spoke as if he were the ""man of the house"" and had that ""I own you attitude"" I would've grabbed him by the balls with a pair of pliers and said ""Shut up. You don't own me, I have just as much as a say and action in this as you do. In fact, since this is my demon, you have no business dabbling in it."" Perhaps the movie would have been more interesting and taken a different (and perhaps unexpected turn) if Kaity where to have worn her ovaries on the outside and made SURE that her boyfriend left it alone. If he didn't she would leave him. I believe that the relationship wasn't a vital part of the movie, Kaity was.<br/><br/>All in all, this goes against what you think is going to happen. It utilizes irony somewhat, and has very subtle scares that keep you interested, but all in all, it's a very mediocre and student film.<br/><br/>To sum it up: Weak, somewhat dumb characters, good acting, great concept that should've been portrayed better."

","This movie sounded like something I would enjoy. I like scary movies when they're done well. Sometimes they can even be fun when they are so overdone that they become comedies (example: Drag Me to Hell). This movie did not work on any level. They only element of suspense was wondering when something interesting or scary would happen, and perhaps when or if the mystery of what was going on might be revealed. Unfortunately, nothing really interesting or scary ever does happen. After dragging out about 10 minutes worth of content into 80 minutes it seems like the writers or director finally decided to end the misery for the audience and throw in an ending scene. I think the movie just might have been written during the filming of the nightly ""activity"" (or inactivity would be more accurate in most cases). The basic concept of the movie had some potential, but it was not developed at all. I place this movie in my personal list of the worst movies of all time."

","As a horror movie fanatic, I expected a good scare form this movie once word was all over the internet that this movie was ""the scariest film of the decade"" or something. Heck, this thing even beat ""Saw VI"" at the box-office! There had to be a good reason why a low budget horror film could dethrone Saw from the box-office number one spot. While I was not expecting it to beat ""The Shinning,"" I was at least hoping for something worthwhile. Boy, was I ripped-off.<br/><br/>The premise is fine; the demonic possession of one member of a loving couple caught on video camera... why not? It's like ""The Exorcist"" from the point of view of ""Cloverfield;"" admittedly it was an interesting idea. But just because the idea was interesting doesn't mean the movie's any good.<br/><br/>The ""scares"" in this movie include an Ouija board burning itself, a girl dragged out of a room by an unseen phantom, etc. If people screamed their asses of watching this, then I'm sad to say that the quality of horror has degraded further than expected. The ""scary"" scenes occur during the night, which means lots of daytime boredom in between. Majority of the film was enough for me to wish that the two would just die and end the movie but no, they had to have some sort of ""character development"" in this pathetic excuse of a horror film. The film also takes too much time to move its story, killing the tension between the night time scenes as you get bored rather than getting pumped up for the next time the phantom makes an appearance. And when you do get to the night time scenes, you'll end up WANTING the phantom to appear to stop the boredom.<br/><br/>By far one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, skip this if you want good horror. And what's even worse, there are plans of a sequel or even a franchise. Like the Twilight series, I know this thing will suck but it will earn a lot anyways because of sheer popularity and nothing more."

That freak you out people? c'mon The Blair Witch Project was good, kind of scary and original. But this movie is pure garbage. For real...I turned the video off close to an hour into the movie. I rather watch wedding videos of people I don't even know. The only scary thing about this movie is that they are making a sequel and most likely a bunch of mentally handicap people will soiled themselves over a freaking curtain moving back and forth....and they wont shut up about how scary this it. Save yourself the time and pain and watch a video of Rosie O'Donnell doing an striptease instead....because that would be definitely scary."
"fedor8","Null","2","4","25 February 2010"," Plenty of ""Normal Activity"" for a (home-)movie claiming to offer the paranormal.
","People continually going upstairs downstairs is rather normal activity. People sleeping between midnight and morning I hear is quite common behavior too. Not to mention the exciting arguments over whether the movie's main camera should be recording the trivial proceedings or not. But I guess the movie's title must be referring to the inexplicable hence supernatural effect the movie had of people screaming in theaters as they watched it, their Neanderthal jaws dropping in horror. Only black magic can account for this turkey raking in as much dough as it did.<br/><br/>Just because a dozen or so little ol' ladies shrieked in horror while watching PA (they were probably given free tickets by the cunning producers) and then ran out of the theater gasping for air, doesn't mean that the rest of the audience were shaking in terror too. I refuse to believe all those idiotic hype-reports of people fainting while watching this 35-cent crap-o-rama. Or are today's audiences truly that stupid? Have years of viewing Nicholas Cage action flicks and Meryl Streep dramas so exhausted/drained the viewers's collective brains? What's next, a Summer blockbuster comedy filmed by pre-schoolers, which consists of 90 minutes of little boys hitting each other with their Transformers' toys? I don't want to know what historical dramas will look like in 5 years (Actually, they already stink; see ""Alexander""...) <br/><br/>A bland yuppie and his chesty but plain-looking (and only slightly less annoying) girlfriend spend several weeks going up and down the stairs in their haunted house, while she berates him for trying to make a low-budget piece of crap horror flick for very easily scared viewers. In the meantime, an inept ghost – who probably failed all his Terrorizing the Living courses at Netherworld University – does all he can to frighten them. The fact that the plot makes it all the way to a ""Night 18"" caption sufficiently describes how well the spook had succeeded. You almost gotta feel sorry for the poor undead sap.<br/><br/>Why any demon - no matter how lonely, bored, or intellectually hollow he/she/it might be – would actually bother to spend several weeks with these knuckleheads, that's the real mystery here. The couple should have hired a demon-shrink, not a ""demonologist"" (an old f**t who leaves the house like a coward at first opportunity - a hilarious bit). After all, all a ""demonologist"" can really tell them is what they already know, i.e. that a semi-retarded, barely competent ghost had moved into the house to steal the guy's girlfriend (apparently spooks love big breasts too), but a demon-shrink, on the other hand, could have actually gotten to the bottom of this poor spirit's true mental problems. Perhaps he wasn't loved by his demon parents, or perhaps he just realized that the only way to stop this movie from going on forever is to kill its main protagonist slash director slash cameraman slash day-broker who says ""dude"" and ""like"" in most sentences slash unconvincing and dull moron slash Micah.<br/><br/>Most of the movie consists of the two birdbrains stating the obvious (pointlessly summarizing/commenting on what the viewer had seen just minutes earlier) and then going to bed to lie around while we watch the ghost's feeble attempts to assert himself as the star of the movie. So lousy are the demon's terror-less antics that he can't even get a highly strung woman to panic enough to actually physically leave the house. Instead, Katie starts feeling pity for the ghost, and eventually falls in love with him, allowing him to possess her rather chunky body (plenty of space there).<br/><br/>In the end, we get rewarded with the movie's one truly well-shot scene, the one with the hapless yuppie getting slammed into the camera (a Mikah death is a good death, regardless of the manner in which his torso gets hurled). But was that one good scene worth the 85 minutes of pure tedium and in-your-face proud-to-be-crap amateurism? Worse yet, this good scene is followed by Katie smirking into the camera and then assaulting it to eat it? Her figure does suggest a rather undiscriminating diet, so<br/><br/>There's a good reason why fantasy-based horror films only have a chance at being effective when they're STYLISH, i.e. when there is actual effort, talent and money involved. Movies about junkies or lower-class families screaming at each other are sometimes made in low-budget kitchen-sink mode, but that works for (riff-raff) dramas only. You can't expect me to get spooked by a moron with a hand-held camera who talks like a college meat-head, and a dilettante who plays his girlfriend with the conviction of an F-student reading his history report on George III.<br/><br/>Still, for whatever it's worth, ""Paranormal Activity"" it still scarier than ""The Blair Witch Project"". What I mean to say is that TBWP is ""Bambi"" to PA's ""Fantasia""."
"kennychaggerty","7","2","4","15 February 2010"," A Modern Classic Horror Flick
","I remember one time I was in a restroom and out of nowhere the sink came on (was not a sensor sink). At the time I simply figured the plumbing somehow short circuited, but who knows. Perhaps some supernatural ghost or demon was haunting the bathroom and was trying to tell me to wash my hands. Most people have had something unexplainable happen to them, and it just depends on the individual to decide whether the cause was coincidence or if there is such a thing as ghost.<br/><br/>In Paranormal Activity a young couple begins questioning the weird sounds in the night and the mysterious things that happen while they sleep. In an attempt to get evidence of the ghost or demon haunting their house, the husband named Micah buys a video camera to try and catch the ""paranormal activities"" on tape. Day by day the camera records stranger and more evidential activities of demons in the house, who appear to be trying to control the body of the wife named Katie. The couple has no idea what to do because the demon seems to have been following Katie since she was a small girl. They want to leave the house but they know that the demon will only bring torment to other people they come into contact with. Micah wants to figure out the problem, but his pride and reckless personality does not allow himself to call for help. Katie just feels desperate, confused, and guilty. She doesn't understand why this is happening to her and simply wants it to go away (who wouldn't).<br/><br/>What is very frightening about Paranormal Activity is despite its extremely low budget, it is one of the most believable horror films ever made. It is shot with a hand-held camera and with simple effects, which makes it almost look like a home movie. With this in mind, Paranormal Activity makes the audience question those sounds they may hear in the night. This is what makes this film really scary and unique. So if you like horror films, Paranormal Activity is a must see. First time director Oren Peli has proved that a big-budget, experience and all-star actors are not needed to make a top-notch horror film. All it takes is an original, interesting idea and 10,000 dollars (The Paranormal Activity budget) to scare people out of their seats."

","The scariest cinema experience of my life.<br/><br/>This was due largely to the fact that I was the only person in the largest screen in my local multiplex. This was such a privilege.<br/><br/>This reason this film worked for me is because of the threat that I felt. The audience is the camera, therefore the audience is the cause of the disturbance. The demon is conscious of the camera from the very beginning, hence the audience is constantly threatened.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the scares are so effective as they can be the exact thing that we hear in our house. SPOILER. the door creak, the light swinging, the whispers. All things that lets our imagination run riot. The demon is never revealed allowing the viewer to created the image of the scariest demon they can possibly imagine, Instead of being let down by some crap monster that has been created for you.<br/><br/>The sense of peril when descending into the night sequences and the deep murmuring sounds works perfectly. As well as the clock speeding up then slowing down when an event is about to take place. This simple effect builds up so much suspense that I found my breathing becoming deeper and faster whilst watching.<br/><br/>The helplessness that is felt as well with the clever use that the house isn't haunted and instead she is solves the classic ""why don't the just leave dilemma"". This is also heightened once the psychic enters but is unable to stay for any period of time.<br/><br/>It is at this point where impending doom besets the audience and the final horrifying sequence delivers exactly that. With the audience trapped within the camera the unknown happens downstairs again letting the imagination go crazy. Finally the demon recognises the camera and sends out a final punch to the viewer.<br/><br/>Good old nuts and bolds scares with original ideas and simple yet effective mind tricks and scares.<br/><br/>Immpressive"

The film follows Katie and Micah as they try to record bizarre events that are happening around their home.<br/><br/>Maybe it was due to the fact that I watched it on my own or maybe it was because I used headphones. But Paranormal Activity made me jump and shiver more than a few times. The strange events get more intense as the film goes on and as a result the tension is built up brilliantly.

","This is your basic no-frills scary movie. But oh my, how very effective those simple techniques can be. The last movie to scare me as much as this one did was ""The Strangers,"" another film that proved high-tech special effects and exorbitant budgets are not necessary in the production of a genuinely scary film. The documentary style this film uses definitely creates a sense of credibility and realism. Comparisons to ""The Blair Witch Project"" are inevitable, and BWP probably paved the way for films like this and ""Cloverfield."" I simply see it as the development of a genre--and that's a good thing. If you like to have the s*** scared out of you, rent this one, turn off all the lights, and prepare to be spooked."

","The movie is boring, predictable and not scary. Characters are extremely stupid and unconvincing. E.g. they are very scared, but they would not turn on the lights when paranormal activity starts. They would not close or lock the door at night. The Psychic character, with paranormal experience, shits his pants and can't stand a second in the house - that should makes us scared? Come on, better watch an episode of Hounted Homes with Mia Dolan, it is more scary and Mia's ""acting"" is better.<br/><br/>The only realistic and convincing part is when cops come and kill the woman without a blink of the eye. They report shooting and go on as nothing happened, even not bothering to check if she is still alive or not. That's the sad truth we are living in, and the scariest part of the movie."
"homecoming8","4","2","4","10 January 2010"," Very Overrated ""Blair Witch Project in a house""...
","""Scariest Movie of all time"", just one of the tag-lines that totally over-hyped this simple low budget movie. It immediately reminds you of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"". Also filmed with a home camera that the people around it are aware of. ""Blair Witch"" set the standards for that one, although ""The Last Broadcast"" was a similar movie that was produced before the original ""Blair Witch"" but that was not a surprise hit, so not too many people know that movie. ""Blair Witch"" certainly had it's impact on some people because it was a new way of showing terror. When it was released on VHS and DVD in 1999, I owned a videostore and people who returned the movie sometimes asked me if it was real. (I'm not joking, some people actually thought it really happened). ""Paranormal Activity"" takes on the same path, except that this time it revolves around a haunting in a house. the ghost ,or what is later considered a demon, follows the woman, so it is not housebound. I watched the so-called ALTERNATE CUT (with the murder (?) and suicide) but besides that, nothing really happens here. Just one location with 2 people mostly. It gets boring and the story is not exciting or scary. The only scary thing is that it could be real, hauntings do seem to exist in real life. That is also what they try to sell to the audience. Worth a look, certainly because of all the fuzz, but do not expect too much.."
"BarbaraEvans","9","2","4","10 January 2010"," Absolutely a MUST-SEE
","Wow. That is the only thing I can say. I mean, how often in these days do we see a horror movie where YOU are the one searching for anything in the darkness, or feeling like you're there with them? Or even turning the head in the camera direction to see ""beyond"" even if you know you can't (oops, I guess that was just me LOL)? I must say that, naturally, if you want to be really freaked out by music and typical stuff then don't go with higher expectations, cause it's not like that. AT ALL. Which is the fantastic key point in this. What I love was that you can see at first how she's like almost used to all this to happen with her limits, and when they break those limits it all turns out of control. Also, Micah is so much fun to see (and hear, mostly) because he's so realistic! I mean, there's always someone eager to do the ""paranormal stuff"", then don't take it seriously, and finally end up being the most damaged. I have to admit he's my favorite character, but Katie's performance was really cool, dramatic, and believable. Effects were AWESOME. I read someone's review that said that in most movies you cover your eyes when what you should do is cover your ears because that's the only thing that scares you the most. And it's true! Well, here you'll be no longer distracted by scary music, but you'll not close your eyes either cause you'll now you're about to lose everything. Suddenly the light turns on and you're thinking ""ooooooohh"". Why saying more stuff to convince you to see it? GO! Even if you're convinced it will not do the effect you want, this is something that you won't regret because it is not the worst-best movie ever made. Although, I think it will be so much more scary if you see it all concentrated. My opinion? As much as a must-see as Titanic and The Exorcist."

There was promise of a demonologist, but that didn't go anywhere, at least that might have been funny.

"jccwu","6","2","4","12 November 2009"," One major flaw that hurts the entire film!
","Paranormal Activity could have been more than just a very scary movie, but due to a specific major flaw, the entire film falls into being unbelievable & absurd; wasting every realistic aspect to the movie that it tried so hard to be.<br/><br/>There are two main characters in the movie. You have the female/girlfriend character (Katie) and the male/boyfriend character (Micah); where the ghost/demon/entity is haunting the young couple. Now, the major flaw that lies in this movie is the Micah character. The personality and actions by the boyfriend is so idiotic, unrealistic, selfish and illogical. Micah is absolutely STUPID and his character literally ruins the whole movie, where I actually started to root for the demon! As I watched the beginning of this film, I was very intrigued in where the story was taking me; but as the movie progresses, the Micah character is very distracting, by all his ridiculous personality & actions. After numerous paranormal activities that Micah had already captured on his own camera, I officially lost interest to the film after the boyfriend said ""What the f**k was that!"" for the 20th time! The actress who portrays Katie did a fantastic job and had a believable performance; but due to the distractions of Micah's unrealistic behaviors, his performance even begins to hurt Katie's role by the time the film nears its conclusion.<br/><br/>The major reason why Micah's character seems absolutely disjointed is his lack of concern for his girlfriend. In the beginning of the film, it's brought to our attention that the two are a young couple who are ""engaged to be engaged"", so we're assuming that they absolutely love each other. Maybe Micah isn't the brightest guy in the world, or maybe he was very interested in seeing ghostly activities; but nevertheless, there is no way a loving boyfriend would ever put his girlfriend through so much grief & agony for his own selfish indulgences.<br/><br/>Other than the flaws in the boyfriend's character, the visuals in this amateur film were excellently done! All the bedroom scenes gave you chills and most importantly, you thought about those sequences after the movie ended; especially when you got home to your own bedroom. This film was creepy and I give the filmmakers absolute kudos for accomplishing that with a minimal budget.<br/><br/>I may seem highly critical & harsh on this amateur film, but this movie had so much potential and I really wanted this film to work. ""Character Writing"" is the most important ingredient to a story, and when the audience starts to loose sympathy for the victims in peril, then there is something seriously wrong with the main characters. If only the writer/director Oren Peli decided to rewrite & restructure the boyfriend character, Paranormal Activity could have been a brilliant horror film."

","Not sure exactly how they did it, but as some others here have said better than I can ""less is more."" Very low budget. Only a handful of actors, two primarily, none well known. Limited set, a house. Not much else.<br/><br/>That this film does work, is a genuine scarefest, has as much to with the lack of pretentious trappings as it does the engagement of the viewer's imagination. The house could be almost any house or duplex anywhere in the USA, and many parts of the world. The protagonists could be any young people. They're not totally nondescript, they just don't have exceptional traits calling attention to themselves. The situation-- ----strange nighttime occurrences and sounds-------is the stuff of conversation anywhere you go.<br/><br/>So why does the film work so well?<br/><br/>Verisimilitude. It's all credible. The actors, the set(s), the scenario, the weirdness-----all credible. It doesn't stretch the viewer with convoluted plot detail. So the midbrain stays more involved in the action than the cerebrum . . . . . thoughts are kept at a minimum, while fears are played to. By restricting thought, viewers are brought into a heightened emotional state. The viewer's visual search for something out of the ordinary on the recording video when time passes and nothing has happened keeps the endocrine system in high alert. I noted that it was difficult to NOT look at the screen at such times, and I sensed that the same was true for everyone in the theater: The movie cajoles watchfulness. When we become so attentive, we move into a different internal state, a more alert state than regular waking consciousness. This movie lulls the viewer into that state gradually and convincingly. The final effect when the movie ends is that we are left in that state: ""Deer in the Headlights"" ---no one moves out of pure uncertainty, out of crippling fear.<br/><br/>And isn't this precisely what a good horror film ought to do?<br/><br/>I give the makers all the credit in the world. They either lucked into this one, or they're more genius than they realize. And from the profits this one is generating, they'll be able to explore their talent again."

This is true, except it is important because it sets up the final 15 minutes that will blow you away. Taking a page out of Hitchcock, this film follows the belief that taking time to set up a sequence helps make the payoff more effective. We start out by seeing a young couple living in suburban San Diego. We learn very little about them or their relationship, which also makes it more effective, and we can only see what the camera will let us. Of course, part of the reason this film has become famous is due to the fact that it uses mostly a standstill camera method in order to explain what is happening. Never once do we see something without one of the characters actually taking hold of the camera and showing us.<br/><br/>Part of the genius of this movie is in the fact that it uses very realistic and even funny moments to make the scary ones more unsettling. We see the couple argue, tease and love each other. We can relate to them and we fear for their safety. This is in no small part thanks to the two actors, Katie Featherston and Micach Sloat, who seem to not even be portraying characters but simply doing what comes naturally to them.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, more strange things happen and thanks to Micah's obsession with trying to figure this out we get to see nearly all of it. The ending comes at a great shock and though some will complain that it is too over-the-top or Hollywood-ish, it does deliver the biggest scare and helps end the film on a most ominous tone. So, if you haven't seen this gem yet, do so. Just like its father, 1999's The Blair Witch Project, this is downright, bare bones effective film-making. If only others would pay more heed to this."
"sschimel","8","2","4","28 October 2009"," Genuinely creepy
","As someone who likes scary movie but hates torture porn, I was a little skeptical of this movie, especially since it was so hyped. I have to say that it was probably the most genuinely scary movie since The Haunting (1963). Proving that a movie doesn't need to have a huge special effects budget or the latest in CGI effects, the movie is very effective at building suspense, all the way through to the wonderful ending. My quibble with the movie is the characters seem to waffle. Katie is either scared and trusting that her husband will solve things or she's barking at him. Micah is either an insensitive jerk or a hero (and Micah the actor, who is gorgeous in a Ben Affleck sort of way, is more believable as a jerk than as a hero). Like the original The Haunting, there's a lot of suspense between the big scares. Like the over-the-top remake of The Haunting, there is room for this to be remade (which was the original plan, with this version on the DVD) really badly with lots of special effects. I hope that doesn't happen. The box office for this movie proves that there is a market for well-made, creative, low budget, and really creepy movies without all of the gore and torture of the Hostels, Saws, and Halloweens."

","I like indie films - I love hearing ""the little engine that could"" stories in show business - so good for the filmmakers and actors. But this movie did not work for me at all. The VERY end was effective but so what? Everything else that led up to it did not scare or terrify. In fact who knew hauntings could be so boring? This slightly annoying couple argue - the camera is providing the only real evidence to her case and yet the girl says over and over ""turn off that stupid camera!"". If only he had. And look, I liked Blair Witch Project a lot - I felt that once that movie got going, the scares built and built to the climax. Here - we see a sheet move, we hear a bang, etc. And I have no problem with movies taking their time and being subtle but for the sheer use of sound to scare someone - rent the original The Haunting - a Robert Wise film - excellent ghost story that uses sound very effectively. People keep saying ""can you believe they made this film for only 11 grand?"" And I'm like ""Yes! Yes I can! It looks cheap and it is full of cheap thrills. No thrills really.""

","Greetings again from the darkness. With an all out frontal assault on our fears of what happens while we sleep, writer/director Oren Peli, takes a page from Blair Witch Project and presents this as actual footage. Instead of a bunch of nausea-inducing, running through the woods holding a camera ... Peli gives us a slightly more controlled video package from our lead players, Micah and Katie.<br/><br/>Neither Micah nor Katie have any real acting ability, and I believe were cast because they come across as believable. Actually, as the movie went on, I found both a bit annoying and found myself rooting for the demon after awhile. Seriously, there are some very creepy moments which I won't give away and I did enjoy the approach of the stalking demon, instead of a possessed house.<br/><br/>As for a fright factor, I still rank The Shining and Poltergeist as far superior but these days, any horror film that doesn't involve major slashers has to be commended.

","First, let me say that I thought the movie was good. The script was well written, the idea was interesting, and the acting was fantastic. It's hard to find a movie that does such a good job of making the characters seem realistic, and I'm not sure I've felt a connection to the actors this well in a while. That being said, the movie was boring.<br/><br/>Now, there were genuinely suspenseful parts, and parts where I was more than a little creeped out, but it was in a boring way. These parts were few and far between, and each one seemed very anticlimactic. I hardly ever watch scary movies because I get scared fairly easy, but watching this alone, in a dark room, at two in the morning, I barely felt spooked. To me, most of the scary events were more like ""wow, that's kind of weird"" moments instead of ""holy freaking cow I'm going to wet myself if I try to sleep tonight"" moments.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the ending, I thought, was appropriate and well done. I saw the original ending and, while a little anticlimactic, I thought it fit perfectly. The theatrical ending I looked up online, and, while it was scarier, seemed like it was in a completely different movie.<br/><br/>The verdict: Good from a cinematic point of view, but seriously failed to scare."

If a demon grasp my leg and drag me through the hallway of my house I can guarantee you that I'll be running away from the house at light speed. I'll not be returning to my bedroom to cry on the floor. Ridiculous!! Reminded me of the terrible 'The Hunting in Conneticut' Movies like 'Blair Witch Project' and more recent movies like 'Rec'('Quarantine') or even 'The Decent'(which uses a hand-held camera in some scenes) where a lot more effective creating horror and spooky moments. So far 'Rec' is my favorite hand-held-camera-horror movie.<br/><br/>The main problem with 'Paranormal Activity' is the lack of inventiveness or creativity. Moving doors, moving flowers, strange shadows, burning Ouijas, loud food steps. All I saw was cheap special effects. Did you see the lame exorcism video the boyfriend found on the internet? Instead of been spooky it was cheap.<br/><br/>I was hopping that the video footage had some sort of hidden mystery; something else was recorded that we did not see because we where fixated looking at the moving doors, moving flowers, strange shadows, burning Ouijas, loud food steps.

"Volrath20991","1","2","4","24 October 2009"," Please....
","I want to set the record straight here and now with Paranormal Activity. In my opinion... This was the most awful display of horror I have ever witnessed... Ever. The Movie is brilliantly shot, great performances by the cast (i mean they aren't Super! great but they played their parts well) Sound was executed well. I mean when you boil everything down there was little money... So you look for faults as to Why there's no horror. The writer/Dir, must have had some crazy illusion/fantasy and must have really thought this was gonna scare people because no one in the theater was screaming, jumping, Anything... Matter of fact many people laughed (myself included) at many of these ""horror"" scenes.<br/><br/>Im gonna try to dissect this a little more for you, The film is on a documentary hype trying to best the Blair witch project in my opinion and it fails terribly. The entire movie was strings, mirrors and a few little fire effects. Nothing gruesome or horrifying up until the last scene where she gets possessed and does what? nothing because they don't say anything afterward its like a big joke that no one got. Everyone saw the ending and started marching straight to the ticket counter for refunds. I mean I was bored almost the entire time up until the last scene where I thought the movie was getting somewhere... Obviously not. Its either a bad attempt to make a sequel or just terrible writing/directing of the film leaving everyone in the theater waiting for something to happen other than the OBVIOUS!<br/><br/>I will say one more thing; If my little comment wasn't enough to convince you not to go, then I encourage you to go, waste your money and be terribly upset for not listening. I want to stress the upset for not listening part, honestly the 10 bucks to see this wasn't the worst part. What makes me upset is this big god damn joke everyone keeps trying to pull on IMDb telling people this movie is good. It is Not... I repeat not good. You have to be either extremely Dense or still in diapers to be afraid by the antics performed in this movie. I went to see this movie with high expectations after reading these ""great"" reviews; Despite my instincts (by instincts i meant watching the trailer was sufficient to see this movie was not up to par with its cohorts or for people to compare it to great movies which really just discredits these idiots who call themselves movie critics)telling me to avoid it in theaters and wait for a DVD release.

","I got a DVD copy of Paranormal Activity today (With the original ending) and decided to sit down with my subway sandwich and a friend and watch the film. I have to say, it was a good attempt at a scary film, but non-the-less, needs some work.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Micah and Katie, a couple who have moved into a home together and discover that Katie is being followed by a demonic entity. First off and foremost, I will give credit to both Micah and Katie (Yes their real names are the same as their characters) for an outstanding performance. Not exactly Marlon Brando, but a lot better then Christian bale and most actors out there. As for the crew working behind the camera, this movie needs some work. I went into this film expecting to be frightened to the edge of my seat, but instead just kinda sat there going ""Wow what is the director thinking??"" and ""Hey I can see the stop motion animation there!"". Honestly, were talking about the film that scared Steven Spielberg so much he left the theater. Really? Maybe Spielberg should stick to blues clues.<br/><br/>The movie does have its strengths though, for example throughout the whole film I felt as if I was watching a home movie or some old footage filmed from a family trip (Which I'm hoping was intentional by the filmmakers, otherwise I retract this statement). Also the actors/actresses did a good job improvising the entire script (Yes, the whole thing was improvised). Also in the beginning of the film, a psychic tells the couple that the demon is fueled somewhat by anger and frustration, and the more the couple argue, the more violent the demon became (Sort of like Katie's inner demon), which I thought was a good use of symmetry. <br/><br/>Still, the movie got too much hype. During the first ""Night scene"" my heart was racing because I was expecting something to have me quaking in my boots, but after it failed to scare me, the rest of the movie I just kind of sat there going ""Oh hey look the sheets moved.... aahhhh?"" <br/><br/>I appreciate the film for trying to scare people Alfred Hitchcock style, as opposed to just gore fests (Like most mediocre horror films today such as Saw), but this movie failed to deliver. When I order pizza for delivery and its not here in 30 minutes, its free. Your 30 minutes is up Paranormal Activity, wheres my money back?<br/><br/>Oh and before I forget, If you want a scary movie that REALLY gets your blood pumping, but uses suspense as opposed to mutilated bodies, try renting Psycho, trust me its worth it."
"prufrock5150","Null","2","4","24 October 2009"," An Academic Review of Paranormal Activity
","I've been mulling it over, and I think Paranormal Activity did what all great ""horror"" movies can do: it touched on the raw nerves that we didn't really consciously recognize were there. I'm not talking about the fear of the supernatural, or the unknown, or the tired trope of ""possessed psycho girlfriend"" - those things are usually exactly what filmmakers err in relying on to carry a movie in lieu of sloppy writing and poorly fleshed-out characters. Not, that is, that the writing and character-development was particularly stellar in the case of Paranormal Activity. It wasn't - but the atmospheric development was, and in a preternaturally magnificent way.<br/><br/>See, most American filmmakers (and Video Game directors, I might add) tend to pay far too little attention to the atmosphere created by the interplay between camera (or ""implied narrator,"" in the filmic jargon) and viewer. It's what made Hitchcock Hitchcock. It's what made Silent Hill (the game) Silent Hill (again -the game, and *not* the movie. The movie was turd- balls). It's what makes Japanese Horror good. Really, it's only in contrast to the expectations that the ""average"" American horror movie yield that PA stands out as so delicately effective.<br/><br/>To start with, the film centers on two characters. Done and done. Furthermore, these two characters - a straight, white couple - live in a three-bedroom house that has all of the domestic charm of a newly-spawned SIMS abode (less, really, considering that in the SIMS you at least get that snappy elevator music). We learn that the dude is a Day-Trader and the chick is a Student (an English major, even). These details, of course, are entirely irrelevant to the ""plot"" (and I use the term loosely, as it can be described in less than five words: creepy haunting overtakes girl). This is where the Cloverfield intersection occurs: in like fashion, all of the exposition in PA occurs either outside of the film entirely (to be found in the viral video campaigns on You Tube, or the years-old My-Face-Space-Book profiles painstakingly created) - and is completely and utterly irrelevant whatsoever. It's like a giant middle finger being shoved straight up Aristotle's nostril - we don't need no steeenking plot!<br/><br/>What, then, makes us empathize at all with these characters? What provides us with the central conflict through which we, the audience, receive catharsis at its resolution? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. This film, along with Cloverfield, is proving what might just be the defining element of film that makes it different from any other medium: the characters, plot, and conflict are all practically negligible in comparison to the one effect that film can achieve best - atmosphere. We are immersed and engaged because we are already in the movie - it's talking to us in a way that mere writing and post-production SFX can never do. It's making a pseudo-Brechtian violation of the diagetic relationship by never even bothering to build the fourth wall, much less break through it. It alienates us by mimicking us exactly.<br/><br/>What I'm talking about is the subtext; the underlying commentary on life and people that the film tacitly makes by presenting the dual themes of isolation and consumption. It's precisely because the writing didn't try to explain why this newly-engaged couple would live in a large, empty house that it is so effective. No clumsy dialogue about wanting children, or building a future, or any of the other mundane claptrap that tries to legitimize the situation - it's just there. The barely-used kitchen equipment. The multiple musical instruments. The perfectly-maintained and hotel-quality spare bedrooms. They create the undertone of consumption, and it's that whispering indictment of excess that makes us guilty without even knowing it. Add to that the fact that only two other actors are even in the film, and you have an ambiance of isolation. These two are disconnected entirely from the world around them - amidst the suburbs of San Diego, this is relevant. This is what makes the voyeuristic quality of the implied narrator through which we interact with the film an added element of our guilt. No preachy monologues about the internet are necessary - we feel doubly-indicted because we, too, interface with the world via less and less ""face-time"", and it's that very disconnection with other human beings which allows our nerves to be so jangled by the keyhole-peeping quality of our interaction with the film. It seems... familiar.<br/><br/>Of course, the producers knew exactly who their target market was - it's no accident that footage from this film bears a striking resemblance to every one of the umpteen-thousand ""paranormal"" shows on every channel from Sci-Fi (sorry, I mean scyfi, or scy-fy, or skype, or whatever-the-hell-its calling itself now) to Animal Planet to even National-Effing- Geographic (academic integrity? What's that?) - the difference being that it actually pays off on its promise. Sure, they had a template - but it doesn't explain the sheer success of the film outside of that audience. If it weren't for the atmospheric element of the film and the way it exposes our cultural vulnerabilities, it wouldn't have made it to wide-release.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that this was in any way intended by Oren Peli. If I've learned anything from watching DVD commentaries, it's that usually the filmmaker stumbles into genius like a drooling child who accidentally craps his diaper in the shape of the Mona Lisa. I'm just trying to explain why this film struck such a chord with its audience, and with me. bell hooks mentions the phenomenon of a ""Social Haunting"" in her treatises on media and culture, and I'm inclined to call this a manifestation of just that - the ""Paranormal Activity"" of the film, then, becomes the activity which it commits on our very social (un)consciousness, and which reminds us of the very real, existential vulnerability we face in our digitally-informed, non-renewable-resource-dependent, and increasingly- isolated lives."

","Paranormal Activity is fair attempt at popularizing the genre of cam-reality cinema. It combines a very interesting plot along with a creative screenplay which lacks shaking cams, over-done screams, etc. Though interesting and refreshing, the movie neither meets the expectations nor the euphoria that this movie has propagated far and wide.<br/><br/>The movie throughout uses the element of surprise as its lifeline for adding the SCARE element! No matter what the scenes are, you will be scared if you are always worried as to what is going to happen now.

If you are one of those people, you should definitely watch the movie. <br/><br/>However, then there are others who are not worried, but are the edge of their seats expecting something horrific to happen soon and towards the end of the movie, they not only lose their patience, but their expectations might/might not be met.

This is not one of those movies!<br/><br/>Nonetheless, PN has several well directed shots towards the latter half of the movie that show its creative genius.<br/><br/>On a final note, PN is an innocent attempt to portray a different kind of horror based completely on what kind of person you are.

","By now you've probably been exposed to the hype surrounding Paranormal Activity, a low budget but critically lauded ""mockumentary"" horror film that chronicles the hunting's that plague a young American couple, and their attempts to capture the manifestations on video.<br/><br/>Instead of showing you key elements of the film, trailers have provided generous footage of audiences squirming in the seats and freaking out at the scares, all of which is true, yet deceiving.<br/><br/>Shot on the shoestring budget of $15,000 over the span of seven days by novice Director Oren Peli, the movie manages to alternate between predictable, boring, and creepy, with the latter being its only redeeming quality.<br/><br/>The story begins midstream, with couple Katie (Featherston) and Micah (Sloat) having been beset by periodic bouts of things that go bump in the night. It opens with Micah turning on a video camera he's just purchased to try and capture the going's-on on video. Think of Blair Witch meets suburbia and you'll get the idea.<br/><br/>They mount the camera on a tripod in the bedroom and set it to night vision mode and let it record each night's events for examination the next day.<br/><br/>It's during these evening recordings that the spirit becomes most frisky. Unfortunately, this is also one of the film's problems. In the interest of imparting a reality feel to the story, Peli devotes far too much screen time to the innocuous, boring and even irritating daytime banter between Katie and Micah, which is largely filler. We're told early on by a psychic that the entity feeds off ""negative energy"", which is inevitably followed by numerous scenes of the couple fighting as if Peli felt the scare factor would be upped by devoting 60 of the film's 86 minute running time to domestic hell.<br/><br/>The redeeming factor is in the film's night footage, which is far too short. Peli ably managed to give me goosebumps during the late night video segments, and a few when the couple were awakened as the hunting's were in full swing. While I'm compelled to admire his work in this area, its nothing that hasn't been done before, often to greater effect, in such movies as 1973's ""The Legend of Hell House"", or 2000's ""The St. Francisville Experiment"", both of which contain more story and similar frights, without the lousy camera work and constant bickering, which in this case may leave you feeling more sympathetic towards Beelzebub than Katie and Micah."
"ShaanChaudhry","7","2","4","20 October 2009"," One of the most psychologically disturbing films ever....
","There has been a void left unfilled in the horror genre since 2002's The Ring. That void was filled when Paranormal Activity was released. While the trailer looked promising, I was a little skeptical because of the tremendous level of hype the movie was getting. Let me say this folks, this movie lives up to the hype and then some.<br/><br/>The true genius of this film lies within the directing. This film epitomizes our fear of the unknown. It's the simplicity of things in life that scares us such as a dark corner, an eerie silence, or an unknown sound. Oren Peli took all these elements and brought it to the screen with fierce deliverance.<br/><br/>Some movies are only good as the actors and the acting in this is so believable you might think for a second that the footage is real.<br/><br/>In closing let me say that every several years a movie comes out that transcends it's genre. Paranormal Activity is definitely one of them. I hope that this is the movie that will be known to kick Hollywood in the ass. You don't need a super high budget packed with lame special effects, a weak story, and bad acting(unfortunately this has been the case for most horror movies in the last several years).<br/><br/>Hollywood take note, this ""$11,000 film that could"" made me cringe in my seat in such a way that I have never experienced since watching ""The Exorcist"" as a child.

"Brett66","1","2","4","18 October 2009"," Nothing Special.
","Films like this are always more difficult to critique, it seems. Because it is low budget and features a small production is it given a freer pass than in other circumstances? Is this what's happened here? I'm not sure. But what I think has occurred with Paranormal Activity is a somewhat unique film which thrives (stylistically) on the same elements used in previous intimate/imagination based horrors (and often imitated to poor result)...thus requiring comparison. The primary question is does this movie work? Sure, the apparent reason being simplicity, something severely lacking in modern day horror. The second question is whether or not this measures up to Blair Witch, in terms of building on or showing audiences anything new in the minimalistic style...Not really. In discussing the film's shortcomings I think it is necessary to point out certain stylistic choices which are this film's double edged sword. The major tension builder in Paranormal is the fact that they live in a common looking house. It could be anyone's home, basically. It's pristine suburbia...almost to a fault. What's wrong with this choice though is that nothing changes. As with the characters themselves there is no visual representation of evil; whether it be distortion or ugliness or age there's nothing in their house but Pier One furniture. By the fourth or fifth night the repetitive nature of; upstairs, downstairs and bedroom becomes tedious and the very simplicity that they're trying to scare us with becomes laborious. A similar problem exists with the characters. I love the fact that they were down to earth, natural, fleshed out people, but for the most part there is no transformation. What little there might be is limited by the actor's abilities and all we get is a lovable pair who's fear develops even more slowly than the spirit's attacks until the narrative just ends without much buildup. I don't mean to disparage this too much, I enjoyed it well enough, but for me there were too many missed opportunities and the overwhelming sense was that this was a polar opposite reaction to overblown violence in popular films such as Hostel and Saw...(as well as the result of some tricksey marketing via studio exec super-geniuses). I hate to incorporate the hype factor but I really don't understand the love this has gotten from most critics. I have sympathy for the filmmakers but if I'm going to be paying the same ten bucks for any given film then I don't think it's fair to put on the kid gloves just because it was low budget and cheap to make...it is was it is, and this is undeniably amateur. I found this film to be very similar to ""Death of a Ghost Hunter"" which was made in the same year. Yes, the acting was worse in that film but at least the story actually had depth, and for the most part the only major difference (I think) was the marketing machine behind it.

","Is Paranormal Activity really that good? Is it worth all the hype? It achieves its goal and then some. That's enough to say it's at least worth a watch. I don't know if the acting is great, and neither of the leads are what we would categorize as glamorous. But does any of that really matter. This film is scary, and let me tell you why.<br/><br/>Horror films come by a formula now. To me there are rules that are followed that work really well. The Hitchock idea of suspense - that we already know something terrible will happen. He builds it up - and then doesn't show us the act. So we've built this horrifying vision in our head. In Psycho, we see the knife, but not the act. We're then afraid of showers.<br/><br/>Then there's another formula for horror that works. Isolation. This was mastered by George Romero. He imprisons his characters - be it in an old house or a shopping mall. That there's really nowhere to go keeps our characters hopeless. Again, we're waiting for the inevitable. It's the how that's got us spooked.<br/><br/>So why spend a review talking about other films? Because Paranormal Activity successfully combines these two elements and ups the ante. In the Hitchock sense, the film begins with a title card thanking the families of the main characters, alluding to something horrible that has happened to them. We're just waiting to learn how. In a classic Hitchcock way, suspense is built. We never see what is actually causing the said activity, and the most horrifying things don't happen on screen. So we're left to imagine how horrible it is.<br/><br/>Then there's the Romero element of isolation. This is where the film takes two clever turns. For one, it sets a rule for itself, that the characters might as well stay in their house because it doesn't matter where they are. That gives the director no reason to shift the characters elsewhere. So he keeps them in a place that by audience standards is the safest place in the world: their room. The scene of the camera videotaping the characters as they sleep as they hear things go bump in the night is horrifying because it preys on a primal fear of ours. We relate to this, and that the image is repeated, it keeps the audience on edge. This is the most terrifying form of isolation imagined, robbing us of our one safe haven. That's why the film is so scary.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this film is that you can't look at the traditional elements of film alone (ie screenplay, direction, acting). Is it gimmicky? A little. There's the sense that it looks real. But I don't point to the documentary feel. I think it's just that the director didn't need to come up with anything new to scare us. He just took those things that go bump in the night and put into a movie - which hopefully survives the hype that has surrounded it."
"cdlc92","7","2","4","17 October 2009"," Okay, But...
","First of all, I want to make a comment on the predictability of this movie. It seems like scary movies these days have slipped into a trend of what I call a formula projection. It seems like every second of the movie I could predict what was going to happen before it happened.<br/><br/>On the scary aspect, I really wasn't scared at all during the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, there were a few times where I was shocked, but it just wasn't a screamer if you know what I mean. There is a lot that the director could have done that would have made it more scary, or mysterious/creepy. ie. if the movie camera would have been picked up and moved by the ""Demon"". But, none of that happened and it seemed like the director missed a lot of opportunities to take this movie to another level.Frankly, it's not The Exorcist, as far as scary goes.<br/><br/>Humor was another aspect and was actually quite prevalent. There were a few times that I found myself laughing at comments made by the characters or their conversations.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a pretty good movie. I do not recommend seeing it in theaters because I feel the theater setting degrades the scare factor of the movie. But, if you like a good shocker, this is the movie for you. I will say that when ever it comes out on DVD I will get it and watch it again to experience it in my own home.<br/><br/>I hope this has been helpful."

","I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. Even though many people are thinking it's real (Just like they did with the Blair Witch Project) I had no such thoughts going into it.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely creepy. I will give it that. It started out pretty slow, but I think in retrospect that this was necessary. A few of the creepy scenes were very effective and some of them were just too way over the top.<br/><br/>I think for most people, this will be one of those movies they either like a lot or not at all.

","With an estimated budget of somewhere between $11,000 and $15,000, Paramount's expertly marketed ""Paranormal Activity"" manages to be one of the scariest films of all-time. Shot with the ""shaky camera"" technique (which has been used in other horror films such as ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Quarantine"", and ""Cloverfield""), Paranormal Activity evokes pure terror with an authentic, yet old-school ""this-is-really-happening"" vibe that leaves all of the rotten clichés of most horrors films of late at the door. The film immediately starts with a disclaimer from Paramount, undoubtedly a trick to suck us right into thinking this is really real. Then we are introduced to our happy couple, Micah and Katie (who's names are the same as the actors who portrayed them, same as ""Blair Witch Project"", yet another trick to authenticate the viewer's nightmarish experience). Micah has just bought an expensive camera to document the strange, paranormal activity that has been going on in their house, which has apparently been drawn to Katie all her life. We are immediately drawn-in and like these characters, who feel so real. Micah makes some funny, light-hearted jokes about the paranormal activity, which makes us laugh (even if they are nervous laughs, for we know what is about to come, unlike him). What Micah and Katie don't know, is that the camera is not only going to document paranormal activity, but demonic and satanic activity that leads the couple to paranoia and especially traumatic fear. And we as the viewer are along for the ride! The acting, script, and direction, were all just fine. Nothing to point out as good or bad, except for the overall realistic dialogue was good. Where the film shines truly shines, is what we all go to this movie to see, is the paranormal activity. The night scenes, in which Micah and Katie set up the camera to watch the room as they sleep, are so terrifying and shocking, it's hard to believe that a low-budget, 7-day shot film, can make the audience jump, scream, and even cry. The film does have some flaws. Although it is paced much better than I thought it would, there are a few scenes that are fairly tedious. The sub-plot about the woman, Diane, was unnecessary and contrived. Although the film was apparently shot out of sequence, I felt the acting and the script fell off a little towards the end. ""Paranormal Activity"" generally has no theme or point to it, except to scare the living crap out of the audience (which it does). I've been looking for a horror film for quite some time to come around and scare the living daylights out of me. Although I was one of the least scared members of the audience, it was what I was looking for, and I was as scared as I am ever going to get by a horror film. ""Paranormal Activity"" is a brilliant and admirable low-budget masterpiece that succeeds in it's obvious goal to ensue sheer chills and thrills and to be the scariest and most groundbreaking horror films of all-time. You've seen the ""shaky camera"" technique before, but you haven't seen anything like this! Don't see it alone."

","As a horror movie fanatic with hours and hours of horror movies under my belt, I was happy to hear that something new and amazing was on the scene. Sadly, I was not blown away as the lights came up in the theater after I viewed PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It wasn't something super different and didn't manage to send me running from the theater in terror. And, while I wasn't scared silly, I was very uncomfortable several times. The movie stuck with me. The audience was blown solidly away hands down.<br/><br/>I adjusted my experience and thought about what I saw and I have to say that I have never been in a theater where the audience reacted to the movie as strongly as they did with this one. Ever.<br/><br/>I caught the midnight showing of ZOMBIELAND a few days before seeing PARANORMAL and audience members lingered around the auditorium entrance talking about the film. They seemed upset and happy at the same time. Like they saw something and felt something in a movie that they had never felt before. This wasn't the ""Oh dude, that scene was dope"" crowd. These folks seemed like none of them wanted to leave the comfort of the larger crowd and head back to their homes. Safety in numbers. But why? Strong characters, attention to detail, and some genuine scares that did manage to have me thinking about it into the night and through the next day.<br/><br/>This is a simple film with a simple plot. A couple has something ghostly in their home and decide to try and catch the happenings on tape. Terror ensues and is relentless in it's building feeling of dread and horror as the poor couple is subjected to nightly happenings that continues to get worse and worse. ((all the while keeping the shaking camera to a minimum! Thank you!)) The film builds brilliantly and the view really feels the anguish and horror that the couple goes through. There are no cop outs like cats suddenly leaping through a room for a jump scare. There are audio clues that fill you with dread because they foretell nastiness about to happen. And worse of all, you believe the whole of it and feel the scares in your bones.<br/><br/>Scares and thrills aside, the thing that really impressed me about this film is the reaction from the audience. People groaned and whimpered, they screamed, and they were not able to keep still as the film unfolded before them. When the screen text plate came up with ""Night 10"" etc, people moaned and were both excited and scared to move forward in the film. The groups of people that moved out of the theater chattered away about how disturbing the film was and how they would not be able to sleep when they got home. Jokers pounced out of the shadows and scared their friends. Huddled groups moved to the parking garage and stayed tight and together in packs.<br/><br/>Yes, like I said, I've seen tons of horror films and am numb to them now for the most part, but this film had me thinking and smiling and talking about it for a long while after. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY will send a shiver up your spine and will have YOU thinking about ""What Happens When You Sleep?"" malco - amoreeroma.com"

","Now first of all I believe in ghosts, spirits and demons, I have personal experience with these things, and this movie captures everything to the shadows, things moving, weird sounds and lights turning on and off. Now that I have told you that this movie is a perfect documentary about these things I have to tell you why, it started about the year 2009 I was five years old and I had a nightmare, so I went out of my room and went through the hallway and stopped at the door of the bathroom, there was this shadow standing in the bathtub just staring at me, I was so scared that I couldn't move, I just stood there for the whole night. Now my second time I witnessed these things was in the year 2015 I was sleeping over at my grandfather's home when I see this shadow again, now the room I was staying in had the door open and through the door was the hallway and the kitchen in front of that, the shadow stood there by the stove and just staring at me, it looked human but had this bucket shaped head and a green light on its right eye, again I couldn't move. My third time witnessing the paranormal was last year at work, I was working after hours cleaning the store up when the work phone started to ring, I thought it was my boss telling me to do more than usual but the phone number was 10 and it was just static, and then my boss came after seeing this through video surveillance ( he believes in paranormal too ) and asks some questions and the static stopped and started. We continued to ask questions until the phone just hung up. All of these things happen in the movie and they might have all of these things happen to them."

Gradually they get more and more preoccupied by these shenanigans and that leads to hysteria and, I have to say, quite an hysterical ending.

","It's not that I don't feel for Katie (Katie Featherstone). She's been plagued by hallucinations since the age of 8. Her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) is sympathetic but clumsy, thinking his pricey new camera can capture her demons on film.<br/><br/>It's a pretty silly concept and this highly hyped film can be tedious as we sit through repeated filmings of the couple asleep in the blue-gray light of their room. Admittedly, we tense up a little when we start to hear eerie noises around 2 AM, observe the bedroom door moving, and watch a catatonic Katie hovering over Micah's side of the bed.<br/><br/>I'll also admit that apprehension mounts a little as Micah gets rough with the spectre, throwing the F word around and making taunts -- ""Have something to say in English this time?"" while Katie vows to contact a demonologist. ""Tomorrow I'm making the call."" Ooooh, the spirit will get angry at these things!<br/><br/>The last few minutes of the movie are indeed scary, as we observe Katie descend into madness and Micah meet an inexplicable end. (It's so easy to kill off characters; the writers' resorting to this is a very weak point in the plot.)<br/><br/>I like what I've seen of found-footage movies, particularly ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" Despite referencing the latter, and paying homage to such horror epics as ""The Haunting,"" this production is not in its predecessors' league.<br/><br/>I think this film is best viewed as the portrait of an unfortunate soul who is tortured by a psychosis that ""doesn't care about alarms and locked doors."" ""You can't run from it,"" a psychic advises. ""It wants Katie.""<br/><br/>Katie never seeks help in a conventional way (i.e., by consulting a psychologist), and one does feel for her suffering. ""I don't want to be here,"" she laments. ""I feel it breathing on me."" She can never escape herself and in the end that proves devastating. How sad to hear her words of surrender: ""I don't want to leave. I think it better if we stay."""

"david_rudy_lee","9","0","0","15 May 2019"," A Solid Haunted House Found-Footage Film
","This film was one that I remember seeing when I was in college. It actually freaked me out and I remember telling my sister and dad, who are both big horror fans, that this was one of the scariest films I had seen. Now I did probably get sucked into the hype a bit, but I will admit, this film still does work for me. Before I give away too much though, the synopsis is after moving into a suburban home; a couple becomes increasingly disturbed by a nightly demonic presence.<br/><br/>We don't waste too much time getting into this one actually. It states this is police footae that was released. We start off with Micah (Micah Sloat), getting a new camera. The reason is that he and his girlfriend, Katie (Katie Featherston), have been experiencing noises at night. He is trying to get proof of it. He greets her in the driveway with the camera and she isn't thrilled about it. She is also a bit put off by the idea of what he wants to do.<br/><br/>They bring in a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), which I think is a creative way to give the back-story. Katie first experienced an entity with her sister when she was 8 years old. That house burned down and she didn't notice it again until she got older. She feels it is now back. The psychic tells them the presence he feels is not a ghost, but a demon. Micah isn't buying what he is saying and he thinks he can handle it himself.<br/><br/>His plan is to get an Ouija board to communicate with it and he sets up the camera at night to see if he can capture the haunting. They get more than they bargained for as time goes on, the haunting gets worse. It doesn't help that Micah challenges the entity either. It wears the couple down as it does as well.<br/><br/>Now for this recap, I wanted to go a bit vague, because to be honest, there isn't a lot that actually happens. This is actually is the biggest gripe that I hear from people. I personally think there are subtle things that happen with a realism of the events. I also don't want to spoil as there are some things that just need to be experienced if you haven't.<br/><br/>I believe this is now my fourth time seeing this film, with the first and last being in the theater. I'm not going to lie; this film got my anxiety going. I personally don't believe in ghosts or demons, but from what I do know, you can't just catch them on a normal camera. I think that realism really brings something to this film. The noises and the other things that happen can be subtle, but efficient. The realism is also helped by the fact that this is found-footage. It makes it seem much more real for that.<br/><br/>There is the issue with found-footage films that you need someone to be carrying a camera. I like the idea that Micah isn't really taking this serious and if he is, he thinks that he can take care of it. His arrogance causes him to be a bit of a jerk and constantly carrying the camera around. I believe from his personality that he would do exactly as we are seeing. The scariest things happen at night, where they have it on a wide lens and stationary. It is in a place where it can catch from a perfect angle.<br/><br/>From here I want to move to the pacing of the film, which I think is perfect. It doesn't waste any time establishing the characters, the plot and the back-story of the film. It is given to us, but in a unique way of telling the psychic the background information. The haunting in the film progresses in a way that is believable and definitely gets worse. The tension builds to the fateful night that ends everything as well. I like the ending and with the hindsight that I have, knowing this becomes a series, I think it sets it up perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting can be hit or miss with found-footage films. We really just follow the two stars. I think Featherston is great in showing the fear and terror of the events. She has been living with this her whole life and I think she presents that to us. I felt bad for her and can see how this is affecting her. She seems real in the emotions she is presenting. She is also cute in the girl next door type of way, which I think adds something to her character as well. Sloat I actually really hated after this viewing, but he is needed in the film. He is a jerk, because he isn't taking this seriously. On top of that though, he is actually making everything worse as well. I do think he is believable though as well. The rest of the cast rounded out of the film for what was needed as well.<br/><br/>Something I find interesting to talk about is the effects of the film. There isn't really anything. We get to see something walking through powder later in the film, but we never actually see the entity. There's a trick with shadows well, which these things are what freak me out about the film. There is something at the end that I found to be fitting for what they were going for. It is also found-footage, so this does feel like we are really watching the videos that they are making as well. I think that really adds an element of realism.<br/><br/>The final thing to briefly touch on would be the soundtrack of the film. There is no music in the film aside from a song that Micah plays in the film. I'm glad it is that way, because if there was music overlaid, I think it takes away from it feeling real. The sounds of banging and other things help in this category as well. The use of ambient sound is very effective for me.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I know this film and the series in general is pretty decisive. There are many that think nothing really happen, but I definitely beg to differ. I think it is an effective found-footage, ghost film. The realism that comes from this add something to me and it builds to make me feel quite anxious. The acting is good enough to add to the realism along with the soundtrack being all ambient. The film is more subtle, but also a realistic look at a haunting for what we know. Since I don't believe they are real, we will never know if this is the case though. Overall I find this to be a really good film and even after multiple viewings, I think it is still stands up and still makes me anxious much like my first viewing."

It can be a really boring movie sometimes however and some things that happen in the film seem unrealistic. The reason why The Blair Witch Project (1999) works is the shakycam adds to it giving it more of a grimy and inmature feeling. Yes it's annoying, but it's more believable than the main characters having all that equipment around the house.

","1 March 2010. Reality television meet horror acting. Reality is boring and the difficulty with making a film about boring reality is to keep in interesting enough that people actually watch it. What is likely even more difficult is to recreate boring reality and horror at the same time as an authentic performance. Never truly scary, uncomfortably boring but fascinating at the same time, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY seems to present one of the most authentic performances of horror on film. Unlike CLOVERFIELD (2008) that appeared to have been released in 2008 after PARANORMAL ACTIVITY but before ACTIVITY'S widescreen debut in 2009, PARANORMAL activity is genuinely almost completely more consistent in its approach to authenticity with strong elements from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) which remains more completely and eerily scary. Whether or not PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is an excellent horror film depends on the beholder and the riveting reality of it is where it presents its strongest case. Unfortunately, as a full feature film it remains boring, unscary, and mostly interesting in how it really seems to reflect what actually goes on behind the scenes in a relationship - a great pseudo-documentary reporting."

The constant single picture of the nighttime bedroom begins to pall but the naturalistic banter between the two and the gradual unfolding of the back story and the beginnings of 'activity' are well done. Most of the film is as if through the couple's camera whether resting on its tripod, lying on the side of the bed or jerkily hand held. Things do happen and at least a couple of moments are genuinely scary. Use of sound, I understand Spielberg tinkered with the print for the theatrical release, is effective and combined with sudden movements are all it really takes for this to work.

","This is it. Regarded as the most profitable film ever made. The seed that grows into every future Blumhouse horror film as you witness ""from the producers of Paranomal Activity"" so frequently, that you start questioning if your own life was made by those very same producers. Independently shot by Peli, viewers enquired whether the events that occurred were true...because they were so terrifying. Well, guess what? This was boooooring. A young couple are haunted by the paranormal and decide to set up some cameras to document the events. Maybe I was being ambitious, reading how critics praised the nightmarish scares and genius use of the found footage trope. Granted, the latter definitely felt refreshing as it borrows a similar idea from cult favourite 'The Blair Witch Project'. The subtle depiction of this supernatural entity destroying this couple's relationship was also intriguing. A few tense moments here and there where silence and acknowledging the unexpected are your greatest fears. Yet, all that laborious hard work accumulates to nothing. Honestly, I became quickly disinterested after the first twenty minutes. These characters have no expression, literally none. A light bulb has more personality than these two together. The script consists of ""Katie!"" or ""Micahhhh!"" as she gets casually dragged down the hallway. Micah seems more obsessed over his cameras and documenting everything rather than the safety of his girlfriend. Boyfriend of the year, am I right? The ""scares"" really are just loud noises, whether it be thunderous footsteps or slamming bedroom doors. Nothing here was frightening, just derivative nonsense. The ending, well...apparently there are four so I'm going with the theatrical cut, was terrible. I tried to stay awake, and my reward is a body flying to the camera? Time. Well. Spent. Look, I appreciate the realistic perspective it was going for and I see the appeal. But the monotonous acting, lack of scares and incredibly dull plot nearly made me fall asleep."

","The hype surrounding this film was probably the highest of any horror film since I've been old enough to watch horror movies. Yet, it falls remarkably flat. The scares are few and far between, and they aren't even that good. I have no idea how they staged the over the top film screening reactions that were constantly shown on TV around its release date.<br/><br/>This film is not as scary as plenty of the other offerings in this genre. Annoyance is the main emotion I felt watching it, inspired by the male lead. He's a total man child doofus and he pisses everybody in this movie off with his macho antics.<br/><br/>In fact, there's more than enough evidence to suggest the negative energy that attracted the paranormal activity was caused by how much of an disagreeable buffoon he was. He always chose conflict and resistance over peace and reconciliation, so that created the negative energy the psychic warned them about."

","Convinced that paranormal things occur in her bedroom at night, a young woman asks her boyfriend to video record her while she sleeps, which leads to some surprising revelations in this found footage style horror movie. While very few of the jump scares and off-screen sound effects are unsettling, 'Paranormal Activity' certainly has some creepy moments as the young woman wakes up in the middle of the night and stands in a trance besides her bed for minutes on end. The film also successfully plays up the unpredictability of the scenario with a slowing down time lapse counter eerily indicating that something weird is about to occur. Promising as all this might sound, 'Paranormal Activity' is a total miss in its non-nighttime scenes. Neither main character is particularly interesting with the film varying between slow-moving and simply dull as the couple discuss what to do for minutes on end and as the boyfriend often seems to be having more fun experimenting with his cameras and getting out a Ouija board than anything else. A surprise hit when first released though, 'Paranormal Activity' may, however, benefit from being watched with limited preconceptions."

","Paranormal Activity, originally shot in 2006, didn't get a mainstream release until October of 2009 when Paramount Pictures bought the film. Paranormal Activity is an interesting movie, now although most people know the series today as the shaky, found footage film, that is about ghosts and demonic possessions, without ever actually showing it, the series started from humble beginnings. The first couple entries had to be demanded for, if Paranormal Activity wasn't playing at your local theatre you had to visit a website and ask for it to be played there, it was almost like a crowd funded movie before sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo were a thing. Made for around $15,000 and shot entirely in director's, Oren Peli's house, Paranormal Activity tells the story of Katie and Micah, a young couple living together who find themselves experiencing nightly disturbances for inexplicable reasons. <br/><br/>One word that could sum not just this film, but the series as whole, is polarizing. As the first Paranormal Activity was growing in popularity, the film was heavily advertised as one of the scariest movies of all time, that in and of itself creates false pretence as it couldn't be farther from the truth. I do not consider myself much of a believer in the paranormal, so that may have tampered my experience with the film, nevertheless I can understand why someone would be frightened by this movie, however it is definitely not a horrific movie. It's totally easy to see why many people are so divided about this series, one side views the movies as a realistic depiction of paranormal occurrences and the other just sees a bunch of people shaking a camera around and slamming doors for an hour and a half. I consider pretty neutral with the issue, there are moments where certain events do get under my skin, however thinking back to it I realize how stupid it is. <br/><br/>Now the first Paranormal Activity movie plays out almost like a psychological thriller, a lot is left up the imagination and you see the effect of the events taking a toll on the characters. There isn't a lot that happens in the movie, the viewer is basically confined to the house for the entire runtime and you do a lot of analyzing, asking yourself ""is that shadowy figure, or is it my imagination?"", ""did that lamp just move or am I going insane?"", and this is probably where my biggest issue arises from. I've seen Paranormal Activity a handful of times, and each viewing I keep a careful eye trying to see if I can pick up on any background things, however every time, I come up with nothing. For a movie that heavily relies on the viewer examining what's going on, there just isn't a lot there. You'd think that with a movie about a ghostly haunting that features these long drawn out scenes, the filmmakers would include subtle activity in the background to create even more of a frightening experience. Sadly they don't, and everything you get is at face value. Other problems that face the movie are, the acting, slow scenes, badly improvised dialogue, odd cuts, etc, most of these issues are constricted to the screenplay and low budget, so some of it is forgivable. <br/><br/>Overall Paranormal Activity isn't a horrible film by any stretch of the imagination, it's easy to see both sides of the argument, however I lean more towards it being a pretty decent time. It's a watchable film that does have some good scenes of intensity, particularly the hallway scene where Micah uses baby powder, that was definitely an effective sequence that did get under my skin. As with most films it isn't perfect and it's not something I can recommend to everybody, you have to know what you're getting yourself into and although I was never frightened by it, I do enjoy watching this movie from time-to-time, so for the reason I'm giving Paranormal Activity a 6/10."

","""Paranormal Activity"" tells the story of a young couple haunted by a demon. While they do everything to get rid of their supernatural housemate, the events worsen and get more serious.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in the style of an amateur recording, which makes almost anything look more scary than it actually is. This is probably a good thing considering that during most of the film not much happens at all apart from moving doors or some screams. During the second half the events become a bit more serious and the plot is more solid there but this is definitely not something that will keep an experienced Horror fan awake for the upcoming nights.

","While not a fan of found footage films, there are exceptions out there. There are also examples of good horror films. After putting off watching 'Paranormal Activity' and its sequels due to the divisiveness being so extreme both ways, the decision was made to watch them all to see what the fuss was about.<br/><br/>'Paranormal Activity' is one of those very divisive films where you can sort of see why it was hyped up positively, at the same time one can totally see why it wouldn't appeal to all. For me, 'Paranormal Activity' was nowhere near as good as the hype and wasn't really for me, but it did have its moments and redeeming merits so can't be as hard on it as most negative reviewers have been (not so much as to attack anybody who liked it).<br/><br/>There are times where there was a genuine sense of dread and tension, heightened by some creepy lighting and eerie if effectively low-key sound effects and noises. The ending may have been a little overblown somewhat, but was also gut-wrenching and the scariest the film got. Some of the occurrences are suitably ominous.<br/><br/>Katie Featherston is pretty good and brings some normality to the proceedings, while Mark Fredrichs provides the one memorable supporting contribution.<br/><br/>Micah Sloat however is disadvantaged by an underwritten and annoying character with zero development and acts blandly and obnoxiously. The rest of the supporting cast are forgettable.<br/><br/>While there are some good scares here, more so than given credit for by those who didn't care for it or disliked it, they didn't come consistently. Too many of them suffered from being far too predictable and veering on the ridiculous. The lack of music was a brave choice but while it was appreciated to not have anything overbearing what was going on parts did cry out for some scoring of subtle eeriness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, too much of 'Paranormal Activity' drags badly, with downtime scenes that are ridiculously and dully written with lots of cheese and no substance, a big problem for a film with a good deal of that. Dialogue is poor and the storytelling relies on atmosphere to work but is paper thin to the point of non-existence elsewhere. Really didn't care for the excessively unfocused and gimmicky camera work either.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not as good as the positive hype and not worth losing sleep over, but while the less than positive reviews are understandable some of the extreme negativity is over the top to me. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I wasn't sure what to expect going into this - i'd heard some of the hype and marketing, but was at a loss as to how such a low budget found footage could have generated such interest and positive reviews from a string of respected critics.<br/><br/>Having now forced my way through, Im still at a loss. I mean, it's alright, if i was running a film school and one of my pupils produced it on a low budget i'd probably give it an A-. It's kind of scary in places, in a not really half rolling your eyes kind of way, its competently put together and does succeed in drumming up some tension, but by professional standards its as amateurish as you would expect from something produced for under £20,000. The kind of thing a young director might use to demonstrate he can produce films to a production company, without being suitable to actually release.<br/><br/>80% of it its just a boring couple talking to each other in their boring house, with a film quality not far off what iPhone's are capable of these days. Perhaps worse, all this filler doesn't seem to contribute anything in building up tension for the few actual 'scary' scenes, which after a while became boring in themselves. The acting/ pacing/ camera-work/ anything else you'd like to name are all generally woeful, and the fact so much is so unrealistic and ridiculous stops it properly generating tension and scares. The acting, pacing and writing are just so clumsy it becomes easier to laugh. They literally have on camera doors moving on their own, an Ouija board moving around on its own and setting itself on fire, as well as seeing first hand doors suddenly slamming on their own and weird screeching in the house, and the guy is still laughing if off like she's screaming at a spider. There are literal footprints in their bedroom and the couple start googling it the next day like she's checking the symptoms of a cold or something and go to bed that night like its nothing. Call the police, maybe? Get out the house? Maybe even try to look a bit spooked out?<br/><br/>Other 'supernatural' type horrors (say 'the ring' or 'sinister') make you forget you are watching a film, get under your skin and properly unnerve you. By the time the girl was being dragged out of bed by some invisible force i just wanted to laugh. Im actually almost annoyed at the cheek of the aggressive marketing of this as the 'scariest film ever,' as well as some of the critics giving it legitimacy. If you are intrigued by it but have suspicions as it how it could live up to its billing, then, honestly, don't bother. It is exactly as you suspect and really, really, isn't worth your time."

","The effects of 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)' should never be underestimated in my view. With it came to many peoples' attention a whole new way of telling (mainly horror) stories: found footage. It was a phenomena, a huge low-budget hit. The inevitable backlash from the fickle public mainly whinged about the effects of 'shaky' webcam making the delicate souls in the audience feel queasy. Imagine then, if a film could be told using static security cameras endlessly filming every room in a haunted house. Perfect! For a limited time, it was certainly very effective.<br/><br/>Katie and Micah live in the unlikeliest haunted house. No dank corridors or Victorian era décor – this is a thoroughly modern homestead devoid of dank shadows and possessed cellars. The couple are likable and real, and Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat are naturalistic performers and have a certain casual chemistry. The production is genius in its simplicity. Watching stilted views of familiar rooms command the attention, dare the audience to examine every inch of the scene for any sign of unnatural movement – and even if nothing happens, there is growing tension merely in being so drawn into it.<br/><br/>Micah's scepticism in the face of visiting psychic (Marc Fredrichs) marks him out quite early as fairly vexatious, especially when Katie seems to have been sensitive to paranormal activity from a young age. And yet every horror film needs a sceptic. I remember being very irritated by him when I first saw this, but watching again, I find he is a lot more understanding than I gave him credit for.<br/><br/>Unspectacular occurrences are a lot more effective because they are filmed as 'live', and we get the couple's instant, undiluted reactions to them. The scene where Katie is simply standing beside the couple's bed, staring at Micah's sleeping form, doesn't sound much on paper, but is incredibly sinister. Such moments, gradually built up throughout, are simple and unnerving – far more so in this film than in the numerous sequels and prequels, which desperately introduce new characters and build unreasonably on the 'curse' (which is not that interesting) to try to maintain the interest. To my mind, the only sequel that works is 2014's 'The Marked Ones', because it is a fairly self-contained ghost story in its own right.<br/><br/>Yet 'Paranormal Activity' should have remained a very effective one-off, in my view. Its huge success persuaded Paramount Pictures, who had bought the film from its original independent distributors, to add a new ending, which would then lead into further numerous ways of wringing money from what had become a new franchise.<br/><br/>At the end of my first viewing of this, I had to turn all the lights on in every room, just to make sure there wasn't a figure standing there. A sure sign the film has done its job ?"

","Paranormal Activity is that indie chiller whose unexpected box-office success brought back found footage subgenre of horror into the mainstream and spawned an era that saw almost every horror film using the POV-shot technique green-lighted into production by the studio, whether it packs in a compelling story or not being one aspect that doesn't play any role. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity tells the story of a young couple who move into their new house in San Diego. When the girl confesses to her camera obsessed boyfriend that she's been haunted by a supernatural entity all her life, he sets up the camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that takes place while they sleep and ends up capturing many strange occurrences in the house.<br/><br/>Written, co-produced, photographed, edited & directed by Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity is shot on a mere budget of $15000 and features a very simple premise, only two characters & vast amount of nothingness in its story but what really makes it work is the excellent use of silence & waiting to create an aura of tension as well as its greater emphasis on believability over action & gore.<br/><br/>Filmed with a home video camera, the film's POV technique is nicely executed for the most part but also overused. Plenty of sequences have no reason for the camera to be there but since it's our only eye into these character's lives, the forced camera-work ends up making the guy character seem like a freak. The performances are amateur and the only thing worth watching in these dull characters' lives are those supernatural phenomena.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Paranormal Activity is a pretty decent horror flick that offers a couple of genuinely chilling moments, does a fascinating job in turning its limitations to its advantage, and is a fantastic debut feature for Oren Peli who did a commendable all-round job to bring it to life. While many consider it to be the picture that's solely responsible for revitalising the found footage subgenre of horror, Paranormal Activity never really adds anything new to the world of horror and its influence on the found footage flicks that followed has far more to do with its box-office performance than its content."
"jethrotroll-30807","8","0","0","1 June 2015"," Interesting. Unique. And yes...Scary
","My reviews aren't scene by scene accounts of the movie, but they may reveal some small spoilers.<br/><br/>First of all, I think this movie gets a bad rap from a lot of reviewers because it was hyped as the scariest movie of all time. It isn't. But, movies shouldn't be rated compared to it's hype. Taken alone, this movie is pretty solid, and it's scares rely on the viewers imagination, as there is no scary entity to be seen. The unique thing about this movie is it's voyeuristic aspect. We, as the audience, are actually watching most of the scenes play out through closed circuit cameras. And it's easy to imagine the horror the young couple must be going through as we're witnessing the paranormal activity happening first hand, almost like it's directly happening to the viewers themselves. All in all, I think the concept works pretty well, as this was an interesting and scary movie.<br/><br/>One of the common complaints of this movie is the fact that they show time elapsing at night, leading up to the different paranormal activities taking place. The complaint is that this eliminates the suspense. Personally, I think it has the opposite affect. As voyeurs, we feel the tension build as the camera's clock winds forward. Sometimes the activity wakes the couple up, sometimes it doesn't. It's especially creepy the times we see Katie get up out of bed and stand over her sleeping boyfriend for a few hours.<br/><br/>Like any movie, there is some flaws. I know personally if I watched the video from the night before and saw my girlfriend creepily standing over me for hours on end, I'd do something about it. Secondly, Katie's boyfriend is pretty annoying, and reminds me of college frat boy punk. And the ending was a little anticlimactic to me, though it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film. But, I digress, as there is and never will be a movie void of flaws.<br/><br/>The movie worked for me. The mood is generally creepy. The pace is good, and the tension builds throughout as the activity increases. The characters are generally likable, sans Micah (the boyfriend), and the story is solid. I found it to be generally scary, which is exactly what a scary movie is supposed to be."

Until this point everything is good, the couple start to argue about something in the house, the woman says is some kind of presence and the man don't believe this saying is the wind, etc etc. Obviously the paranormal episodes begins to raise and every night is worst and worst. <br/><br/>What happen in this point? The movie explodes and everything becomes a cheap horror movie with a cheap script. Why? Because when both see the video of really disturbing images the woman acts like a normal person in real life, she wants to leave the house.... But, the man acts like a wall, he sees everything normal or attractive to keep staying in the house, plus, he buys a Ouija table (i have to say that in a early scene the woman make him swear not buy a Ouija table). So the man transform itself in the stupid cliché horror character that function as the red carpet for the evil or the monster to attack and make his appearance. <br/><br/>!!!SPOILER END!!!<br/><br/>2 stupid reactions, unreal and totally forced reactions. The first one the man... too much forced, the movie uses him to keep both in the house. The second stupid reaction.... The woman decides to stay because the man convince her (i really don't understand why you force this, you don't have to do it like this...)<br/><br/>Very bad movie... I didn't like the man acting either<br/><br/>See other movie if you want something filmed like documentary. ""Alien Abduction"" for example.

","Paranormal Activity is centered around a rather likable couple - Katie & Micah - who have been experiencing some strange happenings in their home. Micah decides to try and document the various goings on, and as time goes on the friction between Katie & Micah gradually increases as do the various incidents until they all reach their final crescendo.<br/><br/>Now, films that are shot in POV/first person perspective I usually enjoy as they have a way of drawing you in to what is actually happening because it's like you are seeing it through the eyes of someone else; as if you are right there yourself, and Paranormal Activity does this pretty well. It stays realistic to what can actually be someone's POV instead of taking it to stupid & ridiculous angles like what happened in My Little Eye.<br/><br/>The scares that happen in Paranormal Activity are good, and they obviously get more intense & frequent as the film goes on, but to be honest it does get a wee bit boring during some of the more ""relaxed"" moments. In saying that, however, it is a fine line for getting it right; if there are too many scares it can be overkill but if there are too few then it can get boring. Thankfully, though, Paranormal Activity is kept interesting enough for you to keep you watching.<br/><br/>Just as a quick mention, the characters of Katie & Micah are pretty likable as I mentioned earlier, but there are occasions where they can get a wee bit annoying. For instance, Micah with his occasional macho ""I'll fix everything"" attitude, and Katie's woman-type attitude where no matter what Micah does or suggest it's always wrong. In saying that, though, I guess that describes practically every couple in the real world! So, just to end, while Paranormal Activity is nowhere near the excellence of films like The Blair Witch Project or Sinister it's still worth a watch and is a pretty decent film."

","Katie & Micah are a happily married couple that have moved into the Suburbs. Unfortunately for them, Katie has brought a demon with them from her childhood. Micah decides to record everything with a camera, but becomes overly incessant with it. This ends up angering the demon and Katie get slowly terrorized by it. This one is far from perfect, but it's actually a well done film. The effort is clearly here, unlike the egregious sequels that followed suit. The formula is wildly overdone and it's become very tiring. Even though it did get tiresome in the sequels, I did love the ""everyday"" feel this movie had. Incorporating realism is actually a clever move, and it panned out pretty well for director, Oren Peli. This movie had something in common with The Blair Witch Project. Both had an enormous amount of hype. This movie is much scarier than Blair Witch Project. I actually enjoyed the slow-build. Oren Peli knows how to control the tension just perfectly until it reaches the boiling point. We never actually see the demon and I thought that was for the best. Kate's paranoia slowly increases and it was quite interesting. All the shots of the house and people wandering around does get a tad redundant, but there is stuff to keep you occupied. The shots of Katie just standing there, staring at Micah in the bedroom gave me the creeps. The sleepwalking scenes were effective as well. The viewers patience is rewarded with a finale that packs a major wallop and it scared me silly. It isn't often that I get scared anymore. I've seen far too many horror movies, but I'm not afraid to admit that the ending made me regret having the lights off. I was afraid to go to bed for a while. If you don't feel a few chills go up and down your spine during the ending, check your pulse. The acting is competent, but I wouldn't necessarily wanna spend time with these people. Kate Featherstone is fine as Kate. She's got semblance of natural charisma and is fairly likable. I wouldn't call it a great performance though. Micah Sloat is a different story. His performance is fine, but I hated his guts. He was a major reason they were in the predicament that they were in. How many times did Kate politely ask him to put down the camera? He was very recalcitrant towards her and it became obsessive. Do you need to film EVERYTHING? He rarely stops filming! It got unrealistic after a while. I also got tired of his smart ass routine. If I was Kate, I would have thrown him out much sooner for being such a jerk. He was much too abrasive for my liking. Those two are forced to carry all the weight and they did an adequate job, all criticism aside. <br/><br/>I did have some major carps with this movie, but I won't deny that it's a genuinely frightening film. The effort is there and I can see why it was so popular. Thanks to the popularity, we got three atrocious sequels (Haven't seen ""The Marked Ones"" spin off) that somewhat tarnished the original's impact to the point where I think people forgot how efficient this movie was. See the original and avoid the sequels like Ebola. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"calliemck","10","0","0","11 November 2014"," A creepy non-gory horror.
","This is one of the best and creepiest horror films I have seen in recent years. As a non-fan of the gory blood-fests, I found this picture a refreshing change.<br/><br/>It is a little slow in building up but not excessively so. There was enough suspense to keep me interested. There is good build-up to the paranormal activity which succeeds in adding to the suspense.<br/><br/>A down-side to the film is probably the two main characters - Katie and Micah - with both being extremely annoying (particularly Micah). Katie's initial blasé attitude to the haunting is rather unrealistic and therefore irritating considering her long history with the demon (which we find out more about in later installments).<br/><br/>Apart from that, this succeeds in being a very creepy, sometimes scary horror, and if you are a fan of the 'home video' and 'lost footage' horror and are creeped out by noises and demonic screams in the night, then this is right up your alley. If you want blood, gore and violence, and anything to do with the paranormal leaves you undisturbed, then give this a miss because you will probably hate it."
"ironhorse_iv","6","0","0","30 October 2014"," Watching people sleep. Yawn. This movie sucks. Sleeper hit made me fall to sleep.
","I'll give the movie, some credit. It did have a good marketing campaign that was very effective in creating hype for the film. It even ask for audience members to demand that the homemade movie, be shown in theaters around the world, that didn't bother selecting it. This movie was so over-hyped; it got me watching it. Man, was I such a sucker. I was deeply disappointment when this movie came out. Paranormal Activity is supernatural horror film written, co-produced, photographed, edited, and directed by Oren Peli. The film centers on a young couple, Katie (Katie Featherston) & Micah (Micah Sloat) who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. Micah, decides to buy a high-end video camera to film the house at night in order help solve these phenomena, only to find out something more menacing than an average ghost. The movie is known as a huge Indy hit that help re-launched the 'found footage' style that 1999's Blair Witch Project help pushed. Too bad, it's cheaper & less interesting than the Blair Witch Project. Why, because first off, it's settlings. Paranormal activity takes place in a nice modern day house in San Diego, rather than anything creepy, like an old abandoned house or the woods. It's like filming a scary slow pace horror movie in fancy fast-pace hip Apple store. It doesn't mixed well. Another fault of the film is the worthless dialogue. I know, the director wanted natural dialogue, but it made a really awful lot of filler. Just get spit out the exposition, already, so we can move on. For a movie that 86 minutes long. The pacing is really snail pace. We have to sit through a lot of pointless scenes before it get scary. Let's be honest, does anyone like the main characters? They were some of the most unlikeable beings. It was hard sit, watching them talk crap with little to no humor or charm. Then spent the other half, watching them sleep. After a while, the gimmick kinda wear off, and it got really boring at times. In this movie, alone, there were tons of stupid tiresome overused nightmare clichés. The worst thing in the movie was probably the whole Ouija Board sequence. It really make the movie look silly with the mostly harmless parlor game. It like making a murder mystery movie like 1995's Usual Suspects and adding the board game, Clue to help solve the crime. It's stupid as hell. Another stupid cliché in the film was the Spiritualist that visit the house and warn them. God, it's not like, we the audience, haven't saw that a billion times before. I like how the movie doesn't even bother, getting information right. Micah is seen flipping through a book on demons, which features an article on Baphomet - in actuality this was a medieval European swipe hatred at Muslims AKA Baphomet. In real life, Baphomet is often mistaken to be a demon, so it's likely the fault of the book's author, not necessarily the film maker, but still that pretty insulting. This movie isn't anything new. It's a cheap Youtube movie that got viral. It's so easy to make, that it create a subgenre of hand held crap series. All of the sequels to this film are pretty awful. The movie series does have some clever gimmicks that I like. I do like the image of seeing the timeline on the video footage, speed on, and slow down. It's give a creepy edge to the film. Attempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, the director chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera with little to no special effects. It gave the movie a more raw and stationary format, that made it cheaper to film. It eliminate the need for a camera crew. Like the original 1963's the Haunting, the film works off well, using sound effects and dim darkness to help create the fear of the unknown. You never really see much of anything in the film besides door opening and closing, things getting mess up, or flickering lights. One thing, I like about the film is the three different endings. Without spoiling it, the original ending was the best. Once Paramount acquired the rights to the film, two other alternative endings were created. One of the alternative ending serve as the theatrical version. Overall: This movie is one of the most-laziest film, ever made. The film is asking you to participate by looking for the ghost that never show up. Like the Blair Witch, it's insulting to the audience, by presenting a film with no payoff. The movie was just a waste of time for me."

Micah's testosterone filled ""I'll take of this"" by myself attitude, ummm... yeah THAT was believable. If this was real life (which the producers tried to do but failed), no one in their right mind would be in that house longer than three nights and they would have the house cleaned of evil spirits asap. I do applaud the producers for making a grip of money off of this other than that, why keep trying keep the story going by making sequels.

","Fear of the unknown is a billion times more terrifying than blood and gore in your face. The best and most successful horror films contain horror in which you never known when the next scary scene will occur. Your always hanging off the edge of your seat. If you combine this aspect with an overwhelmingly realistic setting and camera, you get ""Paranormal Activity."" In this shocking nightmare, a middle-class couple is terrorized by an unknown demon in their house. We constantly see little nuances such as the door moving, the sugar left outside containing footprints, chandeliers swinging, and more. Towards the end we get intense tension with this demon. The scariest thing about ""Paranormal Activity"" is how this couple places a camera in their bedroom to get evidence of what is haunting them. It looks like a real camera the whole time, and is directed brilliantly by Oren Peli, who makes it look like a documentary. The performances by the unknown couple are also extremely realistic, making the film even more terrifying. Do not watch this film at night, or alone, because it will give you insomnia for years!"

","The movie was just alright. That's it in a nutshell, really. I mean, this is one of those found footage movies that doesn't actually give you a headache while watching it, and also one that is worth watching more than once. But, the movie is just one big haunted house cliché after another. Footsteps, doors closing, sounds in the dark. In fact, you don't even have to watch the movie to know that happens. In fact, if you watch something like Paranormal Witness, you'll get pretty much the same idea there is in this. I actually prefer Paranormal Witness to this, though, because there is more of a variety. Well, it is a TV series though. Anyway, I watched this 2 days ago on FX and was compelled to review it, but I just never really got around to it until now. My mom watched it with me, because I wanted to see how scared she got. She didn't get scared. And if my mom doesn't get scared, then you know the movie isn't that scary. I wasn't that scared either. I believed the hype around this movie, and that was a mistake. I was bored pretty much the whole time. I might be sending you some mixed messages here, but there are good and bad things about this film. Believe the reviews about this movie, because they give an honorable rating to it. The critics are a little off, in my opinion though. Ratings from regular people give it an honorable rating, not the critics. Basically, it's like any other haunted house/possession movie. The girl is always scared and screaming, and the guy is always scared but goes to look at everything. The scary scenes were OK, when there were any. The real scary stuff only happens in the last ____ minutes. OOPS! Guess I can't tell you. What I can't understand is how this movie almost grossed 108 million, and only cost 15 million. That's almost a 93 million profit! That's craziness! Oh well. I'm really running out of things to say, uhhhhh, well, that was my review on Paranormal Activity. BOOP!"
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","5","0","0","10 October 2013"," Really overwrought and unremarkable ghost story
","After a series of vicious and brutal attacks in their new house, a couple's efforts to video-tape the culprit leads to a more harrowing series of attacks by the ghostly perpetrators and force them into ever more dangerous methods of getting away from the creepy beings.<br/><br/>Frankly, there's not enough here to really care at all for it. The main issue with this one is the main selling point of the movie, that the found-footage aspect of this one manages to completely undo the film on several vantage points. From the very first seconds of frame-time, the film makes a big deal about the whole effort being shot with a hulking video-camera instead of a smaller, more portable device throughout the duration of the film, and essentially that means numerous opportunities of having to handle the unwieldy object through situations that require the safety of their own well-being before documentation is required, so a lot of time is spent on them trying to keep the camera rolling rather than get to a safe location, and it really takes a lot of the suspense away from the scene. As well, the fact remains that the events have to be captured by the camera to be able to figure out what's going on as there's no way to tell what's going on from time-to-time, since the camera can't capture everything so noises, banging and scratches that go off-screen are exactly that, off-screen noises that leave no definitive take on what's going on. Those issues are combined with two other big negatives here, the ungodly amount of build-up that basically leaves this one with very little going on for the majority of the time since they're reacting to everything around them first before the main attacks come in, which really aren't that dangerous since the stationary camera doesn't go chase them to see what's going on and certainly makes this feel a lot longer than it should. That said, there's some good stuff here as the last half where the attacks actually get physical rather than just the odd or the off-screen are absolutely fun and enjoyable, including the beating in the bedroom hallway and the encounter in the dining room which are pretty creepy, and the fact that it's got a creepy story set-up works for it. Overall, it's a real mixed bag but ends up on the bottom rung of decent.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language and Violence."

","I watched this movie because one acquaintance, pretty loud-mouthed guy kept talking about how this film is so low budget and super scary in the same time. So I decided to see it for myself. <br/><br/>He was right on one thing. Despite the movie's non-impressive budget it looks very well, I would have never thought about it. But what about the scary part? Well... <br/><br/>The movie is scary. And one thing you should like about it is how different it is from other horror movies. It's not a B-category slasher with tons of blood and sexploitation. It returns to the classical horror movie concept "" There's nothing scarier than an unopened door "". However I have a few objections. The movie is scary, but not scary enough for what they declared to be the best horror movie ever. And you know what it did lack, the exact thing cheap horror movies are full of : screams and unexpectedness. <br/><br/>Don't take me wrong, the style is flawless, the 1st person view offers a great immersion experience, but that is just not enough. Yes the effects were very good for this movie, but still... <br/><br/>We all know how it works, ever since Jaws made the appearance on the big screen. First everything is calm, then the tension arises, the illusive calm-down and then BOOM something happens. In a attempt to look ""non-hollywood"" the makers of the movie seem to have ignored this rule. Sometimes they skip the tension part throwing us straight to action, other times there just is no culmination. Of course alternation is important, but it's a very sensitive thing, a thing the movie-makers couldn't squeeze maximum results of in this movie. <br/><br/>Horror movies should be like roller-coasters, they should go fast-slow , first making you feel the overwhelming sensation of rising g-force then making you nervous waiting for the next fall. Unfortunately 'Paranormal activity' doesn't exactly feel like that. It feels more like driving a car accelerating at a constant pace on a highway, no sudden skidding, almost no unexpected turn. Instead of feeling as if I traveled on a road with very bad conditions: disturbed, cranky, nervous; this trip felt like a slide on butter. The movie has few really scary moments, the rest are not so scary. Plus to that the movie is too linear, i caught myself thinking ""wow this is just like in those old ghost stories, right now thing x should happen"" and I guessed, A LOT. Because of this you can't fully enjoy the movie, the sounds aren't loud enough, the events aren't scary and unexpected enough, developing too predictably, slowly and monotonous . <br/><br/>Now, of course I am being strict right now. The movie is flushing with originality . It re-raises standards of the genre by once again proving that a movie can be scary : <br/><br/><ul><li>even with a basic ghost story you heard hundreds of times </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>even without excessive violence, blood, sex and profanation </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>even without a immense budget </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>and most importantly it proves that tension alone and originality can still make a good horror movie. </li></ul><br/><br/>On the background of the achievements, the minor problems like sometimes asking yourself 'Why are they acting strange?' and the fact that the relationship of the characters looks a little not genuine just fade away.<br/><br/>However... <br/><br/>Yes it has good effects, yes the acting is quite believable, yes the scenes are creepy, but still it just missed a little bit of spice. <br/><br/>This movie will probably enter the manuals of 'How to make good horror movies' but it was just a few steps away from perfection."

","Groundbreaking on its initial release, 'Paranormal Activity' still ranks as one of the best found-footage films, in my opinion. It's a pretty amazing achievement of the production team to make the film on such a tiny budget. Where this succeeds is where so many modern horrors fail: the ability to create a sense of fear and dread without relying on shocks and monsters. Don't get me wrong, we do have these in the movie, but there is more of the psychological terror that an audience would respond best to.<br/><br/>It's not without its flaws though. The film is best during the night scenes, when the couple are asleep and the paranormal activities happen. Scenes during the day are pretty boring and not really worth much. The lead couple are good enough, but the several supporting cast are archetypal and dull. There is also a certain amount of suspension of disbelief required, which jars the film a bit. Why is the camera never put down during serious moments? Why don't they just leave? Obviously, these things remain for the sake of the storytelling, so you can let them off a bit. I only wish there was no need to.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the sequels yet, but I've heard they're nowhere near as good. This, though, really was a good film.

","As i saw a lot of Horror movies like ""The Shining, The Thing, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Zombieland, Wrong turn ... etc"" But this one ""Paranormal Activity"" is unique one.. you know that kind of Horror movie who made on some frost ""jungle"" and barbecue party then some freak creature attack them or running and split them into half with Ax or sword or whatever they bring into the movie .. You know we've know that kind of common movies it's boring but this one.. is ""different"" it's like natural scary came from inside clearly without any blood or a huge studio to make the movie.. it's simple and good Horror.. just turn off the light rise up your volume a little bit then Enjoy the perfect show. So, I would suggest this Movie you are not going to sleep after this scary one you and your girlfriend."

","A lot of people don't like this movie. In fact, a lot of people downright HATE this movie. I heard all of the same complaints when The Blairwitch Project first came out, one of the first in this 'lost footage' genre. I believe, in order to enjoy films like these, you have to let go and let yourself be absorbed into the movie. You can't possibly enjoy something if all you do is nitpick the entire film.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a great movie, in my opinion. When it first came out, the concept was still very fresh and very exciting. This is one of those movies where you have to allow your imagination to create the right atmosphere. The movie - that is, the script, scenery, and minor effects - will do the rest for you. If horror movies are your thing, this is *the movie* to watch."

","I can feel the writer/director's enthusiasm with this movie.<br/><br/>""We can do this. It's a found-footage style film, shot on video with only two main actors and a small handful of extras. It's got one location, needs next to no crew and we can fund it all from my credit card. WHY WAIT? LET'S SHOOT IT TOMORROW!!!""<br/><br/>And that's where it falls down dead.<br/><br/>There wasn't nearly enough time spent on the script. Sure, the Unedited Tape ploy does away with any need for intricate plot development (or character development for that matter), but the development of scares and general ideas for what this Spooky Thing does and how it behaves was painfully weak. At times, it felt like things were being made up as they went along. I could almost sense the on-set decision making that not enough had been happening, so they needed to bring in a Ouija board (resulting in a stupendously tacky bit of Boo). And onwards to a point where the movie looks like a checklist of 'we can make this happen too!'.<br/><br/>As a result, Paranormal Activity has no subtlety. And, due to the lack of original ideas surrounding the movie's haunted episodes, no surprises.<br/><br/>I'm amazed that this isn't recognised as one of cinema's all-time turkeys. At least Plan 9 had idiotic charm... Paranormal Activity is just chronically bad."

","A guy makes a horror movie for $15,000 and uses hand held video cameras, which is supposed to add to the reality of the film. It just didn't work for me. I found the whole thing tedious and silly. Katie and Micah have moved into a house in San Diego. She claims that something evil has haunted her since childhood and it has followed to their new home. Micah sets up a camera on a tripod to record the bedroom they sleep in every night. At first they only here footsteps. Katie hires a psychic who says that the spirit is not a ghost, but a demon. Night after night the incidents escalate until Katie actually sees some kind of creature in the room. They obtain a Ouija board and after they use it and go out for the night, it catches fire and has a message burned into it. Micah puts down talcum powder and finds footprints leading to the attic. He goes up and finds a burnt photo of Katie there. Shortly thereafter, lights go on and off, doors slam and they invite the psychic, who advices them to leave. Some bad things happen to the two, and apparently, there are two different endings. The film reminded me of Rec, which I believe, is a better movie. Paranormal Activity is just another average thriller."

","This is basically a video with poor quality acting and poor filming. There is virtually no plot. A complete waste of time for the viewer. There is no depth to the two characters. You don't get to know them well enough to care what happens to them. It leaves the viewer waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing ever happens. The ending is ridiculous and basically leaves the viewer wondering why they just wasted all this time watching this. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen and it never does. The movie is not scary at all. It is just a pointless movie with no depth. Annoying screaming by the female character adds to the irritation. The majority of the film takes place via the view of a video camera of the couples bed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Don't waste your time! There are too many good movies out there to waste one's time watching this poor quality film."

It was incredibly difficult not to fall asleep in the theater. (The camera focuses on a big comfy bed w/ fluffy pillows, and soft lighting.)

It was horrible. Sooooo boring."
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","0","1 April 2012"," How the hand-held camera genre should be done
","The hype that surrounded Paranormal Activity when it first came out was a pretty serious thing. People raved about this film when it was first released. There were those who hated it and those who loved it, and it sparked conversation all across America. It has become the 21st century's Blair Witch Project and that success has spawned multiple sequels and in some ways revitalized the handycam genre.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is about a middle class couple, Katie and Micah, who have recently moved into a new home. Shortly after their arrival, however, strange things start happening. They begin hearing weird noises and every morning when they wake up things have been moved around and windows have been opened or closed. To figure out who or what is behind all this Micah buys a camera to film them while they're sleeping. What the two discover from this will change their lives forever. They quickly learn that some sort of paranormal force is behind all these disturbances and, whatever it is, it isn't happy and it's there to stay.<br/><br/>The first person style of filming where the characters have the camera is a style you either like or you don't. Personally, I'm a sucker for this style. I've really enjoyed every film I've seen filmed like this. The Blair Witch Project is one of my favorite horror films, Cloverfield is a movie I can watch over and over again, and there is also the movie Chronicle that came out earlier this year that is absolutely fantastic. Paranormal Activity is no exception. I really enjoyed this film. It's unique in its style, and it's also completely terrifying. Paranormal Activity is scary to the extent where I felt legitimately stressed out by it, and incredibly bothered and uncomfortable. I was worn out by the end of the film, which is a mere 86 minutes, and had to spend some time calming my nerves. This film knows how to scare and it doesn't hold back.<br/><br/>Most of the scare factor in this film stems from not knowing what is going on and not knowing what will happen. There is a lot of waiting around for things to happen with periods of 30 seconds to a minute of nothing happening, only stillness as Katie and Micah sleep. This anxiety stirring waiting is one of the scariest aspects of the film and it is done perfectly. You know you're scared when the simple moving of a door is enough to send a chill down your spine. This is minimalist horror at its finest.<br/><br/>Many hate this film because of its lack of action and the way we see so little of what is actually going on, but these are the reasons I really liked it. Showing little in the film leaves so much to our imagination, and our imagination will always produce something far more terrifying than what the movie can muster. Paranormal Activity is a film that got inside my head and scared me more than I've been scared by a film in a long time. It is well worth the watch, and is an excellent representation of what the hand-held camera genre is capable of."
"rlaine","5","0","0","30 January 2012"," I was left disappointed, very clichéd
","I was under the impression this was a good and somewhat well received movie when I caught this on TV. I'm a fan of supernatural and paranormal movies which do not rely on cheap scares or blood and gore, so I was actually looking forward to this.<br/><br/>Well, good things first. There was very little blood and not really gore at all, thumbs up for this, there's never too many horror movies of this kind. The story was somewhat interesting, I like stories that don't go full throttle all the time or are too traditionally structured. There's a genuine feel of not knowing what will happen next when watching this. You really keep an eye on the screen, because you want to see if something happens. If there is a small freaky clue or anything really. I was pretty hooked.<br/><br/>What was wrong with it then? I didn't find the movie very believable nor the characters very genuine or likable. The guy continuously does what the girl doesn't want him to do and it gets kind of annoying. She's telling him to turn of the camera all the time, so you are also aware of the camera all the time and while this may be unavoidable in a movie like this, I still felt it distracting.<br/><br/>The movie is very clichéd and most of the stuff doesn't make much sense. A lot of stuff happened just because they are commonly felt as freaky, ie. the attic, lights turning on and off, everything happening during the night. What if the couple were working on a night shift, would the entity then have done the actions daytime? The ouija board scene was especially cheesy.<br/><br/>The biggest let down was the ending, while it was partly freaky, the very very ending ruined it. You'll know when you see it, completely unnecessary choice to make the camera (and audience) so obvious again.<br/><br/>I'm surprising myself saying this, but this movie was actually a bit boring. I'm OK with slow paced movies, but you need some food for brain to make it interesting even if it's slow.<br/><br/>It's all done better before (Poltergeist, Entity). Even the more recent movie The Fourth Kind which utilizes somewhat similar idea is so much better and more engaging, only it's about aliens rather than geists. There's also a movie called The Collingswood Story (2002) which I also think was a lot better than this."

","This film is promoted as a cinema verite of a paranormal event. But at the end I will tell you why I gave it a 1 out of ten. Meanwhile, I want you to read it as I experienced it. In the opening it thanks the families of the two characters and the San Diego Police Department. I watched the trailer before I rented it on cable. There was no indication that it was anything but home footage of paranormal activity. There was nothing else on cable so I rented it. (There must be multiple edits in circulation because many of the goofs that are reported on IMDb were not in the film I watched). But, like the Blair Witch Project, I thought I would watch it to see what all the talk was about: how a low budget film could have grossed so much. I did notice as the film progressed and I was buying it, that there was one goof still in the film that was never explained or mentioned. In a house with a burglar alarm set, the female character leaves the house in the middle of the night without setting off the alarm. That was when I began to question the veracity. I admit it: I am gullible. At the end (which is a different end from what is described on IMDb) after the film stops rolling, there are no credits, but a copyright and the standard disclaimer that this film is completely fictitious and any similarity to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. It was then that I realized that I had been duped. I know, I should have known that it would have been on the news if it actually happened and not a film in a theater. But, it was only then I went to IMDb to confirm that this was not cinema verite of actual events. This is purely fictitious and the film was had a writer, director, hired actors, stage hands, and was deliberately sold to the public as fact. Most people would be on their way out of the theater when the fiction disclaimer was shown and who actually reads them as even docu-dramas have this disclaimer even though it is a representation of factual events. So, people saw it, believed it to be true, told their friends, and we lined the pockets of another group of people who promote a film as fact when it is fiction. I wish I could get my money back. But more than that, I believe that films like this should have at the beginning credits and a clear disclaimer that it is fiction. We pay to see big budget horror films knowing they are fiction. This group deliberately presented the film from beginning to the penultimate frame as fact. Gullible people like myself belief that they are seeing cinema verite when it is presented as such. It should be illegal to promote a fictional film as fact. Even though I rented it on cable, my money went to a group of people who presented fiction as fact until the final frame with the legal disclaimer. I was livid. In future, I will be going to IMDb to find out as much about a film before I even pay $4 to rent it. But that is not why I gave it the lowest rating. I gave it the lowest rating because despite all the hype, it is not scary or riveting or even entertaining. I kept waiting for something to happen that would scare me or have me on the edge of my seat. It never happened. I only put it on pause to stare with disbelief at the end of reel fiction disclaimer. That was the only thing thing about this film that I will remember. It was a hoax."

","I unabashedly love Paranormal Activity and consider it to be one of the best horror films out there. Not THE best, but damn close, and before you laugh at least hear me out. For the many things it did poorly (and it did many), PA did one thing exceptionally well.....it did a great job of hitting a primal tone and nerve. Namely, it exposed and made apparent the vulnerability of sleep, something that everyone can identify with and must do. I can't identify being lost in the woods with friends with a witch leaving stick figures outside my tent. I can't relate to seeing my daughter's head doing a 360 and spewing pea soup in someone's face, nor of Darth Maul suddenly appearing behind someone (Insidious). But I can relate to having to fall asleep every night and trusting that nothing bad will happen. THAT is the core element of what makes PA such an effective film, and it honed in and exploited this aspect beautifully. Being attacked or hunted by something unknown, unseen and unexplainable (which is scary in itself) while asleep is a very fundamental fear and is frightening as all hell. It hit home, got under my skin, got my imagination running, and left me jumping at every creek and bump at night while trying to get to bed. This film stayed with me long after I had left the theatre. To me, that is an indication of a good movie. I also thought it was paced perfectly, was accurate in the depiction of a haunting (or what I'd imagine one to be like), and the occurrences were so mild and escalation so believable it made it even better, and made its flaws, IMO, overlook-able.<br/><br/>I think that those who simply see a door moving a few inches and lights going on and off and say, ""so what, how is that scary?"" are missing the point, and the underlying goal that the movie's striving for. They weren't meant to scare in and of themselves (aside from the few scenes at the end), they were intended to imply and hint at while building tension and dread about what was to come. If taken just on its minimalistic approach to film-making without trying to look deeper than that I can entirely see why some find it awful. It really is NOT that good of a movie when viewed from a technical perspective. There's questionable acting, some plot holes and stupid plot points (most notably the psychic and Micah's sometimes ridiculous and unbelievable behavior), admittedly all of which don't help. Especially if someone doesn't or can't entertain the possibility of such phenomenon existing (though I've never understood why someone who didn't think such a thing was a possibility would go see it in the first place).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I can see why many hate PA, but I love it, and feel there aren't nearly enough films like it. Unfortunately, I fear this series will degrade into simple cash-in releases every October, i.e. the ""Saw"" movies. Be warned though, if you're looking for explicit horror, look elsewhere. This film really doesn't show you barely anything at all, and what it does show 90% of the time is miniscule. It is psychological horror that needs imagination. If you have one and if you can grit your teeth through its blunders and approach this with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised. Considering how this film is such a love it/hate it affair though, I'd highly recommend renting it first to see if it's your cup of tea."

I'm really quite flexible when it comes to what type of film i like to see. I can see the shocky kind of horror movie, the more ""moody"" kind, i even like Pretty Woman for Christ's sake. The problem here is, it's not that shocky, to me that is. And it's not that moody. It's just slow, and the main characters are a couple of stereotype annoying Americans. Micah is a total douche-bag, not respecting his girlfriends feelings. And she's just too overbearing with him. Anyhow, this is the kind of films that split the audience in two.

","I was reluctant to see this one for awhile, as I thought it would be more hype than anything, but last week my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>There are people that will say it isn't scary, but I think it's all in the way that you view it. People seem to forget that the purpose of a film is to submerse the viewer into the emotions and actions of the characters. If you imagine yourself in a situation such as the events of Paranormal Activity, you mean to tell me that you wouldn't be the least bit scared? I doubt it.<br/><br/>With that said, I have to say that I was impressed. I've seen a lot of horror movies (though this title falls under a psychological thriller more than anything), and I really liked the way the movie was done.<br/><br/>The lighting and the camera visuals were just plain creepy. Imagine watching those camera recordings the next day and seeing these things? I think that was the goal of director -to add a sense of mystery and suspense, and I think they succeeded.<br/><br/>The acting was decent (I've seen much worse), and I can even call it good for a horror film. They created a sense of realism which just added to the suspense, as you can tell that they were genuinely scared.<br/><br/>There wasn't really any music to speak of, but again, this is supposed to be ""real"" camera footage, so it makes sense to be void of any sort of soundtrack. The sound effects were nice, with a few ""jump out of your seat"" kind of scenes.<br/><br/>As others have said, it's a fairly slow-moving film, meaning that the suspense and stress of the characters builds rather slowly, but it works well for this type of film. Give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in the feelings and fears of the characters. If you view it that way, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","0","3 December 2011"," ""Paranormal Activity"" is so enjoyably spooky that I am all the more disappointed that I passed on the chance to see it in a theater.
","The peculiar pleasure of being scared is one of the most inexplicable and perversely fascinating things about the human psyche. Over the centuries, we have shelled out money to subject ourselves to a good scare, and when the auctioneers of the show hold up their end of the bargain, we come out of the auditorium chilled, quivering, and yet, more importantly, giddy all at the same time. Being scared at the movies is like subjecting oneself to an intense nightmare; the only difference is that this time we get to choose when and where we are pounded raw by the blood-chilling pseudo-paranormal. Perhaps that is the pleasure of a good scary picture. And in recent years, fewer have come close in influence, promise, and delivery than Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity."" It is precisely the sort of scare picture that I enjoy: spooky, clever, and yet not overdone to the point where it becomes depressing and the shock value diminishes.<br/><br/>It is also evidence that sometimes a limited budget forces the creative monster out of all of us. For it is because it was filmed on a shoestring budget, and that it was literally filmed inside director Peli's own house, and that it was acted by talents who might as well have been playing themselves, it seems all that much closer to life - or perhaps the appropriate term is 'plausibility.' And therefore, it's all the more pleasurably creepy.<br/><br/>A bigger, fiscally-minded production probably would have turned this story of a haunted girl (Katie Featherston) and her scrupulous boyfriend (Micah Sloat) into a modern-day ""Poltergeist"" with tremendous influence placed on what a special effects studio can do. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, as the marvelous 1980 classic that I just mentioned did it and did it well, but ""Paranormal Activity"" accomplishes something just as good with even less. It's one of those 'mockumentary' pictures, with the whole thing being pre-recorded footage supposedly picked up by a third party. As it starts out, Mr. Sloat, concerned over his girlfriend's confessions of being haunted, buys a camera to record them as they sleep, to prove to her that the only thing paranormal in the house is what she is imagining. Then, spooky stuff starts happening. They hear sounds from downstairs, the lights in the hallway come on and off without explanation, and the door, conveniently left open every single night, begins to move on its own.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" has some great shock moments in it, but what it really builds its strength on its suspense. And again, this is where its limited budget comes into rewarding effect. Low-key (but not overly gloomy) lighting increases visual tension, similarly-shot scenes, and similar methods to help the audience watch for signs of danger. In the movie, the two haunted characters show little in the way of intelligence, for even as they start to believe that there is a specter among them, they always leave the door to their bedroom wide open. Is it because they're not the sharpest tools in the shed? Perhaps that's the plot's excuse, but it's really the ingenuity of the filmmakers. They know we want to see signs of a ""boo!"" moment upcoming. Therefore they keep the door open so that we may see the lights in the hallway turning on, and better still, a nondescript shadow passing against the lit side of the door. And for once, the hand-held camera gimmick comes to terrific effect, as it seems all-too-real.<br/><br/>In spite of its uncanny ability to set teeth on edge, ""Paranormal Activity"" does not overplay its shock-and-suspense factor to the point of overkill. Rather, it plays its scare elements to just the right level and gives us proper stretches of relief in-between. What results is a set of chills and thrills that are giddily exciting, not depressing, not to be turned away from. ""Paranormal Activity"" is so enjoyably spooky that I am all the more disappointed that I passed on the chance to see it in a theater."

","There were many gossips about this movie the time I heard about it. People didn't want to sleep after watching it, many had no desire to watch the other two movies, simply because they were too scared. So I was curious about it.<br/><br/>Main idea of the film is same as ""Blair witch project"" or ""Rec"" - to make things look more realistic. So, it is a movie, that is intentionally using an average camera for home using in order to provide such effect to make everything happening in movie look even scarier. And there comes the first problem - it is not original in such idea. At least it managed to provide the realistic atmosphere of all of the events in the movie.<br/><br/>Then it is one of the rare movies, that has a really shallow plot, which I generally find disturbing, because every decent movie has a really good plot. And real time camera caption is not an excuse for it. In fact, you can always watch creepy videos throughout the internet without any plot, if you want to be scared.<br/><br/>Then at some point the classical ""BOO"" effect and protagonists screaming becomes really annoying. This was used in milliards of other horror movies and simply doesn't work over and over again.<br/><br/>The characters themselves aren't well-developed. This makes the plot even more shallow than it is.<br/><br/>Though it succeeded in creating tension from start of the movie, which solidly leads to final events.<br/><br/>But overall, I expected much more from this movie.

I thought this movie was going to be exactly like it, so I had very low expectations.<br/><br/>Instead, I was surprised when I found the film to be very well done and even very scary in some spots. I sometimes needed to remind myself that these events are fictional, because they seemed so real. It is an entertaining movie, and it was different enough from The Blair Witch Project. The acting is very good and the plot moves at a steady pace. Nothing drags on or feels rushed.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good horror film that should not be missed. It's one of those movies that are good for a scary movie night or a Halloween party. There are many movies that are much scarier than this one, but Paranormal Activity is sure to cause a few screams.<br/><br/>8/10 - Great"

","This much hyped film is an off-shoot of the Blair Witch Project D.I.Y. filming which likes to think it is a genre of film-making in it's own right. But, just like Blair Witch, Paranormal activity is virtually devoid of content and even more disappointing. There is very little story which might have helped to make the film even a little frightening. The small cast do not act in a believable way and are not very interesting. Being subtle is one thing, but a few cheesy demonic noises and slamming doors are nowhere near enough to provide an atmosphere. The film is a failure in my eyes because it didn't scare me and therefore didn't do what was claimed by it's many supporters. It's huge success is therefore astonishing as it has to be one of the most boring films I have ever watched and wouldn't scare a new-born baby. A far superior film of this kind is the Spanish horror REC, which unfolds in real-time (live) and was very skilfully put together. It makes any other horror film seem mild by comparison and exposes Paranormal activity as even more shoddy and laughable."

","Paranormal activity.This movie was the worse movie I have seen. I love watching scary movies but this one did not scare me at all. The movie is about a couple who just move to a new home in San Diego to live together be seeing some paranormal activities. Katy says that she has those problems since she was a child and her boyfriend does not believe her, but after some strange things happen, he started to agree with her. She put a video camera so she can have some captures of the spirits or gosh. At first when I stared to watch the movie I thought that the movie I bough was not well recorded or something was wrong. From the beginning thru the end was the same scene for me nothing happen. It was so boring, I did not like it. It was different than other scary movies but it was not what I was expected to watch. I kept forwarding the movie skipping some parts that were not interesting. Towards the end of the movie I cannot understand why other people still liked it."

","I was hyped when I heard this film would come out. The Tralier showed us a audience reaction from them watching clips of the movie getting scared to death. This got me hyped because I love horror films. I saw it on DVD and... .... Ugh... why did they make this movie? I can tell you whats wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>1. Although not boring, its annoying! The couple is to stupid to figure out whats going on at all and it feels like a eternity when you hear them argue. Thats all this movie is. Arguing.<br/><br/>2. Another word that can be described is it is Dumb. This movie's logic is about as correct as Driller Killer's. When the demon possesses the girl she stands there for like 3 hours doing nothing. I guess the demon had to wiggle its toes and fingers while watching the guy sleep.<br/><br/>3. This is one of the most stupidest parts of the film. The demon starts doing sit ups after killing the boyfriend. Why? Just why?! There is no point in this at all and it makes it... you get the point.<br/><br/>4. Pointless scenes that the editor could have trimmed out. I know this movie is on a low budget but when the editing is that bad for a low budget movie thats saying lots.<br/><br/>5. The audience has been brainwashed. They have all been possessed by demons while they watched this catastrophe. <br/><br/>I don't know what else to say. This film is a disgrace to film making. If you are a director who wants to make a movie like this. Please don't make the same mistakes as the crew members did."

","This movie was awesome! I am a really big fan of horror films and paranormal activity was great. The whole movie was based on a girl named Katie who lives with a boyfriend Micah in a home in California. She is being haunted by a demonic entity that's trying to possess her soul. I thought the theme complexity of human relationships fit this movie to a T. because this movie focuses on problems, and frustrations in a human relationship. Granite the problems in the relationship aren't between Micah and Katie, but between them two and this entity. So the film gives us insight of the problem without any clear solution to the problem. That's what made it so much more intense for me, because people don't go through these types of things every day. So your sitting on the edge of you seat asking yourself ""OMG, what are they going to do? They don't have a solution and the demons going to take over her soul."" At this point Micah doesn't know what to do. There's no one there for him to defend her from, just air. So he's really at a loss for words and ways to fix the problem. So now the human relationship is being tested because Micah doesn't know how much more he can take with Katie because he knows the problem revolves around her but it's not her fault. So he's frustrated and upset with something he can't even see, that's causing the wedge between them two. Paranormal activity theme complexity of human relationship is also spotted in another on of my favorite, Insidious. Because the problem was very similar but in this particular movie their son was haunted and the fact of not knowing if he had a true medical condition or if he was being possessed drew a wedge in between the parents relationship. Both of these movies added intensity with both the music and lighting mainly. Because the lighting at certain points was very dark with the rumble and really intense base of the music in my living made you want to scream, because you knew something was about to happen! That's what makes movies very horrifying and makes and makes you bite your nails at the edge of your seat. You can tell it was more than enough because there's no way the director could have pulled the same lighting and sounds off to a comedy or love story. He made it just right for the horrifying vision that he was trying to capture in paranormal activity. At the end of the day you have to put yourself in their shoes! What if you had a spouse or significant other you cannot help? There's something trying to get them and you can't see it! Of course everyone says ""hell, I would've left."" But this is you wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, roommate, or maybe even a family member. Could it or would it be that simple to leave them? This is where the wedge would come in between the two and put strain on that human relationship foe me. But thank god it's only theatrical entertainment and we get to watch it and not live it because I would officially be named crazy in someone's mental facility!"

","First let me say if you life this movie you probably have not seen any good movie in your life. This movie is horrible. It is very low budget, the acting is just atrocious and it is not scary at all. I don't know if you remember all the hype for this movie saying ""the scariest movie of all time"" but that is probably why it grossed 100 million. Why people like it is beyond me. I love horror movies but i don't like boring movies that are not scary. <br/><br/>This movie is about a couple in a house who notices weird things that start to happen. So they set up a camera and then go to sleep. (literally half the movie is them sleeping then a loud noise them being like ahhhh oh my god..... It is so lame. After they watch the film they indeed find out there is something besides them living in that house.<br/><br/>Please friends i am a huge horror fan and i could not stand this movie. If you are a big film lover stay away from this. Even if your not. the only reason anyone should ever watch this train wreck of a movie is if every movie on earth is destroyed and you have had a labotomy hands down worst movie ever."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","0","0","21 July 2011"," Still effective at some parts and in some ways.
","Just like ""The Blair With Project"" this movie its idea is better than the actual execution. Also the entire marketing campaign behind it was better and more effective than the actual movie, just like was the case with ""The Blair With Project"", which is the reason why the movie doesn't really lives up to its hype but you at least still can call it original and effective in some parts.<br/><br/>Yes, in this age of modern horror this movie does definitely feel like a breath of fresh air. You could say that his movie is more old school horror and doesn't depend so much on its writing but more on its atmosphere and build up. But this only works for so long. You could say that the movie is being a bit of a lackluster as well, since you are constantly waiting for something to happen or develop. But as strange as it may sound, that was actually what I liked about this movie.<br/><br/>It kept you guessing and constantly waiting. The movie didn't provide much information and it at its beginning does a good job at setting up the right required tension and mystery. It constantly makes you aware and ensures that you keep paying attention to the screen, knowing that something might happen, that you might miss when you blink. The movie at that point only consists out of the occasional weird sound, or a sudden falling object. That's old school film-making in its very essence and at its very best. But the movie is not consistent with that unfortunately. I actually began to dislike the movie when suddenly more and more paranormal activity start to happen, which was just too much to really take serious. The movie actually became sort of ridicules, which also made all of the events suddenly terribly ineffective and just not scary at all. This gets increasingly worse when the movie is heading toward its end.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help much that the actors aren't much good. The movie really suffers from that. Because this is an extremely low-budget movie it only has inexperienced actors in it who don't express their emotions and fears very convincingly. The movie pretends like it consists entirely out of found footage (again, just like ""The Blair With Project"") but even those who are ignorant enough to believe this at first will soon realize it's all 'fake' once they see the actors try to act in this movie. Seriously, with some professional actors instead of amateurs this movie could had been still about ten times as effective to watch.<br/><br/>Still I'm willing to give this movie plenty of credit, not just for what it achieved globally at the box offices but also for what it is as a movie. It's a movie with a shoe-string budget but it came up with a very creative idea that cost very little money and actually let its low-budget work for the movie and its concept. It also shows that you don't need lots of money to successfully create a horror atmosphere and can also manage without having to fall back on all sort of gore or effects. <br/><br/>It's also a movie made with the viewpoint of only just one camera and only has an handful of characters in it, at just one location. This is not the easiest way of film-making but they did a very good job with this all. So I still have lots of respect for Oren Peli for making this movie but that all still doesn't make this movie a great one.<br/><br/>I am still sure that with the right crowd and under the right circumstances this can still be a good scary movie to watch.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","So I watched 2007's surprise hit ""paranormal activity"" starring two people I have never heard of before or since this movie came out. The stars are also the directors as this movie was shot on a single camera. The stars are Katie somebody and Micah somebody playing fictional couple Micah and Katie somebody. So in other words this movie isn't about the stars. So what is this movie about? Well let's not discuss plot but rather what this movie is. Well it is a horror movie of the best kind, minimal where the chills come from what we don't see. Often this fear of the unknown affects are own lives and I often prefer movies that reflect the heightened sense of fear we often display in the face of nothing to be afraid of. This movie is very similar in concept to ""The Blair Witch project"". Unknown actors are given a camera and imersed into a scary situation. However with this film there is a very structured plot and use of minor but highly effective special effects. The result is a movie which is very creepy. So I have waited to say whether it is good or not, well yeah it is good, and I think it could have been great. The ending is much like Blair witch, but unlike Blair Witch instead of just ending when the big horrible crescendo is reached, we are exposed to a coda which kind of ruined it for me. So it is good, it has broad appeal, and if you liked Blair witch you will probably like this movie. It is a really great flick, if unlike me you turn it off when you hear the final blood curdling screams. I know I wish had."

","Taking cue from ""Blair Witch Project"" comes yet another on similar lines and guess what - it delivers a rock solid punch. <br/><br/>Clearly visible that ""Paranormal Activity"" is made on a shoe-string budget. Shot in an apartment with 2-lead actors and another 2-supporting cast. <br/><br/>It is a very simple story with nothing unusual scare tactics. Had the POV technique not used, it would have struggled to find a sell on the horror channel. The beauty is the flow of the narrative, which pauses at regular intervals ensuring the fear gets implanted into the audience's head and later on take the germination to the next level. The strongest point of the movie is the static viewpoint of the camera which alleviates the fear factor exponentially. <br/><br/>Micah Sloat does a good job, a typical alpha-male wanting to get to the bottom of the issue. Every person comes with a baggage and in the case of Katie it comes with a demon. Mark Fredrichs did a poor job on performance front, seemed to be in a rush to get out of the frame. <br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" will linger on for quite a while to extent your ears become more receptive to the creaking floor-boards and the gregarious streak inside you comes alive to avoid being alone at home."

","Well after such an hype the movie has done well overall also after the incorporated sum is very low. If you ask me, don't go with the hype and don't expect anything different. The one different thing is the treatment like a cam movie making it more close to real stuff but its not. Now coming to movie. I seriously didn't find it anywhere near good. More than half of the movie is very boring. I am still amazed how it has been rated so good and how people are so scared after watching it. There are far better cam movies than this. There are three different endings and I will suggest you go with the theatrical version as it has a better climax. The movie offers nothing new. It lacks majorly in script and direction. Its not scary trust me. Moreover you might get frustrated and bored till the last 15 min. Would not recommend it."

Also, fairly good work from the 2 main characters of the movie though the guy's act could have been a little better.<br/><br/>It also had a few shocking moments for people who like 'jump from the seat' moments.

"sam-50-208908","8","0","0","10 May 2011"," Paranromal Activity, and why special effects can suck.
","So many movies nowadays are made with this philosophy in mind: ""CG effects make everything better."" Well, I'm here today to tell you this is not true and, in fact, it's one of the stupidest statements I've ever heard uttered from someone's mouth. Computer graphics are a great resource for filmmakers, as it allows them to capture moments that are otherwise impossible, or enhance certain scenes to drive a point, and yes, they can even just make a scene flat-out look better. You know what else they can do? They can totally and utterly ruin movies that would have otherwise been pretty decent, or even good.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a great example of this. I don't think there's a person on this planet with an IQ above 3, who would argue the fact that additional special effects would have RUINED this film. It's lack of CGI, and reliance on practical effects, is exactly what made this film so great. There is power behind realism, and this is something that 90% of Hollywood film makers forget.<br/><br/>This is the first time, in a long time, that I actually made audible noise as a result of being scared in the theater. The actors aren't really noteworthy, but it is important to mention that I felt that they could be legitimate human beings, and since this is shot in the faux documentary style, it makes it more believable.<br/><br/>All-in-all Paranormal Activity goes into my book of the best horror films in recent years, and if anyone hasn't seen it yet, please do. If anyone claims to not have been scared by this movie then I ask that you watch it by yourself in your house at night and then make a statement like that, because I have and let me tell you, I was terrified - but having a blast the entire time."
"AkumaHeishi","Null","0","0","31 March 2011"," Not bad, but I have a few problems.
","Firstly, let me say that as a whole I did enjoy this movie. The home camera style made it more personal and believable. However, one part of the movie that made it hard to go along with was the fact the the character of Micah was just no very bright. I cant think of anybody I know that would have been that idiotic throughout the entire series of events that the characters went through. Micah practically asked for the ""demon"" to do something to him and his wife. Personally if those types of things actually happened to me in my house I would have been out in practically no time. I understand that in the end the ""demon"" wasn't haunting the house but still, I would have at least left to see if that helped at all. Instead Micah insisted that they stay there and stand up to an entity that they could in no way fight or even defend themselves from.<br/><br/>I guess that is typical of horror movies and if they were to leave and it worked there would be no movie, but they could have moved and the entity follow them or something.<br/><br/>This is just my opinion though."
"MBunge","7","0","0","31 March 2011"," Like a grown man playing peek-a-boo with his mom
","This movie is fun, creepy, excitingand I'm embarrassed at how much I liked it. I feel like a grown man who just enjoyed playing peek-a-boo with his mother.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, Paranormal Activity is like a remedial version of The Blair Witch Project. If you loved the latter, you'll find the former less entertaining but still well worth seeing. If you're one of those types that has taken to ripping The Blair Witch Project to prove how smart and sophisticated you are, every single complaint and criticism you've made applies even more so to Paranormal Activity. So, your reaction to this movie will depend on whether you've taken the stick out of your butt.<br/><br/>Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are a young, unmarried couple living together in a big house in San Diego. There are two other important things in the house with them. One is a video camera they use to tape everything that goes on. The other is an invisible demon who repeatedly torments them. The world's biggest psychic douchebag also shows up for some exposition, but it's mostly just Katie, Micah, the camera and things going bang or roar in the night.<br/><br/>This film is supposed to be the ""real video"" footage of what happened to Katie and Micah, just as the Blair Witch Project was supposedly ""real video"" footage shot by those kids in the woods. But unlike its late 1990s predecessor, Paranormal Activity puts up only the barest pretense at being ""real video"". It's less realistic, more obviously contrived and it's impossible not to recognize how the movie is deliberately manipulating your emotions. For all that, though, it's still pretty effective.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example. A lot of the movie is shot in Katie and Micah's bedroom where they have the camera set up to record things as they sleep. Their bed is on the right side of the screen and on the left side is their open bedroom door, leading out into a hallway and the stairs down to the ground floor. It's set up that way so you're constantly looking over at the open door, wondering and worrying and freaking out over what might come through it. I was completely aware of what writer/director Oren Peli was trying to do and how he was trying to do it and he still creeped me out.<br/><br/>There's something about hand held video and the possibility of the supernatural that hooks into your brain somehow and gets you to believe. The fact that the acting is just okay, the dialog beyond banal and the plot kind of tedious simply plays into your suspension of disbelief and makes it feel more true. That magic is the reason why there's 327 different shows on cable TV about people looking for ghosts with video cameras, even though every single episode of every single show is exactly the same.<br/><br/>1. The go somewhere to look for ghosts.<br/><br/>2. They don't find any.<br/><br/>3. The end.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because we grow up associating video footage with the news or with our own home movies and it programs us to involuntarily respond to all video footage as if it were actually happening. Maybe the first generation who grows up entirely with Youtube will react to video footage as merely another entertainment format, robbing films like Paranormal Activity of their power. But until that occurs, movies like this will be able to come along every few years and scare at least the socks off us.<br/><br/>And if you like Paranormal Activity, let me again recommend a movie called Video X. It's not about ghosts, demons or witches. It's about a white trash girl and an even whiter trash guy who video tape their cross country trip that goes horribly awry. I think Video X is the pinnacle of ""real video"" filmmaking. It's better than Paranormal Activity and better than The Blair Witch Project. That's because it's more than a trick. It uses the ""real video"" style to tell a genuine story of hope, fear, love and despair.<br/><br/>I can recommend Paranormal Activity, but Video X is a must-see."
"zaisjr","7","0","0","24 January 2011"," Not your typical horror movie
","When I first heard about this movie I figured it was another Blair Witch ripoff. But I must admit that it is actually a decent horror flick.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't rely on blood, guts, gore, sex, and nudity to make itself a good movie. It relies on well-planned and placed scares, sounds, and reactions. I was very tense during this movie and many unexpected frights make the hair on your neck stand up. The actions of the paranormal entity mixed with the frightening sounds make for one frightful film. On top of this, the movie feels realistic. For being amateur actors, the acting is superb. It truly feels like this story could be true and be something documented.<br/><br/>I'm not the sort of person who gets scared easily during movies. The last film that spooked me this much was the Ring. I didn't watch this film in the theater. I watched it from home which gives it more of a scary feel. Many complained to me that far too many rude teenagers come to these types of films. This is why I watched this one from home. If you are a patient individual who likes movies about paranormal entities, while not being ""too Hollywood"", this movie is perfect for you."
"squeezebox","8","0","0","14 December 2010"," If you like being scared, you'll love it. If you don't like being scared, you won't.
","I really, really liked Paranormal Activity, but I tend to like this kind of movie. I know that there was a something of a backlash against this movie, as there was with The Blair Witch Project, and I think that it has to do with two things: the enormous return on investment and the refusal to go along for the ride.<br/><br/>The first is pretty easy to understand. Even I as an aspiring filmmaker am kicking myself for not coming up with the idea (as I did when I first saw Blair Witch). Someone making a movie for $10,000 or $15,000 and going on to make tens of millions of dollars as a result can frustrate anyone and some viewers allow those sour grapes to ruin the movie for them.<br/><br/>The second reason is more hard to understand: refusing to go along with it. In other words, some people a) can't get lost in the story and suspend their disbelief and b) simply don't want to be scared. I don't mean they're afraid to be scared; I mean they don't want to allow themselves to be scared. They hear that a movie is scary or disturbing and they have a desire to take the wind out of its sails be watching it and then boasting how trite and boring they found it. It's sort of an ego boost: THAT didn't scare ME.<br/><br/>I've now seen decades of horror movies and can honestly say that only a handful have really truly frightened me. Night of the Living Dead, Jaws, The Shining and the aforementioned The Blair Witch Project all had at least a few scenes which scared the crap out of me (The Shining has a palpably terrifying atmosphere from beginning to end).<br/><br/>In the past ten years or so, I can only say that a couple of movies got under my skin. Session 9 I found to be a genuinely creepy movie with a few heart-in-my-throat moments, and David Lynch's Inland Empire, thought perhaps not a straight horror movie, had a few moments that were the first to make me jump out of my seat in years.<br/><br/>You can imagine my delight, therefore, when I found myself jumping and actually being SCARED while watching Paranormal Activity. A very simple, well-made horror movie that works because it leaves so much to your imagination. Instead of throwing a barrage of gruesome CGI imagery at you, the movie creates a truly creepy atmosphere through sound, the occasional inanimate object moving and, most of all, the effective performances of the cast.<br/><br/>While the acting has a touch of the histrionic theatricality that most Hollywood performers display these days (something which Blair Witch avoided completely), the sense of fear and heartache is completely believable. Katie Featherston's terror is tangible and later, when frustration, anger and guilt join the cocktail of emotions, her final emotional breakdown (which is only briefly shown) is heart-breaking. This then makes her suddenly calm and tranquil demeanor toward the end all the more bizarre and unsettling. And Micah Sloat's alpha male smugness in the face of this unseen intruder is perfectly juxtaposed with his fleeting moments of real fear.<br/><br/>I like the fact that Micah never believes that they are truly in danger. I also think it's somewhat touching that no matter how angry or frustrated he gets with Katie, he is still ready to bolt to her rescue every time she calls to him. He truly loves and cares about her, which makes the conclusion of the movie all the more tragic. I should mention that Katie Fetherston should go down in horror history as one of the all-time best cinematic screamers! There is only one thing about the movie that I can really criticize: no matter how bad things get, they continue to sleep with the lights off. Simply from a believability standpoint, I would think that by a certain point, they would be far too unnerved to sleep in the dark.<br/><br/>But, I admit, that's nit-picking. Paranormal Activity will go down as one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while. I highly recommend it for horror fans who truly want to be scared and are willing to let their guard down and let the movie in."

","This movie was OK... I had a few problems though. I think that the story was good and that the movie could have been good, but they did not do anything good with it. Let's start with the slogan, ""What happens when you sleep"" They could have done anything when someone is sleeping, but they didn't. They spent 7/8 of the movie with the door and small stuff moving, it wasn't until the final fifteen minutes (The credits counting in the minutes) that they finally tried to kill Kate. It was predictable. And maybe it is just me but in the end (Spoiler) When she screams and kills Micah. Was just bad because you expect her to be possessed and kill him. Then it says ""Thanks to KAte and Micah for giving us the footage"" As if it were real. Then they have a sequel with the same family. By the way Kate was never seen again and Micah died so they probably didn't send any footage."

","Another rare cheap project that made crazy money inhabited our cinematic space this past year in Writer-Director Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"". Many compare it to the low-budget, high-grossing late 90's horror flick ""The Blair Witch Project"". I thought that ""Paranormal Activity"" had its suspenseful & scary moments but overall my consensus is that ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a better premise & narrative, and even marketing plan; even though both movies were ingenious in the marketing end. Just in case you are in the abnormal activity end of the movie world and do not know what the premise of ""Paranormal Activity"" is, I will divulge you that info. The movie is about Micah and Katie, a young San Diego couple who suspect there is paranormal activity going on in the master bedroom of their two-story house during the midnight hours. Therefore, they set up a camera in their bedroom and let the video roll as they are sleeping in order to later see for themselves if they are in the spirit. As Blair Witch, the haunting scenes of the film divulge themselves from minor sounds that make a major chilling impact. Peli scored some points on the directorial end of the suspenseful scenes of the movie, but focused way too much on the couple's ridiculous arguments on the writing end. But what do I do know! It only cost him $15,000 to produce the film and its made over $100 million in the box office. So Pelisimo, you are laughing all the way to the bank! I guess lots of not-so-normal, high-volume ATM activity use for Oren now. Micah Slot & Katie Featherston star as Micah & Katie. So this is all real and in reality they were not really acting! Even in the sex scenes of the film! Kidding! There was not much of any Parahormone Activity in the movie. And there was not much of any thespian activity in the movie either, but Micah & Katie's job was not really to act, just to ghostbuster their way through. ""Paranormal Activity"" is sure one step beyond some of the horror movie duds that have been released in the last few years, but zoom in more on the creative direction of the movie than on its mediocre script & acting. So hope you enjoyed my usual Punnormal Activity that I inject in most of my film reviews, or maybe this will continue to haunt me. **** Good"
"mlevans","7","0","0","9 January 2010"," Can't quite capture 'Blair' magic
","Ten years ago a couple of guys with a camera and a handful of unknown actors turned the cinematic world on its collective ear. They produced a bizarre gem of a thriller for less than $25,000. Ignoring the somewhat questionable marketing of The Blair Witch Project, the cast and crew showed that a hand-held camera could serve as narrator and that CGI, monster costumes, blood, gore, etc., were not absolutely necessary to provoke fright.<br/><br/>That technique in and of itself, however, is no guarantee of producing a legitimately scary film. Owen Peli has followed the same formula in the much-anticipated Paranormal Activity. It is a cross between The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project, we were told for months. Well  the plot, perhaps, is a combination of those two, plus Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. The quality doesn't quite match most of those others.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Paranormal Activity is OK. Rookies Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat turn in stellar work. However, I don't think PA captures the raw emotion and terror of Blair Witch. Chained to the camera-as-narrator device, meanwhile, it fails to evoke Haunting or Poltergeist-like chills, either.<br/><br/>I almost wonder if a film ABOUT the couple trying to capture the occurrences on camera might not have worked better, such as in Poltergeist. In the Blair Witch type films, there is always an awkward moment where there is danger, yet someone takes time to grab the camera, ignoring the others' remonstrations to put the camera down. Of course, if they didn't grab it, there wouldn't be a film. Therefore the quest of 'realism' actually brings about a LOSS of realism. (Would it have cost much more money to have one stable camera recording the events as the couple makes their own video?) The film has its moments. It does gradually build up tension as events escalate and both endings are creepy. Still, there just isn't enough going on throughout the film to really keep an audience on the edge of its seat. Maybe if it were filmed in a more eerie, Gothic setting, where the house had some history, as well as the girl, it might hold tension better.<br/><br/>The format works, as we have seen, but has its built-in flaws. Blair Witch never seemed to suffer for those flaws. That cannot truthfully be said of Paranormal Activity. Somehow PA misses matching Blair Witch's intensity and frightfulness by half a step."

","I got a bit confused after seeing this movie. It's clear from the very first moment it's an ultra-low budget thing and I wasn't waiting on a huge production. Nevertheless, the acting and writing could be so much better, imo.<br/><br/>Micah becomes extremely stupid and insensitive most of the times and Katie looks dumb for keep him going on like that. Who the hell would bear anyone filming every step one'd gave, specially when you're against it? Sometimes Katie seems really scared (every yelling scene is convincing indeed) but the whole doesn't make sense: she just lets the situation run day by day and doesn't leave home most of the time. At least it would be normal if one of them thought about being surrounded by people, even knowing strange things would happen anyway... At least, I would! The Ouija board part is pretty cool but there are a few topics that also don't make sense. You need to concentrate on a certain question and put your fingers on the board glass, otherwise you won't get any answer. The pointer moved anyway, even Micah hasn't done any effort to make a well-suited communication scheme...<br/><br/>Concerning the writing, it's absolutely awful and imo the worst part of this movie. The dialogue is pretty void and plain, with lots of clichès and tones of ""I have an idea"" (and then here it comes a stupid idea like - who would have guessed! - filming the same thing over and over again or spreading baby powder on the floor when you already have millions of evidences that there's a ghost who steps on the floor) or ""We need to do something"", ""I feel it's dangerous"", ""What the heck is this thing?"", blah blah etc etc...<br/><br/>However, not everything about this are drawbacks. For a low budget production, some of the scenes which were supposed to be scared (I didn't get particularly scared but I recognize some of them have potential) are pretty well done, considering there are no five stars special effects. It gets you exhausted and thrilled, keeps you ""waiting"" for the hours to pass until something happens and so the crescendo is different from many of the other horror movies. However, by the end, the movie COMPLETELY loses its verosimilitude and becomes deeply deceiving with Katie becoming some kind of creature like the one in The Exorcist.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it's an impressing movie and will certainly please horror movie fans but the ""less as more"" thesis is maybe taken a bit far."
"Whitewolf34","7","0","0","5 December 2009"," Hype killed this horror movie, but there's something here to admire
","First off, I'd like to say that all the hype killed this film. It didn't need to be built up so much. In fact the less you know about it going in, the better.<br/><br/>While it's no Exorcist, as the hype says it is, it is however a clever little film that plays with your mind. That's only if you allow it to.<br/><br/>Yes the build up is slow, but what follows is a great little exercise in terror and how fragile the human condition can be, if played out right. Doing a home video format film like this is always taking a risk in the credibility stakes and this film does have it's flaws.<br/><br/>The performances are borderline good but not enough to carry the 'true terror'of what unfolds, but the female character 'katie' is almost realistic in the unfolding events, which is why the film works when it does.<br/><br/>Go in with an open mind and as less information about the film as possible (which is hard considering all the hype) and you will go along for the ride. Otherwise, check out REC, the Spanish horror film, which in my opinion is much scarier.<br/><br/>Props to the writer/director though, who clearly knew exactly what he was doing and wanted to achieve."

","This movie in a lot of ways was more about a man and a woman than about the supernatural. The leading lady was amazing. I can't shake the feeling I had in the scene in which she talks to a psychic about the experiences she had as a little girl with spirits. It came across as so real that in itself it was just incredibly spooky, just like someone telling you a true story that is really frightening. I'm totally not used to someone in a movie being SO damned convincing the feeling was uncanny and I found myself wondering if this woman had been cast because of her real life torments.<br/><br/>I'm not really aware of the hype surrounding this film I only knew it was made for very little money and was supposed to be scary. I don't know about terrifying I don't know about being spooked by it at home, I was not. But it was very very well done. Occasionally I have to admit I was put off because the man or the woman would do something I couldn't believe they'd actually do. In particular I was really annoyed with the fact that each night when they'd leave the bedroom to investigate, they'd never turn the damn lights on! And why would they leave the damn bedroom door open every night in light of what's been going on!?!? Not feasible!

And is the typical monsters we see in most Hollywoods films.

","I have recently been out to see this movie and due to all the hype and it's claims to be the scariest movie ever made, I was disappointed. I found the film very interesting and very entertaining, it was certainly nothing like anything I have ever seen before. The demonic direction the film takes is well portrayed. I expected to be seeing a movie claiming to be real hard evidence of paranormal activity (Ghosts)Which I thought would be a typical ghost haunting style of movie, and instead I saw demonic possession/presence that was not insanely cheesy and unrealistic but actually felt realistic throughout most of the film. I think the problem with this movie is that people are expecting a lot more when they see the trailers in the cinema's to what they actually see, and if the trailers didn't heighten the expectations the audience wouldn't be waiting for the film to 'kick in' to something they had been lead to believe would scare them like nothing they had ever seen. All in all it's a movie worth watching so long as you are open minded and are do not have high expectations."

","I sought to write this out earlier as quite frankly the films plot/ any memorial moments have managed to escape me between now and viewing the film last night. What can I say to all the other beloved horror film fans.....How much of a laugh is this film? Im not joking when I say that i was in kinks of laughter nearly the whole way through this film, barr the 2 minutes of scariness. This was obviously based on the Blair Witch Project hand held camera idea, and if there is any major criticism of this film it is that the movement was jerky and gave me quite a sore head.<br/><br/>The actual execution of this film was priceless, Im not sure if the editors had intended for Katie's boyfriend to be somewhat of a comic relief, but he worked a treat and had the cinema hall in rapturous fits of laughter. I think the line that one the most was when Micah tells Katie to 'go upstairs and hang out with her new friend'. The amount of one liners this guy lashed out to the demon was priceless and kept me watching. Katie's performance was overdone and instead of feeling sorry for her you felt like she just really needed a slap across the face.<br/><br/>As for the demon, well, I've got some serious holes to pick in this one, mainly this: We are dealing with an un-godly force, hell bent on exacting torture and everlasting pain upon those who mocks it, a force so powerful that even the most qualified psychic's steer away. So then why does it not seem to have the ability to see in the dark as it constantly turns the lights on and then off once its past the room it needs to be in. Also,when Micah is deciphering the Weegie board writings, his interpretation of what the demon wants goes in this order on his notebook: Diane, Edina, Di, BEANS?!?!?!?!?!? Im surprised that the Demon never possessed him there and then and forced him to put his head in the Oven! Still a comical moment.<br/><br/>Guys, I would recommend seeing this for a bit of light hearted humour mixed in with a couple of jump out your seat moments, nothing special and nothing fancy, but there's something likable about this film that keeps you glued to the screen."

However, what i was disappointed in was the attempt usage sub plots within the film.<br/><br/>The Ouija board scene was okay, however, i felt as if the story of Diane could have contained more of a deeper storyline compared to that of a simple website reference of 'oh yeah, the same thing happened to her'.<br/><br/>Both scenes in which the photograph in the attic is found as well as the smashing photograph of the wall could have been developed a little further, as they just seemed to happen, the couple were like ""OH MY GOD"" and then that was it.<br/><br/>Also, the night vision scenes in the bedroom were very well made, with the amount of tension and build up of activity happening over a vast periods of nights, however, it seemed as though in some parts, as soon as any movement was heard, either Katie or Micah woke up and reacted too quickly, loosing the scare element which i think could of been heightened much further.<br/><br/>Even though i went to see this (this evening in fact) with a sold out cinema house, thankfully the rest of the cinema watching were all of an older, more mature audience, which eliminated anyone ruining the (you could call it) 'illusion' of the scares during the film.<br/><br/>For me, I did like the ending (as i did find myself hiding behind my hands at one point ha) and i thought it was a clever way to end the film. I am intrigued to see what the original ending was though! Regarding to actors, i felt that both Katie Featherstone and Micha Solat had really good chemistry on screen and as well as acting incredibly well in these roles, they are what made the film. I think that if they had hired any well-known actors for such parts, it would have lost its appeal and seriousness almost immediately.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy this film. It was good to see it being filmed from a personal point of view, emphasising the realism of the movie, which, without a doubt was the key element in making this film work. The actors worked well, the scares were there, I just think that the mass hype that surrounded this film really did give me incredibly high expectations for it which were slightly disappointed at some points.<br/><br/>But that's just me!

","I went to see paranormal activity with high expectations, the whole hype got me excited and I was looking forward to being scared to death; even the ticket lady said 'prepare to be scared' The film starts off pretty slow, which is nice because it gives you a bit of back story, but it seems to maintain a slow sort of escalation. The 'paranormal happenings' start off small scale and not very frightening, then they gradually build up to be more jumpy and scary; though I think this was a bad idea as it doesn't build up any form of a surprise and almost seems artificial...<br/><br/>The main problem I had with the film was that there was no real mystery and it was pretty short. I wanted to see a bit more from the psychic and perhaps a séance. It's not like they could have made it more interesting by making it longer, they pretty much put in everything without pushing it.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good - which surprised me - as I thought with such a low budget the film would have had some cheap actors, but no, the acting was quite impressive. overall the film was pretty good, a decent flick and worth the money; I didn't find it scary and it didn't give me nightmares or keep me up all night with the light on, but maybe that was just me."

A lot of the ideas were recycled and frankly not scary at all, the ending was one of two obvious choices and the whole premise of the film is based on cheap tricks which are ground out at such a static pace that the film never really picks up any momentum.Where the film lacks in visual splendor it compensates in its audio work some of the sound used creates a real sense of tension and triggers of more powerful imagery in the viewers mind than what the filmmaker could throw up on screen. However a lot of the incidents in the night recordings featured in the film could have been merged together cutting a good 15 minutes of the film which would have lessened or even completely taken out the rather stale periods during its 86 minute run time, granted this would have made it a much shorter film but it would also make it much tighter.Overall a good principle idea ruined by pretty poor execution."

","Last week it seemed Paranormal Activity swept the nation, a relatively unknown horror movie from 2007 had earned itself a wide release into theaters (a rare occurrence). The hype began to appear everywhere, people hailing the film as one of the scariest horrors in a long time.<br/><br/>Let me begin by first praising the film for managing to be genuinely creepy and menacing at times, though it rarely, if at all crosses into scary. The psychological fear of what is in the dark is its greatest advantage over today's typical show-you-everything horror.<br/><br/>Now, we'll get into what the structural weaknesses of the film that, for me, were so glaring that no amount of dread could cover over them.<br/><br/>The entire premise is based on a young couple moving into a new home only to immediately begin experiencing strange things. Their on screen relationship makes them seem likable at first UNTIL they begin fighting at every opportunity over the dumbest things. Yes there are real relationships like this, where the couple bicker at every little incident, but the constant illogical nagging of the girlfriend and constant smarmy smug attitude of the boyfriend quickly make the characters hard to feel for. The dialogue is lame and the reactions of the characters highly suspect. For instance: If the ""activity"" is being caused by a ""demon"" than why don't they contact a priest? No instead they go the secular root attempting to contact a demonologist. Are we to believe that at no point in the film did they think to attempt the religious way of defeating this entity? Don't get me wrong, I've no affinity for the Church, but it seems logical that when you've got a ghost you've at least got to reach out to people for help.<br/><br/>Also, their decision to stay in the house long after things get WAY WAY out of hand simply on the belief that this thing will follow them. So why not go somewhere where there are a lot of people and sleep near a few dozen family members and friends so at the very least what you are experiencing can be verified or perhaps subdued by safety in numbers...<br/><br/>The story goes nowhere, no one develops or is dynamic (and none of the characters are likable).<br/><br/>The weakness of the characters and dialogue, along with a gimmicky hokey (nearly fourth wall breaking) and truly SILLY ending make this a weak horror film and likely only scary for the impressionable, superstitious, or easily frightened. Its not all bad but its certainly not good."
"the_rattlesnake25","7","0","0","30 October 2009"," Always wondered what goes bump in the night?
","Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity' isn't a brilliant film by any standards, nor is it groundbreaking, but considering it was made for only fifteen-thousand dollars and it has now grossed over thirty-five million dollars in the US before it has even been released worldwide definitely shows that it has appeal and the subject matter to tap into the general public's imagination – the issue of unseen paranormal activity that we have all apparently experienced at some time or another, but never been able to conclusively prove that it wasn't simply the ice-maker! While 'PA' also taps into the sub-conscious fear of that our homes are our fortresses, however in Peli's film, the home is anything, but a safe haven. Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are your typical young, suburban couple, however Katie believes that there is a paranormal presence praying on herself or the house in which she and her fiancée are staying, so Micah does what any young-buck would do in this technological age in which we live; we sets up a cheap video-camera in the bedroom and hopes to capture the ghoulish goings-on during the night – and it certainly isn't the dishwasher that's on the fritz! At around eighty-odd-minutes in length the film follows a simple three-part narrative structure. The first third of the film is focused around introducing Micah and Katie to the audience as they discuss what could be going bump in the night and their general lives, work, friends, etc. We also see the conflict in personalities from the beginning as well, as Micah is somewhat of a sceptic, he is always making fun of Katie and the presence which is clearly taking a toll on her life, while Katie outwardly accepts that there is some form of paranormal activity around her or her house and wishes to get rid, or banish it as soon as possible. From there on as each night passes, the second part of the structure focuses around Micah and the various small unexplained noises and movements that were captured on camera, slowly dispelling his scepticism and fuelling Katie's increasing paranoia, before the final third of the film completely puts to rest any scepticism Micah has and sends Katie into a detrimental spiral of fear and instability, concluding the film with a brilliantly terrifying bang! The use of Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat work perfectly, as the unknown, inexperienced actors that provide somewhat of a refreshing realistic quality to the low-budget flick. While the use of on and off-screen diegetic sound and movement, especially while the characters are sleeping, creates the perfect atmosphere for the unexplained goings-on in the suburban homestead. We can see everything that is happening, every small sound, or every slight movement, however while the audience can rest behind the protection of the movie screen, there is no such barrier for Katie and Micah which constantly raises and the suspense, tension and fear-factor throughout the film. Peli and his small crew, show how much you can simply evolve forth the narrative from such minimal and surprisingly fear-inducing events, such as slamming doors shut and banging loudly on various walls.<br/><br/>'Paranormal Activity' is one of those rare films that will still stay with you hours after you have already left the cinema. It sets up the bases – character development, captured unexplained activity, and the history of said such activity – before finally winding back the bat and knocking the audience of the park with a well-shot, emphatic and truly frightening ending."

","Before you continue, I would like to make it clear that I am a seasoned veteran of horror films and most of them don't affect me in the least anymore.<br/><br/>I'm sure you've heard all the comparisons to the Blair Witch Project but this movie takes the whole 'paranormal stalker' idea and brings it a little closer to home. Literally. Katie's the pretty college student, Micah is her slightly moronic boyfriend. And something is banging on their walls at night. They bring in a ghost expert, who tells them they have a demon, which has been messing with Katie on and off for years. He gives them a number to call for a demon expert and tells them not to provoke the angry entity. So what do they do? Not call the expert and Micah starts trying to screw with the demon. Things start getting worse. So he starts acting like more of an idiot. And by the time they finally get around to calling the master of demons, he's out of town and the ghost expert tells them he can't do a thing. The unseen demon makes it known that it isn't happy with Micah and despite deciding to leave the house (which won't help because Katie is what draws this thing), they stay one last night...<br/><br/>While the idea is very fresh when compared to recent horror films (mainly remakes), the scares aren't that bad for a horror veteran. A moving door, powdery footprints that appear out of nowhere, loud noises downstairs, etc. But to those who are desensitized to these simple scares, it becomes another horror movie. There are too many 'duh' moments where a logical person would say 'why are they doing this?' It really kills suspension of belief when someone does (or doesn't do) something so clearly stupid that you slap your forehead.<br/><br/>If you can maintain suspension of disbelief for the 100 minutes, it is decent. It gets points for being original compared to recent horror. But is it the 'scariest movie in the last 10 years'? Not unless you never see horror movies at all. It's good for a Halloween scare but the hype around it will soon fade when the sequel is officially announced."

A very pleasant side effect, he joked, was ending up with a ""dream home with a big TV"". In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and demonology, stating, ""We wanted to be as truthful as we could be.""

Don't get me wrong, we all loved the movie, but I texted one of them when I got home and she said that she could not fall asleep. I didn't either. I couldn't. I was so terrified.<br/><br/>This movie sticks with you for hours, possibly even days, after you see it. It leaves an imprint on your psyche that's very hard to get rid of. It's possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen, even scarier than Texas Chainsaw Massacre or High Tension.<br/><br/>I'm probably one of the few people that loved the ending, probably because it scared the hell out of me. But it's just so disturbing. How they shot this movie for $15,000 I'll never know, because the effects are so convincing and are just absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I'm seeing this movie again this weekend with more people that are dying to see it, so hopefully I won't get scared again... which I probably will.<br/><br/>See this movie. It will blow your mind, and shatter your senses, and fry your nerves. Guaranteed.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I never rate a movie 10/10 but this movie is the best in its genre. I have watched almost every horror Hollywood movie in the past 15 years,only a few actually did an effort to scare the audience,they play around with special effects and sound-effects.(You know when the camera is focusing something and a cat with a loud noise jumps at the camera.Pretty dumb..huh? they are supposed to scare us not test our reflexes) But this movie is a genuine piece of work. Its one of those unseen horror flicks like 'The Blair witch project'and pictured in the same manner. A sequential footage that scares the hell out of you. The best part is after watching the movie when you go to sleep in your bed.The movie is bound to haunt you for some time.<br/><br/>If you sleep alone, please do not watch this movie."

","I wasn't expecting a lot when I went in to see this movie. I thought it was going to be another cheap Blair Witch rip off. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this movie. The build was gradual but not too slow that you lose interest. The climax hits you out of nowhere! What an ending! I definitely recommend seeing this movie. While painful to watch in some places, it has a reality factor that I think is earth shattering. This movie was very well made. Not only was the scare factor nice, but the mixture of tension with humor/sarcasm was very smart.It makes you want to watch it again to see if you missed anything along the way--and you KNOW you want to see the ending again. I usually don't scare easy, but I definitely had trouble driving home after I saw this one."

","A young couple in their 20s--Katie (Katie Featherstone) and Micah (Micah Sloat)--have a poltergeist invading their home and targeting Katie. They want to get rid of it but this thing doesn't want to leave...<br/><br/>This film has been WAY over-hyped. The studio only showed it at midnight showings and the coming attractions supposedly showed an actual audience screaming and jumping at the movie. To make things worse they ""suggested"" that all these things happened--although the closing credits makes it clear that it's all fictional! ""The Blair Witch Project"" did this successfully 10 years ago but it's old hat now. I can see why they over-hyped this movie. It's hardly new or original and, aside from a few moments, you've seen this all before. The plot is also full of head-scratching moments. Supposedly Katie has been haunted by this poltergeist since she was 8--and she waits till she moves in with Micah to tell him about it? Why do the attacks intensify so suddenly? Katie is a student but she never seems to leave the house. Her mood swings come out of nowhere and serve no purpose to the plot. Also Micah is given almost zero character development. He does stupid things for no reason (the Ouija board) and just ends up saying ""f***"" all the time.<br/><br/>On the good side the movie does have it's spooky moments, Featherstone and Sloat are very good in their roles and the ending actually scared me (although I saw it coming). But, all in all, it's a good hour long movie stretched out to 90 minutes. Don't believe all the hype--it's not that good. I give it a 5."

","I was in the packed theater after driving more than my usual distance for a movie. The distribution was mystifyingly limited but I found a venue nevertheless. Psychologically, the movie is extremely intense and children should not be allowed. I was impressed with the use of deep, loud, low frequency sound in the soundtrack as a tool to reinforce a feeling of dread in the audience. Brillian and simple. Gasps and shrieks from the audience during the creepiest scenes. It instilled a tingling sensation in the spine. I just cannot explain it. If you like horror, go see this film. It will be copied. See it on a dark rainy night but don't go alone. Huge."

","This movie was very simply terrifying. I am not one for the horror genre myself but I tend to steer towards them now and again. I came across this trailer online and immediately I wanted to see it for the sheer tease that the trailer gives. I had to know what happened. This film centers on a couple that has had experiences with something in their home. All I really have to say is that this movie truly scared me. It has been less than 12 hours since I have seen it and I slept 2 hours and am still thinking about and freaked out by this film. It is amazing what this director did with a mere $11,000 budget and a weeks time that many multi-billion dollar directors can't do with their ridiculous budgets. Go see this film. Support the unknown directors and the up and coming actors, because their performance in this, Katie and Micah, is spectacular. My friends and I were all walking out of the theater asking ourselves if this movie is clipped from real footage. The characters are that relatable and cast a shadow that makes you think this is really happening. I honestly can't say enough. Throughout the entire summer, I have seen Wolverine, G.I. Joe, Transformers...but this film has to be the shocker of the year. Thank you to the filmmaker and cast of this really great film."

"Mudsharkbytes","10","3","8","27 September 2009"," A superlative example of how to do more with less.
","I found out about this movie before it even had a page on the IMDb, so I've been waiting a LONG time to see it.<br/><br/>I was afraid that after having anticipated it for so long I would be disappointed. That was not the case.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is one of those rare movies that stays with you long after it's ended because the storytelling is so deftly handled. Very simple elements, almost bordering on clichés, are used in a way I can only describe as virtuoso. The sound of footsteps proceeding and receding, seeing a light turn on & off down the hallway, the slight movement of a door in the context of the plot take on a significance way beyond what you would have thought possible. My fears that I would be underwhelmed were unfounded.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me was the amount of humor in the movie. The best scary movies have elements of humor in them to prevent them from being too grim to enjoy. The humor in Paranormal Activity not only served as a contrast to the intensity of the more frightening scenes, but also helped the audience to empathize with Katie and Micah, who were a likable couple, even though Micah was some what of a horses ass at times.<br/><br/>My only complaints are minor ones. There was a low hum - almost like a contra-bass note, that clued you in something was about to happen - it was unnecessary and distracting. Also, it is well known that the ending is not the original and involves a little CGI. Even though I liked the ending and found it especially disturbing, the fact that the effects went beyond the reality of the entire movie to that point took the movie out of character a little and made it less believable. I certainly hope the DVD release contains the other endings as bonuses (I have heard there are three different endings).<br/><br/>To be honest the closest any other movie has ever come to getting under my skin and gnawing at me after it was over was REC (not the useless and unnecessary 'Quarantined' remake). While REC was more like a roller coaster ride, Paranormal Activity is more like an intense nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of scary movies, and Paranormal Activity is right up there with the best of them, if not on top, certainly within spittin' distance."
"baumer","10","3","9","20 October 2009"," A film that leaves you exhausted, drained and scared of strange noises
","For a film that has been around since 2007, been searching for a distributor, made with a budget that wouldn't even cover the cost of cigars smoked by Jack Nicholson on a major film, was blown up from WOM by REGULAR PEOPLE, stars nobody and made by nobody, it doesn't get much better than this. This is a celebration of horror that I grew up with. This had just as much effect on me as some of the classics that I hold so dear.<br/><br/>I think this is what horror is all about. If you watch Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and some of the other greats, it is very similar to this film. There is very little blood, very little violence. It is all imagined. You never do see the girl go through the meat hook in TCM. You never really see Myers do anything incredibly overt to many people in Halloween. But you see shadows, you hear breathing, you see a flicker of a candle, you hear a dog bark, you see a giant man in face of skin and you see the surroundings he lives in. Blair Witch Project did the same thing. The mind can mess with you and Paranormal Activity epitomizes that. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is the story about a somewhat cocky man named Micah and his live in girlfriend Katie. Katie, in her own words, has been somewhat haunted her entire life by some kind of malevolent spirit. The couple decides to videotape themselves while the sleep to see if they can find out what it is that goes bump in the night. Micah doesn't really believe in demons or ghosts or spirits, and he is more interested in playing with a ouija board and getting some ""cool"" things on tape. What he is in for is ultimately something he never could have foreseen.<br/><br/>The couple invites a psychic over to the house to see if he can pick up any negative energy or provide them with any answers. In the best part of the first half hour of the film, the psychic tells them that demons are not to be messed with and that he can feel a presence in the house. Soon after he leaves, the real trouble starts.<br/><br/>Once they begin recording the strange activities while the sleep, loud, invasive noises seem to be an every evening occurrence. And then soon there after, Katie begins to feel the presence of the demon. The middle of the film is a frightening and chilling experience, the last ten minutes will have you cowering with fear.<br/><br/>I personally can't stand films like 1999's The Haunting, or any of the other myriad of inferior pg-13 horror films that have been made ever since the recrudescence of horror with Scream. Film makers started to realize again that there is a huge market for horror and if you do it right (low budget, moderate scares) you can make a profit. But if you do it wrong (big budget, buckets of special effects and potty mouthed unlikable characters who all grew up in a module) it becomes one of the terrible films of your life.<br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a stroke of genius because it doesn't have the budget to show you a demon, not in the demonic literal sense. But it does have the brilliance to use what it has to its advantage. We're all afraid of what goes bump in the night. We're all afraid of what we don't know and can't understand. And we're all afraid of the worlds that are mysteries to us. By using possession, demonology and lots of bumps in the night, this film has managed to scare the yoyos out of many, many people. I don't agree that this film has 10 minutes of tension or 10 minutes of scares. I'll agree that the last 10 minutes of the film is some of the scariest scenes ever filmed, but the buildup to the ending is just as well done. I guess some people (and there's nothing wrong with this, just different things that scare different people) aren't bothered by what the mind does to you. some people need more of a visual stimulus. It's kind of like phone sex. Sometimes all you need is words and a vivid imagination and it's almost as good as the real thing.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity has stayed with me long after I have left the theatre. This film has proved to me and other horror lovers and non horror lovers that you can make a scary film. I love the movie, love everything about it. Horror has blessed me with another surreal experience and for that I am grateful.<br/><br/>10/10"
"PureedMonkeyBrains","7","3","9","10 October 2009"," YES it is scary!
","I was ready to be disappointed. I came in expecting this to be awful like ""Blair Witch"". Well, guess what? The film works. About the only criticism I have is that yes, he does bring the camera along everywhere to an absurd degree, but when the screen goes blue (when they are sleeping) it is incredibly chilling.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the accompanying low-range, ""rumble"" of ambient horror sound really freaks you out. The actors did a good job of appearing ""real"", especially Katie.<br/><br/>As far as the ending goes, yes it will shock you...however, the final shot felt a bit clichéd. I would have changed it just a little to make it even scarier.<br/><br/>Some people complain about the mundane stuff. But what they don't understand is that that is necessary to make the couple and their experience feel more real."
"slobhero","7","3","9","26 September 2009"," Better than your average horror film
","Honestly, Paranormal Activity is funnier than it is frightening, which works well to relieve tension, and to keep the film interesting during the scenes that aren't meant to scare the audience. The scares it does deliver, however, are mostly genuine; you aren't going to be forced to leap from your seat because of some cheap jump cut spliced together with a loud noise. The parts meant to disturb you are due to the film's images, not its editing techniques.<br/><br/>But all in all, it's not really going to be that frightening unless you're one of those people who goes into the theater knowing that you're going to be terrified for the rest of the night. Those of you who dare the film to scare you will grunt and shrug: ""That wasn't scary, bro. I'm from Detroit."" You know who you are.<br/><br/>You're not going to scream and pee your pants, but Paranormal Activity is still worth your time. It's engaging and suspenseful and definitely worth sticking around for the big finish at the end."
"jboothmillard","8","2","5","28 March 2010"," Paranormal Activity
","Quite a few people had told me that this was a film I had to see, and naturally knowing it was like the style of The Blair Witch Project, I wasn't going to ignore them. Basically it is presented like another found footage film, with young girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) and boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat), who have been together for three years, filming themselves and their experiences. They have had strange things happen to them, sounds and movements in the house, especially as they try to sleep, and Katie claims to have been haunted since she was eight years old. So Micah sets a video camera to film them and this paranormal activity, and they get a little advice from The Psychic (Mark Fredrichs) about what this entity may want. Over the next few nights, the camera catches every sound and movement as they sleep, including a door opening and closing again, Katie getting out of bed and standing for hours, the sheets being blown by a wind and no windows open, and loud bangs. It obvious this spirit, or demon, is getting increasingly threatening night by night, and it is apparently after Katie, which causes friction between her and Micah. When there is a night where Katie is dragged by legs through the bedroom door, they consider going to a hotel for a night until the demon is gone, and The Psychic visits again, but they have to face this situation alone. The final and most terrifying scene sees Katie get out of bed and stand for hours again, before going downstairs and screaming, and Micah runs down. Seconds later some loud footsteps are heard, and Micah is unexpectedly thrown at and knocking over the camera, and Katie walks into view, covered in blood, and she kneels down to smile and roar at us, Micah's body was found, but Katie's disappeared. Also starring Amber Armstrong as neighbour Amber and Ashley Palmer as Diane - Girl on Internet. The performances by the two unknowns are very well done, there are very few special effects and no music, making it all the more realistic, and with simple things like loud noises and images to freak you out there is plenty of tension, a brilliant supernatural horror. Very good!"
"annrie_1","8","2","5","28 December 2009"," Brilliant blows Blair Witch out of the water
","Well what can i say about this film except OH MY GOD!!!! it was a casual Sunday afternoon when i saw the trailer for this film and immediately i was gripped by it, i have search for ages to find a horror film that will actually scare me to the point where i think twice about before i go to sleep. but this film ticked every one of my horror boxes. at first i thought it was going to go the way of Blair witch and basically be a lot of talk and no action but i was quickly mistaken. i love the actors who play the leading couple they just convince the audience that they are a really couple and all these events are really happening. the high light of this film for me has to be the bit where the demon basically drags Katie from the bed and down the hall, and this is the part that has stuck with me, the way she screams as she get dragged down the hall made shiver all over. I mean who wouldn't freak out if these events were happening to you. The films is slow in places but this just adds to the anticipation of the film, the slow bits are the bit you have to watch as this explains why these events are happening. I have also seen the alternative ending of this film and i think this is the ending which they should of kept, basically it show Katie standing over mika and then goes downstairs as she does in the original all of the sudden you hear the scream and mika running downstairs to find her, all of a sudden there is nothing and sudden you hear heavy foot steps coming up the stairs and suddenly the lifeless body of mika is thrown into the camera followed by a possessed Katie crouching over his body. sudden she looks into the camera and her face turns into a demon and bites the camera. well this is much better than the ending they have with her basically getting shot by gun happy cops!!!<br/><br/>So well done to this and i hear they have already lined up for a sequel so please invite me to the premiere so i can be the first to see it"

","Paranormal Activity is definitely one of the creepiest movies I have seen in a while. I watched it alone at night-big mistake! I took a nap on the couch afterward and when I woke up, I was sure that I was hearing movement in my kitchen. It got me that bad. If you're looking for blood and guts, or overdone special effects, don't see this one. It's more of a psychological horror. The only reason that I didn't give it 9 stars was because sometimes Micah's personality didn't stay consistent. While he seemed like a smart and nice enough guy at the beginning of the film, his reactions during some scenes led me to believe that he was a stupid jerk. Don't get me wrong; I thought the acting was excellent throughout the film and would blame the writing more than the acting for these inconsistencies. I thought that Katie being played by a ""real"" looking girl added to the reality of the movie also. Overall, a great movie that you shouldn't miss."

"dancrjen8","9","2","5","24 October 2009"," Why I thought it was brilliant.
","I saw this in Austin Texas during a private screening when it was ""in demand"" right when the hype started. After it was over I found myself unsure of what to think. I am huge horror buff and have seen it all it seems and am always looking for something different. There were 2 characters really unless you count the demon. There was one setting. There wasn't much blood, no gore, and limited special effects yet it effectively gave a ton of people the creeps.So when it was over on the long drive home I wondered why?! During the movie I jumped a little and said ""what the f*%$"" a couple of times, but I wasn't scared and didn't feel like I would have trouble sleeping. So on my way home I thought about it and suddenly was actually scared of going home. All I could think about is how the scariest parts of the movie occurred while they slept in the comfort and safety of their own home. We are the most vulnerable when we sleep and who really knows what is going on around us during that time. When I got into bed I couldn't help but imagine something crawling in under the covers with me or pulling my leg out from under the covers dragging me down the hall. See with most horror movies I love them because I can't relate to them. They take me out of my reality. For example...The Hills Have Eyes, I can't relate to being stuck in the dessert being hunted by deformed creatures. However we have all had strange things happen to us in our life that we can't really explain and we can all relate to sleeping in a bed. So I could actually put myself in that situation and my imagination went wild...hence I was scared and I got it. At the end I was a little let down because I didn't want it to end. I wanted more! However the only outcomes really were exorcism, death, or disappearance. An exorcism has been done and we got the other two so there you go. I am a fan but I can understand the skepticism. I highly recommend seeing it and forming your own opinion."

The acting was as bad as a bad porno (literally). Keanu Reeves is one of my favoriate actors, so that just proves how I'm not someone who bases my love of movies on the perfection of acting. None of the character decisions made sense at all.

Bottom line is.. if basements, attics and graveyards scare you then I would have to assume that this movie will as well. Even during the films first act when the Paranormal expert is invited in for his opinion.. it is hard not to snicker at the typical way in which he reels in these kids that obviously are of the sort that will buy into the whole ghost thingie... If I were to tell a stranger that I saw something unexplainable when I was 5 years old (or eight) I'd expect a response like.. ""Well you were 5.. Kids see sh*t""."

","I heard this movie was supposed to be scary. The scariest movie EVER, in fact. It was not scary at all. All the boring stuff with the psychic in the first 10 minutes made me want to fall asleep. I figured that the garbage at the beginning was going to lead to into a scary movie, perhaps it was limp just to throw me off guard. False. This movie's genre should really be a dark comedy because of how funny some of the dialogue was, also the thought that I was ever supposed to be scared of anything happening. After seeing this movie I am also going to re-evaluate my use of the f-bomb, because this movie made it into the new fiddlesticks. This movie was made for idiots. *Now for the SPOILER!* I'm glad they both died in the end."

","I'm a huge fan of the suspense/mystery/thriller/horror genres. I am also a big fan of independent films. ""Paranormal Activity"" appeared to fit perfectly to my taste so I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>After what seemed like an endless (digital) reel of previews, the movie started without warning. The movie wants the viewer to think it's real home footage. The cast is small. The setting is simple and the effects are not over the top. This, my friends, is a recipe for a potential masterpiece! Pull me in ""Paranormal Activity"".....I'm ready!<br/><br/>.....but it failed to produce. The movie did not feel real to me. The acting was fair at best. The reactions of the two main characters during and after a paranormal event were not believable, especially as the movie progressed. The majority of the movie was absolutely boring. I will say that Micah Sloat had a few funny things to say, and the climax, albeit short, was very good.<br/><br/>4/10"
"ElijahCSkuggs","8","2","5","19 October 2009"," I would've been on Montel in a heart-beat!
","I'm just gonna keep this simple. The flick revolves around a couple who are suffering from some....paranormal activity. And obviously, the....paranormal activity keeps getting worse and worse. The flick overall is a pretty gripping experience. You're constantly wondering what type of scary dealy is gonna go down next, and that mixed with the setting of a night-time bedroom being the main area where the haunts are going down, it makes the horror that much more intense. Unfortunately the flick suffered a wee bit from stupid-ass decision making, and an arguably weak ending. Honestly, with the decision making, I would have been screaming bloody murder from the roof-tops if even a tenth of what was happening to them was happening to me. I'd be on Oprah, Jenny Jones, Donahue...all the talk-shows in a heart-beat. And with the ending, I was seriously hoping for something truly horrific to be shown, but instead it's played in a not-surprising type way. Also due to how the movie plays out and concludes, the film doesn't have very high replay value either. But it's without a doubt a recommendable film that succeeds in building tension like few others."
"Solbaid009","8","2","5","18 October 2009"," Great movie, just not for this generation.
","Truly a great movie. I'm 15, and everyone I know that saw this thought it was lame and wasn't scary at all, except for the ending of course. But this generation of people have grown up with lame slashers, ridiculous gore movies, and other jump out and scare you movies that really don't leave an impact. <br/><br/>Lets face it, unless its a killer clown that eats people with excessive gore and jumps out at you every 5 seconds, there isn't much that scares this generation of people. We are hard to scare now, I blame it on stupid 'horror movies' that are supposed to scare you for life. Paranormaly Activity uses old styles of scary movies, styles that will impact you for literally years to come. But thats whats NOT scary about this movie, is that it uses 'old styles.' While it definitely left an impact on me, as I hesitate to find out whats scratching at my door or whats the knock on my wall (kitty at the door, painting hitting the wall from the fan's air), the movie itself just didn't deliver as much as it was hyped up to. Because it didn't jump out at you or throw blood all over you, it wasn't scary. This generation has lost what scary is. To me, movies like Alien and The Shining are scary and impact you, they use suspense and the fear of not knowing. Paranormal Activity does the same thing and it would have been the scariest movie 25 years ago, but unfortunately, it was made now.<br/><br/>Don't go to this movie and expect to be crying due to how scary its supposed to be. But don't overlook it. If your into older style scary movies, this is a great movie. 8/10 because it just didn't deliver. Darn my high expectations. Kitty, stop scratching the door please."

","I am a huge fan of horror movies, I love them. When I first heard of Paranormal Activity I was excited to see it, then I began to read the reviews and the hype about how terrifying of a movie it was and I was overwhelmed; I was dying to see it. I had that chance Friday night and I came out disappointed. The first 20 or so minutes of the movie is very dull, it then slowly begins to pick up and continues to pick up until the end of the movie. I disagree in that this movie is the scariest movie since the Exorcist or the scariest movie of all times. It was a mediocre movie at best, I definitely did not find it to be terrifying and left disappointed after reading so much hype about the movie.<br/><br/>A friend I was with, also a huge horror movie fan, actually drifted off to sleep a couple of times during the movie. It definitely wasn't worth the $10 I paid for the tickets."

","This film is really slow and the pace crawls along. The acting is nothing special and laughable at times. The film really builds a sense of tension and then just leaves you hanging when it has the opportunity to throw in a good scare. Most of the paranormal activity that takes place is just loud noises heard from the other room, there really are no sight gags. For the low budget it had it was shot pretty good, the camera was not too shaky and the editing was not bad. But overall this film suffered from its over hyped reviews, showing people exiting the theater and jumping from their chairs. I only heard two reactions from two people in the whole audience. There are so many other good horror movies that have come out this year that should have been released in the theaters than this crap."

A good approach with only a $15K budget? Definitely. The marketing on this movie is on par with how the Blair Witch Project was delivered back in 1998-1999. Hell, they got my money! And the comments about the trailers ruining the movie were absolutely true. The trailer is basically the movie, in a nutshell, save for long drawn out daytime ""shaky camera"" discussions between the protagonists.<br/><br/>Save yourself 10 bucks, and watch the trailer over and over again until you've reached 88 minutes."

Even my GF got queasy, and that's never happened to her before. If you are susceptible to dizziness, vertigo and/or motion sickness, do yourself a favor and skip this one. Ghost Hunters is better and they don't shake the damn camera all over the place."
"fx_man","4","2","5","16 October 2009"," Over-hyped and underwhelming
","Just like the Blair Witch Project, this film has been turned into a ""phenomenon"" by savvy marketing folks who know a goose that lays golden eggs when they see one. I am sure that half-drunk college students in a dark, crowded theatre may possibly be freaked out by some of what happens in Paranormal Activity. Hell, after someone's had a few pints and maybe a joint or two, getting in his/her face yelling ""boo!"" would achieve the desired effect.<br/><br/>However, any sober person trying to convince me that there is anything remotely frightening, clever, or original about this movie is most definitely one of said savvy marketing folks. If you can suspend your disbelief about when and under what circumstances a halfway intelligent person would walk around his house lugging a somewhat bulky camcorder, refusing to relinquish it and put it down no matter how dire the situation and how badly his significant other needs help, then you might be able to sit through this cavalcade of boredom. Otherwise, you'll constantly be thinking to yourself how anyone could be this dumb and unaware.<br/><br/>Successful fright fests tap deep into one's psyche. The problem with Paranormal Activity is that while it's attempting to do just that, it is simply not well executed. The conceit of the ""home footage"" doesn't work because the protagonists do things that ordinary people just wouldn't do. If the idea is that this is found footage of a couple who were taping some weird events at their house, then you need to write a screenplay in which the couple behaves in a believable manner, one that audience members can identify with. I shudder at the thought of thinking that audience members would identify with the couple in the film.<br/><br/>The wholly unrealistic reactions of the actors in what is supposed to be a hyper-realistic setting immediately neutralises the documentary feel, which is central to the film, and yanks the audience (well, at least this writer) out of the movie. After witnessing the implausible behaviour of the leads in the face of what they were experiencing, boredom began to set in. I was no longer watching ""found footage"", I was watching a contrived and amateurish movie.<br/><br/>I can understand how the movie has become popular at colleges, considering the state of mind required of one to remotely enjoy this movie. But there are many other such communal experiences that don't work outside the very specific milieu in which they find success. Consequently, as a film that stands on its own, Paranormal Activity is inconsequential and flaccid. It doesn't frighten and only occasionally holds one's interest.<br/><br/>I was disappointed because I wanted to have a good time, and I believed the hype. At least it was a matinÃ©e."

","Okay so like everyone else I saw the less than appealing trailers on TV. My GF thought it was going to be a good movie but I had my own thoughts. Needless to say I was not at all disappointed with the movie at all. It seems like the movie is much longer than the 1.5 hr. This was not filmed like the Blair Witch project!! Yes there is some shaking (seems like a lower budget film) but you are not going to get sick from all of the shaking and have to leave the theater.

"IRateFilms","7","2","5","8 October 2009"," The beast unveiled.
","It's almost always a pleasant experience when I sit down at a screening, and know absolutely nothing about the movie I'm about to watch. So, walking into the screening of Paranormal Activity was a total treat, seeing that I had absolutely zero knowledge about the movie. As the movie began I was a little disappointed thinking I was watching Quarantine, or the early parts of Cloverfield. For some reason every hand-held, no budget, cheap thrills movie has to spend loads and loads of time developing the characters and establishing the fact that you're going to be on a very ""bumpy"" ride for the duration. We meet Micah and Katie in the first shot of movie, as Micah explains why he bought the camera, for the purpose of catching something ""paranormal"" on it. Katie has been seeing and feeling something out of ordinary since she was a little girl, and it seems to have followed her to their new house. Micah spends most of the homemade movie ridiculing her notions of being ""haunted"", and just laughs off most of her claims until something is caught on his camera overnight. I'm sure the producers would like a critics to keep the plot and surprises in this film to a minimum, so I will be short with the plot. Basically, a lot of nothing happens right up until the last 5 minutes of the movie. This is a good exercise in storytelling, proving that we must about the protagonists, before we can start to care about them. The cheap tricks and thrills that we get at the end (startling the entire movie theater as they shrieked and screamed) would have had completely different effects on everyone had the movie been way shorter. That was the only criticism I could give this movie, its length. Many impatient viewers will become tired of the daily, diary like style Paranormal Activity plays in, but the juice is certainly worth the squeeze in this case."

","Words can't really do this movie justice. It needs to be seen, period. I've never experienced such an intense crowd reaction to a film...this is just raw, primal fear - no CGI (except for the damn ending), no overt violence - it's just genius filmaking.<br/><br/>Except for that damn ending I keep mentioning. And by ending I'm talking the last 20 or 30 very crucial seconds. The ending all of us Midnighters are experiencing is NOT the same ending that played in the festivals, it's also not the same ending that so infamously spooked Steven Spielberg in his California home..and by all accounts this new ending is much much weaker. I've read a description of how the original wraps itself up and by comparison it really seems to be much more disturbing, emotionally devastating, evil - while at the same time remaining much more realistic and logical. Who was behind this decision I wonder? Do they think we can't handle it? It's still an excellent horror movie, but its overall long-term impact on the individual human psyche has been diluted with this silly, schlocky new ending...IMO"

","Saw this Friday night in a sold out theater and have to say the fear effect that this film produces is truly astounding. As someone who loves horror but has not found anything in the genre scary since Blair Witch (before it became a phenomenon), I have not been able to stop thinking about several scenes in this movie and just how effectively scary the overall film was. I have to dock 2 points because the film was overlong by about 15 minutes and could have greatly benefited from some editing in the first half of the production.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you were frightened by Blair Witch (this movie is truly a spiritual successor)and don't need violence and gore or cgi to keep you interested check this film out.

","Okay let me ask you all a question, for the people who were really scared and freaked out, why were did you feel that way? Are you really going to let the devil fool you into believing he can actually come to you in your sleep and hurt you? Believe me, he cannot. Jesus said, greater is he that it in me than he that is in the world. There is no pain, hurt or sorrow he cannot feel. People you must all believe that God loves you and is there for you even when you believe nobody is around. All the devil wants to do is KILL, LIE AND DESTROY!! All you have to do when you feel scared or stressed is call on the lord and ask him to rebuke thee. Ask him to give you strength because you are greater than some sorry ASS demon who has no authority or power over you!!!

I have never seen a movie with more suspense and pop up scenes in my life. The suspense was so realistic and so were the characters that provided it. I can't think of a more suspenseful ""scary as hell movie"" than ""Paranormal Activity"" because there is not. It may have been over-hyped to some but it a movie can draw you in so close that you can hear the characters heart beats and yours, I say see it.

This haunting is particular, in that it is not a house that is being haunted, but the girl herself. Apparently, the ghost ""wants her.""<br/><br/>Nothing happens in this ridiculous movie except for a few doors closing and lights turning on and off. Meanwhile, we are subjected to the lowest common denominator of American public school products, namely these two buffoons. Their main mode of communication consists of pithy catchphrases like, ""Get over it!"" and ""Whatever!"" When they're serious about something, they'll insert some more profanity to make it clear they mean business now. When the ghost starts acting up a bit too much by knocking on doors, the dunce that is the boyfriend has had it. ""I'm taking care of this right EFFEN now!"" he bellows, and the peasants shudder. At one point he actually grunts in frustration. An actual grunt! It's amazing to think human language has been developing for thousands of years, only to see these two twits condense down to ""ughghhggh.""<br/><br/>One interesting thing, though, is that the boyfriend and the ghost seem to both share an affinity for fat-legged war pigs with rapidly disappearing jaw lines. Who casted this woman? Who wants to stare at her walking around in a baggy t-shirt and men's boxers for an hour and a half?

When a film can get inside your imagination there are no limits or boundaries to how much that film can terrify you.<br/><br/>The cinematographer deserves applause also as the lighting in this film creates a lot of suspense and sets the audience up for many frightening stingers.<br/><br/>This is what Drag Me To Hell could have been and what Blair Witch should have been.

"whathappenedtojake","10","2","6","31 December 2009"," One of the Most Effective Horror Movies Ever Made
","I first heard about Paranormal Activity on YouTube when I saw the trailer for it and I was quickly drawn to the idea of another ""Blair Witch Project"" film. There has been many mixed reviews for The Blair Witch Project and so does this movie. But I am a true fan of both. I did think Paranormal cannot live up to the hype and it certainly will not be better than Blair Witch. But I did want this movie to do well and I could not wait to see it. Since I wanted to be scared as much as possible with out hearing immature teenagers laughing and disrupting the theater, I decided to take the challenge and watch it at my house. I downloaded the movie and connected it to my TV and watched it alone on the couch with popcorn and lots of pillows. There has been a lot of complaining about how boring and slow this movie is. But in my opinion the movie moved very quickly in a fast pace. On Night #1 from the beginning, something happens. We hear footsteps and the door creaking. I don't understand why and how that is not scary. Hearing footsteps in your house when everyone is sleeping? Wouldn't you wonder who or what that can be? From the beginning, it caught my eye. I looked around my living room feeling slightly uneasy. Someone also said we are forced to watch the couple sleep, making the audience bored. What kind of a stupid argument is that? The director clearly does not want you to focus on the couple, but focus on the thing that attacks the couple. Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston were a great couple and they made the acting very very believable. From the beginning they grab you by the arms and never let go until the end of the movie. But it doesn't stop there. Near the end of the movie when Katie is tired of Micah's behavior as her boyfriend she feels detached by him and goes to sleep. But soon she is woken by the demon pulling her and dragging her across the floor. She quickly gives full trust to Micah and screams for her life. I have to admit, I screamed with her like a little girl. I just could not believe what I was seeing. This film makes you think what just happened,but it doesn't give away what will happen next. The absence of music was very effective as a horror movie. The silence and quietness adds to the suspense. Watch this film with your friends and family at your house. You all will not be able to go to sleep for few days. I dare you."

With Paranormal Activity, anyone that's a fan of (or at least liked) The Blair Witch Project will probably like this. I found it to be an engrossing picture, but it isn't without mild flaws. The pace is off, and the scares are redundant. It has a great, albeit familiar, premise and the execution is very good. The performances are well done, I didn't hate or love the characters, but I did care for them (and I didn't find Micah annoying at all). Oren Peli does a great job a setting the atmosphere of the film, and anyone that likes ""fear of the unknown"" suspense, then Paranormal Acitivity is a worthwhile adventure. I can see this film as one I'd pop into the DVD player to scare my children in future years."

The Ouija board spelled some girl's name, all on its own, right before it lit on fire... ""Awesome, let's stay another night!"" Oh, I can't forget, let's also completely abandon this subplot five minutes later and NEVER bring it up again.<br/><br/>In the same way that many horror movies could have easily ended early with a 9mm, this couple could have left, or at least shut their door. Yet, the audience is under some vague impression that leaving won't help. Idea: Drive to a church, temple, psychic, exorcist – do something! One hour into the movie, the audience sees a few door slams. Really scary! At this point and up until the end, this couple is still sleeping with the door open. Why not close the door? Done, End of movie! There were a few creepy scenes that involved the main character, who was so memorable I can't recall her name, standing there for hours. Yep, she just stood there. It's just as lame as it sounds. Creepy, but lame. The humor was decent though. My favorite line: ""Fine, go upstairs and hang out with your friend."" Lame, don't waste your money."

Hmmm...still thinking? Because it is BORING! In Poltergeist at least they had people coming and going and they went outside. So consider yourself warned. Just so you know, right when the ouija board caught on fire is where it jumped the shark, and you will be thinking as you leave the theater, damn! Mitzi was right!

EVERYONE at the theater was laughing at this movie, IT WAS THE WORST HORROR FILM I'VE EVER SEEN. This movie made Quarantine look like a masterpiece. At the end of the movie (which sucked) I literally thought the whole movie was a joke, I thought the employees at the IMAX would give me and my friends refunds for this joke of a film, but they never did. RIGHT when i got out of my seat, I went outside and told everyone, ""DONT WATCH PARANORMAL ACTIVITY!!!"" ALL my friends were shocked that they saw such a terrible film. Not even close to a B-Class movie. Not even worthy of being at the 1$ movie theater."

","Was this a joke that I didn't get? Don't get me wrong I like watching paranormal TV shows but wow. This movie was HORRIBLE from start to finish. If anyone walked out on this movie it was because of how bad it was not because they where actually scared. The full movie was so slow with a few bumps to make you jump a little. If you like watching movies that have gotten a lot of hype but turn out to be pretty horribly bad then you will enjoy this *cough Blair witch, Clover-field, ground hog day cough* you get my drift. Maybe I have seen to much ""scary"" movies or its due to today's media but this truly did not scare me. <br/><br/>All I have to say is ""Save money and stay at home and watch T.A.P.S, Ghost Adventures, or Paranormal State."""

","This movie is very bad... don't get me wrong if it was real footage it would be cool but its not.The actors are lame from the start of this long drawn out low budget waste of time.It takes about a hour before anything even happens in the house So they open and close a few doors, light a witch board on fire and hear some foot steps.They throw in some strange voices and the kill off both of the actors. Its pretty much two hours of boredom not scary or even remotely creepy save your money wait for this one to be on HBO.I love a good horror movie and the is not one of them I will never watch this again.Also I have set out to tell people how bad this movie is, this one is pretty much like Blair witch minus originality."

","im a real hardcore horror fan, There hasn't been a movie that made me get all paranoid except when i had seen the exorcist, but i slept with that movie. it had its frightining moments,but this is something that leaves you shocked,and not shore if your safe in your own home or not, this doesn't scare you after half an hour of watching the movie, this makes you think at first,come on is this the scariest movie that lots of people keep on talking about? this is boring,but give it time.This movie is deep,realistic,the acting was like as natural as can be,and what they do here is what a real horror movie should have the power to do, it is not exaggerated but leaves a real hard impact,there are some parts in this movie that after you've finished watching it,you regret it like i did, i wanted to watch it alone in the dark at around 1 AM.to test myself,knowing that I've heard about similair events that happened in real life . It is so well done, in a dark room with noises,banging ,a camera is always switched on a door moving back and forth a woman being dragged out of bed in a really weird style like a strong evil power of Satan pulled her and ran with her into another room, and closed the door.knowing that the demon is present every night beside you in the dark,footsteps right next to your bed,moving objects,whispers and to make it really terrifyingly you find a burnt picture of yourself in the attic when you where younger in a different location in a different house, and discover it in the house you are living in presently which makes you only think that this force has been following you for such a long time and is always getting worse and more angry ,that is when horror is genuine.and she phones here dad to see weather that picture still existed if i remember correctly and he tells here no. while they are sleeping,always with the camera on,there was a part where the sheets would rise up like a wave as if the demon entered inside the bed with them.NOW THAT IS SCARY.After all that here boyfriend makes some research on his laptop and finds out that a woman had the same problems, and they play the video to see what happened to this other woman,only to find out that she got possessed turned really ugly like a demon and was strapped to a bed for exorcism and bit off here own arm,this footage is not for the faint of heart, and makes it even more scarier, because it is actually giving out another message that things are most likely to get worse. and guess what, they do. even if you are not a religious person and don't believe in these things,i think that this movie will shake you up, and to sleep after this, I Don't THINK SO. unless you watch a couple of comedies after, but that didn't work for me either, in fact i got so paranoid i stayed awake till the morning, i was dead tired and didn't want to put off the lights,i didn't want to touch the sheets,and i couldn't even stop thinking about what i had seen. AND THE WORST PART IS THAT I WAS EXPECTING A NOISE."
"chrisinaltoona","7","2","6","21 October 2009"," One Of The Worst Horror Movies Ever, Or So I Thought.
","Theater Review: Can someone yell conspiracy? I've read so many reviews on here and other sites that praise this film for being ""the most scary film ever!"" In my opinion and many others, this is just not true. The almost 8 star rating on here is very suspect, one can almost assume many of the good ratings and reviews could be linked back to the filmmaker or to people who haven't seen the movie, or to people who have no idea what a scary film is. The current 7.9 rating, which for any horror film that has over 1,000 ratings would be remarkable, is fraudulent in my opinion. I understand people's taste in films differs, but the horror genre fans tend to mostly agree with each other when a great horror film presents itself to us, and this is simply NOT a great horror film, nor is it even near great. I cannot prove fraud here, but I can sure smell it. I remember how disappointed I was with Blair Witch, the film had some scary parts, but for all the hype it got, just like Paranormal Activity has received, it was a true fail at horror. The majority of the episodes on the Discovery TV show ""A Haunting"" is scary than this film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This film is over-hyped, over-rated and not a bit scary. I only gave it a 2 for the filmmakers attempt at showing the big studios the small guy can make a better horror film with only a fraction of the budget, the attempt failed miserably.<br/><br/>Home review/New Conclusion: My above review that came with an original rating of 2 was based on my experience of seeing this movie in a packed, uncomfortable and ridiculously loud theater after more than a few drinks, and of course we had the occasional warning before a scary scene from some dummy who had seen the film the night before. One of the worst theater experiences ever. The very next night I was lucky enough, although, one day too late, to possess a legal high-quality DVD screener of this film. I watched this film sober in my home, in the dark, alone. The first 20 minutes of course are a snooze-fest but I forced myself to get into it and by the 30 minute mark I was enjoying it without effort and appreciating the long first 20 minutes a little more. The pace of the movie is perfect, more and more activity progresses with each night and the video evidence gets stronger and much more frightening. There is a scene where the entity makes itself very known mid-way on that made me almost jump out of my seat even though I had just seen this the night before. I do have a problem with one of the scenes that's not the couple, but something they're watching, it's so unrealistic it almost ruins the pace and feel of the movie for me. Soon after though the movie picks right back up and begins to become absolutely frightening, the point where the entity becomes physically present is one of the scariest parts in the entire movie. This did have the Blair Witch feel no doubt, the choices the couple makes gave me that frustrating feeling I had when the girl and two guys in Blair Witch turned into idiots and just yelled, cried and lallygagged their way around the forest they were trying to get out of, but under the circumstances of the categorization of this entity, I understand their actions but disagree with how the director interprets what a normal couple would do in that same situation. The ending is not something I could of predicted even though it lays itself out well before the film is over. HERE'S THE DEAL! If you love being goofy scared and having that packed theater feel then go see it, but if you truly want to be scared and enjoy this film to it's fullest potential, DO NOT watch this in the theater, watch the DVD at home, in the dark, alone. I will never watch another horror film in a theater again! I apologize to all for my original review and rating, the horrible theater experience along with my alcohol buzz totally ruined this film. I may just give up on theaters all together. I upped my rating from a 2 to a 7."
"madrigalshihtzu","2","2","6","21 October 2009"," Too much hype, not enough fear!
","As always, these days in horror films, the sizzle is far more potent than the steak and this film does not vary from that formula. Paranormal Activity is merely okay, its not particularly frightening nor is it particularly suspenseful. It is fairly formulaic in its approach to ""unknown entities"" inhabiting an otherwise typical suburban household and does not stray from that recipe. I'm a bit unnerved by the reviews which praise the acting in this movie as I found it quite amateurish and without any character. Just by calling someone ""Babe"" throughout the film does not constitute ""reality or realism"" to me. I will admit it had a few creepy moments, but they became repetitious after the first half of the film. The ending was completely disappointing and the characters' attempts to solve their ""paranormal activity"" were feeble and completely unbelievable. Young people like Katy and Micah do not live in a vacuum and I cannot believe they would not have spoken to friends and family and colleagues about what was going on and shown them what would be compelling films of ghostly or demonic presence. Such films would cause a media sensation in the ""real"" world and Katie and Micah would have been on Larry King or Oprah and have sold the ""rights"" to their story within minutes of seeing the first videos of their ""houseguest"". Just wait for this one to be on HBO or on DVD. The vintage 60's film ""The Haunting"" does a better job at this sort of thing with wonderful and professional acting to boot."

","Since it is genuine footage it is definitely interesting. You would think that. If you were six. I liked the scene where a screaming tattered old person with popped out eyeballs sits up in bed looking at the female lead just as she wakes up and sits up in the middle of the night and scares the character so badly their hair stands strait up and fire shoots out of the characters ears. No, wait, that was a dream I had last night, not this film. Oh well, this film was OK, but I coulda thought of more frightening scenes-like maybe an arm stretching and reaching across the room 20 feet in the dark half light-reaching for a smoke or something while the couple sits in bed freaking out like they had 999,000 volts running through them nonstop. Or something. Oops that was from another film. Run of the mill new school yank me crank me fiddlin'."

","I first saw the preview to this movie about a month ago, so I know that makes me a ""newbie"" when it comes to the title. After I saw the preview, I came on here and read all about it, read how it was the ""Scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'"". I read that Steven Spielberg couldn't finish it, but THEN read that he suggested a new ending.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I think the reason he couldn't finish it was out of sheer boredom.<br/><br/>If you go into this movie expecting horror all the way through, think again. The first half of the movie made me laugh more than ""Couple's Retreat"" did throughout the whole thing.<br/><br/>If you want to save yourself some time but still see the scariest parts, just go to the theater when there is about a half hour left. Because I will hand it to the director, there WERE a couple scenes that gave me shivers. And for that, alongside the surprising amount of comedy, I give 3 stars."

","Paranormal activity had me on the edge of my seat the entire movie, until the ending made me want to lay back in my seat, and wonder why I wasn't watching Where the wild things are, instead of this sorry excuse for one of the scariest movies of all time. Whoever agrees with the statement ""Scariest movie of all time"", should probably watch this movie again. The highest honor possible that I could give it was jumpy. It had few parts that actually were. Paranormal activity was a sorry, poorly made, low-budget, wanna-be, Blair witch project. It is made in the same documentary style of horror as the Blair witch project, and was a waste of my time, and nine dollars. Whatever you do, do not see this movie. It gave me more laughs, than it did chills. I give it a 3 out of ten. And I advise not to see it or you'll be disappointed."

","I don't care for the horror genre. It's never really appealed to me, the movies tend to use cheap scare tactics, and they're often riddled with clichés. Maybe it's why I usually enjoy comedy horror like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland; they're almost self-mocking, acknowledging what they are and spoofing the genre. <br/><br/>That's why I'm impressed by Paranormal Activity. It's a serious horror film, with a clear intent to frighten you, and it actually works. No clichés, no cheap scares, no excessive gore. Instead the film employs ambient crescendos that evoke dread and tension, minimal but effective effects, and realistic, sympathetic characters stuck in a hellish downward spiral. <br/><br/>The film was made for a meager $15,000, and it shows, but it might be better for it. Many have drawn a comparison between this and The Blair Witch Project, and while I haven't seen the latter, like its predecessor Paranormal Activity has at least turned out to be a major indie success story. And I'm glad, it deserves it. <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"zardoz-13","8","2","6","17 October 2009"," The 'Un-Horror' Movie That Scares Up Goosebumps Galore
","""Paranormal Activity"" ranks as a good horror chiller that leaves more than enough to your imagination to give you goosebumps galore. It is not one of those pverdone, CGI movies that sets out to scare the crap out of you with buckets of blood and gore backed up by state-of-the-art elaborate, mind-boggling special effects. Instead, this $15-thousand dollar budgeted, minor masterpiece works for its scary moments primarily with subtlety. Freshman writer & director Orel Peli takes his time, carefully develops the action, acquainting us with two very believable characters and makes them seem sympathetic to us. These are not phony, Hollywood idiot characters begging to be possessed. Furthermore, Peli had the good sense to narrow the focus of the picture down to the two foremost characters and not burden us with distractions. In other words, virtually all the action in ""Paranormal Activity"" occurs in a house that really isn't that big. The weakest moments occurs with the Ouija board mysteriously bursting into flames and the sight of the demon's hoof-like feet when it traipses through the hero's trail of power on the floor.<br/><br/>Katie has been plagued by demons her entire life. She believes that one burned down her home when she was child. Ostensibly, they have returned to make her life miserable. Now, her loyal boyfriend--a San Diego day-trader who takes none of this hokum seriously--resolves to protect Katie. First, he buys a digital video camera and hooks it up to his laptop and leaves it on at night while they sleep. Okay, this part sounds a little like the infamous ""Blair Witch Project,"" but ""Paranormal Activity"" does not act stupid like BWP. Second, Micha wants to contact the demon but a professional ghost hunter warns him not to do it. Of course, things go bump in the night, leaves burned photos of Katie in the attic and eventually makes our heroine do some odd and unusual things at night, like stand by her bed and watch the sheet slip off the bed while her boyfriend sleeps peacefully. What makes this picture so hypnotic is its utter simplicity. Basically, everything is seen through the lens of Micah's camera. The ending will jolt you."

It was kind of entertaining...the main guy was an absolute idiot and that was fun to watch. I really wanted to be scared...but it just didn't deliver. I'm a Christian believer, so I know that at any moment, I could've told the demon to get out, in Jesus name, and he would've had to. No question.

","Just got back from the Friday midnight screening (Oct 9th) in Toronto. The crowd was buzzing and unlike some midnight screening crowds, I really felt like this one was there to be scared and to take the movie seriously. I've been hearing the hype for this since it first screened in 2007, and I've been absolutely dying to watch this. I was kind of bracing myself for the setup, that normally accompanies movies that are hyped as much as this. For instance the Blair Witch Project was supposedly this scary phenomenon, but it turned out to be a barely scary flick.<br/><br/>For whoever has the same doubts I did, I can tell you this much: Within the first 25 mins, you will KNOW that you're in for frighteningly good time! As soon as the night lights in the Camera go on, there's a sense of dread and I could feel everyone in the th eater just hush and wait for something to happen. This happened every time night came around and by the end people were literally groaning in fear. <br/><br/>Is the movie scary? YES! Is it unbearably scary? Well parts of it are, and SPOILER: The ending where she leans over him like an animal, or is standing by the bed watching him, is the scariest movie scene I've seen EVER and I've seen just about every horror flick ever made. <br/><br/>The movie is authentic, extremely well acted (Both Micah and Katie are as natural as you can get), and Peli is a gifted director. The effects are outstanding for such a micro budget. <br/><br/>There are a few corny parts that take away from the scares like the Ouija board fire and name writing on the board. But other scenes like the Attic, and the scene right before the end where Katie convinces Micah to stay (an obviously possessed Katie) are downright disturbing.<br/><br/>Having watched movies like the Exorcist, The Omen, Shining, Audition, The Ring, Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc I can safely say nothing disturbed me more than this movie did. It's a definite must watch! There will be some who won't find it that scary but its the scenes I mentioned above that WILL make you cringe and make you remember when you get home and close the bedroom lights (Like I did just now!)<br/><br/>10 Stars for taking an age old concept and making it so fresh, for the acting, direction and an outstanding ending."

","Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" is hands down the scariest, most terrifying movie of the year. Every minute of this documented film will keep your skin crawling. I was so freaked out after watching this film, I did not want to step foot into my house thinking there might be something I can't see waiting for me. This film is a series of documented hauntings. A young couple suspects that their house is haunted by a malevolent entity. They set up video surveillance to capture evidence of what happens at night as they sleep. According to Ryan E. Buell, Director of the Paranormal Research Society of Penn State University, most paranormal activity happens around 3:00 AM because it is considered the anti-Christ hours for it is said Christ died around 3PM. This film makes the ""Blair Witch Project"" look like a cheap hoax. This demonizing, not to be confused with a ghost sighting, takes us to a place we really never want to go. A Ghost Sighting is a spirit that was previously human. This docu film depicts what happens when you have been chosen by a demon long before birth. ""Paranormal Activity"" had its world premiere at screamfest to a sold out crowd. I could tell people were extremely disturbed long after they exited the theatre."

Cheap jump scares and thats about all you will find within this film. The acting is what i expect from amateurs, the direction lazy and the pacing while yes attempts to build tension does very little. The best point in this film is the very last 2 to 3 minutes, other than that there's not much else i can say about this film other than the fact that it has spawned 3 sequels, an upcoming spin off, and another sequel completely dumbfounds me."

Don't expect to get shocked every time it seems to happen. I think a lot of people couldn't handle the very slow increase in suspense (and some are probably just those guys, who start making fun about everything that's happening on the screen because they don't want to get scared but look like the tough guy instead).<br/><br/>P.S.

","With a cast of only five amateurs and a budget of a mere $15,000, director Oren Peli deserves tremendous praise for even managing to form a feature length movie never mind take the world by storm.<br/><br/>Peli's 'Paranormal Activity' is being dubbed in the same bracket as great horror classics such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Poltergeist' and that for the director and anyone involved is an achievement in itself. Perhaps though, some critics are a little too easily frightened as the things they described 'Paranormal Activity' as were completely over-the- top. <br/><br/>I vaguely remember feeling a chill or two, missing a heart beat and perhaps biting my upper lip however I was massively disappointed that my expectations were wide of the mark. Certainly was this not 'The Scariest Movie of all Time', far from it, the amount of scares were few and far between and some of them didn't have as great an effect on the viewer as others.<br/><br/>With a mockumentary plot revolving around Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat starring as themselves, the combination of CCTV footage and hand-held camera footage gave a detailed account of the paranormal events which occur in the young couples' home. <br/><br/>In fairness, the acting is outstanding considering the lack of experience in the ranks; the final third of the film is also rather disturbing. Unfortunately, the premise is a little clichéd and not very interesting since it's not actually 'real footage' so 'Paranormal Activity' is over reliant on the fear it injects into us. That fear doesn't begin to arrive for some time and when it does, it's not as shocking as you may interpret beforehand."

","A number of people that I have spoken to did not really like this film, and to be honest with you there was little about this film that really stood out for me with the exception that it cost only $15000 to make but ended up pretty much breaking the box office. It has gone down in history as the movie with the biggest taking on an opening night ever. Not bad for a guy with a camcorder and a couple of mates.<br/><br/>Obviously it is the little tricks that Peli uses to make it appear that there is a ghost in the house. Okay, they are a little bit more explicit in labelling it as a demon and that this demon is a dangerous entity to mess with, and it is clear from the movie that there isn't really anybody to assist them with the problem.<br/><br/>Basically the movie is about a couple, Micah and Katie, who suspect that their house is haunted, so they purchase a camcorder so that they can attempt to capture the ghost on video, or at least try to work out what is going on. The actions start off really subtly, such as a door swinging in the middle of the night, or the occasional bump from downstairs, but as the movie progresses the events become more and more intense until it ends badly.<br/><br/>This is one of the things I generally like about horror movies like this and that there is generally no happy ending. The Blair Witch Project did not have a happy ending, and neither does this movie. However, we are left in the dark about a lot of things, however I suspect that this is Peli's purpose. He is not attempting to explain anything beyond what we are told in the movie. This movie is about things that go bump in the night, but does not endeavour or even attempt to explain what these things are. Further, it has no intention of having any realistic explanation about it either. The other effect that he uses quite well (though it comes out much better in the next movie) is the shock value. Not shock as in doing something on screen that absolutely appalls us, but rather having a long stretch of nothing, and then suddenly a door slams, startling the characters and startling the audience. That, I must admit, is hard to do, but it is the reason we go and see these films, to jump out of our seats.<br/><br/>I would have to compare it with the Blair Witch Project as the style is very similar, but while I may have liked the Blair Witch Project when I watched it it made me feel very ill, and I know that I was not the only one to find that. This film is nowhere near as bad as that, though the camera shots of them just living their normal lives do get quite boring. However it adds to the entire suspense of the movie, as we are made to let our guard down, and we then forget that there is paranormal activity occurring in the house, and suddenly BANG, the door slams shut of its own accord.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad movie, but not something that I am probably going to watch over and over again."

","Ah, 'Blair Witch'. Nothing will touch you. This film, though, tries. Succeeds...a little. Essentially, one thing, and one thing only, works here, and it's a spin on the hand-held footage genre: the bedroom filming. This truly is suspense, for the seconds count away and you look from the door to the bed, back to the door and the hallway, waiting. It's wonderful. It's just too bad that a better film weren't wrapped around it. Micah and Kate are OK, and do the 'real' thing adequately. Yes, you wonder: mid-twenties, she's a student, he's a day trader, and they have this really nice three-bedroom house? And why would even young people with some money rent/own a three-bedroom? How is it always beautifully clean? It's like porn, when you realize the set is the producer's actual house; no couple that young would have the spare bedrooms so nicely furnished, or the collection of outdoor furniture clearly gathered over years. Then - after a certain point, there's no way they're not getting some help there. Surely there's more than one demonologist in CA? Or: maybe, after the thing drags her out of the bed by the ankles, it might be smart to sleep in turns. Or arrange to have friends over at various times, in shifts. Or put a tent in the yard, see what the beastie can do outdoors. Or, if you must sleep together, MAYBE HAVE KATIE SWITCH SIDES SO SHE'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE DOOR. All this is what drove me crazy, because the potential was there. I just can't accept that the returning ghost hunter, terrified of being inside that house, would tell Katie that his demonologist friend will be 'back in a few days', or that Micah, after the night of the footprints and photograph, tells K that there's no need to call in expert help. All in all, the real scare is how your own imagination wishes you were making this, because so much could've been done to bring on subtle, realistic terror. Last word: skip the alternate ending. The theatrical one is far, far better."

Such is the nature of the web I suppose (see the disparity between pro and user reviews on metacritic as proof).<br/><br/>I'm not a huge horror fan and that's probably why I was generally indifferent towards this film. But here goes anyway:<br/><br/>GOOD:<br/><br/>Everyone slagging this film should remember that a guy got of his ass, worked really, really hard with no financial backing and actually produced a feature.<br/><br/>The 'found footage' style works better than in many bigger budget productions.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/>BAD:<br/><br/>The acting is okay, but not fantastic.<br/><br/>Whilst I complimented the 'food footage' style, it falls down a bit when the female lead is filming. Of the two main characters, she is the one who is scared out of her wits. Is it realistic to suppose she'd carry on filming? In (REC) the filming was 'done' by a professional news camera person. This makes more sense. Normal people do not film during stressful situations. This is why it's hard to make a documentary with no training.<br/><br/>It does drag a bit.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/>To sum up, I applaud the achievement of the director and I'm aware that many people thought this was very scary but when it comes to horror there's something I don't get: Gore can be scary - because the audience cringe at the thought of it happening to them. Loud noises/shocks can be scary - because evolution has decreed that humans produce fight/flight responses to them. Murderers/psychopaths can be scary - because murderers/psychopaths are scary.<br/><br/>The supernatural is not scary because it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>This is the same problem I have with most horror films. I can't be scared of ghosts/demons/fairies/leprechauns/angels (you know, the bad ones) etc because I don't believe in them. Other people do believe in these things and therefore they do find them scary. I just find this odd. This is all irrational, learned behaviour. The Ouija board, for example, was sold as a child's toy in the 19th century and has been mythologised to it's present day status as an object of fear (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija#Toy). Because I don't subscribe to these kinds of irrational fears, I don't find this type of film frightening. Still, if you do, fill your boots. Just please don't try to engage me in any conversations regarding your wacky beliefs.<br/><br/>Thanks."

Apart from saving myself a few quid (in the end I snagged the DVD second hand for a pound!), I really couldn't imagine anywhere more apt to watch this home-based horror than in one's own house.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even though I did everything I could to enhance my viewing experience, including waiting until I was alone at night, turning out the lights and leaving the door ajar, Paranormal Activity still didn't scare the bejeezuz out of me! It has a few creepy moments, helped by some weird noises and the occasional loud bang, but like so many other documentary style horrors, the novelty of the hand-held format soon wears off, and the formula rapidly becomes tiresome: the spooky activity is mild at first, but predictably escalates as the film progresses; it's just a matter of time before the ectoplasm really hits the fan; and it's almost a cert that the film will end abruptly with one last shock and the camera falling to the floor/being dropped/smashed etc. (which it does, depending on which ending you see).<br/><br/>Thankfully, unlike the Blair Witch Project, the characters are at least likable enough for us to care about them, which helps the tension a touch, and director Oren Peli does manage one or two good scenes amidst the more routine bumps in the night—the discovery of footprints that end under a loft hatch leads to a chilling moment as the camera explores the dark roof-space, and Katie being dragged from her bed by an unseen assailant is an unexpected jolt—but the film as a whole is far from the intense, relentless, crap-your-pants-in-fright scare-fest that the trailers, and many reviews, claimed it to be."

And there is absolutely nothing scary in this film as a result.

","Was this movie supposed to be scary because I wasn't really scared at all? I am not a horror movie fan, get scared easily & usually avoid the genre because I don't find pleasure in being terrified which is why it took me this long to finally see this popular film. Perhaps it was the lack of visual effects/quick camera shots/scary music (horror movie standards) but it just didn't scare me. There was a lot of footsteps and banging, etc.. but I couldn't help but imagine the film crew making the sound effects on the stairs as the 2 lead characters lie in the bedroom. I don't know - the movie just wasn't terrifying whatsoever.<br/><br/>What the movie lacked in fear, it made up for in suspense. It was the suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat watching and waiting to see what would happen next. There is absolutely no way to know the ending in advance, assuming one hasn't read spoilers, which makes it a lot better than clichéd movie endings that one can see coming a mile away. There is a nice buildup of action that finally leads to the ending climax.<br/><br/>This movie was shot in a 1st person manner by the 2 lead characters - Katie and Micah. This means that all the footage in the film was created by the 2 leads which means that they end up filming anything and everything to give the audience a portrayal of their lives and a cohesive storyboard. Filming at night when the couple was asleep trying to catch paranormal activity on camera worked for me but the filming of anything and everything, no matter how random didn't. It was weird how they would randomly shoot their lives 24/7 as if they were on some reality show or shooting a documentary when in reality, they were trying to catch the entity mostly at night. Again, this was necessary to actually get the footage to create the film but from a logical standpoint, it didn't work. Why was the camera always on?<br/><br/>As for the 2 main characters - great acting. I bought them as real people truly fearful of what was happening to them or really Katie, specifically, in the home. The movie is fictional but it was done in such a realistic manner that it would be believable that this was a movie about 2 real people and what happened to them.. although, again, it isn't - it's all fiction.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, before I got into the 2 characters and their dynamic, I found them and the movie to be extremely annoying and hard to sit through. This actually takes me back to the previous paragraph where I pointed out the random recordings of anything and everything - that is basically what the beginning of the film is ... it's the intro to the home, the layout of the home and the characters BUT at the same time why the heck is Micah, specifically, annoyingly recording everything? What's the point? He may like cameras but still...the camera was on 24/7 taping randomness for no reason especially at the start of the film. Again, yes, this was the only way to get footage for the movie BUT it was odd.<br/><br/>6/10 Suspenseful but not really scary. It was good and original but nothing fantastic. I'd definitely consider this movie overrated based on the heaps of praise and the box office numbers but it isn't bad either - I'd recommend it because it IS good, it's just not great. I do plan on watching Paranormal Activity 2 so it was enjoyable enough for me to want more.<br/><br/>Lastly, I saw the movie with the original ending which is apparently different from the theatrical version. After watching the theatrical version online afterwards, I'd recommend trying to see the version with the original ending, it was better."

","At first I found this about as tedious as anything I've ever seen. It was, of course, a home movie from a pretty much stationary video camera. The people do the things people do on a daily basis. It's one boring thing after another. However, as time goes along, we begin to be pulled into the nuances of the unfriendly spirit that haunts the young woman and her husband/boyfriend. What happens is not really life threatening or seriously significant through most of the film, but at some point, there is an overwhelming threat that permeates every scene and we begin to watch the two lumps in the bed, waiting for the next action. I will not spoil this movie. I will say that considering most of what goes on is cerebral and left to the imagination, I found myself staring at the screen. Neither character is very likable or even kind. His obsession with his camera would have driven most women out of that marriage. There is no compassion or concern for her well-being. Nevertheless, we don't have to like characters to profit from their experiences. Suffice it to say, they become caught up in their own shortsightedness and inability to overcome inertia.

"server10","1","1","2","10 November 2010"," 4 reasons why 'Paranormal Activity' is a bad movie:
","1)Because it has an unoriginal plot: In fact, all of the ideas presented in this movie are directly taken from well known horror films: the hand shaking camera movement (The Blair Witch Project), the whole exorcism theme (The Exorcist), the ""Oh I can't sleep at night because something bad is going to happen!"" (A Nightmare On Elm Street) and many other things that I won't expose in order to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>2)Because it's an unprofessional movie: it's not a secret that this movie had an extremely low budget, but that's NOT a reason to see an irrelevant crew member getting his way out of the camera in the middle of a scene.<br/><br/>3)Because the acting is bad: Katie and Micah characters can't make you feel any empathy towards their situation in the what supposed to be the scary scenes and The Psychic is just pathetic and utterly futile.<br/><br/>4)Because it's simply doesn't work: the main goal of this film is to get you scared, but I just can't be afraid of occasional knocks or slammed doors or some weirdo Psychic who says he has a ""bad feeling"". Sorry, I don't buy it."
"cinemalady2007","2","1","2","9 November 2010"," Not that I wouldn't watch it again, but HOW IS THIS SCARY?????
","Okay, I know this may sound hypocritical, but please try to stay with me on this. This film represents a good home video series, but the way it was filmed as a home video, takes away from the movie. I mean, it does make you wonder what the demon plans to do next, but let's be real for a second. There is never any kind of hint as to WHY the demon wants the girl, and the ""activity"" is like that from an episode of Goosebumps! Now, I do admit that certain parts put me on edge, like the end for example, and when the attic was open, but the trailer totally lies to the public by calling this a ""horror"" movie. It honestly seems more like a video that a bunch of college students made! Not to mention some of the actors were not even trying! Yes, it is candy for the eyes (to a degree) if you like ghost stories, but do not be fooled by anyone telling you that it's scary! Would I watch it again? Maybe. Is it scary and terrifying? Only if you're six! :-P Actually, I'm not sure if I can believe a child would be frightened by this."

","This came off as an inept attempt to capitalize on an equally inept genre: the ""realism"" movie where we are supposed to believe that the action that takes place before the camera is real. In this movie, there is little action until almost the end of the movie and even then the ""possession"" of Katie by the so-called demon is hardly new and was already a given from the moment she confessed to seeing ""dark images"" at age eight. My main problem with this movie, however, was the terrible writing. These two people are supposed to be a couple, yet Micah does everything in his power short of drawing a pentagram to summon the demon, including using a Ouija board despite Katie's protestations. Fueled by what seems to be an inexhaustible supply of testosterone and chauvinism, he treats Katie like a lab experiment rather than the woman with whom he is sharing his life. At the instant he first exhibited his need for ""control,"" this became a B-movie. The only reason I can think of for this type of behavior is that it is ""in the script."""

"DWheelerOz","3","1","2","21 September 2010"," Disregard the Hype
","Paranormal Activity is a film about... well, it's really all in the name. It's about a young couple who are trouble by some strange and disturbing phenomena and decide to video-tape their experiences. The film is shot in a style similar to Blair Witch. To Paranormal Activity's credit, it's less annoying to watch than that film because there's much less running around in the dark with constant screaming. The film benefits from a more subdued pace, which results in fairly well developed characters and a fairly complete exploration of the plot. The acting and scripting both feel very natural, lending a little bit of credence to the film's set up as essentially found footage.<br/><br/>That may all seem like not-insignificant praise, but the truth is I really didn't enjoy this film. I was going in expecting to be scared. That's the reputation the film has - as one of the scariest films of all time. But I simply couldn't buy into it. The film spends a lot of time with not much happening. This isn't uncommon for horror films, and in fact I tend to prefer films in the genre that spend some time building up suspense or a feeling of dread. But Paranormal Activity doesn't do that. It builds on character (generally in fairly superficial ways) and on a plot that, while well-developed is simply not that interesting, but neglects to build any kind of real sense of suspense that would add impact when things really do get strange.<br/><br/>The end result was that I was bored for most of the film. The characters are well-developed, but they're also kind of boring, and not enough to carry the film. When there is actually something paranormal happening, there are basically two extremes shown in the film. There are events which are so benign as to be... yes, a little odd, but not really terrifying or troubling beyond that. And there are events that are fairly over-the-top and just ridiculous. The film goes to great lengths to set up a realistic atmosphere, presumably so that you'll accept the more outlandish events, but it had the opposite effect for me - the movie spent so much time building up a certain atmosphere, that when I saw those scenes, it had the effect of destroying any sense of immersion I may have had. They simply didn't fit. There was not one good scare in this movie as far as I'm concerned, and it failed to create much psychological horror or dread. As I said, I was bored for most of it.<br/><br/>There are aspects of this movie that aren't terrible. If you liked The Blair Witch Project, you might well enjoy Paranormal Activity - I think it's a markedly better film in the same style. It's still not very good, though. In fact, in this man's opinion, Paranormal Activity is a pretty lackluster film indeed. Avoid."

","Not quite as bad as ""Absolute Zero"" or that thing called ""Cloverfield"", but it does rank down there with the worst of them. Granted, the movie doesn't have the typical ""Four College Students Finding Evil and Horror Somewhere"" theme, but it does play on cheapness. The Trivia states it took ten days to film this movie, and I'm sure much less time in writing it.<br/><br/>Pretty much, the story is about a couple living in a haunted house. Strange things happen to the women, many, many times. Instead of running in fear and terror, she opts to read books about ghosts. Micah, for whatever reason, starts out by making fun of her (yeah, typical Gen-X yuppie wanna-be), and uses the old Cloverfield routine: Film everything. To get in a good horror scare for the religious types, an Ouija Board is used (yawn).<br/><br/>One paranormal expert comes in, offers advice, and listens intently to the suffering women. Another comes back later and is scared, close-minded, and worthless. So, the couple stays in the house.<br/><br/>The woman then sleep walks around and is outside in the cold night. So, the couple stays.<br/><br/>Things get broken and moved around, scaring them into believing something evil is living in the house. So, the couple stays.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT* Not to give the movie totally away, the never-ending credits - if you can read them - roll on and on over the screen in the speed of a Fox TV show, and written in a microscopic size. What was the point of that? I asked myself as I was in my fifth minute of credit watching. After ten minutes I ejected the DVD wishing ill fates to those making this thing, and cursing myself for having listened to people telling me to watch this trash."

"stevenfallonnyc","2","1","2","31 August 2010"," Unscary nonsense, excruciatingly dull
","Wow, where to begin? ""Paranormal Activity"" is a movie I heard was so scary, so I finally got to watching. What a massive waste of time.<br/><br/>You know the story - a young couple living together have to deal with a ""demon"" that has been chasing the girl on and off since she was a kid, and now it's making noise in their new home. The guy buys a camera to document the happenings.<br/><br/>This is a ten-minute short stretched out very painfully. For most of the movie, it's established the demon only does stuff at night - so why even have the camera on during the day? So we can watch the clichéd nonsense the couple has to spew out in order to stretch the movie to feature-length time. These sequences are beyond mind-numbing. Watching the couple try to be ""natural"" is just downright uncomfortable and embarrassing.<br/><br/>When they sleep, however, the camera is set up in its place and we get to see things like the door moving and some lights turning on and off. Now some may say, ""What do you want, gore? It's supposed to be subtle."" That'd be fine, except the movie, again, is a ten-minute short stretched out to feature-length time. It's beyond dull.<br/><br/>Even way later, when the demon finally does a few things in the daytime, you think things may pick up a little, but no. Not a bit.<br/><br/>A little later, we see the guy get angry because he wants to ""take care of the problem"" instead of the girl calling in a demon specialist. Where did that come from? Wasn't the idea for the guy to simply document the happenings with the camera for proof? Where was it determined he was actually trying to ""take care of the problem?"" Was the demon supposed to say, ""Oh, they are filming me, I better leave!""? Just another mess in this abysmal movie.<br/><br/>The laughs are good though. Scenes that are supposed to be ""scary"" are really quite funny. Watching the couple scream and get startled, seeing the girl get dragged out of bed by the demon, and lots of other stuff, it's all pretty hilarious. And the ending, actually, the various endings - all very funny.<br/><br/>Even the obvious ploy to have a busty girl in the movie so the guys watching don't fall asleep fails, as that is no consolation for this bore-fest. The guy reminded me of Jimmy Fallon and since this movie should have been done as a comedy, Fallon would have been perfect for the role. Him, and that busty Rachel girl also from SNL when he was on it, they should have been in this movie.<br/><br/>Now, I can appreciate what may have been attempted - to make a horror movie without the gore, and go for chills - it just fails miserably. Extremely.<br/><br/>If you have absolutely nothing better to do, and want a few laughs, this may be OK to sit through. Just fast forward to the bedroom scenes and get ready to laugh."
"sddavis63","3","1","2","11 August 2010"," A Ho-Hum Pretend Documentary
","First question: did the world really need another haunted house style of movie? I don't think so, although I suppose I can't argue with the fact that this movie has had decent reviews. And in fairness, given the very small budget it worked with it does what it does reasonably well. Still, I can't honestly describe this as a particularly good movie. To be blunt, the gimmick is getting a bit stale. It's filmed like ""The Blair With Project"" or ""Cloverfield,"" a pretend-documentary shot with a hand-held camera (or, for the night scenes, a stationary camera) supposedly documenting the strange things happening in the house where Katie and Micah live. Katie has apparently had a history of these experiences, Micah inherited them so to speak when he moved in with her. I liked both of the afore-mentioned movies, so I can say that I have no particular problem with the style. This movie does little to draw the viewer in, though. For the first half hour very little happens, we spend a lot of time watching video being shot and then fast forwarded, there's a few mild chills - but nothing really exciting or frightening or shocking happens until the last fifteen minutes or so. I won't give the ending away, except to say that the very last scene struck me as silly, and it sets us up for a sequel that is apparently to be released in the fall of 2010. Frankly, the idea of a sequel doesn't get me enthused. This one was quite a disappointment."
"scarletminded","1","1","2","10 August 2010"," Vapid, boring, lackluster acting, not scary...I want my 90 minutes back!
","I should have probably turned this off halfway through. It reminds me of Blair Witch Project, except it wasn't as interesting. The acting doesn't create any kind of suspense. The scene with the door is reminiscent of The Haunting, sort of if the original Haunting was devoid of decent acting. This reminds me why I don't like people in San Diego. I live here and the people remind me of the vapid sort of person who is so afraid of the supernatural. The Ouija board they had was laughable. It looked like they put a motor of a remote control car into it and though it was filmed, they didn't talk much about it after that. It's funny that they would even have to call LA for a psychic, there are plenty of ones in San Diego. And really once the guy gets there, he wimps out and just leaves them to their fate. <br/><br/>It was like watching a bad reality TV show. All the ""scares"" have been used in countless B movies before and I think I was only amused by the ending, because I couldn't figure out what hit the camera. By then, I'd been wanting to turn it off for an hour and didn't really care if the characters lived or died or what. Whatever, as Micah would say, this sucks. That's San Diego speak for ""My girlfriend's been possessed, bro!"" I guess because of the lack of acting, it didn't seem realistic, like people were acting like they weren't acting. If you watch ghost hunting shows on basic cable or real horror films, nothing in this will freak you out. <br/><br/>I am hoping my boyfriend doesn't want to view this because I don't want to watch it again. It moved very slow (and I am used to watching stuff like David Lynch so slow can be OK with me if it is done right), the characters were lame and unbelievable and there wasn't much plot, really and no real scare until the last minute, which might have been better experienced in a dark theater. It probably doesn't help it along that it is one of those ""could it be real?"" movies like Blair Witch Project, but BWP did it ten years ago and much better."

","I found this movie to be very effective. It's hard to find movies that can build genuine suspense and sustain it as well. This one immediately drew me in. It didn't matter that I was seeing it after all the hype, I think because of the acting job done by the two leads. They created characters that made me want to find out what happened. As opposed to, say, Away We Go, which I had to turn off because I really couldn't stand the couple being portrayed.<br/><br/>This is the simplest set-up possible: a man buys a video camera to record what goes on while he and his wife sleep. She senses that some sort of presence is visiting her, and over the course of the movie, the experiences intensify.<br/><br/>This movie does follow one of the major clichés of the horror film, which is the ""smart people doing dumb things"" syndrome. As the evil spirit begins to act more aggressively, the man only does more to antagonize it, and the girl doesn't really take any action.<br/><br/>I much preferred the unrated ending, as I think the version shown in theaters fell flat. Did Steven Spielberg really suggest that ending? It was a very lame choice that extinguished all the tension built up to that point. The alternate choice was a better payoff."

I'll start with the acting, perfect, I've never seen such great acting from fairly unheard of actors, it made you feel that they were just normal people which is exactly what the film was wanting you to feel. They both had pretty good camera skills as well as the film is recorded as though Micah was filming from his own HD camera. The storyline was fairly typical, but still kept me hooked on it. The special effects were subtle, mainly good, but sometimes were a bit simple, but in many ways that helped this film get it's 'feel'. <br/><br/>I loved this film in the end, I was genuinely scared when the night scenes started, and really wanted the morning to come in the story.

Very lame. <br/><br/>Despite those two things, I ended up liking Paranormal Activity a bunch. The idea and execution were very well done, and going with two unknown actors really added to the realism of the project. If any of the events Katie and Micah experienced ever happened to me in real life, I'd be terrified, and I thought they did a pretty convincing job of appearing as confused and freaked out as I would have been.<br/><br/>This kind of horror won't work for everyone, as it relies a lot on tension and a sense of immersion.  If you can't put yourself in the place of the two main characters, then Paranormal Activity won't do much for you.

","This movie is a welcome breath of fresh air to the modern horror genre. In the right setting, and the right state of mind, this movie has you on the edge of your seat. It makes a normal activity, such as going to bed, seem frightening.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of documentary style filming, although in the past this style of filming and the element of horror has been questionable. The Blair Witch Project for example; over hyped and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Though in this case the realism that has been produced in this film is spine tingling. There are no added elements of music to heighten the mood; its the silence in Paranormal Activity that makes it such a success. Your almost afraid to breath too loudly, in case you miss out. The director should be awarded for not over-exaggerating the narrative. The 'hauntings' appear to happen quite naturally on the screen, which highlights the realistic nature of this film.<br/><br/>Based on a young couple; the horrifying fact is this could be anyone of us, and thats what was on the back of my mind whilst viewing the film. If you are a sceptic though and don't believe in spirits, demons or the paranormal world, then this is not the film for you. As a believer i embraced the 'hauntings' and the paranormal incidences that were happening right in front of my eyes.<br/><br/>One criticism i do have though, is that of one of the main protagonists Micah. He goes against everything that Katie asks him not to do, and if he had of listened to the Phychic in the first place and not tried to communicate with the demon, then maybe he would not of met such an untimely demise. On the other hand though, it would not of made such interesting viewing.<br/><br/>Its nice to see what affect a low budget film, with few cameras and actors can actually do. It is not reliant on big name actors, special effects, or over-exaggerated sound effects. The focus is purely what is happening on screen. Its raw, original and has you watching your back the way to bed."
"jzappa","8","1","2","30 April 2010"," The Rare Quality of Quiet and Anticipation, Even Nothing Going On.
","Paranormal Activity is a cunning little horror film, so well made it's authentically creepy, that comes insisting it's the real thing. Without any sort of traditional opening or closing credits, it opens by thanking the families of the two central characters and closes with one of those Current Whereabouts Unknown title cards and a screen of copyright notices. This was ostensibly a film made without a director, a writer, a producer, sound, catering, grips, makeup orwell no it does have a cameraman. All of the footage is shown like it had been found afterward.<br/><br/>As in Blair Witch, Rec, Quarantine, Cloverfield, et al, the plot gimmick is that one of the two characters recorded it himself. There isn't a single shot that defies that premise, even if certain ones appear practically unfeasible without other hands on the camera, but I may be wrong. A grad student and a day trader who've been together three years have now moved into a house in San Diego that doesn't look much occupied. It's well enough decorated, yet everything seems recent and there's no untidiness. Micah meets Katie out front one day by filming her on his new video camera, which she finds bulkier than his other one.<br/><br/>They've been disturbed by auspices of some kind of ghostly goings-on in an upstairs bedroom. Micah's brilliant spark is to film in the house, leaving the camera rolling as a quiet watchman while they sleep. Like any man with a new toy, he grows consumed in this idea, the bottom line, for him, isn't Katie's despair but his movie. After one significant shock, she asks him doubtingly if he indeed went back to pick up his camera. One advantage of the plot gimmick is that for extended stretches of time the camera is apparently left on with no one running it. It's on a tripod at the end of their bed while they sleep, and we watch occurrences while they're sound asleep. Some of these things are considerably minute, and I won't outline any of them. The basis that they occur anyhow is the key. That they appear to occur by themselves, observed by a fixed camera, makes them scary, particularly because there are some shots that look beyond the bounds of possibility without special effects, and there's no discernible sign of any, looking as carefully as one can.<br/><br/>He is usually off camera. She is in front of it in nearly every shot, and for all intents and purposes you could say that this is a predominantly one-woman show, and of Katie Featherston's performance it's sufficient to claim it is excellent for the aim of this film. She's not Emma Thompson, she's a young woman who looks and talks completely like she might be an everyday college student who has newly moved in with her boyfriend. Micah acts, well, precisely like a man. The sort who still has a rock band at thirty. Katie has been disturbed by some kind of ghostlike apparition since she was a child, and now she's gravely bothered, and Micah's reaction isn't much concern but a resolve to get it all down on camera. Nearly all horror movies are about teenagers for purely commercial reasons, and this film has the quality of showing us completely and totally relatable young people.<br/><br/>I of course know thanks to IMDb that Paranormal Activity does actually have a writer-director, Oren Peli, and naturally other technical credits. Though akin to The Blair Witch Project, with which it's of course likened, it goes near and far to look like a film found after the fact. It succeeds. It demonstrates that quiet and anticipation can be more engrossing than machine-gun fast-cutting and manic effects. For long durations here, not a thing is going on, and trust me, you'll be paying strict attention."
"animesh1789","8","1","2","26 April 2010"," pretty good if you forget all the hype
","First off, I'm the kind of person that doesn't get scared easily. So i had this movie in my laptop, it was just over midnight and the house was empty. Half an hour into it and i started regretting my decision.<br/><br/>Although i was scared witless at the end, but i doubt if it would be half as impressive if it was inside a movie theatre. But the movie is , afterall, well directed. It succeeds in creating an aura of tension and spookiness. Needless to say, this was the whole point of the movie and those who think the movie is not worth watching don't get it. I'd also add that if you watch enough of blunt horror scenes like disembodied heads coming to attack you or whatever, you'd soon get bored of it. Whereas fear of the unknown never fails. This is human nature.<br/><br/>On another point, some scenes are a bit of a disappointment. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna talk about it now...<br/><br/>First - I guess after a couple of nights footage, it was clear that the ghost was entering the room through the door. So, they might as well had closed the door when they slept. Not that it would help, but in the movie it would look nice. A good struggle to distance themselves with the ghost would look better than catching the ghost in action with a camera. Come to think of it, why was the stupid BF filming all this stuff at all? He didn't look like he was gonna use it (he didn't like the idea of a demonologist coming to help).<br/><br/>Second - The psychic comes to call promising to help but chickens out at what, i thought, was to be an interesting twist in the movie. wtf.<br/><br/>Third - The built-up tension in the movie was such that I myself dreaded the moment they went to sleep. So how could ""they"" sleep so soundly. It was almost odd and nearly ruined my moments of exciting nervousness.<br/><br/>and so on..<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is pretty good. Im at a loss to understand how anyone could possibly think that the acting is bad. I thought the acting is so well that it looked like real life footage to me.<br/><br/>Go ahead, watch it."

","Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) film and record the night-time activity in the house that they share. They are not alone......<br/><br/>The film is a bit slow to get going. It comes alive after the visit of the Psychic (Mark Fredrichs). The cast are all good but there are the usual stupid moments that crop up in the storyline of nearly every scary film, ie, a refusal to switch on the lights when exploring something spooky in the night, and the compulsive urge to split up when strange noises are heard. The film is also full of ideas that have been ripped off from other films such as ""The Entity"" and ""Blair Witch Project"".<br/><br/>Whilst the film is alright as entertainment, it fails to explain what the demon is and there doesn't seem to be a coherent story. I also didn't like the ending. It seems to have been added on to get a shock factor into the story. The story is actually a million miles away from true poltergeist behaviour. The writers invented a demon for the story which is undefinable and so can't be compared to anything. It doesn't exist. I'm more scared of the Daleks.<br/><br/>It's a mildly scary film that is basically a string of other films spliced together with a running thread of the main couple sleeping a lot."

","While I appreciate the fact that this film will probably end up being lauded as a classic and that it was reportedly made in 7 days on a $15000.00 budget, I can't in all honesty say that the movie terrified me, or even really scared me at all. This isn't due to bad acting or a terrible plot or even the hand held camera technique that so many complain about. The whole problem with Paranormal Activity is that there, in my case, was absolutely no suspension of disbelief after the first few ""problems"" that Katie and Micah experience. I'll tell you what... when stuff starts moving around, doors slamming by themselves, and my girlfriend gets hauled roughly out of bed and down the hall by an INVISIBLE FORCE, I am out. Period. Pack your crap, grab your girlfriend and find somewhere very public to be. Psychic can't help and the Demonologist is out of town? Vacate and call a priest or something and GET THE HELL OUT! Find hallowed ground. Hell, find a MALL! Anything other that putting your girlfriend through abject terror by goading some unseen, malevolent force into an insane rage! The macho douche-bag crap Micah persists in displaying through some of the most horrific nights is so far over the top that it's totally unrealistic. Then there is the noise AND the screaming AND the booming AND the crashing of breaking glass. These people don't have neighbors in suburban San Diego? How about police? That kind of screaming draws attention. Lots of attention.<br/><br/>Nope, sorry. I don't buy it."

And if you look at these circumstances a movie with this ""equipment"" couldn't be better. I mean only 2 main characters and they lead the story by over 90%. It is really good. The acting appears to be quite natural like if it had really happened which raises the tension quite good. Their whole behavior and the situations are quite realistic in their ways and make that whole movie really enjoyable, more like a documentary about a spooky house - but longer and not that artificial.

"colinrgeorge","8","1","2","6 April 2010"," ""Paranormal Activity""
","""Paranormal Activity"" presents an unsettling and uncompromising reality. Without the context of a hype-fueled theatrical release or reviews like this, a believer in the supernatural could easily perceive the found-footage aesthetic as honest documentary. After all, it was made for only eleven thousand dollars, features one location, and a principal cast of two. The print that ran at the Bridge for last weekend's midnight screening was even bereft of credits. Nothing betrays the internal logic of the film, which is pretty cool in a decade of increasingly glib, grandstanding splatter flicks usurping the once-credible horror name.<br/><br/>Comparisons will inevitably be drawn to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" or indirectly, ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" which are suddenly hot commodities in genre film-making. Among the most successful viral marketing campaigns of the last few years are those for ""Cloverfield,"" and ""District 9,"" both of which experiment with docu-narrative hybrids, and have, along with the recent DVD release of Spanish zombie film, ""REC"" (and its North American remake, ""Quarantine""), paved the way for ""Paranormal Activity,"" which distributor Paramount has apparently been sitting on since 2007, to finally see the light of day, figuratively speaking.<br/><br/>But ""Paranormal Activity"" deserves to be seen on its own merit, and it delivers because first- time director Oren Peli has an intricate understanding of his audience. He establishes an intimately suspenseful atmosphere for his gradual exhibition of the paranormal, but anticipates the inherent silliness of the ghost story as well. The protagonists are live-in girlfriend/boyfriend Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), the former of whom has had recurring encounters with the otherworldly, and the latter representing the audience as a giggly, playful skeptic. It's Micah's idea to purchase a camera and document the ghostly goings-on (along with some not-so-noble, good-humored alternatives for the bedroom- mounted recording device), and it goes a long way in creating a convincing scenario for the audience.<br/><br/>Watching the couple sleep has a voyeuristic creepiness in and of itself, but the repeated use of a single brilliant angle, almost like CCTV footage, which places the camera over the foot of their bed, with a clear view through the open door into the shadowy hallway, with a digital time readout ticking away into the small hours of the morning, and with the occurrence of exponentially spookier incidents, viewers' eyes are left darting to every dark corner of the frame in taut anticipation.<br/><br/>I don't intend to part with any hard details about the film, as even its trailer can't help but give away a little too much of what is best experienced with a clean palate. The precognition of certain scenes may unwittingly trigger a subconscious calculation of the structure by what has and has yet come to pass, and that sort of spoils it. As for the conclusion, it suffices to say Peli saves his most genuinely frightening moment for last, and again, the more surprises you leave for yourself, the better.<br/><br/>Despite the excessive praise the film has received from the press and bloggers, insofar myself included, there are two minor issues that keep ""Paranormal Activity"" from receiving the fullest extent of my recommendation. First, the film is too long, with tension-killing exposition of relationship minutia that admittedly prevents the scares from growing stale, but wears out its welcome early on. The second is the occasionally questionable performance of Featherston. Neither issue has any serious adverse effect on film's accomplishments, but deserve mention nonetheless.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Paranormal Activity"" is a film that lives up to the hype as long as you don't buy into all the hype. It's a genuinely creepy, crawly little film that will likely disarm you if you're not bracing yourself for it. It's a terrific haunted house spook-out that will probably see wide release in time for Halloween. If not terrifying, ""Paranormal Activity"" settles for shivery fun that'll give you goose bumps. And that's something I haven't gotten from a film in far too long."
"war-8","1","1","2","4 April 2010"," Not terrible but extremely overrated.
","A lot of people, including some of my friends, describe this movie as the ""scariest movie ever"" and the ""greatest horror movie ever made"". I'm a huge horror movie fan and I especially like horror movies about something supernatural/paranormal, be it ghosts, monsters or otherwise. I watch pretty much every horror movie I can get my hands on in the hopes of discovering some hidden gem amongst all the generic slasher crap out there. I'm mostly disappointed and annoyed with all the unoriginal killer-chases-screaming-girl-around-for-90-minutes horror movies that seem very popular to make these days, but sometimes, just sometimes, something good pops up like The Exorcism of Emily Rose or Pandorum and blows me away. Paranormal Activity is not one of them. Unlikable characters played by mediocre actors, all done at a very slow pace and a very low budget. This movie is basically The Exorcist filmed like The Blair Witch Project but a lot more boring, with much worse actors and a shitty ending. It even says thanks to ""the Penasquitos Police Department for providing this footage."" in the opening of the movie, which makes it seem even more like a Blair Witch ripoff. I can't seem to find any part of this movie scary at all. Most of the time you know what's going to happen. It's all been done before and done a lot better. Ghost Hunters is both scarier and more interesting. Paranormal Activity isn't a terrible movie, it's just not a very good movie If you want to see a good horror movie about the paranormal, demons and exorcisms then go watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose. You won't be disappointed. On a scale from 1-10 I would rate this movie at about a 4."

","When this film came out at cinemas i ignored it based on the fact that it seemed a bit simple and thought that these films are never scary, i don't believe in ghosts and if i was caught in a house with one i wouldn't run scared becoz they're only ever a bit of wind that could never cause you any harm. Anyway i rented it and i am so glad that i did. ITS BRILL. I've said Scream is my favourite film of all time but this film is scarier, esp if you let yourself an inch to believe that there are things we still don't have control over, that can't be seen but are there all the same. I'm not very easily scared but some of the stuff is genuinely frightening (i'm 22 and i've seen loads of horrors and never flinch) and it nearly made me want to pull up behind my duvet. The originality and imaginative dialogue from the two main actors gives it even more of a realistic feeling, particularly the guy, micah, who behaved just how you wouldn't expect in a horror film, he confronted the spirit, didn't take it seriously and when the spirit was seemingly in their presence stepped up and confronted the damn thing. Very cool. Must watch for all horror enthusiasts."

"chucknorrisrules","9","1","2","26 March 2010"," A very clever and creative scare-fest.
","Well, Paranormal Activity. This is an interesting film to talk about because I didn't even go because of any hype. In fact, I had never heard of it and only went because I happened to be in London one day and discovered that it was on in a cinema near to where I was. Being better choice than Full Moon, I decided that it was the only decent thing on and went to see.<br/><br/>The general story follows a couple in San Diego, Katie and Micah. Katie has been followed by a ghoulish entity for a long time, and it has inexplicably re-appeared. Micah decides to record the goings-on at night and bravely - but foolishly - tries to see if he can fix the problem. Gradually because of his recordings and attempts to communicate with it, the creature - revealed to be not just a ghost, but a demon, ups the ante and increases it's terrorising actions in the night, until...well you'll have to watch the film.<br/><br/>The film gets a bit boring in between scares, and sometimes you know the demon is coming in the night shots when you hear a slow rumble you know something is going to happen, though some things that happen are scary enough to still freak you out. With only a couple of characters, the acting is far more intense, and unlike many others, you find yourself giving a (beep) about these characters unlike most horror films where they are just meat for the grinder.<br/><br/>The true strengths that this film is built on are not so much what happens, but the ideas that are portrayed, that tap into your primal fears. From something that goes 'bump' in the night, to more extreme noises, violence being done on you while you sleep, being stared at for long periods of time while you sleep, someone you know, love and trust turning on you all of a sudden, and the fact that it happens in an ordinary house like, say, for example, Yours! <br/><br/>Very little is shown until the end - although that largely depends on what ending they show you - and that is what makes it scary. For me, I found that the scariest thing about the movie was that many of the things it showed involved the imaginary night time scenarios that I've always feared in my darkest nightmares!<br/><br/>Of course some people don't find it scary, but it depends on what floats your boat. If you're a gorehound, don't bother because there is almost none, otherwise, take a look! Sleep tight!"
"minimal-3","9","1","2","24 March 2010"," It's The Hype, Stupid
","I learned long ago when a film approaches release and you may have an interest DO NOT READ/LISTEN/ OR WATCH THE HYPE OR REVIEWS. I would rather go into a film knowing NOTHING about it. The more the hype the worse the film. They (producers) want a huge opening weekend. That is all they want out of a U S release. They make all the cash worldwide. This film was made for 200K but has returned an astounding 183 MILLION! That figure may even be without counting rentals and sell through. I have always dug scary films. I found 'Quarantine' on Netflix and was very very surprised by the film. It was a favorite until this one came along. I am glad I watched this film during daylight hours and not just before I went to bed. I would have heard every creek and moan with no sleep.I am susceptible to these type films cause I believe all this stuff does go on. So this film scared the bejesus out of me in my darkened media room (O K, living room). Once I have watched the film I will go back and then see what the reviewers I like thought of the film. To my surprise Ebert loved it. The film had no production values only what it did NOT show us. Plus it was made to look homemade by using video tape. This was a jaw dropping film with some slow spots yet you sort of built opinions about the two actors. The guy was a jackass as his girlfriend suffered. She was on the money and the creepy demonic voice was perfect. i suggest you see ""Antichrist"" by Lars von Tiers if you did not like this and want to step up to a thoughtful well made HORROR film with only two actors."
"kizear","7","1","2","10 March 2010"," A Genuine Scare.
","It takes a true film to scare me witless these days, but somehow this was a film that succeeded. Paranormal Activity centers on a young couple, Katie and Micah, who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home, and that's pretty much it for a storyline as it focuses on the in's and out's of the couple dealing with it. It's fair to say it takes a while to kick in...the first hour deals with Katie mainly complaining during the day but by night things take a different twist, even the most obvious cliché (door slamming shut) is used in a subtle way that you don't see it coming. Without revealing too much, by the last half hour, you will be truly petrified. Superb acting performances come from Katie and no doubt you'll be finding yourself wincing when the scene switches to night mode. As stated before, it takes A lot to scare me but by the time the credits rolled i actually screamed (the whole cinema in fact). The weakness however is simply that it takes too long for the action to kick in, the best parts of the film come from the last half hour so it makes you wonder if it was worth paying £7 for a film that only scared you for a half hour or so, but if you do have the patience believe me it's worth it. To finish, it was by FAR overrated, but if you do like a good scare, i'd definitely recommend but maybe just a rental."

","I just watched this from Netflix and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It is a very very simple movie. It is basically an episode of Ghost Hunters or Ghost Adventures that actually has stuff happen. The characters are fairly likable. I did have issues with the boyfriends stupidity. Egging on the demon, bringing out a weegie board... The night scenes were very creepy and I had a strong sense of dread every time they went to sleep and set up the camera. There is nothing scary looking in this film, it's all noises and mysterious goings on. This kind of scary may not work for you, many may find it lame. But for me, letting myself go, the demonic footsteps creeped me out. If you're one to over analyze or can't get past the fact that'it's not real, that's just a crew member thudding in the hallway' then this isn't something you should see. As I said, very very simple. Bumps in the night. The ending is sudden, I wasn't expecting that to be the ending. Creepy. Fun, simple creeps to be had here."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","2","22 February 2010"," Demon in the House
","The style of execution of 'Paranormal Activity' immediately reminds the viewer of 'The Blair Witch Project'. While this movie doesn't exactly match up to 'Blair Witch', it does come pretty close. Unlike 'Paranormal Activity', 'The Blair Witch Project' leaves a lot open to suggestion. Here the viewer already knows about the presence of some kind of demon. Additionally, while the original ending of 'Paranormal Activity' is more suspenseful, I preferred the alternative ending due to the high chill factor. As a stand alone movie, it does work very well in creating a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere and the jump moments are well timed. The use of a hand-held camera adds to the eeriness of the setup. The special effects are brilliant. Oren Peli has done quite a good job as director and his actress Katie Featherston is impressive. I wasn't around during the hype surrounding 'Paranormal Activity'. I only heard but a few positive things regarding the film and that it was compared to 'Blair Witch' but overall I quite enjoyed it mostly because it succeeds in creating a chilling intense atmosphere."
"kdnor2011","8","1","2","20 February 2010"," Wonderfully Creepy
","I've never heard of a horror franchise in which the first film was the weakest. At least in my opinion, but of all three Paranormal Activities released so far this is my least favorite. That doesn't mean I don't like it, in fact when I first saw it I jumped on the bandwagon of ""this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life."" Now I do know that this movie is very polarizing, and I can see why people hate it so much, but for me, I don't have too many complaints about it.<br/><br/>Yeah, it can be very slow at times, it's not a movie that will continuously try and scare you, it needs build up, and for some people the build up is too long and doesn't pay off enough. Micah, one of the two main characters is...well...kind of an idiot. Throughout the movie you want to just go inside the movie and yell at him to listen to Katie. And the day scenes drag on a litte too long, you want to get to night because that's when things get really interesting. And the characters may explain too much to you, they always look over the footage and watch the scary parts.<br/><br/>This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen in my life. I mean, seriously, any time it turns to night, I begin to get so tense, knowing that these two characters are being watched. And it always leads to a great jump scare. It build gradually, the first few are so small that you may not even realize that something is happening, but then by the last night things just start going so crazy. Katie is a great character, reminding me of myself. If I were in her shoes, that is pretty much how I would act. I like the sense of humor it has so that it isn't completely dread filled. And the ending is fantastic, I've seen the alternate endings, and while they were cool to see, this is the best in my opinion.<br/><br/>This is a love it or hate it movie, and I love it. Yeah it can be slow at times, and Micah is a bit of an idiot. But if you love haunted house movies, or found footage movies, than you owe it to yourself to see this movie."
"DreddMancunian","8","1","2","13 February 2010"," Brilliant minimalist chiller
","This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen at the cinema. As someone who liked The Blair Witch Project, I was happy for more of the same. But this film is a lot scarier. As each night of video taping approaches, I felt myself tensing up in my seat, dreading what might happen, knowing something would. The filmmakers very cleverly amp up the tension each night. The acting delivers just enough to support the story. The director knows what is truly frightening - those surreal moments when reality seems to be suspended - without resorting to the usual CGI overkill or Pirates-of-the-Carribiean-style ghosts jumping out at the camera. This is a terrific lesson in budget film-making that many multi-million dollar movies would do well to take heed from. A very effective fright machine from start to unforgettable finish. Go see it!"
"Danny_G13","8","1","2","4 February 2010"," Psychological horror goes back to basics
","BWP-style chiller horror affects at a deeper and more cerebral level than the likes of Friday 13th.<br/><br/>The hype: Paranormal Activity wasn't released in the UK till late 2009, but the blurb surrounding it was that it was a horror movie on a new level from the more traditional Hollywood fare. Furthermore, there was the 'do not see it alone' warning which only added to the reputation it was gaining.<br/><br/>Shot in a Blair Witch 'real cam' style, Paranormal Activity likewise smoothly passed itself off as a documentary about individuals being caught up in haunting or terrifying environments, and the subsequent danger they found themselves in.<br/><br/>The passage of text at the start strongly implies this is real footage of what happened when a young couple moved into a new house, aware the female protagonist had a history of being haunted. This move was 'an experiment' to lure the entity out and get hard evidence of its presence and a consequent cure.<br/><br/>However, like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity uses simple horror techniques, also seen in the Japanese original of Ring; it's not so much what is on camera which terrifies you, but what isn't.<br/><br/>Much of the fear is left to the imagination - save for a few bumps in the night and the odd special effect, the majority of scares are inside the viewer's head.<br/><br/>And that's the most effective method to really scare the watcher - who wants to see gore all over the place when you can terrify watchers purely by suggestion.<br/><br/>There's also the 'is it or isn't it real' aspect, whereby the viewer, who knows nothing about the movie's origins, half suspects what is happening is real, and really was captured on camera. To this end the acting is more than adequate, and the bumps and sounds (and effects) are extremely effective.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a movie to watch knowing as little about it as possible, and preferably on your own.<br/><br/>It is also the first movie for years to actually scare me, and achieve a 'watching through fingers' moment, for which it earns my respect and praise. And yes, that again was a 'what isn't on the screen, but is in your head' moment.<br/><br/>It's not the best horror you will ever see, but it is a very, very good attempt and deserves praise for its simplicity and effectiveness at what it does.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","First of all my beautiful fiancée put me in the credits...how cool is that? I'm talking about the Blu-Ray release of Paranormal Activity where they allowed fans to write in and they added their names to the credits. Anyways something I'm sure you'll look into. There were some definite extenuating circumstances that made Paranormal Activity a little more like a dud to me. While I enjoyed the basic ideas behind it and some genuinely creepy scenes, and I enjoyed the low quality angle like Blair Witch or Cloverfield. However, I knew, as many did, going in that this wasn't real, they weren't even trying to pretend it was real. Secondly there were three girls in the theater that giggled and screamed and were downright stupid through the whole thing so thank you ladies for ruining my experience. On top of both of those I felt like both stars in the film really weren't giving their all. It felt like they were ""performing"" which takes away from the aspect of this being a true story or all too real or anything like that. It just didn't fit. And finally there was a lot of hype around this movie by the time I saw it. People were raving about it so it probably inadvertently raised my expectations.<br/><br/>Micah Sloat is the doting boyfriend who is also the unbeliever at first. Boy will he get his just come-uppins. Sloat is significantly better than his female counterpart but still doesn't really show off any terrific acting ability. He's new to the big screen so I guess this will likely help a budding acting career. Katie Featherston is his girlfriend and the one being haunted. She was good in some scenes and then other scenes she just came across as really phony. She got some of the creepiest scenes (like simply standing over his side of the bed for hours) but that still didn't really take a lot of effort. The two of them together however are really terrific. They have great chemistry and work well together, lucky for them. I personally would have worked overtime to find the perfect ""psychic"" but instead they found Mark Fredrichs. As the psychic come to try and help the couple which he doesn't...at all...he doesn't even try but rather runs away every time. He doesn't even come across as believable.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to harp on the creation of newcomer Oren Peli because he wrote and directed and the movie made millions, tens of millions and already has a sequel slated (which I will see!) However, the movie was sloppy, and it seemed to win over millions of people but I saw it for more of what it was which was a run of the mill, not strongly performed movie that tries to make you believe in its reality. Now all this being said it takes some talent to completely and utterly send a creepy chill through you by moving a bedroom door and nothing else. But that is one of the creepiest scenes in the movie. Add in that her behavior throughout the film and it will give you some shivers. But don't believe ALL the hype because it isn't the best horror movie of the year, there are zero special effects and all the chills are done cheaply which only work some of the time. Overall you'll end up seeing it because of its popularity but I think you'll see what I saw. Average for what it is. 7/10"
"cyclone259","7","1","2","2 February 2010"," Not the 'rollercoaster ride' of fear shown in the trailers...
","The trailers would lead you to believe that this was a non-stop, scare-a-minute horror film and although it's not, it's still a worthy endeavor.<br/><br/>The problem of course by misleading movie audiences is that those who went expecting this to be more than it was are going to be very disappointed. Thankfully, I didn't buy all the hype and since I didn't drop $10/person to watch it, I was a bit more open minded.<br/><br/>The style of the film will also be turn-off to some, particularly those who don't care for the 'amateur look' with camera shaking, etc. which has been used in The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield to name a few. When done well, it takes it out of the realm of being a professional production and makes it more 'real', but it's not for everyone, especially those prone to being motion sick.<br/><br/>The reason the film worked for me was all of the subtle effects used throughout the production. A lot of the atmosphere was created using only off-camera sound and by what you couldn't see. Even the effects, which were very low key, were quite successful in making my skin crawl a few times.<br/><br/>Although I too love gory movies (especially anything with the undead), I feel it takes a bit more creativity to deliver a scare without a hatchet-wielding psychopath or torture devices used on its hapless victims. The fear in Paranormal Activity is not a physical form like Freddy, Jason, Mike Myers or any numerous horror films and remakes of late, but more by what we don't know or understand.<br/><br/>I'm not going to try to defend this film by those who say it sucked or want to degrade it. That's OK with me, because I can certainly see the talking points against it. What's interesting is that (2) people I know that didn't like it and rented it recently, were occupied doing other things while it was on and weren't paying much attention. Is that good or bad? Was it so boring they lost interest or were they so preoccupied that they didn't play close attention to all the details? All I can say is that worked for me."

Movie starts without any proper introduction it goes straight to a ""footage"" which makes it feels like it is a homemade movie. During a period of 30 minutes you find yourself as you are actually in the house with a couple, you get to know the house and every time something happens you know what camera ""guy"" is going to check which greatly increases the effect of the movie on you. The tension of the movie is glued by a few spooky nights that a couple had and the aftermath of that lead to ever growing tension towards the end which eventually exploded. Wobbly camera has put off many people but if you can accept that you will ""enjoy"" the movie. Beside that the acting was OK meaning that the whole idea is to make it look authentic and as close as possible to what has actually happened but I still got upset by the acting of a main leading actress - if I were her I would probably **** my trousers and do whatever it takes without going into any compromises with my other half. I'm not going into a deep detail of a special effects but for what it's worth I can say that they were quite decent and they haven't spoiled the movie. When things were happening you are kept on the edge of the chair and that is important. All in all I can easily say that this film is the best horror film of 2009 and I'm pretty sure that it will give you chills if you are watching this movie alone in the dark without any interruptions."

","This film took me back to my childhood when I was sometimes allowed to stay up and watch the 'late film'. Everything in this film depends on your imagination, the understanding that what you can't see, what you don't know, is potentially the most horrifying thing you will ever experience. It is not a horror film in the modern sense (modern being the blood/slash/kill/scream films), and I can understand those who will dismiss this film as over-hyped. Now I can sit through the saw/hostel paint by numbers horror/torture porn, appreciate what they have done and have a good nights sleep, but Paranormal Activity played on my mind as I turned out the lights and therefore it has worked. Of course there are moments that don't work, that make you think 'why don't they just...', but there are in every film. The true horror of this film is that it makes you think of what might be lurking outside your bedroom door rather than showing you."
"ozkantoral","8","1","2","28 January 2010"," Orijinal idea
","I do not know why most of the movie fans judge horror films unfairly. They claim that the most of the horror films have a same subject and not very effective, but the demons,genies and spirits are accepted by most of the common religions so producers are choosing these subjects to make films very effective.Paranormal Activity could have a same subject either,but the most important thing with this film is the idea of the ""amateur camera"". I think this makes the film very effective and original. Paranormal became my second favorite horror film. I offer everyone to watch it ,especially for the horror film fans. Note : Watch the film without making a search about film in the Internet."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","2","27 January 2010"," A lesson in doing the most with the least, especially with fear
","I don't necessarily understand the phenomenon that ""Paranormal Activity"" became in the Fall of 2009, especially considering the success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" bringing exposure to the documentary-style and low budget horror/thriller. Yet people demanded this film be shown in their cities and towns and this $15,000 movie grossed more than $100 million. We might never fully understand why, but my hunch is it's partially because filmmaker Oren Peli is able to effectively do what bigger-budget horror filmmakers can with just a fraction of the resources.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" is not all it's cracked up to be, but it's proof again that money is not what makes a good horror movie. You can sink cash into science fiction and action films and that can make them better, but fear is like humor -- it's a part of our brain function, it has no price tag. The pleasure some people get from a scary movie comes with skilled direction; money only dresses it up and allows a filmmaker to execute fear tactics in a different physical context.<br/><br/>The film follows a young couple that has just moved into a new home. The girl, Katie, has had experiences with some supernatural presence much of her life and it has followed them into her new home. Her boyfriend Micah has bought a camera to see if he can get down to the bottom of it and his footage is what we see. Everything takes place in their home (the home of Peli, in fact) and the paranormal events escalate as well as their relationship tension throughout the film.<br/><br/>This premise and screenplay is just head-strong writing. First off, its premise fits its budget. ""Found footage"" film-making is cheap and provides an artistic excuse to make a film that way while also appearing very real. If at any moment in the film you buy into Peli's attempt to make it realistic, then you'll be at least somewhat scared or fascinated with the events.<br/><br/>As far as being scary, Peli's tactics are simple but executed perfectly. Everything is foot-in- the-door -- worked in one scene at a time. A great horror filmmaker knows his audience's expectations and turns them into his or her greatest tool. We learn early that this ""demon"" comes mostly at night and so Micah sets up his camera to record them in bed sleeping, the same shot from the same angle countless times throughout the film, the same sound effect cues to trigger our response that something is going to happen. At first just the door moves, or Katie sleepwalks, but it gets a little more intense each time and spooks you just enough before you ever realize what you've bought into is kind of ridiculous. It's relentless in its ways and yet something you were rolling your eyes at five minutes ago now has your complete attention. Sometimes you're like Micah, just itching for something to happen already and ""Activity"" insists on just creeping forward to the climax. It's a plot ramp, not an arch. <br/><br/>In this way we're tricked into thinking ""Activity"" is a good movie. In reality, though the relationship between Micah and Katie is believable, the way they handle this situation is kind of weird. First of all, I don't know how anyone could sleep let alone 21 nights in a row knowing something was haunting them. There are many times where Katie addresses the camera and you feel that the script is really stretching to make excuses for why its on at pivotal points. And as realistic as the movie feels, there's never a scene beyond the half-hour mark that feels strikingly truthful. It also takes us that long to get our first piece of subtext, that Micah's a bit upset Katie never told him about her haunting experiences before they moved in.<br/><br/>Yet for its many flaws there's a brilliance to the fear in us that ""Paranormal Activity"" preys on. First of all there's the ageless notion of scary things happening at night when we sleep, then there's that blurry line that we all experience in our lives like did the door just move or did the wind blow it shut? How did that end up on the floor. Peli works in these daily oddities and slowly shifts them over to completely abnormal events. It's taking fear where we find it in our everyday lives and exaggerating. That's the effectiveness of ""Paranormal Activity.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"rumbleinthejungle","7","1","2","20 January 2010"," While not quite living up to the hype, it's reassuring to see a film like this in the theatre anyways.
","Just saw this film tonight and had reasonably high expectations. Mostly they were met.<br/><br/>We meet a middle class, happy, seemingly normal West Coast couple at the beginning of the film - Katie and Micah. They live in a very nice house in San Diego and all seems well save for the fact that Micah has just spent a whole bunch of money on video and computer equipment so he can conduct surveillance on the house, particularly while they are sleeping.... As the story unfolds, we learn that Katie has a rather sinister past and appears to have been, and still is, the target of some kind of sinister spirit or presence. A visit from a psychic sheds some light on the situation - he agrees that there is a presence in the house and explains the difference between demons and spirits. He recommends the couple speak to a Demonoligist but Micah is against this. As the nights go by the presence becomes more and more bold in it's actions and some of the scenes, even now in retrospect, are making my hair stand on end.<br/><br/>The good stuff - the acting and actions of the characters are very believable. At the beginning of the film Katie is a happy-go-lucky student and by the end she has very nearly lost her mind. Micah goes from being cocky and (thinking he's) in control of the situation to being inwardly scared but not showing it, and then completely frustrated and ultimately powerless to do anything to help protect the girl he loves. The house goes from being a warm, homely dwelling to something very much like a prison - claustrophobic and cold. The special FX are used sparingly but are very effective in the scenes that they do feature in. The sounds effects are also quite cool.<br/><br/>The bad - a little more background on Katie would have been nice and added another dimension to the proceedings. Also, the reaction of the psychic when he visits a second time was somehow not played as well as it could have been. Minor complaints.<br/><br/>See it if you like to be scared and enjoy getting the adrenaline flowing.<br/><br/>7/10"
"zroproductionz","6","1","2","19 January 2010"," All About Paranormal Activity?
","Paranormal Activity, as many of you know, is solely about a spirit/ghost that is haunting the life of the main character Katie. The plot revolves around Katie and her boyfriend attempting to capture footage of the ""spirit"" inside their house in an attempt to finally solve the mystery that has been surrounding Katie for as long as she can remember.<br/><br/>After finally getting the time to watch this movie, i can say without a doubt that this movie was a bit over-hyped and i believe that due to that fact, the audience now believes that this one of the scariest movies ever created.<br/><br/>With that being said, the movie did take an interesting idea and did a ""decent"" job with what they had to work with. There is a factor that this movie deals with and it is one that i myself have seen occur with many other movies. This movie suffers from something i would prefer to call ""theaterism""(if that was a word). That meaning that this movie falls under the category of being a bit more nerve-racking/terrifying if being viewed in a theater rather than being viewed inside your home in front of a television set. I can instantly see how a good portion of the audience would be terrified of this film while watching it in theaters, along with the surround sound and big screen. But beyond that point, it would be careless if one was to give this film higher than a seven or eight.<br/><br/>This movie, in my point of view, was actually funnier than it was scary. I myself have been a fan of so-called ""horror"" movies and quite frankly, i do not feel that this movie falls under the category of horror. I can say that if you are a fan of movies that have loud noises and make ludicrous attempts at scare tactics, this is the movie for you. However, to say that this is the best horror film of 2009 would be even more ludicrous.<br/><br/>The film had an interesting idea, had some fine points and some not-so-fine points to it. In the end, the film fell flat and it can be said that a good portion of the audience would have probably expected more after watching the first hour or so.<br/><br/>6/10 STARS"

What this movie had was really original and scary. Some sort of spirit (possibly demon) that moves things. AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN YOU SLEEP?! The daytime scenes needed better dialog, but them arguing and not getting along was the point of this movie. Because them arguing and not getting along was making this SPIRIT Happy and making it hungry to kill them. The acting could've been better, but the nighttime scenes were pure genius!

"mrcibubur","4","1","2","20 December 2009"," worst 'horror' movie of the year 2009
","sorry folks, I struggled to finish watching this awful film, the acting by the young couple is third rate at best and overdone, very pretentious indeed. the special effects are non-existent, the script is dire and if it wasn't for the appearance of the psychic a couple of times (the only bit of real acting in the whole episode), no way would you call this a film. It is a shame because like Blair Witch project and Cloverfield, there was actually an opportunity to create something original which would be truly remembered, that opportunity was wasted. Again, another piece of americanism which is the real spoiler. The guy is supposed to be a day trader, so we assume he has brains - when did he ever use them in the movie? did the film really ever explain why this 'thing' was following the girl (Katy) from house to house? Where were their computers, mobile phones, other electronic equipment? The focus was on deliberate intent of creating an abnormal lifestyle for two apparently normal people in order to create in turn abnormality (or paranormal activity). what paranormal activity? I didn't see any during the film at all, it would have been better as a Mel Brooks spoof! First hour was absolute rubbish and the 'recording' (because cant really call this a film) offered some substance of scary moments which caught our attention until the final ending about which I will say nothing. Saw this on DVD, I certainly wouldn't bother watching it in a cinema and if you did, shame on you when you have a wide choice at your local multiplex. Horror for me is like Orphan which makes you watch all the way through and react; my only reactions to this were to nearly turn it off at the hour mark - And to fall asleep just before the end. Only survived to the ending because I wanted to write this report. Every one of us is capable of making a movie like this infinitely better. Katy and her partner were a couple of 'stiffs', there was no true emotional sense between except at the beginning when he greets her on her arrival out of the car. I hear they are making a P A 2012 - is it a doomsday scenario or some sort of screenplay/directors worst nightmare contest/competition? If Mr Spielberg did watch some of this and walk out, thank God for common sense!"

Secondly, people that retarded are scared of a rat in a basement so it's really not that big of a deal. Seriously film makers, if you want to scare someone, put some effort in the script. Read it through a couple of times and think does it make any sense at all? ""Ooh, we have proof that were haunted!"" ""Well, let's still continue to sleep lights out together"" ""Sounds like a good idea!"" When you get to the half of the movie you start to understand the problem. And acting. Well. It was kinda realistic the first half, then the reactions of these two people started to be so ridiculous that it ruined the tension. I really had high hopes after the first twenty minutes but it was short lived excitement.<br/><br/>Lightly scary but does not really stick with you afterward.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch it, watch it alone in the dark to get some kicks out of it.

","This is, for the amount of money spent on its production, a great first effort for a filmmaker. I hope that Oren Peli will go on to make better films, and the success of this feature makes it certain that he will go on to bigger and better things. With that being said, I can truthfully say that I was somewhat disappointed in that the film was really quite predictable. The possession angle could be seen coming for miles- not just with the pictures of the exorcism on the website that the characters view, but also with the footage of Katie sleepwalking. Nothing about the film is really groundbreaking or innovative, although it does induce a pervasive sense of dread that just manages to save it. The characters are very realistic- i.e. two typical suburban American dumb asses. The helplessness exhibited by Katie,in my opinion, makes her actually less sympathetic because she can't stand up to her idiotic boyfriend. Again, a decent beginning- let's see what Peli does next..."

I didn't exactly inquired either - but ""paranormal"" made me think of E.T and alien stuff. So that I can handle. MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat as things progressed. The credibility was amazing, its craft was great - clichÃ© just in the fact that you have a typical stubborn GUY and a scared GIRL (legit, since she had dealt with this kind of ""stuff"" before) But that's part of the overall effect. Her ""transformation"" is awesome, and she really is a great (natural) actress.<br/><br/>It's been a week almost and I still have trouble sleeping. I'm usually never the one to wake up during the night. But now, if I do, forget it. I can't get back to sleep. It's just the type of movie that messes with your head in such a way. I loved the fact that even KNOWING that it was all left to my very own imagination isn't helping, ha ha - I was still scared, although I am telling myself to consciously not be! It takes over your whole being - without any violent, bloody, gory scenes. We are just conditioned to believe that in middle/upper-class suburbia, to a twenty-something year old couple - these kind of things are just NOT supposed to happen. It hits close to home. The shock value is tied in with its environment and its unbelievable relatedness.<br/><br/>So, there! I am a non horror/scary movie lover, yet I am recommending this to everyone!

Then I go and see a film like ""Cloverfield"" which failed so miserably at what they were trying to do I actually wanted to leave the theater in the middle of the showing. So I was a little skeptical going in to see ""Paranormal Activity."" But I went in thinking that since it was an indie film it wouldn't have all the Hollywood nonsense. And I was right. The tension-building in the early parts of the film were very well done, and the character development was great. Well, sort of... Katie Featherston's performance was outstanding, and I found myself feeling very bad for her character as the situation got progressively worse. Micah, on the other hand, annoyed the hell out of me. I really couldn't believe that someone who made as much money on the stock market as he did could be so stupid. He finally started showing some redeeming qualities towards the end, but overall I was kinda glad when he got his comeuppance...<br/><br/>So now the ending... I tell you, the final minute or so pretty much ruined it for me. The bit where she grins evilly into the camera and then makes the demon-face was completely unnecessary and ruined what could have been a brilliant ending. I heard that the ending that made it to theaters wasn't the original, but was one that Spielberg ""suggested."" Well, I can't say that I blame Peli. You don't say no to Stephen Spielberg.

","""Paranormal Activity"" starts off with the two protagonists, Katie and Micah, living a happy life together in a nice home in a pleasant suburban neighborhood. Getting a good night's sleep soon becomes difficult as Katie explains to Micah that something has been haunting her. Shortly after, Micah buys a rather expensive video camera to see if he can catch some sort of video evidence of Katie's haunting. For the first few nights, Micah captures some startling noises and shadows occurring in and around their room. Throughout the day, Micah discusses the events that occurred that night with Katie. As more nights pass, the previously happy couple learn that they are not only being haunted, they are being very closely watched by something more sinister than they ever imagined.<br/><br/>Although saying ""Paranormal Activity"" is the scariest movie of all time may be a bit of an exaggeration, it is certainly a very good movie. True to old Hitchcock movies such as ""Psycho"", ""Paranormal Activity"" relies more on tension and suspense than actual scares. Saying that ""Paranormal Activity"" is the most suspenseful movie of all time may be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Just when you think something scary is going to happen, absolutely nothing happens (sometimes). This is part of the beauty of ""Paranormal Activity."" Oren Peli doesn't need CGI or intestines getting splattered all over the walls to make, for example, my very manly friend cover his eyes.<br/><br/>The acting Katie and Micah (their actual names) is so top notch that it makes you feel as if you are watching a real life couple. This adds to the creepiness of the film. <br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" starts off a little slow, but it eventually picks up pace. Throughout the first half of the movie, there is some really superb character development with some surprisingly funny dialogue. For all you people that want to see a scary movie, fear not, ""Paranormal Activity"" gets very scary, especially within the last 30 minutes.<br/><br/>With a budget less than 15000 dollars and shooting the entire film within a week, Oren Peli has achieved an outstanding accomplishment. Highly recommend. 9/10 Stars"

He does not believe it ( just like most of us ) , and his comments are quire funny ( just like our comments :-) ) Slowly , but surely, we start discovering what it's all about. And the entire movie is shown through their own video camera which is held sometimes by the guy, sometimes by the girl, else it's on the tripod.<br/><br/>This is a definite must-see movie for any horror fans. Even if you are not a fan, you should definitely check this out, because it's a classic.<br/><br/>When we were watching, the entire audience was totally into the movie, and jumping out of their seats at times. Yes , we were scared !!! Since it is shot with a hand-held camera, people who can't stand shaky movies might want to take it easy on this one. You can still see it, because when the camera is on tripod , it is fine. And those are the best moments.<br/><br/>This movie is ten times better than Blair Witch.

Me and my friends would start freaking out every time we heard a noise.<br/><br/>The director brilliantly brings you into an unbearable tension that does not let up until the film ends. And, at the beginning, you may be wondering when it will get scary. I know I did.

","I went to see this movie tonight,and to tell you the truth i thought it was actual footage the entire time. The story was very convincing, yet very realistic. It lacked all of the scary costumes, and Halloween b.s. yet still kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I think what scared me so much, is that this movie could happen to anyone anywhere. I'm a horror fan, yet often times i find movies either over the top, unrealistic, or not entertaining, and not believable. Let me just say that, i do believe in ghosts, as well as demons, and i spend a lot of time watching ghost hunters, paranormal state, and things of that nature. I think if you're a fan of ghosts, or have ever seen one, you'll be a fan of this movie. If you don't believe in that sort of thing, or can't consider ghosts or spirits a possibility than it probably isn't for you. But for me, i felt glued to my seat, as if i couldn't move after it ended, and no movie has ever scared me as much as this one in my entire 22 year old life."

","I watched this movie last night and i have to agree this is without doubt the most frightening movie i have ever seen and i watch lots and lots of scary movies. This one plays on everything that would frighten you about the paranormal.There are many boring bits near start but once this gets going i guarantee you will get so involved you will think its happening to you.A real fright fest for those with a good imagination. Well worth seeing and worth every penny. I highly recommend that you watch this with friends. I watched on my own in the dark and when i went to my bed i could not help thinking about what i had just seen. If your easily scared then DO NOT WATCH ON YOUR OWN"

","This movie is terrifying. At the theater you will probably be jumpy every time night falls. After the movie you will be on edge for a few hours, especially if it is at night. When you try to fall asleep, be prepared to jump at ever creak and crack that your house makes. The movie itself was brilliant in its own right, even if it wasn't scary. Using a completely steady camera you can see everything that happens with no distractions. Whenever the camera goes to its ""night vision"" you will sit on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The acting is also exceptional. The two leads have a great chemistry between them and are very natural. They each react in different ways to the haunting, and the audience member can decide which way he or she would react to the same situation. Overall this was a fantastic movie, but not for the feint of hear. Those who believe in the paranormal will be especially scared,I don't believe in ghosts or demons, and I still was scared by this movie."

","I would highly recommend reading the story behind the making of this film. It is great to see how this has become such a success for something done with a mere $15,000 budget.<br/><br/>The movie was good, but I can't say I got scared until the last 15-20 minutes. That is when it really amped up and scared you. I don't watch many horror movies because 90% of the time they're plot less and stupid. This did have a plot and had some meaning and wasn't focused around gore to make it ""scary."" This was a film that used genuine scare tactics to frighten the viewer and I commend them for this.<br/><br/>The last bit of the movie is worth watching the whole thing because I guarantee you won't expect what is coming.<br/><br/>Also, something else ironic, at the very end, you'll notice them mention a date of October 11th, 2006. It just so happened that I went to see this movie on October 11th, kind of ironic!"
"BookBuffBob","Null","2","7","10 October 2009"," Good payoff ... but at what cost?
","The last ten minutes of this movie may be the creepiest ten minutes of any movie in at least two decades. That being said, ten minutes doesn't make a 99 minute movie a good film. The story was predictable and poorly told, and the first hour and twenty minutes were repetitive and truly boring. I read somewhere that people were walking out of the film because it was so scary, but that's not the case at all. People walked out of the film because it takes much too long to provide any sort of entertainment. I feel sorry for the people who lasted an hour and left, only to miss a very good payoff. I can't recommend spending the $10-$15 to see this film, but once you've sat through that first excruciatingly boring hour, you really need to stay and see the payoff.<br/><br/>I wish the filmmakers would have found a writer who could have build a story and the characters so that the payoff left the audience feeling like they saw a great film, rather than feeling like ""it's about time"". Sure, if you are one to be scared by films, the ending will creep you out. But if you are looking for a lasting horror experience coming from a well made and scary 99 minute horror film, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, the ending was good enough to make me glad I didn't leave, but overall I wish I had seen something else. The sum of the experience is negative. This was a missed opportunity."

","Katie and Micah are a couple who've just moved into a new home. Katie believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home. Micah decides to take control of the situation and sets up a battery of video cameras so that if a spirit manifests itself, he can capture its behavior on tape.<br/><br/>PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a small, little horror movie that is getting a lot of buzz lately similar to BLAIR WITCH ten years ago. Let me start off by saying to not keep your expectations as high as the hype because the hype makes the film out to be the scariest film in the last decade and even the scariest film of all time, which is really ridiculous. Setting your standards based on the hype does the movie injustice. However, saying that, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY IS a good, scary film, which we rarely see in Hollywood these days. Oh, wait. This was PICKED UP by Hollywood. My mistake. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film starts off as if everything is fine which makes the scary scenes much more terrifying.<br/><br/>Hitchcock once said that suspense is the ANTICIPATION leading up to the explosion of a ticking time bomb and the scare is the bomb explosion itself. The former part of that statement describes PARANORMAL ACTIVITY perfectly. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film is all about the build up of fear, starting off very subtle but slowly escalating as the story progresses and by the end, you're almost killed by the tension! No, the movie doesn't rely on cheap gore effects, gratuitous violence, or useless nudity. No, it doesn't rely on CGI or make-up effects. It relies heavily on your sense of imagination, which, ultimately, is the cause of your own fear.<br/><br/>The film also has a real authenticity feel to it, especially the exchange between with actors Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, whom both pull off very fine and realistic performances. Oh, and when you go home after the movie is finished, and when you get in your bed to sleep at night, good luck with that. This film not only makes you afraid of your own home, it effectively strips the securities of where you're suppose to feel the safest in the entire world the most: In your bedroom. A movie that makes you feel this vulnerable probably makes you want to see more of these films...or maybe less.<br/><br/>However, if there's one thing I don't like about the film, it's the ending. The movie builds up so well that the ending ends up feeling very abrupt and so very disappointing because it almost comes out of nowhere. There was no catharsis. But other than that, the film is scary. I'm already starting to feel the after-effects. If a film can manage to scare you and the audience with creaks from a door and footsteps coming from another room, you know the film succeeded. See the movie because I'd rather see an inventive, clever movie like this do well than SAW 57...oh, AND because it's scary."

This upsets the demon and things go downhill from there.<br/><br/>I would say the target audience would be anyone who wants to see horror movie, or have a good scare. The movie is rated ""R"" for language, but that shouldn't discourage viewers from watching this film. After all what horror films aren't rated ""R"". As the main reason for a horror movie is to scare people, this movie does a real good job of that. I can't go into real detail of the film because that would ruin it. GO SEE IT!

"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","8","30 October 2009"," Lives Up to All the Hype
","Paranormal Activity (2007) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>By now everyone knows the story but a couple (Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat) begin to experience paranormal activity in their home so they set up a video camera to try and capture what's going on. As a die-hard horror fan I pay attention to all the news floating around year in and year out. Each and every year fans hype up the latest scary movie but more times than not that hype ends up being nothing more than the build up for a bad movie. That's certainly not the case here. I've had several people tell me this was the scariest film they had ever seen. I had people telling me they saw folks leaving the theater in tears. I had heard just about everything you'd want to hear about a horror movie but the most shocking this is that, even knowing the hype, the movie got under my skin like no other that I can remember seeing. I love a good ghost movie and this here is certainly one of the best. On a ""critic"" proof level the film is probably just a three and a half but the overall impact is quite remarkable and in the end this certainly lives up to the opinion of being one of the scariest films ever made. I'm not going to call out any of the scary sequences as to not ruin them for anyone else but I can think of three that had my blood turning ice cold. The film has been compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which I think is fair because both movies take simple things that can frighten anyone. In this film we get a wide angle view of the bedroom and at first I didn't like this because you never knew where the ""scary"" part was going to happen so you were constantly looking all over the frame to pick up that moment. After a while I realized this was a masterful touch because, like the characters, you never knew where the scary moment was going to happen so by constantly looking around you were just building up the fright level in your head because you had no idea where it was going to come from or what they had in store for you. The performances by Featherston and Sloat were very good to say the least. This type of low budget movie usually doesn't feature this type of performances but it's another plus for the film. Another major miracle is the fact that the filmmakers could do so much with so little, which once again proves that you don't need money to show off talent. As with the previously mentioned hyped movie, I'm sure this one will take a lot of backlash but that's going to happen with any popular movie. For me, the movie worked marvelously well and certainly lived up to everything I had heard about it. Sitting here thinking back on a few of the scenes still gives me goosebumps."

","Just saw Paranormal Activity and it blindsided me with its effectiveness, jolts, sheer terror that I was literally shaking towards the end. To be honest the first couple of scenes didn't impress me and I was thinking great just another overrated The Blair Witch Project but as soon as they put the tripod in their bedroom to film these supposed hauntings while they try to sleep things change from ordinary to truly frightening that will have you grabbing your seat or someones arm in fear and it catapults from there on. I was impressed what they accomplished on such a small budget that puts high budget horror films to shame, Hollywood take note! See it in a packed house on a cold fall night or better yet wait for the DVD and watch it with your girlfriend or boyfriend in your own home and turn off all the lights and get ready to be shakened! Folks forget about The Blair Witch Project this is true terror and it is less shaky! I give kudos to the director and the two leads for displaying believable performances and craft, great job! We all should pat ourselves on the back for demanding this gem of a film and putting our voices out there which lead to a wide release and hope that this opens doors for other deserving films waiting for a release and has yet to be seen, so maybe they will finally release In Memorium a film that seems similar to this one. Overall it lives up to most of the hype but go in with low expectations and appreciate for what it is and what it accomplishes. What it accomplishes is how to build suspense and fear and it did one hell of a job which I can't say about most horror films and horror remakes these days. I rate Paranormal Activity a 4 out of 5! Another thing you need to know is that the less you know about this flick the better so stay away from reviews and let you be the judge and see it already! Hope this one makes a lot of money because I want a sequel! Chilling but not the scariest horror film ever made but close to it!"

","So, is Paranormal Activity any good? The movie was slated to start at 10pm on a Thursday night. On a hunch, I decided to show up at 8:30 just in case there was rush, and ended up being about 75th in line. Yup, lots of people in little college towns like free movies.<br/><br/>Once they let folks in, every seat had a butt in it ""the little movie that could"" (with the help of a healthy dose of marketing acumen from DreamWorks) had sold out the house. The air was abuzz with electricity teenage girls were giddy with nervous excitement teenage boys had their chests puffed out and their swagger on. Everyone was ready for ""an experience"". Would it be a self-fulfilling prophecy? A few trailers for upcoming horror/thriller type movies ran ahead of the film, each one eliciting wild screams and hoots and howls from an audience so adrenalin pumped you'd think we were waiting for a prize fight to start. We could tell this was going to be a crazy night.<br/><br/>When the film finally started (easy to tell, as per the choppy hand held home movie image) the crowd let out a scream as though The Rocky Horror Picture Show was rolling.<br/><br/>And then the next ninety minutes were spent listening to teeny bopper girls squeal and scream and teeny bopper guys yell ""Oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t!"" about every 90 seconds. Now I get it, it's a scary movie, screaming will happen. But seriously, screaming when a character turns out a light? Narrating the film with ""Oh f*ck she just went outside!""? Please. Grow up.<br/><br/>But was it scary? In a word, yes.<br/><br/>In more words, it's very scary. I had anxiety and adrenalin pumping through me like hasn't happened in a long long time. The film does a great job of building tension, of offering cues to impending action in the form of a Jaws-theme-esquire rumbling baseline as something ""paranormal"" is about to happen. It does a great job of developing characters, their relationships, and the destructive effects the growing threats have on them. And it does it all in a way that does probably the best job of any movie employing the ""auto-chronicled narrative conceit"" (yes, I believe I just coined that term, tell a friend) has done to date.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is the movie The Blair Witch Project wanted to be and Cloverfield didn't even try to be.

","I found that ""Paranormal Acivity"" was one of the funniest movies of all time. A movie that stands a chance against it is ""Zombieland."" Even though this film was meant to terrify the population, I found that there was nonstop comedy. Granted, I have a twisted sense of humor and find ""The Exorcist"" hilarious, but nevertheless, this movie was hilarious. I will admit that this movie was intense and extraordinarily frightening, but simultaneously, it was hilarious. I normally do not care for video camera movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" (in which I have not seen) and ""Cloverfield,"" but it was very well done. Question remains whether the events were real, but I definitely give this film a ten out of ten. I also found the reactions of the audience in the theater to add comedy to the movie.

"alexart-1","10","2","9","17 October 2009"," One of the scariest films ever!
","Fear. One of the most essential and loved emotions ever in the movies. Does Paranormal Activity bring the fear? It sure does. Paranormal Activity is one of the rare horror movies that is actually scary and that makes you afraid to sleep. Many horror movies these days fall the way of Sorority Row and the Final Destination series-full of clichés and lacking scary material. In fact, in a day where the horror movie is not actually scary, it is hard to even call it a genre anymore. Paranormal Activity disobeys the standards for the new horror movie genre and brings the old version back with good film-making and great thrills.<br/><br/>This spooky little film starts out easy and almost a comedy. It's about a couple, Katie and Micah (pronounced Meeka), who have been experiencing what they think is a haunting. The two quarrel while remaining hopelessly in love with each other. Micah decides to set up a camera system to appease Katie who is hoping to give Micah a glimpse of a ghost which she believes to be in the house. The heart of the film is its night scenes which depict the couple sleeping in bed while the ghost (it's actually something slightly different) ""attacks"". The film is made in the ""shaky cam"" style, but the camera is not very shaky and audiences concerned about nausea should not be.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity works primarily for the reason that it continually mounts fear. As I said before, the beginning starts out comedy-like, gradually transitions into horror, and then just goes wild. The night scenes are scariest because they prey on one of our most common fears: the unknown predator. The viewer knows what it is that is haunting them, yet they never get even a quick look at what it is that is doing this other than its shadow. The night scenes begin with shutting doors, banging noises, and booming noises in the background. This may not sound like anything new, but after this phase is done, the film just keeps getting stranger. By the end, the film is so scary that the viewer just hopes that there isn't another night scene coming, that everything is going to be okay, that the movie will be over so they won't have to endure any more fear. No, Oren Peli, the director, does not give up. Once you've gotten into his trap of this movie, you can't leave. Peli has made a film so scary that even I, a person who really doesn't get scared by horror movies, might have trouble sleeping for the next few days.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely one to catch in theaters. Part of the fun of the movie seeing the audience's reaction. The film was so scary that during a screening in Montreal, a person fainted and was carted out of the theater by the ambulance. Alright, nothing that exciting happened to me, but yes, the reactions were very interesting. However, it was so scary that one woman sitting behind me kept murmuring to herself ""Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod!"" during the night scenes. Later, the ""ohmygods"" turned into a scream which, at the very end, changed into her crying because she was so scared. Many people didn't have as intense a reaction as this, but almost everyone was gasping when scary things happened. I even found myself gasping at the screen at certain parts, something I have never found myself doing before at a movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Paranormal Activity was made for $11,000. It brings the scares of a $20 million-ish movie. Oren Peli takes the audience and scares them until the very end which is easily one of the most jolting endings to a movie ever. Don't watch the trailers! They spoil the ending! Anyway, Paranormal Activity is one of the scariest movies ever and will definitely spook any horror fan. It's a must see for people who care about movies and even for people just looking for fun. I know that I've never had as much fun watching a movie in theaters before. Paranormal Activity is not only one of the best films of the year, but also one of the most frightening films of all time."

Not so funny to watch alone in the dark. I watched it again yesterday to see if it still had to same effect on me. It didn't. The scares were all worn out and the acting was plain pathetic. But regardless of my subjective point of view I am impressed by what this movie accomplished with it's extremely limited budget. People actually ran out of the movie theaters in fear and it was actually banned in certain countries. The point of any horror movie is to scare the audience, and this movie succeeded to say the least. It didn't age particularly well but for it's time it was somewhat original, despite taking a little too much inspiration from The Blair Witch Project."
"GreyHunter","7","1","3","26 January 2020"," First things first...
","...I will concede that this movie was never going to actually ""scare"" me. While I love horror movies, I simply don't have the sort of mindset (or at least haven't had it since I was 12 and had trouble sleeping after seeing the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"") to find myself viscerally frightened by a movie or TV show. I'm far more likely to be viscerally disgusted -- which is why I won't watch torture porn -- than frightened. So anything I have to say about this movie has to be understood in this context.<br/><br/>Having said that, the first time I watched this movie, 10 years ago, I really did start to get a sense of the tension and dread being built up. Some of the behavior of the characters made little sense (why not go to a public place for the night? or turn on actual lights rather than relying on the camera? or show the evidence to others? or even just decide that inexplicable and deeply unpleasant things happening demand to be taken seriously? looking at you, Micah) and that led to a sense of the director manipulating the audience by cutting off any avenue of escape by preventing the characters from finding relief, which in turn creates a sense of the inevitable. If they never leave their house/yard, at least not that the audience actually witnesses, well, yeah, it's going to feel suffocating and inexorable. That said, I do believe it works. Even if you have to suspend some belief and common sense, the movie accomplishes its goal, and does so with a nicely developing series of escalating phenomena. I can certainly see how people would find it disturbing, and could feel it myself (it wasn't going to scare me but that doesn't mean I'm insensitive to the effect.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the aspects I've mentioned also drag down the rating. It's just too manipulative, too much like cheating. I wanted to love it, because you always want to pull for the guy who makes a movie for $15K and hopes for the best. I liked it, even if I didn't really like the leads (especially Micah, who comes across as a stereotype to keep the movie going, which also feels like cheating, a little) and I do admire the director's combination of real creepiness while exercising a restraint that few horror directors seem to be capable of. My rewatch has left me with the same opinion as my original watch, so I feel comfortable in the consistency of my reactions to the movie as a whole/"

I so wanted the movie to be good that I found myself rooting for it (the way I watch Donald Trump being interviewed by Bill O'Reilly and I hope that Trump will be less of a bloviating jackass, but it never happens). <br/><br/>I felt disoriented because I was tracking every frame of the film for something, anything that would add to the tension. Sure, the movie was tense, somewhat suspenseful, but it never lit off, caught fire, made me want to turn away the way The Exorcist or Signs did. <br/><br/>I knew I was in trouble when all I could think about was how blessedly, believably down-to-earthedly wholesomely, curvy-sexy Katie Featherston was. She is such a lovely young woman, with a knack for causing viewers to suspend their disbelief, and I caught myself thinking that, if I were 24, this would be the girl I would want to woo.<br/><br/>Her costar, Micah something (notice how I can't remember his name?) is so annoying and self-absorbed, that the action unfolds with the viewer (me) becoming nicely embedded in the story.

","This movie was just awful. And sadly, it being awful had nothing to do with any of the Paranormal stuff going on. It was the main character's reactions to the paranormal activity that made it increasingly more and more annoying the further in you go (if you do indeed, make it far). <br/><br/>Basically there's this guy who thinks it will be a brilliant idea to buy a camera so he can study paranormal activity while he's sleeping. As more and more activity starts to show up, he becomes more and more intrigued by it, while his wife is scared out of her mind.<br/><br/>The real annoying part is that 90% of the time, the main character is all cocky and reassuring, as if he's fearless. Then every time he actually hears a noise, he whimpers out, ""What was that?"", as if it's the first time anything strange is happening. It happens like 4 or 5 separate times throughout the movie, and trust me, it is UNBEARABLE. <br/><br/>When nothing weird is happening throughout the movie it is thoroughly explained through this character exactly what the paranormal stuff is. So when time and time again he reacts as if it's some huge surprise, as if he's always hearing it for the first time, it just doesn't work at all. It's insulting to the audience. I feel personally insulted by how bad the acting was from the main character in this movie. That's how bad the writing/acting was. That's how bad it was."

"Fishman1966","3","1","3","13 April 2011"," Oh, to have my 86 minutes back
","I should probably say at the outset that I rented PA1 and PA2 last night and watched them back to back, in the dark, alone, no lights on in the entire house, curtain drawn (it didn't help). The 3 or was it 4 ""scary"" scenes were overshadowed by the total idiocy of the characters in the rest of the movie. All I can say is, why WHY WHY do I keep expecting something out of these hand-held camera fiascoes? I was incredibly disappointed with Blair Witch and should have expected the same from this. Micah was a total ""jackwagon"" who thought he knew everything about everything and could ""fix this,"" but at the same time wasn't willing to admit that anything was actually going on (great attitude to have when trying to fight an unseen entity (be it a demon or a tsetse fly) and to top it off Katie just sat there and took it. I loved the psychic who came and said, ""I don't think leaving will help"" so they just accepted that. Even after the demon started leaving footprints they didn't even consider it? Who are these people? And then, SPOILER AHEAD, after she's bitten, Micah says, OK, I'll get a hotel, Katie changes her mind and he goes along? I'm sorry she just was bitten by an unseen something, I would have been carrying her out (kicking and screaming if necessary). Someone wrote that ""it was original"" THIS IS TRUE, but the downtime scenes were as bad as Blair Witch (although there was less screaming the F-word at the top of their lungs). Jaws taught us not to swim in the ocean, PA taught me that if you're in a TOTALLY dysfunctional relationship and paranormal stuff starts happening, get out real quick because your significant other is going to just belittle you at every turn and be of absolutely no actual help."

","I am a person who believes in the paranormal and when i saw it, it was incredibly good and terrifying. <br/><br/>I thought this film was original and had a great storyline as the plot is about a couple called Katie and Micah who think they are haunted by a ghost/demon in their house so they film it with a video camera to film the evidence of the demon's presence and the couple's reactions towards the presence. <br/><br/>Out of some horror films (like the Saw films) i have watched in the past don't normally frighten me or affect me in any way. Paranormal Activity is the film that has given me a fright of my life and affected me in some ways. And it was the first ever horror film that i actually screamed at in sheer terror. It was full of suspense and it made me curious to find out what was going to happen next. <br/><br/>Katie and Micah gave a extraordinary performance as they make it look so realistic that you will experience what they are going through and you will feel the exact emotions that they are going through as well. Also, it is impossible to escape the film's sheer & visceral sense of dread.<br/><br/>The night scenes were good. Examples include: Night 13 is proper freaky when the demon writes on the Ouija board and it sets on fire. I thought that Night 20 was really scary and i thought that was the scariest scene of the entire film. I could feel the emotion and terror when Katie was dragged out of the room and what happened when Micah left the room till they came back in.<br/><br/>I was also holding my friend's hand while watching it and i was proper shaking when i came out of the theatre which was a first for me. <br/><br/>Also, I couldn't sleep with the lights off as i was really scared and i think everyone will say the same thing. <br/><br/>If anyone is planning to watch this film on DVD or anywhere else, you will have to prepare yourself and steady your nerves as you will feel the terror for yourself."
"paul-dickinson","9","1","3","26 August 2010"," Believable and Beautiful
","Having been a fan of the Blair Witch Project since its release I was very excited to see this movie. After watching it, one thing struck me. All the critics who said its just the same as Blair Witch, or a rip off, or trying to be Blair Witch are wrong. Two similarities occur, a hand held camera and there's humans in it. Get over it! If this is the case then every movie in the world that uses standard film cameras are trying to rip off one another. Beautifully written with a brilliant cast of unknowns, this film really does hit you hard. You never see the 'demon' but the director flirts with the imagination of what it actually looks like and what its mission is. The less detail, the better. Now I'm a 22 year old who used to be scared of horror films and refused to watch them. But then I grew up and wasn't really scared no more. Having watched this once in the company of my girlfriend I found it fascinating and wanted to view it again. So, the next night, I did. But my girlfriend fell asleep after a hard days work. So I turned it off because it became to scary to watch. The only fault I have with this film is that it took 2 years for it to become bigger. Also, I'm not to sure about a sequel, because the irony is I don't want it to end up like Blair Witch 2: The Book of Shadows.<br/><br/>If there's a shadow on my door, I wont sleep."
"p-stepien","8","1","3","24 August 2010"," Had trouble sleeping...
","Yes. I had trouble sleeping after this movie. And that says it all. Although we had almost no real scares in this movie and more of what was happening was in you imagination than anywhere else the film itself creeps you out with noises, situations and the fact that it basically delves into the primordial fear of the dark, which almost every child has. And the memory of this persists making well made ghost or demon movies much more frightening than any gorno movies.<br/><br/>Shot entirely on a HD semiprofessional camera, which is either wielded by one of the two main characters of the movie or is shooting whilst on a tripod set in the bedroom. The plot is sinisterly simple - a couple haunted at night by weird noises and small unexplainable occurrences decide to purchase a camera to film what is going on at night...<br/><br/>I must say that in terms of general impact I haven't had my childhood fears so well triggered since watching ""The Exorcist"". Which is saying a lot. I must also congratulate the two main actors who always feel sincere and real to the bone. That adds an additional punch of reality, which helps you forget you are watching a movie.<br/><br/>The end scene apparently sticked on by Paramount Pictures after they purchased the movie and as such it seems too clichéd and banal in comparison with the rest of the movie. The two alternate original endings are much better."
"mikeisitt","8","1","3","24 July 2010"," They don't make horror movies like this anymore!
","This is simply a great movie. But it's something nobody understands anymore.<br/><br/>Today, people don't appreciate what true horror is anymore. Today movie makers take brilliant, timeless classics and squeeze all the juice out of them. Then they make them into remakes with popular actors, special effects and loud noises and expect it to be suspenseful. The prime culprit of this crime against horror is Michael Bay (A Nightmare on Elm Street).<br/><br/>However, Paranormal Activity is suspenseful by actually working to make it scary and has a very low budget, and most important of all, it isn't made by Michael Bay or some other idiot.<br/><br/>The story is about a young couple who has just moved to a house in the suburban parts of San Diego. The girl, Katie, has been haunted by a demonic presence since she was 8. the guy, Micha, is obsessed with carrying around a camera to record his, and Katie's life. When things begin to go very weird overnight, the couple set up the camera in the bedroom to record what happens when they sleep. Sounds pretty creepy, right? Well you'll have to find out what happens by watching it for yourself.<br/><br/>To summarise, don't deny yourself the opportunity to see this. If you're a true horror fan you won't regret it. This may be the first horror to actually scare anyone in a very long time."
"TheClockwyze","7","1","3","24 June 2010"," Don't Watch It Alone.....Seriously
","Alright so I just got done watching Paranormal Activity and I gotta tell you it scared the hell out of me. Oren Peli this out of the blue director creates a mockumentary based on the fiction events that took place in the home of Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. He does a terrific job and it somehow gets into the hands of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg works his magic and in a couple of years boom! its on the big screen.<br/><br/>Micah Sloat and Katie Featherson are a happy couple living in a modern suburban home. As days pass they become disturbed by an unknown presence. They put a video camera in their bedroom to see what happens when they sleep. And the rest is too disturbing to describe.<br/><br/>To think that this movie was shot in a couple of weeks is amazing and how great it looks for a low budget movie. This movie continues the generation of mockumentary movies such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfeld. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and even though you might not want to watch it you have to because you want to see what happens. The ending is disturbing and riveting just as you would expect it to be and a little scarier. Another thing is that it is way More terrifying in theaters because all the lights are off the screen is huge and the volume is blasting. Unlike in your home where every light is turned on and your hugging a teddy bear as tight as you can. If you want a challenge try seeing this movie alone with all the lights off the volume at 100 and the TV 2 feet from your face. Seriously if you haven't seen this movie what are you doing here reading my review go out there and watch it because I don't say this to lightly IT IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN. Remember don't watch it alone ......seriously."
"cute_babyhamster","8","1","3","6 June 2010"," Paranormal Activity
","I remember when the movie was released on Friday night but i went to see it on Sunday because one of my friend told me it was the most scariest movie ever and she couldn't go sleep on that night. Also , i saw the trailer and the audience's reaction seems like they were scared so i was excited to go see it. Also my sister told me the end freaked her out and it was the most creepiest she ever had seen in her whole life. So then my friend and i went to see it together , for first 30 minutes was boring but i laughed a couple time. It was like lurking you into it , and made you feel like you are inside the movie like you are the camera man. On first night , when the sound was coming from downstair i was getting all excited but nothing happened so i thought this movie would suck. Until few night later where the part when the demon crashed in the living room which made me screamed for my very first time. I've seen all scary movies and i only got startled a few time. Also , some parts scared me so badly because of the sounds so the sounds are the only one that scares people.<br/><br/>THE REASON WHY ONLY FEW PEOPLE GET SCARED? because , there was a time by the corner when micah put in the corner of room at night time. Like 3:00AM , so people was so focused on that a lot. And it makes their heart beat races faster , when the seconds goes by then POOF , demon shows up. Then the audience turn their focus on the screen again because for first 30 seconds , it was quiet then all suddenly it's loud. Such as in the end , people's heart was beating so fast and hard and they was waiting for something then , something came up and made them jump out of the seat. So did i.<br/><br/>THE REASON WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYS THIS IS WORST MOVIE EVER ? because , they was probably not really focused into this like if people loves paranormal then they would be INTO this and then they get scared, just like me. So a lot of people aren't interested into paranormal / ghosts. Or , because of some rude people behide you says something bad or funny then it makes movie sounds stupid . Then they ruined the movie for you . If that's not reason , then don't get me wrong .<br/><br/>MY REACTION AFTER THIS MOVIE ? i was not able to sleep for a week. I was afraid that demon would drag me just like he did in the movie. i was afraid that he would whisper in my ears. i was afraid that maybe a member of my family would stand by me for hours. i was afraid i would be sleepwalking too. After few weeks later , everything cooled down. Now i'm fine and i'm not scared anymore. But i would never forgot this moment , it was the most scariest thing that has happened to me in my whole life. Oh don't get mad but I think The Blair Witch Project was not that good. I saw it , then i fell asleep halfway the movie but the ending was quiet good, it surprised me but i could say that Paranormal Activity's ending was way better. I was shaking like crazy after that.<br/><br/>All of you guys who don't think this movie was good. Just don't call me crazy just because i think this movie was the scariest, it really was. Maybe you guys are just different like other of my friends but i'm one of 4 people who thinks this movie was scary.<br/><br/>Also , all gore and stuff in other movies are getting old. Can't someone make movies like this ? <br/><br/><ul><li>For people who was involved into this movie project did a good job, it really was. It was one big scare, it was worth it. I hope you can do better on Paranormal Activity 2, try something more scarier so it will make us not sleep for more than one week. It would be fun for me ;D</li></ul>"
"ThatGuyGus","6","1","3","23 April 2010"," Doesn't live up to it's hype, but still a good thriller.
","I liked this film, I speak for everyone when I say that I would of liked it more if it Wasn't overrated. <br/><br/>When I saw the Trailer I saw some comments, calling it ""The Scariest movie of all time."" when I was like no way. I also heard about the ""Demand it"" thing on its website, I thought this movie was going to be the return of the Exorcist,so I was really looking forward to it. The day it came out, was on my birthday, so I thought that was a little weired,I tried watching it but it was sold out. The next day everyone at my school was talking about how scary it was,they did mention some girl getting dragged, so I just pictured in my mind some girl getting dragged to a red hole, that was hell, so now I REALLY wanted to see it, that day I skipped my 4th period class to see it, & I was really disappointed,I was expecting something like the devil just coming out from the ground,or something ""Paranormal"" like a dog getting skinned, or something like that.<br/><br/>Overall this film could of been better if it Didn't consider itself the ""Scariest horror film of all time"" because thats basically just sticking the middle finger to Alien,The Shining, The Descent, The Six Sense, or even Night of the living dead. <br/><br/>Still a good movie, just Hated the hype for it"

"cadillac20","8","1","3","30 March 2010"," Proves you don't need millions of dollars to make a great film
","It makes me happy to see a film of this sort get such an audience. This is what a film should be about. Not huge effects. Not millions of dollars. Not big names and huge studio backing. It should be about effective film-making. And that's exactly what Paranormal Activity does right. <br/><br/>What worked most effectively for me was the sense of dread that permeates throughout. The film has an incredible use of negative space. You constantly feel as thought something horrible is going to happen. Most of this occurs while the couple is sleeping. Unfortunately, the dread over shadows what DOES happen most of the time, which typically involves some minor incident involving a noise or a door. There are a few disturbing scenes involving some sleepwalking. But the majority of what makes the film so effective is the fact that nothing happens. <br/><br/>That being said, the film loses its steam a bit when dealing with the ""real"" issues, such as the couple bickering and such. It bothered me that the bf would continue to record despite the pleas of his gf. I would think any other dope would turn it off. It does add some drama to what is happening, but otherwise distracts. Certainly the use of a camcorder is effective, but the film quality was a little too good for me. Surprisingly, I think a less quality camera here would have been more effective, as the home made film quality would have been upped. <br/><br/>Luckily, the film sticks to what works well here, and that is its minimalist approach. By not showing a whole lot, we get a whole lot of dread and creepiness. It's something the filmmakers seem to know very well and it definitely pays off."
"www-jats","9","1","3","28 March 2010"," Frcking scary
","A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.<br/><br/>I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a Teri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theater, only heightened my enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>The audience I went with, all had a collective ""Oh My God"". I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theater holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.<br/><br/>Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice.<br/><br/>Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialog, the ease the tension.<br/><br/>The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen."
"TOMASBBloodhound","6","1","3","28 March 2010"," Over-hyped, but effective at its core.
","I'm not going to sit here and claim that there is nothing frightening about Paranormal Activity. It is essentially a scary little movie that will provide some chills. Its main drawback is the feeling you've seen it before. Only out in the woods. Paranormal Activity is just too much like the Blair Witch Project to truly stand out on its own. It is another series of episodes filmed on a microscopic budget and meant to look like it really happened to the people filming it. Of course you know this going in. You know that it isn't real. So why use the same gimmick? Well, to make money I guess. Both films have made a mint.<br/><br/>The film details a yuppie boyfriend/girlfriend couple in San Diego attempting to film possibly weird goings on that the young woman claim have been happening to her since age 8. The young man buys a large camera and begins filming virtually everything that goes on in their home. He's a ""day trader"" we learn. I guess they have a lot of spare time on their hands. The house is modest, and very clean and free of clutter. It looks like a tiny house that has been scrubbed and polished for an episode of MTV Cribs. Not a spec of dirt anywhere... until one scene where the guy spreads a bunch of baby powder on the floor to see if anyone/anything walks across it. The couple banter back and forth as couples do, and since they really aren't required to act anything other than frightened, it really doesn't matter that they aren't the most interesting of people.<br/><br/>During the evenings, as the couple sleeps, the video camera set up at the foot of their bed records some odd sights and sounds. Something keeps walking up their stairs which end right outside their bedroom door. Sometimes the door will swing open and shut for a moment. The fact that these two continually sleep with an opened bedroom door, even after things get really ugly, strains all credulity. So does the fact that anyone faced with this kind of situation in real life would be too frightened to keep filming. (Same for Blair Witch) Eventually, the fact that they stay there at all leaves one scratching their head. But are the events we witness and experience along with them frightening? Yes. Most of the time they are. I was on pins and needles waiting to see who/what was going to walk up those steps at the end. And both endings worked. Give this film a try. If nothing else, it will give your girlfriend a reason to hold on tight to you. And isn't that the best part about scary movies? Well, for some people. 6 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

I couldn't see wasting money on a film that cost so little. Thankfully my sister actually paid to see it and she told me that there was nothing scary in the film and that I should wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>I heard all the accolades, all the praise. Scariest Movie of all time. Big talk. Empty talk. The film is not scary at all. It's boring as hell. It does feature something quite common among horror movies these days, unlikable characters. What is it with movies like that, and in horror films? I'm far more likely to be scared if I'm sympathetic to a character. Instead in Paranormal Activity I didn't care what happened. I really do laugh at all the people who say they were scared. I simply can't imagine why. Like the Blair Witch Project this was all hype with zero payoff."

Unless you're between the ages of 6 and 17, you wont find much in this movie to make it worth your time. I can no longer stand movies where the lead characters make the dumbest mistakes - or are slow to realize things that the everyday donut would see right away. When the movie ended, I felt like the boyfriend got his just desserts and I wished the girl ended up going down a similar route. I turned to the wife and said these two are perfect for each other - he's an idiot and she's a moron - match made in heaven.<br/><br/>This movie hangs too much on the ""jump frights"" that were mastered back in the 1980s - hell, the 1930s even. Beyond that, there is very little to actually ""see"". Though there are cameras places all over the house, the boyfriend seems to only dissect the angle that we as viewers have already witnessed. These two are too dumb to call the experts until its too late. They're too dumb to ask Jeeves or Google for information early on. The information they do eventually find is useless. Why don't they lock/close their bedroom door? Why not move in with the girlfriends friend for a time? Why not stay at a hotel for the week? These two think nothing logically and almost dare the ending to come to pass. The alternate ending is no better - just there for the ""gosh!"" factor. One of the worst hand-held movies out there.<br/><br/>I really don't understand what all the hype was about. At 80 minutes long, you people should ask for your money back.<br/><br/>But alas, you'll leave this movie wishing you could haunt these people yourself - and do worse to them by morning.

","I saw paranormal activity because everyone was talking about it yet I still had no idea what it was about other then 'ghost'. When I saw the previews I was semi-excited because it has been a while since a film touching the subject of paranormal or unexplainable activities sense the completely stupid, waste of time and money movie White Noise. I really liked that the movie was filmed with a realistic feel (Blair Witch style) in that all the video taping came from the boyfriend, it overall made the movie feel more real and personal. I as well like that the couple were not well known actors adding to the realistic feel of the film.<br/><br/>I overall thought the film was boring. I know that certain scenes were there so the audience can relate to the characters but maybe it is just me but I don't care about any of that stuff, I just want to get into it.<br/><br/>I think by the girlfriend having paranormal experiences since she was 8 was a pointless 'filler' and it would have been better if the 'demon' 'ghost' thing had some sort of attachment to the house rather then the girl.<br/><br/>The whole picture in the attic and flour footprints took away a lot of the scare factor for me because I thought it was just dumb. I've never heard or read about a story coming close to their experiences making it very unlikely for me. The whole thing with the Ouiji board could have been amazing, especially after a lot of things I've learned about Ouiji boards by just researching and reading things online but all that was thrown out the window when it was randomly set on fire and in carved with some message, that was pointless.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie were scary but no where near where I couldn't fall asleep. I gave the movie a 7 because of the unpredictability. I really appreciate that in horror films today because a lot of them are just carbon copies, the same storyline done over and over again. This film was definitely original and I recommend it."
"zero102947","9","1","3","21 January 2010"," Excellent Movie
","Well I will have to disagree with ""Claudio Carvalho"" on this movie. He is so busy breaking down and looking so deep into the movie that he didn't take the time to just watch it and enjoy it. Just like the Blair Witch Project, which I loved when that came out also, I love this movie. This movie really shows how the average person could deal with a ""paranormal"" event. Unlike other paranormal movies, this movie gives a view as if you were there behind the video camera. Now I admit I am not the biggest fan of First Person Filming, such as ""Cloverfield"" etc. But this movie didn't make me feel like I am on a roller coaster. I can see what I want to see and that is what makes this movie good. So before anyone goes bashing on ""How anyone could be scared by this movie"" just remember to relax and watch the movie and just watch it, Don't break it down like a damn science experiment. Its just a movie, made for enjoyment. Relax, and watch."
"wynkerts","8","1","3","18 January 2010"," Step into the theater late - like 1 hour after the start.
","Yes, there's been a lot of hype for Paranormal Activity, and that brought me in too. The movie is best watched in a theater, and at night, and with an audience that knows to shut up.<br/><br/>And then go home to try and resist imagining the same things happening in your house. Oh you will imagine - just about the time you turn off the lights before trying to sleep. And then you'll turn them on again. It's very very difficult to shake off PA when home.<br/><br/>That said, I recommend this, and save prospective viewers a lot of time: 1.- Go into the theater an hour after the show starts. Until then, pretty much nothing happens(Now that everyone kinda knows about the story,the couple and the presence in their house - catching up is no problem) 2.- Take a few minutes to get a feel for the situation on screen, and 3.-Focus from the time she wakes up, goes over to his side of the bed, and stares at him for a couple hours. This is like 2 minutes before the film ends.<br/><br/>That's all there is in this movie. The last 2.5 minutes of PA will make the impact that everyone's raving about. Save the first hour for anything else you have planned, outside the theater.<br/><br/>Trust me. :)"
"freedumb2003","1","1","3","17 January 2010"," The Bedroom Witch Project from Cloverfield
","I can only add to what everyone else said. This is a riff on the (then) original Blair Witch Project, seen from the bedroom of an unmarried couple, where the girl is such a ditz she can't even get him to commit after (we learn) 3 years. <br/><br/>The guy is supposedly a ""day trader"" -- anyone named a single ""day trader"" can't afford a room at the YMCA, much less a 4 (4!) bedroom house with a pool (why does a single guy buy a 4-BR house?)<br/><br/>The ""hauntings"" are so predictable and NOT scary, it isn't even funny. The fact they progress (sound like any shaky-cam movies you have seen, anyone? anyone?) from sounds to stuff moving to direct assault comes to no surprise to anyone.<br/><br/>Since this is set in 2006, any particular reason these idiots don't call TAPS from Ghost Hunters?? Even Most Haunted from across the pond would RUSH their British butts across the pond to see what would essentially be the Holy Grail of paranormal investigation.<br/><br/>Oh, did I forget to mention that all that is 10% of the movie and the rest is them unconvincingly arguing with each other?<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>1) People we don't care (in fact soon dislike) about get into a jam<br/><br/>2) People who are clearly stupid get into a jam and don't avail themselves of any help<br/><br/>3) Predictable escalating haunts <br/><br/>4) 90% of movie is meaningless filler <br/><br/>5) VERY unsatisfying payoff (regular ending or extra crispy -- take your pick)."
"whispersnwits","3","1","3","16 January 2010"," Do I feel scared? Hell!! No!!
","I am just back home from the theater and do i feel scared? Its almost midnight and I have just watched a film that claims itself ""the scariest ever""!! Do I Feel Scared????<br/><br/>HELL!! NO!!<br/><br/>The movie is a videography by a couple, documenting the paranormal incidents happening to them. Everything is shown from the eye of the camera which the couple try to wield through their so called ""horrifying"" experiences. The movie is simple - an invisible demon starts intruding into the personal space between the couple, takes possession of the girl and kills the boy. And as in most movies, the act of trying to scare the audience is through loud thuds and screams.<br/><br/>The reasons i am not scared / did not get scared - The screenplay was not so good as to make me feel the way, either of the characters felt. The ""thuds"" and ""screams"" were very few and the visuals were not so scary too! And also, may be, the presence of a whole theater full of audience around me made me feel comfortable enough.<br/><br/>So, if you really wanna watch this movie, i recommend you watch it at your home, in middle of the night, and with little or no company. That may possibly create the necessary ""feel""."
"mark-whait","7","1","3","16 January 2010"," A chiller that delivers
","Whether this movie can inspire after repeat viewings remains to be seen, but the intention to scare the audience witless is clearly successful, and it is no surprise that this low-budget chiller became a runaway hit. If, like me, you saw the 'obvious' scenes coming, you may not be afraid to turn out the lights at bedtime, but that still won't mean you will be any less impressed at a very well thought out movie. Comparisons with The Blair Witch Project will be inevitable and numerous, but the impact is no less for that. There are three key scenes of sheer terror, and the old Hitchcockian values of 'what you IMAGINE happens off the screen is infinitely more harrowing than what you see ON it' gives the film a massive edge. The movie also won't get away from the 'what the hell are they still sleeping in that bedroom for' scenario, but this is still a worthy hit, and will be one of the most talked about movies of the last decade and beyond."

","No matter what do not believe the good reviews. If u are curious, let it play in the background while you clean the room or pay your bills. But it is not even worth you watching it to see if something happens. If u can get it for free, you can fast forward thru the whole thing to see there is NOTHING to watch. And, do not be the one who suggests watching this waste. Your significant other will be pestering you. My hubby actually rented it, but I kept on telling him to watch it. He was so annoyed. You will hate the characters. The effects are laughable. By the time the demon scratched the guys photo, I was laughing at what a simpleton the director must be. Gee, three claw marks scratched through the photo of the hero. No hidden meaning, no layers. Just base level crap. This is a horror film with special effects and dialogue on par with a porno. OMG don't fall for it. My hubby and I were cheering for the couple to be killed! We wanted the guy to die so bad. We laughed when she was dragged out of bed. My husband was so frustrated with the fact that the hero is a day trader and had the intelligence of a 3 year old. But, a three year old could come up with a better way to escape a demon. This movie is the creation of a non-creative type who wanted to make money."

But this movie is exception because I'm must say it's way too popular this days and I had a feel that I must react somehow. On the cover of movie we can see tag lines like 'scariest movie of the year or decade'. I think it's a too funny or some sort of commercial trick.<br/><br/>This movie is only scary for the population under the age of 14 or 16, or if you never watched horror movie or just a few ones, or maybe because you're are too sensitive or fearful. The similar movies like Blair Witch project, Rec, Quarantine etc are hundred times scarier and better. Even the you-tube videos about paranormal things are way too scarier than this.<br/><br/>If you're always hated the stupid paranormal videos from you tube and was angry about your wasting a couple of minutes of your life, then this movie will totally irritate and you will have a will to kill someone. I watched this with no expectation of effects, action, deep screenplay and other things. All I wanted and expecting was a just a little creepy atmosphere and dozen of chilling scenes. The most shocking thing about this movie was a just a huge IMDb rating. Maybe this sounds funny but it was true.<br/><br/>Movie timing is around an 90 minutes, only 2 minutes at total was scary, like dragging girl body from the bed or footsteps of the ghost or what there was.There's some very confusing and unconvincing things in this movie.<br/><br/>After the ghost attacked and wounded a girl (I forgot her name because she was such a bad role), male character rejecting for call help. Oh my god, is he retarded or what? He really thinks that demon or ghost will just passed away and leave them. Not forget mention that dialogs are bored and scenes are too repetitive and there's no tension in it. You just watching when this movie finally finish to see what is whole point of this video. This is not movie in particular, it's just a long video stuff.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all people who don't care about waste of their time. Maybe you will enjoy this but I think you are the same as the guy in the movie. I didn't like Blair Witch Project either, but now I fell it's a masterpiece compare to this. Avoid this movie, go and see the trailer and you see it all there is. Cheers."
"hprashantarora","9","1","3","29 December 2009"," Scary in a Non-Hollywood way!
","I must admit that I have been watching horror movies (gory or not) even before I was allowed to watch any of them, and Paranormal Activity is definitely the scariest movie I have seen after The Exorcist and The Grudge. As one of the reviewer pointed it out - you have to watch this one with the right frame of mind. I enjoyed this movie solely based on the fact that it has some element of originality which, in the era of pointless remakes (who in his right mind would want to make a remake of Psycho?), is highly sought after.<br/><br/>This film is a testament to the fact that you don't need a multi-million dollar budget with gallons of fake blood to make an effective horror movie. Little known actors, a tight script, and some imagination is all that is needed to stimulate the senses. So, watch this movie with your closest friend, spouse, girlfriend or alone - in the dark.<br/><br/>Not convinced? Get a load of this- I saw this movie in theater with my mother-in-law who speaks broken English and does not watch English movies without subtitles. She too was badly shaken by this and admonished me for making her see something that will give her nightmares. Enjoy!"

"craigy101","8","1","3","27 November 2009"," This ain't no Amityville Horror. Not by a long shot.
","I'll start this by saying that Paranormal Activity is one movie that will stay with you after you leave the cinema. It is not often that this is true, but this film taps into such a core human fear that most of you will struggle to shake it.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a couple purchasing a (oddly large) video camera in an attempt to catch some strange going ons that have apparently been occurring in the house.<br/><br/>The films starts slowly, with not much occurring in the first 30 or 40 minutes, other than some occasionally humorous banter between the two leads. However the slow start is more than made up when paranormal occurrences start to intensify.<br/><br/>The film escapes the common ""why don't you get the hell outta there"" criticism of the haunted house genre by creating a rather convenient and weak back story of the ghost following the female lead, as opposed to haunting a specific house - however this just about works and on hindsight the film is better for it.<br/><br/>The last 40 minutes of the film achieves something that many supernatural thrillers fail to do - it creates a genuine sense of dread. It works on many levels and looking at two people sleep or staring at an empty room has never been so terrifying. I watched it at a packed theater, and every time the sleeping scenes begin, you could feel the impending sense of fear in the air.<br/><br/>Special effects are used sparingly, and most importantly never over the top. One such special effect moment will surely go down into horror movie history, though I won't spoil it for you here.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the suspense builds up continually and in the last 20 minutes or so, never lets up. The ending is fantastic and I don't ever remember being amongst such an animated theater audience. The film hits on so many areas, but the most refreshing aspect is the lack of cheap Hollywood scares. There is no Amityville Horror here, this is different, and it works brilliantly. For those Hollywood horror fans that thrive on the gore and shock moments, you won't like it. This isn't the same. This is far more intelligent, and so much better for it. May be there is life in the supernatural genre after all.<br/><br/>A well deserved 8 out of 10. You won't forget this movie in a while."
"ameerzebamjad","9","1","3","22 November 2009"," Too much hype about the hype of this movie!
","Okay here it goes. My first movie review on IMDb. And I'm so glad it happened to be this movie. I've seen too many reviews trashing this movie, saying that it's not scary, that it doesn't live up to the expectations/hype... I have only one question for them: Why would they build such lofty expectations from a movie that they know cost a few thousand more than a Birkin bag? For sure Paranormal Activity (PA) was not made to satisfy the CGI-spoilt, gore loving, severed arteries craving crowd that would excitedly place the 6th rendition of the rehash factory called Saw on their collectors' mantle and happily spend another $10 on the re-release of the first edition the next year just because it is in 3D!! I request you to stay away from PA, this is not for you.<br/><br/>This movie is all about atmosphere. The eerie silence of the night that crawls under your skin, making you nervous in anticipation. The classic horror style of walking its viewers the slow measured journey that builds tension and nervous anxiety with such method and to such an extent that the final outcome becomes immaterial, and the mere survival of the journey itself becomes the reward, the memory for the viewers. PA's characters, the setting, the story - all seep into your life so seamlessly, leaving you with empathy for the characters and a very tangible realization that this could happen to you.<br/><br/>Having said that, is it a perfect movie? No, it has its flaws. Where the actors react in very realistic, very believable ways, are those Oscar-worthy performances? No. Where the plot is simple and gripping, does it leave you with an empty climax? Yes.<br/><br/>But all said and done the movie delivers a punch on what it's set out to be: a horror that, every time you hear an unrecognizable 'thump' in your house at night, will leave you holding your breath uneasily, straining your ears through that eerie silence, hoping to hear the slightest sound of reassuring familiarity. It is for this reason alone, it deserves a commendable 9 stars!"

","Not since Blair Witch Project has a movie left me unsettled afterwards. This low budget thriller relies not on jolt scares or gore to make it's point. This movie allows you to savor the experience long after the movie is over. Most fans of horror movies have come to expect or even rely on the typical jolt scare or over the top gore (much like ahem... Saw VI ) to enjoy themselves. I say more power to ya. However this film is more of a ""scared of the dark, look under the bed before you turn off the light"" kinda movie. I like scary movies but the cheap jolt is overused and i've gotten so used to it, it no longer has the desired effect.<br/><br/>Bring movies like this back, Hollywood.

"thebrow88","9","1","3","2 November 2009"," Liked it
","Let me be clear: I am not a big fan of horror movies. I think a lot of them are incredibly dumb, repetitive, and ultimately not frightening. I get more laughs out of most horror movies than anything else. The best horror movies, in my opinion, would be the Saw series, the Exorcist, and the Shining. The Halloween movies are dumb, the Descent was terrible, and don't get me started on Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>I went to see this Paranormal Activity on Halloween night. I had virtually no prior knowledge of this film, other than the fact that some people said it was the scariest movie they had ever seen, while others said it was a boring waste of time. In order to solve this dilemma for myself, I decided to go.<br/><br/>The movie caught me off-guard at first by jumping right into the story, that some freaky stuff has been happening in the couple's house. It wasn't until later, when the psychic shows up, that we really get an understanding of what's going on.<br/><br/>A few things need to be cleared up. In some respects, this is no different from any other horror movie, good or bad. I say this because, at least Mica was a complete moron, disregarding the advice of the psychic as well as...logic in general. He starts off as a comic relief, to give the audience a sense of calm before the storm. It was BECAUSE he was both egging on the spirit as well as trying to interact with it (via camera, powder, microphone, etc.) that gave the creature more incentive to mess with the couple. Think about it. If he was a nice guy, or if he had simply called the demonologist immediately, then the problem would be taken care of and the movie would be over. What fun is that? I admit, the start of the film was slow. The scratching on the walls, the slight movement of the door, and the little groan were preliminary activities. The point of showing every evening's activity is to build anticipation, to get the audience wondering how the next evening will top the one that preceded it. The film was one big crescendo, and that's what I personally loved about it.<br/><br/>It was true suspense, no Hollywood interference, and no real gory/slasher moments. This was horror at its finest. This movie proved that the biggest fear is the one we create ourselves, which is why the director didn't feel the need to show a demon, excessive blood, and everything else that has been senselessly thrown into every other ""horror"" movie. All-in-all, it was a very well-made film that kept my heart rate up from start to finish and beyond."

","Have you seen it? don't waste your time. When the couple sleeps and the ""devil"" does his ""stuff"" sometimes the editor fast forwards the actions, for ""dramatic"" motivations? if you are curious and need to see the cause for the hype, then wait for the DVD or any other format and FAST FORWARD the entire picture, you will understand the story, maybe it will be funnier or dare I say, scarier! but the most important think it will not steal too much of your time. This is the most moronic picture I have ever seen...<br/><br/>It would be even better if you just not see it... at all...<br/><br/>Lazy film... the low budget is no excuse, George Romero did Night of the living dead with a low budget and it's great... OK, bad comparison, how about Blair Witch Project? very low budget, same camera style, similar task, but way better screen writing! and I am not really a fan of that one so what can you expect from this... please, don't be lazy and expect us to buy this movie..."

But after I had a couple of friends tell me they went to the movie theater to watch this and actually got scared sh*tless I thought I might give it a shot. I've seen way too many horror movies and, maybe Hollywood will kill me, but 100% of everything that was made in the last 5 years is pure crap. Nothing new. All the tricks, all the ""scary moments""... IT HAS ALL BEEN DONE! So, I've decided to give this one a shot.<br/><br/>People, did you really get scared watching this crap? Throughout the whole movie everything is cliché! Every single door slam, bump, etc. EVERYTHING has been done before!

"broadway-bookworm","8","1","3","2 November 2009"," Truly Memorable
","This movie definitely left a huge impression on me long after it was over. Though I was too busy laughing at everyone's reactions to doors slamming closed or an empty attic during the actual movie to be terrified at the moment, the memory of the events in the film left more of a mark on my subconscious than the Krypt Keeper did when I was four and thought he lived under my bed.<br/><br/>The first hour is more creepy than scary, and tended to drag. But it was pulled together nicely by the believable acting done by Micah and Katie. It was interesting to have the tension in the relationship being shown on camera without every single detail of every single fight getting caught on tape, like these other POV movies out there, which kills the authentic feel. Micah was an amazing comic relief when things got too eerie, though by the end of the movie I was rooting for the demon to kill him off - hey, he WAS kind of a jerk about Katie's ordeal.<br/><br/>In the scene where Katie stands staring down at Micah for hours on end before going outside to sit on the porch swing, I could feel myself hold my breath. It definitely was something to think about, for how do we know that we don't do the same thing? From the baby powder scene to the time when Katie is dragged down the hallway and bitten, I was clutching my boyfriend's arm a little tighter than I had been. And the final scene, when Micah is thrown at the camera, I was genuinely wide-eyed.<br/><br/>Hours after the movie ended, I was still checking over my shoulder and refused to go into dark rooms alone in my own house. This movie definitely has something that most other movies can't top - a sense of realism, and I'm not just talking about the POV camera angle. The thought of something like a demonic presence following us for years and then finally torturing us for three weeks in the ways that it tortured Katie and Micah, it's something that will make you keep one eye - and perhaps a camera lens - open while you sleep at night. Don't let the bed bugs bite."
"kosay_1991","5","1","3","31 October 2009"," Bad bad bad, yet original.
","It just didn't happen for me. Where do i start, the corny acting maybe?<br/><br/>1) Corny acting. Okay, whoever told you that the acting is so amazing and it seems like it is a real life situation doesn't even know what they're talking about. You can almost see the actors smile in some of the scenes, they put no effort into making their feelings feel genuine. I despised the acting at the very least, it ruined the whole experience. Really though.. really... what bothered me the most.. ""Hey, you're my girlfriend, and this is my house we'll take care of this.""... wow... so corny.<br/><br/>2) Doesn't bring the scare on. I know i don't get scared easily. However, this movie is just so ridiculous and obvious. By the time the girl stood up for the first time and stared at the guy for 3 hours i told my friend, the demon is part of the girl man.. really.. obvious... and i was right. And I'm sorry.. opening and closing doors.. don't scare me, not even in real life, i'll just say wind, noises.. don't scare me.. i live alone and sleep at night everyday and hear lots of things go on and off.. nope... doesn't work for me... some wind... some hoof prints.. nah, didn't do it for me. that is not even close to being scary. 90% of the movie is useless and doesn't even contribute to the plot. Lot's of the threads aren't closed or poorly closed. For example, the mystery of the board... did that really get solved? really? showing an internet page, and hearing the guy say ""oh, the same stuff happened to her... you know.. her house burned and stuff.. you know.. and it moved on to you... you know.."".. no i don't know, you don't close the whole board story like that =), im not that easy to swindle. And oh.. I'm sorry.. didn't the board burn..?.. we didn't see burn marks..?... oh ya, there is anti-fire cream on the board. <br/><br/>3) Lack's realism, lose story, untied ends. Any person in their sane mind wouldn't go around calling for a demon at night challenging them =), i'd tell you what i'd do, get my quraan and start reading it and i know that i will be protected. Faith is truly your only protection. There is so many unclosed ends to the story. Let me start, the cross, why did the girl hold it? why did it make her bleed? why did she hold it if it made her bleed? Okay fine, why burn the cross =), i don't get it was the demon in the cross? is the guy an atheist? hmm.. that didn't make sense, and my questions didn't get answered. The mystery of the board, not answered, we got a lousy internet page and got swindled into forgetting. The girl's family, why not seek her family?? Why not call her mum if she was with her?? why not go to the hospital to get your wounds checked out? I certainly would if a demonic entity bit me =), i don't want demonic rabies if you catch my drift. And what annoyed me the most, how they took out the possibility of giving a demonologist expert. The doctor got his cheap way out by saying ""demons is not my area"", so if i had a ghoul i'll be sure not to call a demonologist =), ill call a ghoulist. And oh.. the girl says she'll call the demon guy, but doesn't, and I'm waiting... okay when are they gonna tell us why she didn't call the guy...?.. then at the end of the movie, the writer of the script remembers he didn't answer that part of the plot and ties it up in the cheesiest and corniest of ways. They didn't call the guy because the boyfriend wants to handle it =).. oh wow. And oh, the second time the ghost expert comes, he is too scared, and luckily the demonologist is out of town! And when the boyfriend offers to leave, the girl chooses not to =). Why the change of heart?<br/><br/>4) Bad ending Sorry, you're not the sopranos, don't try to be. Don't give me that black screen ending. Because it only aggravated me =) And don't tell me ""her whereabouts are unknown"" and the guys body was found, i kinda figured that out myself. If you want to make an epilogue, put some though into it. Or even better, put some money into the movie =), maybe then it would turn out to be better.<br/><br/>*wrap up* The movie is cheesy, contains bad acting, has lots of loose untied ends, however i praise it's originality. That is why i give it 5, i just feel if they actually put more thought into it, more money, it would've been a great original movie. All in all, i promise you'd be better off watching zombieland (really funny movie that gives what it promises) or maybe saw IV if you're into blood and gore. Just stay away from the cheesy stuff, because i was not screaming, i was laughing. I kept messing around with my buddies saying, 'look at the door!, look at the door!', and when the result was a closing and opening door.. i was disappointed and i started laughing!... not scary.. sorry.. <br/><br/>*verdict* A 75K movie will never be brilliant. If you don't invest in a beautiful idea, if you don't water your seeds, you'll never get the fruits you seek. Don't watch it."

It may be cool for the up and coming generation, those 16-18 year olds that were too young back in the day to give a rats arse about The Blair Witch Project. But for you late twenties/early thirty somethings...be prepared to yawn and occasionally chuckle at the absurdity of it all. It's NOT scary. Some of the thumps and bumps may startle you a little. Character reactions are completely predictable -hence the comedy. And the ending...Big DUH! moment. Worth seeing if you're bored, or young. But seriously, lower your expectations. CLOVERFIELD WAS MORE STIMULATING"
"nowayjose77","2","1","3","30 October 2009"," I think we've been duped.
","I think we've been duped by an excellent advertising strategy. Yes this movie has suspense but not being able to sleep and being physically affected - really? Either all the ""rave"" reviews and comments on this site are part of the advertising strategy or they saw a truly different movie than me. A part of me really wanted this to be physically affecting after seeing the promo ads of alleged movie goers screaming, hiding their eyes, and just being freaked out. But it wasn't, it was down right corny. Seriously, who doesn't turn a light on when a demon is in your room? Or thinks that being armed with a camera could help against something paranormal? My other question, why did this movie cost $11,000 to make? Did they include the cost of the camera in that? It seems to me the people who are so scared by this movie that they can't sleep were made this way by the ads and word of mouth campaign - so much hype helped create their reaction. I can only assume these same people are the ones that are easily put under at a hypnotist show. Easily led."

Sadly there seems to be a following for this type of home made film stuff, what was that oh so forgettable film that started this? The Blair witch something! I think people are getting bored with the films that are being produced so anything that seems different then the rest seems to get a higher then normal rating on IMD, but come on people are most of you as brain dead as this crap! I think I have found out where zombies come from, they watch this sort of rubbish, kills their brain cells and so on, any way a big score of 3 out of 10 for this one, why even 3?

"Seagalogist","6","1","3","29 October 2009"," A Valiant effort, yet ultimately, it falls down a bit
","I saw this movie enter the US top 10 out of the blue and instantly was intrigued. I knew nothing of the movie, hadn't even read a trailer or a review. I kept it that way and got my hands on this movie asap. I prepared, and judging from the huge reception and hearing Spielberg had to switch it off half way through because he was so scared, I was expecting this to be very chilling. <br/><br/>Granted this movie does a superb job at keeping suspense going with it's minimalist attitude, but at the end, for someone as enthusiast about horror as I, it became predictable. The last 20 minutes I could have scripted myself. That's not an insult, it was just a bit predictable. <br/><br/>It's a great effort by a 1st time director but for me, it just wasn't scary enough. I would recommend people to see it, but don't expect a great movie. If you thought Blair Witch was the scariest movie you ever saw, see this! If you're more of a 'Don't look now'/'Rosemary's Baby'/'The Shining'/'The Exorcist'/'The Mist' person, don't expect to be kept awake at night!"

","PARANORMAL ACTIVITY- this movie had to be one of the most mind blowing experiences of my life... seriously, it made me want to blow my head off with something similar to that of a nuclear missile like the movie is THAT bad. The movie is technically a collection of clips of watching an overweight woman sleep with a computer nerd guy and watch a door sway back and forth... and hear a scream but no one does anything about it. the scariest part about this movie, isn't the ALLEGED horror scenes, but is the horrible acting by MOST of the actors, the only one that did remotely decent was Micah. Micah was the only one who was remotely funny aside from the late night clips. I would label this movie a screamer... because after the 2 hours of boring doors and screams you'll be screaming at the ticket guy saying, ''GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY!!!'' I ONLY recommend this movie to people who are trying to give away their money to corporate and apparently have no self-respect."

"joelmeyer","9","1","3","26 October 2009"," Please someone explain the poor comments.
","My opinion is that this is, so far, the best film to come out this year. It was an original horror film that used traditional methods in a whole new way.<br/><br/>I saw the movie and as always wanted to see what the public thought of it so I came here. After a couple of minutes of browsing I was seeing an increasing amount of 1-4 star reviews. How?! I am trying to think of what could be going through the minds of those who leave these comments and have come to blame it on bad television and movies.<br/><br/>People these days are so accustomed to modern horror movies, so that when something brilliant like this comes along all they can say is ""What the hell is this?"".<br/><br/>I also think that this movie was too late. Had it come out before all of the sub-par point of view movies (e.i. Blair Witch, Cloverfield) I think it could have been a movie to change all movies. Un-luckily though its predecessors set a bar so horribly low that people now ignore anything that manages to go over it. For the people who think this is the worst movie ever you watch either too much T.V. or are unable to actually get into a movie.<br/><br/>I also get the feeling that most people go into this movie, sit down, and before the movie even gets going, start making snide remarks. Why do you do that to yourself? I can walk into any movie and make fun of it if I have the right mindset, trust me I do it with all Nic Cage movies.<br/><br/>If you go to see this movie, I beg that you go in with the least opinions possible.<br/><br/>This movie reverted to the thought that the build up is far more important than the actually scare. The fear slowly mounts on you throughout the movie, and by the end my heart was pounding. I had to sleepover at a friends house after because we were freaking out whenever we were alone And to those of you who didn't like it, feel free to contact me and voice your opinion, because, frankly, i don't understand you."

","Good movie but it wasn't scary at all. Not even close. I don't understand why people are so scared about the movie. The Ring is so much better to bring suspense.<br/><br/>The script is good, in my opinion and the director made a good edition. I watch the 2 endings, and the original, from 2007, is far far better than the Theater one (I think they are looking for a sequence, is this 2009 ending).<br/><br/>A good point is a lack of gore scenes.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to see what the director will bring to us in his next jobs. This guy seems to be very creative. With such small budget, it's very very difficult to came up with such a good film like this.<br/><br/>Sorry for the bad English, guys."

Nonetheless, this is a truly scary horror movie that should not be seen alone.Yeah, it's that scary.There are even some rules if your going to see it and these are real.You can't be pregnant, you can't be old, and you have to go the bathroom before you see it.Now THAT is scary.'Paranormal Activity' will shake you to your core and will have you shaking and fearing about going to sleep once you walk out of the theater."

The terrible acting by Katie makes me sick, one part she finds a photo that was burned in a house when she was younger and brushes it off like nothing. Only good part was the last 45 seconds or so and that was it. Wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it for a buck out of a Red Box. Don't waste the time and money going to see this movie.

"deacon_blues-3","7","1","3","23 October 2009"," Over-hyped? Yes! Bad? Nope!
","OK, so this film had it coming, didn't it? It asked for it, didn't it? So, I have no argument with people who fell for the over-hyped marketing ploy and thought they were going to see something really extraordinary, and then wound up bored out of their gourds by this film and its slow pace and subdued atmosphere. They got cheated, and I don't blame them for hating it and feeling ripped off. THIS JUST IN: This is NOT the scariest movie you've ever seen! Unless you have the sensibility of Jane Austin or Little Miss Muffet, you will not be traumatized by the depicted events in this film. But viewing the film from a more objective point of view, it is really not a bad little horror movie! There are plenty of chills for those who take the time to immerse themselves in the experiences of the couple on screen without placing the huge expectations of shock and awe that the film's ad campaign burdened it with. The low budget camera tech calls on the actors to be believable in their roles, and they are. Micah is the typical jerk that girls like Katie usually hook up with, and the negative energy generated by the growing tension between them produces their undoing at the hands of the entity following her around. There are very small subtle things that one can appreciate: The economical but effective voice modulations in Katie's last line ""We'll be OK."" And the creepy smirk on her face just at the end, were very nicely done. Although the end of the movie leaves us wishing we'd seen more visual FX about the haunting spirit, you have to admit that the film accomplishes a lot with very minimal means. I just wish it hadn't been so over-hyped. When all is said about this film, I agree with many reviewers on this board when I recommend that there is absolutely no reason not to save your admission money and wait for the DVD release if you want to see this film for your self. Under those conditions, you won't feel nearly so cheated as if you paid full admission in a theater."
"hampsterwarfare","2","1","3","22 October 2009"," Seen better film on teeth!
","On 5 hits of acid this movie would be terrifying.<br/><br/>The marketing video that shows people in the theatre screaming was scarier that the actual movie itself. That footage must have been taken during movie-night at the asylum.<br/><br/>The only thing that could have made this worse is if the demon came through the screen and raped me in the mouth before rolling the credits.<br/><br/>The Shining is still the scariest movie of all time IMO. No one is ever going to beat it now.<br/><br/>""Good"" isn't profitable anymore. It's clearly more efficient to take a cheap indie film and hype it."
"massacre764","3","1","3","22 October 2009"," Highly disappointed
","I had a feeling the massive amount of hype leading up to this film was going to ruin it for me, and sure enough, I was right. Hype doesn't always ruin movies, in some cases the hype is even surpassed. Not in this case though. My friends said it was terrifying. Family members told me they couldn't sleep after watching it. I, being a huge horror fan, had my doubts of course. I wondered to myself if such a film could exist. A film that's filled with true terror unlike most of the garbage that passes off as ""horror"" these days. I went into the movie very excited hoping to be genuinely scared and unfortunately, came out highly disappointed.<br/><br/>The whole shaky cam thing wasn't overdone like in Cloverfield or Blair Witch, it actually gave the movie a more realistic feel. It had a very slow build up, which isn't a bad thing, but in this case the climax failed to deliver. Not once did I find myself scared and believe it or not, I actually laughed a few times. This is coming from someone who grew up on horror, thought The Exorcist was hilarious and has even experienced some pretty startling paranormal events himself. For the budget that was used in this film, I give the director props. He did some very cool things with the little that he had. Still though, it wasn't nearly enough.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I am sitting here attempting to understand how people gave and are giving this such high reviews. I guess I can understand how younger kids could find this scary. For the true horror fans though, this shouldn't even remotely phase you."
"chad1993","4","1","3","22 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity was nothing short of disappointing...
","After seeing the trailer for Paranormal Activity, I HAD to see it. So, I went to see this allegedly horrifying movie with 10 of my friends, all of which went into the movie confident that it was not going to scare them, however I went in nervous... and I don't get scared by movies. Ironically, I was one of the few that had left unshaken, I had only flinched once during the movie and I will not disclose when so that I won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it yet. I saw it as extremely predictable, and simply just NOT enough of a movie, although I must admit it was VERY well done; the acting was superb and it was a very interesting idea, just not done originally at ALL. This movie was most certainly not what I expected it to be, there was not enough truly terrifying aspects of this movie, and those damn 13 yr olds that managed to sneak into the theater in groups of 10 that happened to scream bloody murder during EVERY scene most certainly didn't make the experience more enjoyable... The responses to Paranormal Activity are generally black and white (from what I have seen): you either love it, or hate it. Disregarding what ""I"" thought about the movie, you should give it a shot, you may end up loving it."
"Issapunk","9","1","3","21 October 2009"," Atmospheric horror at its best...possibly minor minor spoilers
","BTW, this is my first review so bare with me and rate it please.<br/><br/>The factor that makes this film so great is the way the director created such a horrifying atmosphere. I felt trapped in the house with the couple the entire film. It was almost as if there was nothing outside of the house and nowhere to go. I felt helpless and that is what a great horror film should do.<br/><br/>Another factor is that almost all of the events occurred when the couple was asleep, which is genius because a person is most helpless when they are sleeping. Another technique that sets this film apart.<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly good considering it was the couple's first film. The camera is not too shaky to cause people discomfort, which I appreciated. The characters were very easy to relate to and likable. A few scenes seemed forced by the actors but nothing to take away from the film.<br/><br/>While I was watching the film I did not think that I would be 'haunted' by it at night, but as soon as I closed my eyes to go to sleep, my stomach dropped and I started thinking about the film. It really was great and lived up to the hype for me.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that there were people in the theater acting completely obnoxious and basically ruined the experience for me. I wish I had waited until DVD to watch it with friends, in a dark quiet room, but oh well. I still enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars."
"romerofan","5","1","3","20 October 2009"," Like a small-town spook house, with room after room of lame scares.
","Steven Spielberg was reportedly so creeped out by ""Paranormal Activity"" that he had to watch it in two sittings. I seriously have to question that, but then again I know that there were many people totally and completely freaked out by ""Blair Witch Project,"" so perhaps Mr. Spielberg really did get his nerves singed by yet another Camcorder movie.<br/><br/>And then there are the multitude of on-line horror zines that are raving about this movie like its the 'second coming' of horror movies, going as far as saying that it is the scariest film of all time, second only to ""The Exorcist."" That's a pretty grandiose statement to make, considering that since ""The Exorcist"" there have been many very scary films released from all over the world. For my money Hideo Nakata's ""The Ring"" is the true champion of scarier-than-hell movies, followed by Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"" and then ""Halloween."" Just my two-cents.<br/><br/>Warning! Spoiler Ahead!<br/><br/>We all know what the story behind ""Paranormal Activity"" is: a woman is convinced that she has been followed by some kind of restless spirit since childhood. Her live-in boyfriend, half-convinced that she is delusional, sets up a video system to hopefully capture the 'entity at play' while they sleep. He even goes so far as to challenge this 'thing' to show its colors. Enough said. You know where it goes from there.<br/><br/>Admittedly the back story and the initial execution is intriguing and I actually liked the way the film did some interesting things with slowly developing tension, with just a hint as to what is around the corner. But about a third into it, the movie decides its time to get scary, and 'every' scene that is supposed to be scary, starts off with the same exact sound effect and a superimposed reminder of what day it is. Big mistake. That became annoying. There was no reason to alert us visually to the painfully obvious, and that in itself drained some of the power of the film.<br/><br/>Even more annoying is revisiting the concept that Camcorder guru's will keep holding on to the Camera almost constantly and certainly when things get freaky. When you're scared or being menaced by what is obviously 'paranormal activity,' you drop the Camcorder with the endless battery and get out of there. The same problem that I had with ""Blair Witch"", I have with this film. People just don't do and act like real people. But yes I know, it's a horror movie and we have to suspend disbelief for the sake of getting scared. But sometimes a movie asks or requires way too much patience and suspension of disbelief, and I don't buy it. <br/><br/>As the film reaches the end, things start to pick way up, and that's when ""Paranormal Activity"" jumps into hyper-speed and tries very hard to scare us silly. It didn't work for me, simply because we have seen all of this before and the final shot is a rip-off of numerous American and especially Asian horror films that have run out of ideas and then resort to a cheap 'jolt' instead of something that leaves us unsettled.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" has a few interesting moments and I didn't find it necessarily boring. I tried to like it. I tried to stay with it. I tried to care about the characters, so the inevitable horror would really hit me hard. I tried, but no cigar. Before the film was over I completely disliked the characters and the film just did not succeed in creeping me out. <br/><br/>As for giving us anything original, forget it. Just about every scary moment has been lifted from other horror films, notably ""The Entity,"" ""The Amityville Horror,"" ""Poltergeist"" and of course ""Blair Witch Project.""<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Paranormal Activity"" is not a complete waste of time. There are some entertaining moments and I enjoyed the sarcasm of the boyfriend. I will contend that there were a couple of pretty effective chills as well, but ""Paranormal Activity"" is the scariest movie since ""The Exorcist?"" Hardly. A deceptive and over-hyped movie that somehow has garnered undeserved acclaim and attention? Absolutely."
"Michael Fargo","7","1","3","18 October 2009"," A+ for concept
","There are some good scares in this film. In fact, I can't remember the last ""horror"" film that gave me goosebumps the way this one did. Returning to a ""the basics"" where suspense and storytelling are key--not the great folks over in CGI--hopefully this will be a demonstration to the industry of what's been missing from horror films: subtlety.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the rendering of the concept in this case would be more appropriate for, say, YouTube than a feature length film. While the device of ""found"" documentary footage (like ""The Blair Witch Project"") is as valid as any other, here it's an excuse to omit production values: like actors of some merit, dialog that isn't mindnumbing, sets (although the house here is used effectively). I will compliment the videography/cinematographer, because given what this is, it's very effectively shot.<br/><br/>As well, we get a very convincing portrait of a relationship, and while the actors aren't awful, I was always aware that they were ""acting."" But if you've got nothing better to do on a rainy night, rent or download this and it'll be entertaining. However, making the effort to go to a theater, putting up with what often awaits one in the audience, in addition to the cost...this is better viewed at home."

","Micah has just found out that Katie, his long-time girlfriend, is being haunted. She's been followed by a disturbing presence since she was young, and it appears to loathe anybody who gets too involved in her life. This happens to be a serious relationship hurdle for Micah to deal with, and he feels that he must do something to fix the situation. So, he decides that he'll attempt to catch the haunt on film.<br/><br/>There is a common theme in horror movies in which the main characters ignore advice that turns out to be vital to their survival. Micah and Katie are warned by a psychic in the beginning of the film that whatever force they are living with feeds and grows off of negative energy. All they must do to keep the being at bay is to ignore it and remain content with each other. Bringing a camera into the mix doesn't help either of those things.<br/><br/>The movie incorporates a steady buildup, but is well worth its time for the lasting scare it provides. Having been made to look like uncovered footage, there are no musical cues or ominous tonalities. In avoiding most of the common horror mainstays, Paranormal Activity denies cheap scares and uses another method: to frighten the audience members by disturbing them at an ethereal level. Fear is induced through subtle, unnatural oddities rather than the more common ""jump"" moments in today's thrillers. Because of this unique method, the film will affect many of its viewers differently.<br/><br/>Believers in actual demons, ghosts, ghouls and such may want to shy away in respect of the supernatural nature of the plot. While many people have reported having nightmares (if they were able to sleep at all) after seeing this movie, more fantastical claims of actual hauntings have also been made. Steven Spielberg is even said to have returned a home copy to the studio in a garbage bag after believing it to have permeated ghosts into his home.<br/><br/>Oren Peli has created a very inspired work from his own paranormal experiences, and the genuineness shows itself off in his writing and direction. The expected screams and ramblings of most characters in these types of situation are replaced with tears and arguments over responsibility for the events. Peli writes the characters into an inescapable situation, but it is their arrogance and pride that ultimately worsen it. Both of the main actors (who use their real names in the film) do a great job of emoting their fright without exaggerating it, lending visceral honesty to their reactions.<br/><br/>Even though a good amount of information surrounding the phenomenal situation in the film is revealed by the end, there is just enough mystery left keep it strange and terrifying. Those intent on getting sleep after seeing Paranormal Activity have been warned.<br/><br/>Actual Rating: PG-13 While anybody who happens to be afraid of supernatural forces is probably too young (at any age) to see this movie; there is no actual adult material in it beyond ""foul"" language.<br/><br/>For updates regarding future movie reviews and the other shenanigans I get into, follow my page at http://twitter.com/ross667 you lovely person, you."

","This is one of the best movies ever filmed on such a minuscule budget. Is it scary? Not really, but it does provide a satisfying adrenaline rush on more than a few occasions.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed it more if it had not been marketed to obvious idiots. If this movie had been about a guy buying a camera because his girlfriend had reported Tinkerbell sightings, would anyone ask if it was real? Living in this post-Ghost Hunters/Blair Witch Project world, the sad answer is probably ""yes.""<br/><br/>The acting was very anti-Method. Stanislavski would have wept. However, as this film's topic already strains the limits of credulity, the natural, non-dramatic style of these young actors was particularly effective."
"JoeKarlosi","7","1","3","12 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity (2007) ***
","A young woman who's shacked up with her boyfriend in his house has finally revealed to him that she's been stalked by a ghost or demon ever since she was eight years old. Her heroic partner decides to keep a video camera running all day and evening in case they can catch evidence of things that go ""bump"" in the night. I saw this last night with my wife and two friends. Our theatre was packed with a full house and everyone was getting into it, and I have to say that I got freaked out and felt fear and dread several times during this movie - and I'm someone who never really gets ""scared"" when watching horror films, and I personally do not even believe in the existence of ghosts or demons. There isn't anything in the way of story or plot here, but that's not the point ... the goal is to scare you, and the film certainly made good on that goal. Much like JAWS made me afraid to go into the water in 1975, this film often made me dread going to bed at night as a grown man. There is also some comic relief with the couple's squabbling, mostly courtesy of the wise-cracking boyfriend who means well but sometimes doesn't take his girlfriend seriously.<br/><br/>I think it's much to this movie's credit that the simplest means of scare tactics are the very best, and this low, low-budgeted film - with no blow-away makeup or CGI effects, no dazzling camera work (the scariest parts come with the camcorder completely still in one frame at night), and only a cast of two or three people, can be more effective than the most action-packed multi-million dollar blockbusters. You have to know HOW to make a subtle scary film where less is more, and this certainly accomplished that. It is a complete slap in the face to bloated Hollywood that an amateur project like this can trump all ""traditional"" horror movies of the last couple of decades when it comes to producing scares. I thought I was getting tired of the ""shot on home video"" genre after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and CLOVERFIELD (both good films, I thought) but I'm wondering if the success of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY will keep revitalizing this approach. The technique is very strong in capturing the ""reality"" feel of a horrific situation. *** out of ****"
"pressboard","10","1","3","9 October 2009"," Ghost Hunters with an edge
","The title is almost clinical and was probably not the best choice. Despite the hand held camera (on tripod much of the time) I would not compare it to Blair Witch. Like the ghost hunter type shows, it is not the long haul but the subtleties that get under your skin ... and squirm. This is definitely a tribute to the power of old school tension build up and not over the top CGI. There are a max of four actors and two of those are part time. They all put in a very real performance in the way they respond to the phenomena and each other. The main characters, a couple who are living in a new house, are very believable - even to how they argue. My showing was sold out as was the one before and this film stands to make way over its small budget. Laugh and be scared and if you do not jump than the people around you will. Enjoy."
"safford99","8","1","3","9 October 2009"," Puts many main stream horror films to shame
","This movie is certainly a companion piece to the ""Blair Witch Project"", but it is a much better film for two reasons: (1) everyone can relate to it due to the fact we all have to sleep at night and what might go on around us while we're sleeping puts us at our most vulnerable; and, (2) the climactic scene is a much better payoff than the ending to ""Blair Witch"".<br/><br/>The film also puts most of the more recent Hollywood horror films to shame because its plot is simple. It's not trying to remake ""The Sixth Sense"" by providing you with an unexpected twist ending or convoluted plot that ends up making no sense at all. You know at the start what's going to happen at the end and much of the movie's suspense comes from that sense of dread as well as from small, mundane occurrences filmed in a very sinister way.<br/><br/>There is a little too much comic relief from the banter and squabbling of the two main characters which becomes annoying after awhile, but this is a minor complaint.<br/><br/>Definitely a horror movie worth seeing, which stays with you after it's over, which makes it the best kind."
"jeff-coatney","8","1","3","9 October 2009"," Yes, it lives up to the hype, if you give it a chance.
","I was skeptical that a film like this could actually deliver the required thrills and chills to keep me interested, but it delivered. Don't expect huge production value, but you can expect to get absorbed into the story and witness some chilling moments and yes, even some terror. Like the Exorcist, this film presents an intimate peek into the lives of a couple terrorized by something unseen. But unlike the Exorcist, there's no Priests that show up to deal with it. Let's be clear: this film is artfully constructed by a filmmaker that has studied the underlying Psychology of horror and they really stick it to you. This film has a huge impact in a theatre, with a fun crowd of young girls ripe to shriek at every turn. I doubt this film will have the needed impact on DVD. So I suggest you fill out the petition to get it to your local theatre so you can enjoy the ride like I got to. You won't regret it. Take a date. There's plenty of charm and laughs early on from the wonderful actors who play the couple ( they're also decent cinematographers) and so you really get a sense of dread when the spooky shows up. I have very high standards, but the IMDb rating tells the tale."

","This film has loads of hype and its for a reason, just watched it last night and has easily become one of my favourite films. People compare this film to Blair witch Project but I feel it is an insult to the film and the actors. Although the film had only a $15000 budget and unknown actors, the acting and the special effects were much better than most Hollywood films. This is because it is kept simple which makes it much more realistic.<br/><br/>Basically the film is suppose to be recorded by a camera bought by Micah to try and record any ""bumps in the night"", which has been edited by unknown producers as a documentary of what happened to Micah and Katie and as a is it real or fake movie thing. It builds the characters up well and gets you familiar to the location of the film which is Micahs house. It is slow to start with only minor Paranormal activity's happening early on but this builds huge suspense as you keep asking your self ""what next"". There are three alternative endings, i watched the original which I enjoyed.<br/><br/>To sum it up if you want a nonstop unintelligent scream fest with lots of blood and guts watch some silly Hollywood film. However, if you you want to watch an intelligent, high suspense, nerve racking thriller/horror this is it.<br/><br/>If you are after a film with nonstop screams and blood and guts, this is not it.

","I was weary about seeing this in a movie theater b/c of hecklers and the rude, inconsiderate types. But, I was amazed that in a fully packed theater, I could have heard a pin drop throughout most of the movie. I believe in people again!! Yeahh ;-) So anyway, I did'nt read any reviews and only saw one TV commercial advertisement about this Paranormal Activity movie. I am not crazy at all about documentary style movies, and I did'nt think I was going to last the first 10 minutes without getting dizzy in my seat from the camera footage. It's the type of movie that is boring in the beginning, but the couple are cute and their home is awesome, and it keeps you wondering ""what the heck is the deal? or, what is gonna happen?"" I thought I was going to fall asleep, and that is probably where the negative feedback will come from. But, it is a must see movie because I never seen a horror movie made this way before. It's in the style of Blair Witch, but sooooo much better. I feel sorry for you if you have a bad crowd in the theater. Thank God at Lynhaven Movies in VA Bch, the crowd was really cool. Of course, I had the main highest schrilling woman screamer right behind me, but, she was alright b/c the parts that made her scream made everyone friggin scream or jump. I was scared. It felt like it was a real story happening, but, I do not know if it was real footage yet b/c I have not searched about the movie yet. A skeptic will always remain a skeptic, but, this movie will open up their mind more than any television series about paranormal activity will ever do. If it is a made up story with actors, then this movie gets a 10+ from me. I walked out of the theater wondering ""damn, what the heck did I just watch and was it really real?"" I guess because the actors real names are used it throws everyone off. It's a good movie. It will definitely scare you as long as you be patient, listen, and just hang tight and watch the whole entire flick. I don't know if I would rate it as the scariest movie of the decade, but, it is so different from anything else I've seen cuz it did not appear to be fake, unless your a skeptic who has to ruin the whole mood. Skeptics will complain they wasted their $11.50 even if they got scared. Fake or not, it's scary!! This is a must see for paranormal buffs. Definitely a not see for people scared easily."

"Superunknovvn","6","1","4","7 January 2010"," ""Blair Witch Project"" meets ""The Haunting""
","I've probably seen ""Paranormal Activity"" too late. By the time the movie finally arrived in Austria it had already been hyped up for years. Yes, years. Bloody-Disgusting had already raved about this low-budget-sensation before the movie was picked up by a major studio and found a worldwide release. So, I had high expectations, but soon enough the backlash started and a lot of people pointed out that ""Paranormal Activity"" isn't the great, once-in-a-lifetime-horror-movie it had been made out to be at first.<br/><br/>The truth is somewhere in the middle. For the low budget he had to work with director Oren Peli has made a highly atmospheric movie that doesn't need the help of a score or cheap scares to work. The horror happens in the viewer's mind, as they say. This is basically ""The Haunting"" remade with the looks of ""Blair Witch Project"".<br/><br/>Of course, this also means that the movie isn't for everyone - myself included, because really nothing much happens: Most of the time there are noises in the house and we watch the main characters freaking out about it. This may be scary if you're having a lot of fantasy and not much experience watching horror movies. However, if you've seen anything this side of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""À l'intérieur"", ""Paranormal Activity"" just doesn't really do it for you. It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just nothing special (except, of course, for its spectacular revenue, but that's information only movie studio bosses should be interested in, right?).<br/><br/>One last piece of advice: Contrary to common belief that this movie works best at the cinema, I have to say, in hindsight I wish I had seen it at home. This is where the horror in the movie takes place. Watching it alone in your apartment at night probably helps to freak you out more than being in a public place with screaming teens."

"hitchcockthelegend","9","1","4","14 December 2009"," Simple, edgy and an adrenalin shot for the horror genre.
","Empire magazine reviewer Simon Crook hit the nail firmly on the head when he proclaimed that Paranormal Activity is only as scary as you make it. With that, the film is sure to prove a most divisive piece amongst the horror faithful. For Oren Peli's film deals very much in the ""what you don't see is what truly unnerves you"" line of shiverdom. The premise is simple, young couple move into a new house and the lady of the house is being ""haunted"" by a demon {crucially not a ghost}. Trying to get to the bottom of the matter, the male protagonist sets up his new boy toy camera to record what exactly is making things go bump in the night as they try to sleep. What unfolds during each night is hold your breath in anticipation cinema.<br/><br/>Those that know a little about the subject at hand, re; the difference between a ghost and a demon haunting, will quite possibly benefit far more from Paranormal Activity's experience. More so if the thought of incubus/succubus type demons are the things that have been known to render sleepless nights. It's the basic fact that it's the person, and not the property, being haunted {tormented} that Peli is revelling in. With a slow build sense of dread, Peli plants us in a one room scenario, at first it's a noise here and there, a moving door, was that a shadow? Until nerves are frayed to such an extent one finds the eyes darting from side to side afraid of not just missing something, but afraid of actually seeing something! Quite a trick from the first time director. It all builds to a shattering climax, regardless of the ending one has witnessed since there's three known endings out there!<br/><br/>If one invests fully into the mood of the piece the rewards, and scares, are bountiful. It's not a film for the Hostel and Saw crowd, it's one for those who were chilled by the likes of The Entity and The Haunted, only this is infinitely far better than both of those film's put together. With it's one location set-up-two earthy unknown actors and stunning use of audio, Peli's $15,000 piece is a pant filler of a movie. Simple in structure and execution it may be, but the result for those inclined is one of this decades best horror movies. 9/10"
"DICK STEEL","7","1","4","8 November 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Paranormal Activity
","Note to self: If I want to make a film that would allow a clueless audience to leave bewildered whether it's a true event or not, leave out all forms of credits, and end it as it is. Although Paranormal Activity is a work of fiction, its presentation made many amongst the audience wonder if it's true, even as the end credits did state it's fictitious. I guess not everyone reads.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project could probably be credited as one of the earliest horror films which used the Internet extensively to market the film, and to build a buzz surrounding its probable ""real life"" events which unfold from a first person video camera perspective. It managed to spook its way to box office success despite being low budget, and there are now countless of films out there which have adopted similar techniques, though with varying degrees of success. But of course that doesn't stop films, like this one, from trying.<br/><br/>Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) are the chief protagonists in a film as shot by Micah on his expensive camera, just to try and catch whatever's bothering his fiancé each night in her sleep. As we learn together with him on this voyeuristic journey, this disturbance is nothing new, as whatever it is has been spooking Katie since she was 8 years old, and as a ghost expert explains the distinction between ghosts and demons, this one wants Katie, and won't just go away even if the couple should move homes. Talk about not knowing what he has gotten himself into, hooking up with a girl who comes with some supernatural baggage!<br/><br/>So as the story goes, Paranormal Activities has a repetitive presentation, which will either keep you intrigued in wanting to find out what's the next discovery and progress as the days wear on at the witching hour of 3am each night, or just plain bore you out of your wits. It's like a slow brew, watching little things like shadow movements, morph into shock jock tactics like sudden slamming of doors, to things that literally come crashing down into the living room. Half the movie gets shown in 1 camera angle, and that's watching the couple in their bed sleeping until something happens, which will creep you out in varying degrees.<br/><br/>That said, it's the little things that just plant some frightful thoughts within your mind, but when the time is ripe for some full blown in-your-face horror, this film doesn't shy away from that either. It's one heck of a finale that you probably won't see it coming, akin to those viral marketing videos that have you stare until your guard is down, then sucker punch you and knowing not to drag it out for too long, for maximum results. Franking speaking, you can afford to dose off for the 1st hour."
"daveygandthekeyboard","10","1","4","7 November 2009"," Don't Read this Review, Just see it!!!
","Don't read this review, or any review. Just go see it.<br/><br/>Okay. I just had to say that because I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. I just knew that it was a scary movie that had ""real-life"" footage of the supernatural. So first and foremost, before you spoil your experience by reading reviews, (probably too late if you're already on this site) just see it. As a big fan of Ghost Hunters, I went into this taking it at face value, that what this unfortunate young couple did was take footage of their experiences at their home. It is done with one camera and apparently almost nothing for a budget and if you embrace it for what it is, it will scare the hell out of you. Of course, if you're a cynic and have already read up on this, or perhaps are less trusting than I am then you might just think it's stupid, and that would be a shame. It is a scary movie that the filmmaker takes pains to present as real--there are not even any screen credits, just a ""thank you"" to the families and the San Diego Police. It brings to mind everything we've ever heard about how people reacted to the Orson Welles War of the Worlds radio broadcast, and how difficult that might be to pull of now, with the internet and IMDb and an unfortunate need to be ""tuned in"" all the time which would instantly tell you everything you need to know about this film (yes, I understand the irony of me bemoaning this technology in this particular forum). This is why I commend the filmmakers for at least attempting to fool the audience. This story is told in a series of video clips, in which one actor or the other are holding the camera or leaving it mounted on a tripod while they sleep. As the story progresses and you see more and more of a demonic presence and its effect on the couple's lives--the scenes of Katie standing up and staring at Micah for 90 minutes at a time are especially chilling. It was only after it was over and my suspension of disbelief was lifted that I realized what I'd seen was only a movie, and I began to truly appreciate how brilliant this movie was."

I have not really been nervous in a horror movie since i watched ""Evil Dead"". I was nervous several times in Paranormal Activity. I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates great film art - for $11,000 - this film is a masterpiece.

","I love a good scare. I like it better when shared with an audience full of fellow victims. So I didn't hesitate to see this movie based on the trailer. How could I pass up ""The scariest movie of all time"". So scary we saw reaction audience shots in the trailer to prove it.<br/><br/>So at my local Cineplex, on a Friday opening nation wide weekend, there I sat. Popcorn bucket in hand. I also brought my family so I had someone to clutch.<br/><br/>Fast forward an hour into the film...Popcorn gone(the mega free refill bucket). Why is this important? Because instead of clutching at family, and a possible stranger or two, I'm shoving my face full of buttery ecstasy. I'm now full and sleepy. This preoccupation with my popcorn bucket was brought about from watching a Serta Mattress commercial for nearly an hour.<br/><br/>Yes there was an occasional bump or door creek. (I live in a decade old house) if this is scary to most, come spend the night here. The audience has yet to make one of those movie trailer synchronized screams. I however am telling myself it's building up to something. The short story is: it did. I loved the ending, and the 15 minutes leading up to it. However the first hour was so dull it really hurt the momentum. That multiplied by average acting (I did appreciate what non-actors brought to the films pseudo realism), and a script that had very little to offer other than the build up to the end. Couple that with the overused shaky cam effect (not as bad as recent attempts in films like Cloverfield and .Rec) and uninteresting dialogue and you have the makings of a sci-fi original.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that most will get in line for the ride, but end up waiting patiently for the ride home.

","I'm rarely ever scared by movies, but this movie got me jumping and screaming. For the last couple of years i have been trying to find a movie that can actually scare me. I found many disturbing and graphic movies but no scary. That is until I saw paranormal activity. Paranormal activity uses ghosts, a hand held camera, and people that can act to make one hell of a movie. From beginning to end i was on the edge of my seat. What made this movie scary was the unknown. Ghosts are scary because people don't know much about them. Each night the ghost(demon)got more violent. As you watch the movie you get to see how the couples relationship is being affected by everything that is happening. This movie did not need gore, violence, sex, and nudity to be good. It just needed a good story and good actors. This movie is worth seeing in theaters. Don't wait till it comes out on DVD. It's scarier at the movies. 10/10"

I actually think that the Blair Witch Project might have been better but I was younger then and might have been scared a little easier. Either way, save your ten or twenty bucks because you're wasting it on a shaky camera for 1hr 40mins, a decent plot, and no action. I take that one back, there might be 3 minutes of action throughout the whole movie. DON'T DO IT. It's just marketing. I give credit to the group of people who decided to run commercial's telling people that they won't get to see this movie unless they vote for it to come to their city. Then they show two or three shots during the commercial showing a couple of kids jumping during the ""scary"" part of the movie. I think I heard that this movie cost $15,000 to make. If that's the case, the marketing is the reason they are going to get filthy rich. It's the best marketing ploy for a movie in a really long time; that's the best part of the movie.It's genius!!!"
"kaliban185","7","1","4","13 October 2009"," Scary but....
","Yes this movie is scary and creepy and anyone who says it is not watched the movie with his/her eyes closed. The acting was very good and captured the realistic dialogue that is missing from many horror movies and movies in general (of course with the exception of Tarintino). My only complaint is that the movie spans 20 days. No person in his/her right mind after witnessing all that was captured on video, especially an Ouija board catching on fire to burn a message on it, would ever stay in the house even if the demon would follow. Sure you can explain doors closing and bangs in the middle of the night, but after watching the video and seeing foot steps appear out of nowhere, you do not even go to a church? I would show that video to every priest, rabbi, Buddhist monk, paranormal university professor (well, you get the idea) I could find until somebody would listen. Sure nowadays you can create a very ""real"" looking fake video with your MAC at home, but I would keep showing it until some listened. I know what you are thinking: If they left the house and went to a church the movie would be pointless. That is a valid point; however, the movie would have been more effective if took place over, say, 5 days before the reality of what was happening took hold. You can fool your mind for 3 to 5 days, but after 20? After seeing all that on video? I personally would be freaking the out. I do not care how nice your girlfriends breast are, any guy would be out of there. At least take her to a hospital to look at the bite mark. It the Blair Witch, they could not escape the woods. Katie doesn't even call her parents. Anyway, it was entertaining and I enjoyed it. Try not to see this movie with a young crowd (i.e. late Friday or Saturday night). Most of the audience members in my viewing were teenagers and they totally took me out of the film by talking, yelling, trying to scare their friends, and just being silly. It is a natural way to deal with fear but it is still annoying. Also, do not see it alone, if you dare.."

Yes, we figured out the relationship of the two characters and yes, we understood that while the boyfriend Micah was supportive, he also could be childish and bad at listening. The thumps in the night were scary and yes, as a girl that believes in ghosts, it sent my heart sailing. It went so up and down the whole movie though. I will say, the last 20 minutes were worth the money and definitely sent my face sailing downward because I really did not want to watch. But I really can't decide. At some points I found it scary and others, ridiculous. I can't even decide if I could recommend without saying you must go into this movie with the mindset of being scared."

"zetes","8","2","13","11 October 2009"," There were real screams in the theater
","A ""found footage"" horror film along the lines of The Blair Witch Project, and the best of its type since Blair Witch. It may be even a tad better than it, though it certainly shares some of its central problems, mostly in that the characters aren't at all interesting. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat play a couple that has recently moved in together into a large, empty house. Lately, they have been experiencing some strange phenomena, like appliances and faucets turning on by themselves and things moving around on their own. They've also woken to footsteps in the night. Katie has had similar experiences several times in her life before, and is, of course, freaked out that they seem to be starting up again after a long lull. Micah, on the other hand, is excited and comes home one day (as the film opens) with a brand new, super-expensive camera with which he hopes to capture some of the paranormal activity. He sets it up every night in their bedroom and records everything on his laptop. The couple also consults a psychic, who warns against the camera, saying that any attempts to communicate with the possible spirit might make it stronger. Sure enough, the occurrences grow more and more prominent. While the film is fairly predictable, it's great at building tension. Its stroke of genius is that, every night, the film returns to that static shot in the bedroom. It never rushes anything as we silently observe the open door to their bedroom and the darkness behind it, knowing that at some point something weird is going to happen. Every time it returns to that set-up, we know it'll get worse, and ultimately I didn't even want to open my eyes when it arrived back at night. The film is smart never to go over the top, always keeping things very small. Unfortunately, I think its own smallness is going to kill it when more people wander out to see it. Audiences wanting big reveals and in-your-face gore are going to be too dumb to appreciate something like this. I saw it with a great crowd, fortunately. Surprisingly, most of them were teenagers, but they were very respectful. As the film went on, whenever they got to the bedroom sequences the silence was audible. And this was the only movie I think I've ever seen where people actually screamed. Honest to God, there were screams! And then laughter, because it was very funny to hear that in a theater, but that was okay, too."
"GloriousGooner","6","1","5","3 April 2010"," Relatively effective
","For the first half Paranormal Activity starts to shape up as a seriously decent little horror film shot quickly on a shoe string yet eliciting some genuinely scary atmosphere from the innocuous household setting. It's a far more restrained affair than Poltergeist, and uses a subtly dark sound mix to ratchet up the tension far more effectively than Blair Witch ever could. But like i said: that's just the first half. Once we, the audience, have accepted that the malevolent presence in the house is going to do little more than walk around menacingly, occasionally banging on stuff, the threat evaporates and the film's sole strength - the unknown element of where it's all going is gone with it. There's little appeal in the amateurish performances and the hand-held camera-work gets the job done whilst adding nothing to the overall effect of the shots. At around 90 minutes it's also surprising that there still remain one or two filler scenes that add absolutely nothing to the film. It is worth baring with though for its finale, a little predictable perhaps, far better than the alternate ending certainly, and I for one loved it."

It represents one of the unique living evidences that marketing can sell ANYTHING for what it's not and bring back lots of money WITHOUT any investment.I realized I shouldn't write anything about it because the simple adding of any critic will help this movie anyway whatsoever...even downloading this film from the internet is not worth the price of the telecommunication cost....what did I spend 5 minutes of my time to write this review? I still wonder....."

","First of all, I liked this movie. Is not ground-breaking, is not the best horror film ever, but it is a very decent take on demonic possession and faux-documentary movies. The acting was very good (specially Katie.. Micah I felt was a little overdone) and the first half of it promised a lot horror-wise, IMHO. What I mean by this post's subject is that this movie did exactly what the people who dislikes TBWP criticized that movie for NOT doing. The main criticism I've heard of TBWP is that there's almost nothing in the whole movie to be scared of. Sticks and stones are moved around overnight, the film crew gets lost in the woods, they freak out over noises from the woods... other than the final minutes with something hitting their tents and the final showdown in the abandoned house/cabin, there's almost nothing that can be considered ""paranormal"" in the movie (I mean, all these other things could be logically explained if you wanted to). Nowhere is the witch to be seen. No monster is shown. No real supernatural things are shown in camera. And it still freaked the hell out of most of the people who watched it. This movie (PA) does the opposite on the second half of the movie. It all starts with that Ouija board moving around and being magically burned. Then we learn that the demon is a giant chicken (footprints). And the final scene is just plain ridiculous (the demon face eating the camera in the final shot). That, for me, killed the movie. I insist, I still like it, but it could have been WAY superior had the makers stand their ground of NOT showing too much like they finally did. Once you know the demon is a monster like in any of those cheap B-movies, the movie moves from the realms of deep, real horror to the lighter horror-fantasy. For years I wondered if TBWP would have been better if only they showed a little bit more of the actual witch and/or what she was doing to the film crew, but now I know that the answer is a rotund NO. I am not comparing these 2 movies to say that one is better than the other one, but to say that what one lacks (showing too much in PA) is the strength of the other one (TBWP)."

","I just saw this tonight in the cinema, and a lot of young people were screaming a lot and were quite affected by this movie. It is indeed very effective. The special effects are very good. I thought, perhaps, the acting was a bit weak, but it is more than made up for by amazing effects where you keep thinking: ""How did they do it?"" However, this is more like a real film which has been edited so the whole Blair Witch thing seems to be something else. This cannot have been the couple's camera that we did see. Anyway, the whole thing is very much like a meta-documentary even referring to Monty Python's Holy Grail, I think, at one point Mikah says: ""What is your quest? What is your favorite color"" or something like that, clearly a reference to Monty Python's famous movie. Anwyay, the whole thing is very intertextual and actually quite funny but also quite moving and scary. Highly recommended, especially for fans of fantasy and the occult."
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","5","21 November 2009"," ""Blair Witch"" goes to the next step
","I knew almost nothing about Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" when I went to see it. It starts off a little confusing, focusing on couple Micah and Katie and their San Diego house in September and October, 2006. But then the horrific events begin, as strange, unexplained sounds appear during the night. The only clues are what the camera records as Micah and Katie sleep.<br/><br/>Like ""The Blair Witch Project"", this movie is filmed with hand-held cameras to give an authentic sense of presence with the events. Needless to say, that makes the movie a whole lot freakier than the average horror flick would turn out. And as the movie progresses, you're certain to be more and more on the edge of your seat. Maybe the end is a little silly, but how they throw it at you really catches you.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm glad that I got to see ""Paranormal Activity"", and that it got to have a wide release. In a way, it's actually better than ""TBWP"", because it brings the terror into a suburban house, as opposed to the far reaches of the forest. I certainly recommend it.<br/><br/>So just be careful the next time that you use a Ouija board."
"na-09","9","1","5","10 November 2009"," Scariest movie I have seen
","Paranormal Activity is one of the scariest movie i have ever seen. I watched it about three weeks ago and I still get scared with just the thought of the scariest scenes. It is also sad though because to me it seemed like Micah and Katie were really in love and then she kills him. Even though she was possessed its still sad.<br/><br/>I really don't get scared with unusual movies but this one was so realistic and it was not like a scary guy with a mask following some teenagers around. This was an actual demon and just the way she just stands there starring at her boyfriend. One of the main reasons why it scared me so much is that all this happens at night, and every house has their own noises but after watching this movie. At night when you hear a noise you get scared and think of the movie. I automatically related to me.<br/><br/>The only bad things I have to say about the movie would be that they say it was made in 2006 but they put car that came out two years later. Ha ha i thought that was funny. That movie was evil to me though specially when she smiles at the camera that is one of the scary parts cause you know its not her smiling its the demon inside her. That just gave me the chills. Honestly if you are a big wimp for scary movies don't watch it, and if you don't get scared easily be prepared to be scared. Specially at the very end when she has that evil smile at night when i get scared and close my eyes i can see that image in my head I hate it. It was very scary i wish i never watched it."
"nshaw","9","1","5","7 November 2009"," Best horror film I've seen in years.
","The film does a good job of using the reactions of the characters and subtle cues to imply activities are taking place without relying on CGI or other features modern viewers are accustomed to. However, the subtle nature of the film will turn off viewers who were expecting a mindless tour de force of gore and shock. The demon in the film is made more believable due to the fact that its existence is implied through what first appears to be common phenomena.<br/><br/>The only flaw in the film is that a contrived and out-of-place ending was forced upon the director by influences in Hollywood who were threatening to can the film permanently. I am not mentioning what the ending is, so this is not a spoiler. So, if you notice the end was a little silly, you are not alone. Hopefully, the DVD will contain the movie as it was intended by its director."
"goofnut569","10","1","5","2 November 2009"," A masterpiece
","I'm a huge fan of the horror genre and I'm the first to tell you, if there's a bad movie out, there's a solid chance it's a horror movie. Rarely do horror movies truly leave us frightened and disturbed like this one. Many people are skeptical of this movie's actual quality and credit it's popularity to the hype machine of the internet. While I could spend some time discussing that aspect, that's not what I'm here to do. This movie supersedes most horror films because it was crafted with a suspense that builds up as the movie progresses and because the performances are absolutely pitch perfect, particularly that of leading lady, newcomer Katie Featherston. (who is one of the most gorgeous actresses to pop up in recent years) It plays on the innate fear of what you can't see rather than trying to shock you with some sort of gruesome death sequence. If you have no belief in ghosts whatsoever, you may not find this venture to be so terrifying. Personally I have a very active imagination and loved every nerve fraying minute of it. It starts off a bit slow but only for the purpose of getting to know the characters. The boyfriend in this, portrayed by newcomer Micah Sloat, changes from a cocky skeptic to a man out to protect his woman from something he doesn't understand at all. He's not the most likable character ever portrayed but he is portrayed with the same definite realism as the rest of the movie. This movie is not one to be missed. It's frightening and while it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it uses established tricks and themes better than any film I've encountered. Paranormal Activity is an example of why I love movies and of what can be done with a little bit of talent and technical know how. Bravo to everyone involved in this gem of an exemplary indie horror film. Bravo!"

","~Paranormal Activity~ I didn't buy into the hype of Paranormal Activity being the ""scariest movie ever"" because I didn't want to be let down. Is this the scariest movie of all time? No, but it's VERY INTENSE. There's a lot of people who don't like the film, are bashing it, & it's upsetting me. If you bought into the hype, you're going to be disappointed & it's not the movie fault.<br/><br/>For the budget this movie had, they did a darn good job with it. People need to remember this was an independent film. The actors & story were flawless. The main thing the movie does is build up suspense. It's really slow, yet interesting, but things get worse & worse.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet then I encourage you to NOT view the trailers if you haven't already. The main trailer spoils WAY too much & makes you have high expectations over the level of fright reactions. I believe that most of the people slamming this movie bought into the hype, believed the trailer reactions, & were upset the entire movie: or they're just really young.<br/><br/>As the suspense builds up, the fresh viewers will be scared out of their mind wondering what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>Personally, I've never been scared by a movie before: only slightly disturbed by The Exorcist. Yet, a few certain moments of this film & certain disturbing acts by Katie almost got to me. I covered my mouth in shock at the most intense moments because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I got so hyped by them that I couldn't wait to share it with people.<br/><br/>Aside from all the claims about how scary PA is, I still believe the movie is of high quality. It's interesting, it's fun, it's creative, it's suspenseful, had a few insane moments, & does not deserve the immature bashing it's getting from ignorant teenagers. Hollywood has blinded people with gore, special effects, loud sounds, & numerous other things. This is a quality suspense movie that only the wise folks can enjoy. I wish I could share more about the film but I swore to not spoil. The only reason I didn't give PA a perfect score is due to the fact that it didn't scare me out of my mind & the intense moments were a tad bit too minimal.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>The number of negative votes my review is getting proves my point. IMDb should have an age limit of at least 21. Nothing but angry little teenagers are doing this to my review."
"eytand94","10","1","5","24 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity Is A Pure Horror Movie!
","""The Blair Witch Project"" was a box-office hurricane due to its frightening, realistic vibe. And after movies that tried to imitate it, such as ""Cloverfield"" and ""Quarantine,"" we finally get a horror movie in the vein of the 1999 creepshow. ""Paranormal Activity"" is a haunted house movie in the vein of ""Blair Witch."" This is the phenomenon that many people have demanded in their city. Brace yourself, because this movie is the most suspenseful, creepy, and absolutely terrifying ghost story since ""The Haunting."" <br/><br/>Katie and her boyfriend Micah have just moved into a house in San Diego, California. Katie is all but well. For years, she has been haunted by something, and she's afraid that ""something"" might still be with her, in their house, waiting for them. So, Micah, being the obnoxious skeptic he is, buys a video camera and sets it up in their upstairs bedroom so he can record any strange events while they sleep. What goes on is a lot more than strange. It's downright traumatizing.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" is the most effective horror movie in years, maybe even decades. Why? <br/><br/>1) Well, first off, it's so damned suspenseful. Director Oren Peli begins the film with a slowly building tension. Then the tension gets higher and higher, and, therefore, becomes unbearable to handle. Even the strongest horror movie buff might find it hard to sit through. Every time Katie and Micah go to sleep, you are paralyzed in fear, hoping that whatever's haunting them will leave them the hell alone.<br/><br/>2) It messes with your mind. ""The Blair Witch Project"" never showed the witch, but left it up to your imagination to figure out what was happening. Although that's a smart move, ""Paranormal Activity"" shows all of the supernatural phenomena that it's supposed to. A lot of the times I was screaming at the screen, and hurling myself into the edge of my seat. Never, and I mean never, has that happened to me that often in a horror movie.<br/><br/>3) It feels real. The movie begins and ends with no credits, almost like it's actual footage of real ghostly encounters. I believed in the movie, and so will you.<br/><br/>4) Finally, the acting is perfect. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are so believable on the screen because they don't look like they're acting. This feels like an actual couple who really are experiencing weird stuff in their house. You felt for them.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Paranormal Activity"" might be better than ""The Blair Witch Project."" It's definitely one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen. Even if I did see it during the day, it still leaves a profound impact on you for a long time to come. It's amazing what you can do with just 11,000 dollars. What did Oren Peli do? He created a masterpiece. This is one movie that is not for the faint of heart, and not for people who just expect gore. This is for those who love psychological horror movies like ""The Haunting"" and ""The Others."" You won't be able to sleep for days. And most of all, you must never see it alone. This is the one we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>P.S. What a terrifying ending."

"abbychick41","10","1","5","17 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity is......................
","EXCELLENT!!!!! This movie is by the best horror movie this year so far. It may not be the scariest movie of all time but it really, really comes close to that rank. The film stars Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston who basically play themselves in the movie as a couple. Katie begins to experience paranormal events that have been going on in her house and Micah her boyfriend gives the suggestion of buying a camera and actually filming the paranormal activities that have been occurring in their residence.<br/><br/>What me and my boyfriend really love about this movie is that it doesn't really rely on loud music and cheap scares instead the movie scares the viewer psychologically. You really have to rely on your imagination to know what is going on because the camera would just be focused on the bedroom for a minute or two and all you can hear are footsteps and creaking of the floor and loud bangs as well as inanimate objects moving to place to place by itself. Another thing we love about this movie is the whole build up, it starts off slow with just the couple being just a regular couple discussing the whole situation and as the movie progresses the paranormal events start to be more malevolent as it goes along and we really love how the movie feels real and looks like a homemade movie. AND PEOPLE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THE FINAL CLIMAX OF THE FILM! <br/><br/>All in all a fantastic horror movie with great performances, great premise and great scares and perfect execution with all with just a budget of $11,000. P.S. its the perfect date movie :)"
"crow1701","8","1","5","17 October 2009"," Does the movie live up to the hype? HELL YES!!
","Do yourself a favor. Before seeing this film, go to the theater without knowing anything. Don't read anything or look at spoilers. Just let it be u, the movie, and the dark. Mooooo ha ha!! Ohh sorry! I saw this movie last night with a friend of mine, and to say that it freaked me out is an understatement.<br/><br/>The one lesson that I have learned from watching suspenseful films is our imaginations are more scary to us than being fed scary scenes from a film and told what to think. I will not presume to talk about any scene n this film for it would ""spoil"" the experience.<br/><br/>Hitchcock said that suspense is a bomb under a table that never explodes. Well n this film there is a bomb that doesn't explode, then does explode, and then does a dance. It is a film that will keep u on the edge of ur seat the entire time. It is rare that u see a film that lives up to the hype,but this $15,000 film delivers and delivers big!! I know that most of what I have said has sounded generic; however, I don't want to say too much because more information other than the trailer could ruin the experience. I will leave this last thought. Something happened at the end of the film that has never happened to me before. When the movie ended, no one moved. People were stuck n their seats and no one was leaving. To me, it seemed as though they were frozen with fear for an entire minute. When a film has that much power, u need to do yourself a favor and see it."
"Goken21035","10","1","5","12 October 2009"," A Very Scary Film.
","I saw Paranormal Activity late Saturday night on Oct. 10. I can say with utter certainty that it is the only horror film I've ever seen that's gotten me to shield my eyes during some scenes (somewhat, anyway). I'm not exactly an expert on horror films, and there are quite a few I've not seen yet, but I've seen my fair share. This film is among the scariest, if not *the* scariest, that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Things begin quietly enough, with the viewers introduced first to Micah, the man behind the camera, and then to his lovely girlfriend, Katie, with whom he is living. He explains that he wants to record any of the paranormal activity Katie says she has witness on camera, if it actually occurs. Katie is initially resistant to the idea, but goes along with it.<br/><br/>Katie's keys wind up in the middle of the floor downstairs during the first night. Their door moves on its own on the third night. Minor things at first. Little, subtle things that catch you off guard, but make you think ""This is nothing! I can take it!"". My friend, how wrong you'll find you are.<br/><br/>When the couple consults a psychic regarding the haunting, they learn it's being carried out by a demon who has attached itself to Katie. The psychic cannot help them, though, because he is not a demonologist, so he refers to them to one. This seems to unnerve Katie a bit, especially as things escalate. It doesn't help when, one night, she gets out of bed and turns to stare at it (and Micah) for over two hours, eventually going downstairs to sit on a bench outside. Micah eventually wakes up and looks for her and tries to coax her back in, but she refuses, saying she wants to stay outside. He gets fed up and goes back in to get some blankets because he intends to stay out with her, but suddenly she's back in their room. She says that she has no memory of what just happened at all and doubts that she was sleepwalking.<br/><br/>What I really love about this film is how subtle the events occurring in the house are at first, slowly building as the atmosphere of creepiness eventually turns to outright fear. Yes, ""atmosphere"". ""Creepiness"". This is not a film loaded with over-the-top visuals and special effects. This is not a film for those who want to see a scary-looking demon step out from the shadows and laugh some deep-bellied laugh. You won't get that, because that's implausible. This movie is built around atmosphere, a slow plot, and most of all, believability. The things happening in the house are things that actually scare people when they're up at night in their darkened homes. Floorboards creaking, a door swinging a little on its own, some bangs and footsteps...these are the things people are terrified of witnessing at home, and they are exactly how the events in Paranormal Activity begin to unfold.<br/><br/>A couple bangs over the course of a few nights are heard, quite loud ones. When the two go to investigate, they found a chandelier downstairs swinging on its own, as if due to an earthquake...but nothing else is moving. It's dead silent aside from their voices.<br/><br/>Micah decides to put some baby powder in front of their bedroom door, as well as some in the hallway leading away from their room. The idea is that, if something really is in the house, whatever it is may step in the baby powder and leave tracks.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what happens. As Micah and Katie sleep, footsteps are heard. These are not the typical pitter-patter of human steps. No, these are louder, more purposeful, and much heavier than that. They are the steps of the demon, and as it enters their room, it leaves tracks in the baby powder. At first, you may wonder why a demon would bother doing this, but that's what's so creepy about it. The demon doesn't care that it's leaving tracks. If anything, he wants them to be found to further frighten the house's inhabitants, and it works.<br/><br/>Micah wants to experiment further by getting a Ouija board, but Katie absolutely refuses because she doesn't want the demon becoming even more powerful by communicating with it. Micah promises not to *buy* one, but instead *borrows* one. Katie is furious and demands that he not use it as they both leave the house for several hours. Despite Micah not using the board, though, an invisible force is seen moving the cursor around, and eventually the board is set on fire. When they return, Micah sees a strange image burned onto the board, but Katie refuses to hear any of it.<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie, Katie is gradually unnerved and her fears are fed upon by the demon. It is made stronger by the fact that Micah and Katie argue with each other over the best way to handle the situation, with Katie wanting to call the demonologist and Micah saying he can handle it on his own. Micah challenges the demon to show itself, claiming its acts are pointless and useless. This seems to anger the demon and make it even more powerful.<br/><br/>In a way, this film is a bit like Audition, the Japanese horror flick released ten years ago that scared the hell out of everyone. The whole movie builds up 'til the last 15 minutes or so in Audition. In Paranormal Activity, stuff gets real during the last 20 to 30 minutes. That's when the creepiness felt during the rest of the movie is transformed into outright fear and terror.<br/><br/>But I won't give the ending away. If you've read this much of the review, I suggest you go see this movie. Now. My review doesn't really do it justice. You need to experience it for yourself."

","I was breaking my head trying to see this movie and every time I went to AMC on 42nd it was sold out and these were midnight showings. All this made me want to see this movie more not to mention the trailers and the great DEMAND IT hype!!! So finally this past Friday 10-09-09 me and my wife saw the 6:55 showing at AMC on 42nd street. Quickly noticed that the theater was very packed compared to other times I have gone and the audience was very excited and now came show time. The movie starts off pretty basic you get to meet the couple and see a little of what's it about. Quickly start to realize this is an ordinary couple and there chemistry was great. About 20 minutes into the movie is where the movie quickly picks up steam and you just start saying to yourself this is just a movie. Every time the couple goes to sleep something more terrifying happens. I actually saw 2 couples leave the theater in fear. This movie is very scary and disturbing really what has been lacking in many years for a Halloween release. Very cheaply done for under $15,000 and I assure you, once you get home and lay in your bed you will be looking at your doorway it's very disturbing. My wife had her eyes covered for the last 10 minutes which by far were the most intense. This is a must see and it shows all these Hollywood people you don't need $50 million and tons of CGI to make a terrifying, scary and disturbing movie. This made my top five all-time list of most scariest movies. GO SEE IT!!!"
"Katz5","10","1","5","12 October 2009"," Truly terrifying
","Let me start by saying I don't scare easily. I've seen nearly every famous horror and slasher film, but this movie got under my skin more than any film since The Exorcist. When a horror movie actually prevents you from getting sleep the night you see it, you know it's done its job. This film has been compared to Blair Witch, and rightly so. Like Blair Witch, the build-up is gradual and hand-held cameras are used. And like Blair Witch, the main characters are not Hollywood good looking--they're real and appealing. And they become absolutely unglued as the movie progresses. This is a ""minimalist horror movie making"" at its finest. The movie tips its hat to past classics, like the original The Haunting and Poltergeist, but also reminded me of Open Water in its depiction of a typical American couple thrust into an extraordinary situation, and how that impacts their relationship. I hate to use the cliché of ""don't see it alone,"" but in this case, seeing it with another person may ease the anxiety. And you will want to talk about this movie afterward. Highly recommended."
"joestank15","10","1","5","11 October 2009"," I can honestly say I've never been more terrified.
","Paranormal Activity - Micah and Kate are a couple with a large house and a camera that they will not turn off. This is not a haunted house. Kate is the one who is haunted and has been since she was a child. She is haunted by a ghost so malevolent it is known as a demon. She and her husband are never alone, never safe, and never at ease.<br/><br/>And neither are you.<br/><br/>Brrrrr....This film brings to mind the most primal sense of fear and never stops hammering away at your sense of personal safety. If you've ever had paranormal experiences or just unexplainable ones, this film will bring them all back to the present. It does not stray far from the realm of possibility, unless you count how spacious a home this couple has, and one particularly dim-witted (well several, but what would you do in the situation?) mistake made by Micah. The biggest fear we have is not zombies or vampires, but a conscious malevolent unknown. Bottom line, you never see ANYTHING.<br/><br/>Without giving much of anything away, nor building you up with false promises, I can say this is the scariest film I have ever seen. It's a slow build, yet I felt like I was going through hell at points. It just never ends. And then it does. And it stays with you. I have never been so scared by a film in my life.<br/><br/>This film does it's job brilliantly, and was almost thrown away by the Hollywood folk. It proves just how ineffective the current horror industry is at producing genuine terror like what this film offers. This is eons better than Blair Witch, Cloverfield, or any of the other shaky cam films. It gets a well-deserved A, and is not recommended for people with heart conditions, weak constitutions, and my parents.<br/><br/>A."

This was truly the one of the first movie experiences where I went through every emotion possible and wanting more by the time the end of the movie came. <br/><br/>The sound effects were incredible and completely added to the experience. I was happy about was the usage of CGI in this film. It was very limit but it did not look cheap and cheesy, but completely realistic. The acting was believable nothing was forced and there was no over exaggeration of the characters and the paranormal.

"crazybilby","7","1","6","29 December 2009"," Freaky
","I don't really believe that it counts as this generations ""The Exorcist"" but that doesn't matter, it's still quite good. It's not a series of screeching heads popping up to get cheap shocks out of the audience. The audience is in the dark and the screen is dark. You sit, and wait, and wonder what's going to happen next, and sometimes it's just really bizarre. It was incredibly suspenseful and the pauses are larger than some other movies which would've made it boring if it didn't capture your attention so simply and effectively. At first it seems like the entity is a serious lightweight with such spooky tricks as moving someones keys to the middle of the room at night and only making one thing go thud in the night but it manages to escalate to the point where it's not so subtle, but not so grand and amazing, but still really freaky. It's pretty clever n that respect and just goes to prove that budget isn't needed to make a film good.<br/><br/>When Katie screeches it's really kind chilling. It's not got the whole generic teenager in slasher film sort of screaming. It was awfully chilling and freaky. As for Mika, he was an idiot. He was an absolute idiot who kept saying that he could handle it, he was in control and that he was making progress when really he just made things a lot worse. Thankfully his tool-like nature was not so extreme to be apparent instantly or ruin the movie.<br/><br/>The relationship breakdown between the two as the movie progresses was very realistic and that part of the story was actually filmed more believably than in Cloverfield. In Cloverfield the ""OMG A MONSTER LETS FILM IT!"" aspect made sense but the ""hey just ignore the camera I'm holding to the side as I film your reactions to me flirting with you"" was just there because it needed to be for the story. The bits between the nights when it's filmed are realistic. It's believable that Mika would film some of it because it doesn't appear to be propped up as a reality TV show.<br/><br/>So it's pretty freaky. It didn't leave me cautious to open doors or make me a little tense as I turned the lights off and went to sleep but it certainly spooked me while I was watching it. The person next to me was covering their eyes and freaking out though!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","6","9 December 2009"," I am immensely happy to see something like this get made today
","I do not believe in the supernatural. Not in the least. I watch films(or read stories) that have such elements in them only when I expect the piece of fiction to be well-done. That is the reason I gave this a chance... and I do not regret it for a second. As is always the case, this works the best if you do allow yourself to be convinced by it. Criticize it based upon its merits. There is no way for you to be unaware of what it's about... it's right there in the title. And I am thrilled to see this, such a recent movie, be done in this manner. The build-up is key. Atmosphere is carefully established and maintained, suspense gradually increases, and the minimalistic approach to the effects is perfect(think The Ring). I hope that the majority of audiences have not forgotten what horror is about, and what it can be. Violence, gore, torture... if the director possesses sufficient skill, none of those will be necessary. With a cast of half a dozen no-names(that can act rather well, and come off as quite natural), this manages to be scary and unsettling, proving just how little is required. The faux documentary style, currently being used for every cliché of the genre, is utilized well here, and things like the camera being put down and left still, the focus being slightly off or the light being a tad unflattering really help make it seem real. I suppose you could argue that the plot is simple. The storytelling is great, with some hints as to what goes on that we don't see(because it isn't recorded), and the delivery of exposition being smooth, not forced. There is humor in this, but it doesn't detract from the mood. The characters are credible and fleshed out. This is not for everyone. The ending is surprising without being one of those irritating out-of-nowhere ones that distract the viewer in an effort to make them forget the lesser parts of the picture. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The hand-held shots do not render you dizzy, and the way this uses sound is masterful. There is relatively infrequent strong language, a little blood and continuous disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine themselves enjoying it from reading this review. 8/10"

","I remember watching the trailer for this movie, and after seeing the poster it didn't get my attention very much! So... a friend of mine invited me to watch this movie at his house with a couple of friends, and there i was. At the beginning it was really boring, i was almost sleeping. But after the first night on the movie, it started to get more and more freaky.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a couple being haunted by a ghost in their home. Simple plot but very effective and scary.<br/><br/>The actors did a really good job, this is the best first person movie ever, It's even better than Rec. The director it's great. And i couldn't believe that they just spent 15 thousand on this movie. It's just crazy...<br/><br/>I must say that i've never been so scared in my whole life, it was a great moment with my friends, and they also played a joke on us, doing tricks to scare us and saying that the movie was real. And it was on a Friday the 13th. The movie is a big 10. You should really watch it, you will have a good scare time."
"johnbobmeister","8","1","6","8 November 2009"," Interesting film
","This is not a summary of the movie, Paranormal Activity. Nor are there any spoilers in the comments below. <br/><br/>I saw the movie and definitely thought it was interesting. However, I've seen a number of reviews on IMDb where reviewers have written that if you watch the movie, you will not sleep afterwards. I found this to be a bit ridiculous. If you don't believe in ghosts and/or demons, you'll find this movie the same way I did: interesting and fun. Nothing more, nothing less. <br/><br/>The acting was good and even some of the lines are funny. I would certainly recommend this film but, on a final note, I took it as seriously as I did ""2012"" with John Cusack."
"zspace","8","1","6","4 November 2009"," A refreshing, scary, mystery-flick with outstanding performances
","First and foremost, the movie is great for what it is: a low-budget, scary, mysterious flick for those nights where you and your girl-/boyfriend want to experience some creepy moments. To get the most out of it, draw the curtains, light some candles, cuddle under a blanket and enjoy the dramatic development of the two main characters: a lovable, young couple you can actually relate to.<br/><br/>Their chemistry is great and in my opinion it's one of the best down-to-earth portraits of a relationship between two young people I have seen. Her performance is outstanding and even though her boyfriend sometimes seems to act a bit too stereotypical (for he's the one who does the illogical decision making appearing in every similar movie) his role fits well into the story.<br/><br/>The story is quite refreshing. It does not depend on overused special effects. In the beginning the atmosphere is simply set up by using tiny hints like shadows or sounds, but you can be sure that every couple of minutes the scare-factor increases, which I really enjoyed. But in my opinion the main focus lies on the characters being thrown into a situation they try to handle as best as they can, upholding their sanity as far as possible.<br/><br/>I respect the opinion of other reviewers. Yes, it's not a flawless masterpiece, but how can you give something like this less than 5 stars? Come on, seriously... This deserves at least 6 to 7 stars. I would like to give this a 10 to simply remedy those overcritical reviews around here, but I won't fall for that and give this a realistic 7.5."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","6","25 October 2009"," The most frightening film of the decade!
","There has lately been a lot of hype around this film, and where a month ago I had never even heard of it, many people saying it was 'so scary' and that some people fainted really brought the hype higher. I tried not to expect something so scary, because no film has ever really physically shaken or scared me that much, but this came quite close. Similar to The Blair Witch Project, it starts off slow and slowly gets under our skins. It had some realistic characters and they did some realistic things, so that is a compliment that is rare in horror films these days. The direction is impressive, as is the camera-work, and very effective. The moments in the night are so suspenseful, and what makes the film truly scary is how some people have had things like this happened to them, and how everyone at one point really thinks about the things that go bump in the night and stuff like that. The film is simple, but very effective, and the experience of watching it was scarier than watching The Blair Witch Project, just because I saw this at a cinema and I saw Blair Witch in a TV screen. I saw it yesterday night, and when I got home, and was alone, I was very creeped out. Props to this film, easily the creepiest film of the last 20 years next to The Blair Witch, and one of the best."
"paul-575-471683","10","1","7","9 November 2009"," Awesome Movie!
","I had just got done watching this movie at http://www.extremo-movies.com/pn/index.html ..A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.<br/><br/>I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a tri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theatre, only heightened my enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>The audience I went with, all had a collective ""Oh My God"". I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theatre holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.<br/><br/>Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice.<br/><br/>Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialogue, the ease the tension.<br/><br/>The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen."
"tk72988","10","1","7","7 November 2009"," Scariest Movie I've Seen In Years.
","Few movies come out that truly affect me. Blair Witch Project, Noroi: The Curse, REC, and Paranormal Activity can be added to the list.<br/><br/>My first experience with a truly scary horror movie was The Blair Witch Project. I was 12 at the time of seeing this so you can expect my natural response. Not being able to see what was actually happening was terrifying and this was my first taste of a true horror movie. For a while I believed it was real. I read the documentaries, the books, the whole lot. But lo and behold, MTV Music Video Awards that year, the three teenagers showed up. My heart sank. But in actuality, the legends of the story were supposedly true, the background, Rustin Parr and all that. I had to sleep with my light on that very night. Make fun of me all you want, but I was young, and to this day I still love that movie.<br/><br/>Movie goers and horror fans beware. If you aren't into the slightly campy buildup into a horrifying experience, look elsewhere. Rob Zombie fanatics (I like his movies but they don't scare me), beware. Slasher aficionados be very aware. It is not your typical horror movie. It pulls you in, making you think its real. Pay no attention to the trailer, as the boyfriend flying into the camera scene never made it to the final cut, which I'm glad. It would've been too over the top. There aren't any real jump scares, its the whole realism aspect that affected me. I do in fact believe in ghosts, regardless of my views on organized religion, which I will not go into...<br/><br/>I won't give any spoilers away, but I will say, this is the first movie I watched twice in the same night (well it was actually morning, but it was still dark out.) I had to go back, find the little details, and I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. But like I said, not everyone will like it. If it wasn't so over hyped, more people would've enjoyed it. Considering it started out as an Independent film in 2007. But don't let that deter you. I can honestly say Paranormal Activity blows Blair Witch out of the water, which is not easy to say. The subject matter makes you truly think. See this on big screen, or a very large television set once it hits DVD. It is worth a movie ticket without a doubt.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10"

Especially if your house looks very, very similar to the one in the movie. Unfortunately, my bedroom looked very, very similar to the one in the movie, and when my harddrive enclosure exploded when I came home, I was freaked out.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Katie and Mika, Mika is the one with the camera, is haunted by a demon. Mika is the one recording it all. This is not like Cloverfield. Trust me. If you are expecting a seizure, go see Cloverfield.

","I was really surprised reading through to find so many bad reviews of this film. I honestly don't think any serious horror movie fan would call it ""dumb"" ""lame"" or ""boring"".. what is wrong with people nowdays?? People have become jaded because of awful Hollywood remakes of good films and ""torture porn"". All people want to see is violence and blood and anything less is ""not scary"". This movie really made me think of old Hollywood horror when the use of special effects were much more limited. Filmmakers had to use other means to scare people and it was equally, if not more effective! You have to appreciate this when watching the movie because the horror is very subtle and building. You have to put yourself in the actors' shoes; it's much more ""could this really happen?"", than it is terrifying in your face.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you have ADD, no, you're not going to like the movie. But if you have an appreciation for the fine art of subtlety and creativity in horror, you will not be disappointed."

","OK where to begin??? I heard about this movie from a friend and watched the Trailer and read all about it. So I was so excited from all the hype yet so prepared to be disappointed from the negative feedback I read as well. My advice is to go see for yourself when you can. If you go expecting to see a bad ghost film then thats what you will get. However, If you go with an open mind to realistic possibilities and just put yourself in their situation, then you may just get a good scare. Honestly I've never seen a scary movie that made me scared to leave my seat, but there are those that stick in your head and scare you later when you're alone. I would say this is one of them. You may jump at loud noises and get scared in the theater, but I think this movie was designed to make you keep thinking about it. Why?,Why not? Why didn't they?,and Wtf?? (spooky) So I guess my final thought would be to see this with an open mind, forget comparing to other movies and forget all that Hollywood action and FX. See their home as it was your own and you may just get one hell of a supernatural thrill."

","This is one of those films that I always heard about but never predisposed to see ... until yesterday. I already knew, and some reading to prepare this criticism confirmed this information to me, that this is one of the most profitable low-budget films ever, as it was quite cheap to make and made a huge commercial success, marking the cinema of terror, like it or not the marks left.<br/><br/>The script is simple: it is like watching a home video, where a young couple seeks to document the paranormal phenomena that are happening in the house where they live. There are no initial credits, the final credits have been reduced to what is required by law for commercial exhibition, there is no soundtrack, the filming is done with a homemade camera and everything is reduced to the simplest. This makes the movie look authentic and the special effects added are so compelling that they work very well. The ending is a little out of place because it is more exaggerated, but at least it provides a good climax.<br/><br/>The cast is small but capable and competent. Katie Featherston is easily the soul of the film, but Micah Sloat has a good relationship with her, although he's never been so good and his character is more annoying. The most boring part of this film, being a film based on homemade ""security camera"" footage, is that there are a lot of minutes where we are simply looking at a static scene waiting to see something happen."

","An interesting and thought-provoking horror flick, but ultimately unfulfilling. The film does indeed have a unique and fun concept, and the way it is short makes for some truly new claustrophobic horror that hasn't been truly done this way before. The actors do a rather decent job in whole, even though there is probably about 4 of them, the movie does depend on them and they are able to carry the film for the most part quite nicely. The film is only about an hour and a half long, but the pacing of the film makes the entertainment factor ultimately fall rather flat. The film can be engaging at times, but at times you can't help but feel distant and even a bit annoyed at the fact that this film can't seem to do as much as they could with the scenario. In the end, Paranormal Activity is a fun found footage film, which like Blair Witch, is able to hold itself rather well with the actors, but rather flimsy when it comes to concluding a true story.

","First of all, I hope IMDb will allow me to share my review with you, I've been trying to do it but i couldn't...as if it were a paranormal phenomenon...
Jookes aside, i'll tell you one more thing before the review, i don't speak english.<br/><br/>The Review:
You know, i'm a newbie into the filmverse, i enjoy it so much that i need to eat movies these days...and with a friend, we decided to start watching ''horror'' movies (you can check them in my unique list).<br/><br/>After watching Child's Play, Saw and other independent films like Videodrome, we started Paranormal Activity. And the problem began on the first minutes.
The man is unrelatable, we can't empathize with him, he's just an hypocrite.
He starts with some ''i bought this camera for _______'' and decides to help his girlfriend with it, but later he doesn't care, he didn't even ask help for her while having the means, and that already kicks the plot for us, the viewers. The fact that one of the two protagonists is already so poorly developed, causes a void in the viewer, who wants to see a guy whose relevance is such that he throws it overboard? 
No one.<br/><br/>In the other hand, we have Katie.
Unfortunately, even if she is a promising character, she doesn't convince us.
Why? Her decisions take second place to those of her boyfriend, and it makes us powerless, because we know that the means she wants to take because of the circumstance in which she finds herself are more than justified.<br/><br/>The shooting decisions are regrettable.
No, it's not about how much money was used or not, it's about pure and simple decisions.
Focusing the camera on a room in dead time is not scary, it is not suspenseful, and it is boring.
It's an unbearable film, I'm sorry, if the director was even me, I could have taken more potential out of the premise.
There are better movies from that genre, check Poltergeist if you want, the old or the new one. :)"

","A simple and extremely low budgeted film that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Shot with nothing less than a panoramic camcorder we take a voyeuristic ride into the spirited paranormal.A couple are terrorized by an unseen force. First, they try to film it - then they fight to stay alive. <br/><br/>
The one thing that stands out to me is over and over again they keep doing the same thing, waiting way to long to call ANY other demonologist or exorcist. I was tremendously surprised the film had solid editing and the two actors were amazingly realistic in their approach.Each time the film transitions from day to night the footage switches, not being hand held but to stationary on tripod, but to the same static bedroom shot. Because the camera never moves, you're encouraged to scrutinize every single shadow. Your eyes will pick up every sense of that room. When your senses are heightened to that extent, any sudden moves deliver twice the force.<br/><br/>
By any means this is not an OSCAR film but in sequence that relishes the mind and senses of horror. Next time you hear something go bump in the night, there's a chance - just a chance - that thoughts will turn to that static bedroom... and a hint of something moving. I give it a solid 6/10"

That's why this is a great horror film. I remembered when I was around 15 and couldn't even see half of it because it was too scary for me, but watching it now when I'm 20 it's still scary but I can barely see the whole movie.

","I recently watched this movie and since there has been so much hype about it i went in with high expectations and some what skeptical if i wud like but i am happy to say i did like it. The premise is simple but its the way it is presented is what makes it scary. I am not a big fan of jump scares and i believe a good horror movie should as few jump scares as possible and instead just create tension that can instil fear and that is what this movie does well. It is creepy in the sense it doesn't throw things in ur face , u just notice them on your own.
Its breathtakingly fresh and original atleast to my knowledge since i have watched a lot of horror movies.
Verdict : 7/10 i think it's a good horror movie and presents everything it had in a scary fashion. I knocked few points because i think it could have been made more scary with addition of few more scares and upgrade of soundtrack, but nevertheless i would still recommended it."

That was horrible enough. <br/><br/>How can anyone even consider this a film? There's hardly any acting, and all it consists of is set props and cheesy effects. I'm sure they had strings and a lot of CGI working together. ""Oh my god the door just shut."" Or, ""did you hear that?"" Come on now. You tell me how that is entertainment. Anyone can do that at home. It was probably the cat running around at night or something. <br/><br/>This particular film reminded me of those ""B"" movie projects that people make at film festivals.

","I had a feeling I knew what this film would be like before I entered the theatre, and unfortunately my fears were realised. <br/><br/>Despite the incredible hype for this film as a 'terrifying film', I found it to be boring and aggressively average.<br/><br/>There is nothing new about the plot. Boy and girl are harassed by malevolent presence and one of them dies. The only new thing is the found footage element, which is done very badly. The cameraman is bad at controlling the camera, the footage is blurry in parts, and the sound is extra fuzzy. Cheap tricks are used to try and make people scared, but every jumpscare is cued by a sound effect which makes it awfully easy to realise when one's about to happen. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity has remarkably little scares for a film that seems to invite horror from the opening titles. In the end it just felt like I was watching a guy being an asshole to his girlfriend for far too long, and said guy perhaps had a cat that could turn on lights in a malevolent manner or something to further torment said girlfriend. <br/><br/>It's really bad when you end up siding for the antagonist in films like this. <br/><br/>Not recommended."

"TheMovieDoctorful","2","0","3","19 May 2015"," As Someone Who Actually Liked The Later Entries...
","The odd thing about this review is that believe it or not, I actually LOVED the later installments of the Paranormal Activity franchise (4 and Marked Ones) Contrary to popular opinion and belief, I think these movies get slowly better and better with each film, correcting the errors of the previous films and learning and evolving with time. That being said...The first Paranormal Activity is an extremely dull, insipid and unscary film that occasionally borders on unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>Look, I love found footage movies when done well. They're among the few horror movies that can legitimately scare me, and movies like The Blair Witch Project, (REC), Unfriended, The Bucks County Massacre and Afflicted are among my favorite films of all time. The difference between those movies and the first Paranormal Activity are that those films are tense and exciting, and know how to create an effective sense of dread. The first Paranormal Activity has none of that. The ghost here does extremely little, and what little it does is hardly ""supernatural."" Most of it just borders on the verge of ""slightly unusual.""<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the acting is among the worst I've ever seen in a horror movie. For a found footage movie, where the realism and the ability to make you believe you're watching real life horror are perhaps the most important qualities, this is a death sentence. Katie and Micah overact and underact, and not once did I feel like I was watching real people react to real supernatural horrors. Katie Featherstone in particular delivers a truly Razzie worthy performance, never seeming to react to anything like a normal human would.<br/><br/>This brings me to the film's most fatal flaw; the key to a good and scary ghost movie or story is to make the ghost actually threatening and dangerous. This is something that movies like Grave Encounters, Unfriended and The Blair Witch Project understand. Again, the first Paranormal Activity does not. The ghost doesn't hurt the two protagonists and it doesn't do enough strange or unexplainable things to psychologically torture them (Unless you are the kind of person who is traumatized by a slight breeze moving a door, then this movie may shock you to your core) If a ghost isn't a major threat to the protagonists, and it doesn't do anything particularly malevolent or antagonistic, where am I supposed to be scared of it? When the ghost actually DOES do remotely threatening or unexplainable things, the pathetic acting completely kills any horror that the audience might have experienced otherwise. The chief example would most likely be the demon screeching scene, which could and would have been terrifying if delivered by people who could actually...You know...Act and react like real people.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie is so bad and so unintentionally funny, it seems like something out of a parody of a found footage horror movie rather than a real found footage horror flick. It tries SO hard to scare you with Micah's hilariously over-the-top and abrupt death scene and an INCREDIBLY forced final jump scare from a possessed Katie, I just can't help but laugh. Whether it was genuinely funny or I was just laughing in contempt at this pathetic excuse for a horror film is something I may never know. <br/><br/>I understand this movie has a VERY big fanbase, and I respect their opinion. Hell, I'll even admit to LOVING some of the sequels. But as hard as I try (And I tried HARD), I can't bring myself to love this one. It's just a terrible, terrible horror movie and a crappy start to an admittedly decent horror franchise."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","6","0","1","1 March 2015"," I just don't get what makes it so wonderful...
","Paranormal Activity sounded really cool and I love found footage-style movies like Sinister and The Ring, so I decided to watch it. Well, it's not a bad movie per-say, I just don't get why people rave about it as if it's this far out, incredibly scary experience. The characters were shallow, the plot was unoriginal and the effects were really lame. I could make a similar movie with my super 8 home movie camera and it would probably turn out creepier than Paranormal Activity. Anyone with access to a video recording device could probably do better. I almost fell asleep watching Paranormal Activity, it was boring as hell.<br/><br/>On the bright side it does evoke a creepy atmosphere with the house at night. For the right kind of person Paranormal Activity could be seen as very scary, but I just didn't see anything horrific or original enough in it to make me enjoy it."
"Red-Barracuda","9","0","1","29 August 2014"," Genuinely terrifying film made on a micro-budget
","Perhaps the most amazing thing about Paranormal Activity is that it was made for only $15,000. This is truly about as low budget as you can get, it's nothing basically. When watching it, while it was obvious it was very lo-fi, I would never for a second have though it could have been made for so very little. The main reason being was that it was so incredibly effective. I'm fairly jaded in terms of horror movies, in that I have seen loads and don't get scared by hardly any these days. This movie actually genuinely rattled me. Whenever I saw that timer slow down on the video camera in the middle of the night I was immediately on edge. When it comes to gut reactions such as this it isn't always easy to say why they happen but this movie touched a nerve that is for sure. One reason I am sure was that it used its low-budget to its advantage and made the events caught on home video seem like the kind you could relate to; the banality of the day scenes added a definite reality that drew you into the situation much more than if the film had the distancing effect of cinematic gloss. The effect was one famously used by The Blair Witch Project (which incidentally cost four times more to make) but for my money Paranormal Activity is the better movie, in that its characters are easier to empathise with and their situation is easier to relate to, after all everyone experiences the atmosphere of a darkened house on a nightly basis.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be a lot of reason to say very much more about this one, as it has already garnered a huge number of IMDb reviews already. But suffice to say, I would consider this to be a perfect illustration of how to make a very successful movie with very little money. It takes considerable skill to do so and the people involved in this nailed it. And thankfully the distributer DreamWorks did not go with their original idea of immediately remaking it and only releasing the original version as a DVD extra! Thankfully test screenings indicated that this micro-budgeted film was really getting to people in a way that would be simply hard to recreate with all the money Hollywood could provide."
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","1","1 July 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Paranormal Activity
","Riding the coattails of such hand held/shaky camera films like Open Water, The Blair Witch Project, and to an effect, Gerry (the last picture mentioned had well known actors in it but the themes are self sufficient), Paranormal Activity is a welcoming success. It's a small scale exercise that generates overbearing tension and surmountable fear. With a small budget, a no-name cast, and no musical score (certain classics like Halloween needed the music so there you go), the tone of this film at times, will shake you. When I initially saw it in 2009, I thought it was moderately effective (in my mind, I have very high expectations for movies of this genre). It didn't scare or haunt me as much as I thought it would. However, I applaud Paranormal Activity for its ability to avoid the gore factor along with getting solid improvisational work from two struggling actors off the street (I think the film was helped by not having a script. It made things seem so much more real). Now granted, the sequels/prequels that came after ""Activity"" wore out the novelty (except for Paranormal Activity 2 which is just as scary if not scarier than the first one) with each rushed installment. But what seemed like a good idea at the time (why not make a movie for $11,000 and see what happens) ended up turning into a national phenomenon. I even applaud director Oren Peli after I found out that he shot the whole thing in his own home (If I lived there, I couldn't sleep in that bed post filming). Let me put it this way, this vehicle represents a Hollywood Cinderella story if there ever was one. Is it the most terrifying scare fest ever? Not quite. Does it possess a certain level of innovation and ominous glare? You betcha.<br/><br/>With an ending that from what I understand, was guided by the hand of financier Steven Spielberg (yes that Steven Spielberg) and containing various sequences that were manned camera-wise by one of its stars, ""Activity"" examines a normal San Diego couple (actors Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat who use their actual names as their character's names) who's house becomes moderately haunted by a demonic spirit. In order to find out the origin of said spirit, Micah decides to film and document the strange happenings thereby provoking/inviting the evil into their lives (not intentionally mind you). This goes on and on throughout the film's short running time to the point where possible possession may be inevitable (the demon is out to get Katie and has been following her since childhood). Micah even buys a Ouija board as a form of extreme measurement (to the dismay of his aggravated girlfriend). By then, you start to feel the walls closing in from an audience standpoint. The unnecessary actions by Micah's character become a plot device implanted so the flick can ultimately carry on. I will say this though, he does add a bit of comic relief here and there. What can I say, it works despite all the dreariness surrounding the situation.<br/><br/>Now as I mentioned earlier, the improvisational masking by the two main players is pretty good. But the most natural and possibly most catatonic performance comes from a psychic named Dr. Fredrichs (played by Mark Fredrichs, a virtual unknown). He warns the two house dwellers that they cannot run from this entity and it will haunt them no matter what. With an obvious sense of sored calamity, he nails his part perfectly where as Featherston and Sloat strain ever so slightly from time to time.<br/><br/>When I put together my plethora of all time greatest horror films, Paranormal Activity is not solely on the list. I'm not biased to scary movies that have a higher budget because they get the job done as well (in case you're wondering, The Exorcist is my all time favorite). But ""Activity"" is a clear benchmark of what a horror film can do with almost virtually no studio-planted resources. It's a solid entry into the world in which people want to be frightened. And it also made a ton of money (there can never be anything wrong with that). If you've seen one of the ghosts shows on ""The Travel Channel"" or ""A & E,"" just think of a more heightened, more eerie, and more horrific experience all together. Paranormal Activity is innovative, surreal in its reality based factualism, and downright curdling in its ""Hitchcockian"" mindset. In terms of movie watching, it's an ""activity"" you might want to pursue."

"BigMe03","6","0","1","27 October 2013"," A Horror Classic
","The order that I saw these films in was: 3, 2, 4, 1; which considering the story isn't a bad order to see them in. I was glad that I watched the original last because it allowed me to realise the reasons why I didn't like the sequels; reasons that I will only touch on in this review. Out of the four movies this was the best one (the original usually is), although the scare tactic that these films are famous for was lost on me by the time I had got around to seeing this one, I feel this is the strongest story-wise.<br/><br/>Unlike the sequels, this movie begins with Micah operating a camera he has just bought to set up in his and Katie's bedroom because mysterious things have been happening during the night; rather than starting out with one of the protagonist's randomly filming almost every hour of the day for seemingly no reason and then slowly leading into the ghostly terror. We then follow the couple's terrifying experience of loud footsteps, slamming doors and a midnight dragging.<br/><br/>The thing that the sequels lacked is drama; they are purely terror driven with almost minimal character development. This film integrates drama with terror giving the audience an emotional connection with the leading characters. For example, towards the end of the movie there is a scene when Katie has an emotional break down on the bed and Micah is trying his best to console her but to almost no avail. This scene is powerful and dramatic and the emotion spills off the screen and subsequently adds to the sadness of the film's ending, although the sorrow is probably conquered by fear. The development (if there was any at all) of the character's and their relationship creates this strong ending and this is what the sequels seemed to lack. <br/><br/>This film still works as a classic horror piece; watching this movie in the dark late at night right before bedtime is probably not the best idea. The final scene with Katie hovering over Micah for hours is one of the creepiest I have seen in a horror film. For any aspiring filmmaker this film is a wet dream. Made for a budget of only $15000 it has a total lifetime gross of $190 million worldwide (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paranormalactivity.htm) and spawned 3 sequels with a spin-off and a 4th sequel in development. Oren Peli who, according to his IMDb profile, was unknown prior to the release of this film has created a monster of a movie series, whose films have been spit out faster than that of the Saw movie series, another horror classic (original only). It's a common theory that the original is always the best and in this case it is true but it wouldn't be true to say that each sequel has been worse than its predecessor. The third and fourth films were stronger than the second but the third was stronger than the fourth. I am curious to see the fifth instalment but honestly have no interest in seeing the spin-off movie (Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones). A classic horror movie overall that would be worthy to be spoken in the same breath as Halloween (1978), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Saw (2004)."

The scares get bigger and bigger , louder and louder , and terrifying. The movie always stays grounded and never has too much happen that takes the realism out. Paranormal Activity actually has 3 endings the original ending was more effective and realistic and made me think it was actually real because I have never heard of the film before. The theatrical ending has a more ""in your face"" kind of ending that's still scary and if less realistic. The alternate ending is the least effective and I can see why it was an alternate ending. It still gives me chills to think about the footprints, and the demon screaming followed by a loud thud and also when Katie is dragged out of bed and down the hallway.

To know that it was shot on such a small budget and still manages to be so effective is a tribute to the flawless direction by Oren Peli and terrific acting by the leads (Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat). Paranormal Activity takes a similar approach to the Blair Witch Project, in that it suggests a lot and shows very little. Though that's more because of the low budget, this works to the film's advantage. The scares are jolting because they're so simple.

","Not so long ago, I wasn't a horror film fan. But my interest in those films started after I read a news on the internet about an incident that happened in the United Kingdom. There, a cinema was jam-packed by mainly children who came in to watch Madagascar 3. However, a mistake occurred. Instead of putting Madagascar 3, the projectionist put in Paranormal Activity 4. This triggered a large scream coming from the cinema, causing some shocked kids to go home immediately, although some remained to finally watched the film they came for. Some time later, a woman, who was watching with her kids, describes the films in the Paranormal Activity series as the scariest of horror films. Because of that, it made me wonder just how scary those films are.<br/><br/>Days after that, I purchase a VCD of the first Paranormal Activity film and watched it. Although it is a homemade film, what perhaps made it score well in the box office is that it has original themes. In the film, each night is counted and monitored. And as the movie progresses, the things that happen at night get more and more bizarre. This is definitely one of the best films in the horror genre."

I'm not exactly sure what he thinks he's going to do if he finds something, and to be honest, I don't think he's exactly sure either. He just wants to see something neat, just like anyone who watches sixty minutes of ""Ghost Hunters"" hoping to see eight seconds of a chair falling over on it's own.<br/><br/>But we're not dealing with ghosts in this movie, no sir. We have a full fledged demon on our hands. And the fact that this thing is not human already has my skin crawling. I kind of believe in ghosts, and I kind of really believe in demons, although I know better than to do what Micah does and go egging them on. They're best left alone.<br/><br/>However, if he did that, we wouldn't have a movie, now would we? So Micah taunts the demon, after some very small movements and some lights turning on and off in the house on video. He manages to get a growl on his Digital Voice Recorder, but thinks it's funny. Hey Micah...that's not funny. You should leave...now.<br/><br/>But no. Instead, he gets some baby powder and finds hoof marks leading to the attic, where he finds a burned picture of Katie as a child. There's more to this picture in later movies, but for the sake of this movie, Katie hasn't seen it before.<br/><br/>I'm getting ahead of myself a bit I think. The scariest, creepiest, most unnerving moments in this film are the ones where Katie just stands rigid for hours staring at Micah. There's no cheap special effects here. It's just downright scary. Don't think so? Wait until you wake up and your significant other is in a comatose state staring at you in the dark.<br/><br/>So more stuff that is laughable happens, like doors shutting and the like. Katie gets breathed on, and scares the holy Hell out of me. A picture of the two of them gets smashed in broad daylight right before that, showing that the demon isn't just a night guy. He's there all the time, watching, waiting, taking his time.<br/><br/>After the demon burns a message into a Ouija board that idiot boyfriend Micah leaves laying out, they decode the message to be a girl who was also once haunted, then possessed, by a demon. The case is very similar to Katie's, and she's mortified, as any sane person would be.<br/><br/>So she calls a modern-day ghostbuster from the beginning of the movie to come back and get rid of the demon. He takes one step in the house, and bolts faster than the Flash. Now I'm worried. The tension is unbearable, and it's only going to get worse.<br/><br/>That night, Katie is dragged down the hallway by the demon, who takes a bite. She spends a little while crushing a crucifix into her hand before Micah takes her upstairs to lay around possessed. He throws the crucifix into the fire because, hey, don't wanna be safe or anything.<br/><br/>Katie tells Micah that everything's fine, in a creepy voice. He's like, ""Okay. Cool. Let's spend the night here again."" So then Katie wakes up and stares at Micah again for an extended period of time before going downstairs and screaming like a banshee. He runs downstairs, starts yelling, and is then thrown at the camera by demon Katie, who crawls towards the camera and eats it.<br/><br/>Or she comes upstairs alone, and slits her throat.<br/><br/>Or she gets shot by police.<br/><br/>None of these are good, and the last two would destroy any chance at the decent sequel they churned out.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie scared the daylights outta me. The subtleness of the demon's power, Katie being outside in a catatonic state in the middle of the night, those kind of things are scary, and I can't say I've seen another movie that does what this one does as effective or terrifyingly realistic.<br/><br/>I highly suggest this. Highly. The sequel? Well, that's for another day.<br/><br/>_______________<br/><br/>For all of the Horror Banana's reviews, visit<br/><br/>http://morozov924.hubpages.com/"
"dancer65781","10","0","3","20 November 2012"," Paranormal Activity is a Surprising Success!
","Paranormal Activity succeeds as a horror movie because of its simplicity. This movie fits the criteria of a modern horror film, including scares, realism, and fear. From the beginning, this movie emphasizes the believability of the young couple's situation, creating fearful audience members. Most of the movie is shot from the perspective of a hand-held camera, like the viewers are watching a surveillance video. The key roles in this movie, Micah and Katie, have chemistry on screen together and are able to portray the story line in a realistic manner. Since the actors are not given a script, and are only given certain direction from Peli, the director, they are asked to come up with their own lines. By not being structured, which makes it more realistic, they pretend the scenario is happening to them and can react as to how they would in real life. Micah and Katie feel trapped in the movie because they cannot escape this demon. Likewise, the audience feels trapped because the emotions of the actors become the emotion of the audience. Another reason why this horror movie is a success at the box office is for the scare tactics. Whenever the night scenes arise in the movie, the fans know that something is about to happen; it's just a matter of when. Timing is an important device directors use in order to make the audience jump out of their seat, according to director Steven Spielberg. The scares are plotted out perfectly in this movie, intensifying as the movie progresses. One of the first nights in the three-week time span, the bedroom door moves slightly on its own. Towards the end of the three weeks Micah was filming, the covers on their bed start to move without any explanation. The demon/evil spirit is never actually seen on the screen; sometimes the unknown can be scarier. Music is an effective device for horror movies, however, silence, in this case, is more effective. The audience watches the screen intently for something to happen, and all of a sudden a loud noise occurs or something happens which makes the viewers jump. The audience does not have to believe in paranormal activity in order to admit it is effective as a device. Although this movie has excessive hype before it came out in theaters, many movie critics and fans thought highly of this ""underdog"" film. Paranormal Activity is a successful horror film that will continue to frighten generations of viewers because of its simplistic story, scare tactics, and realistic actors and plot."

","First of all I would like to say that it takes a lot and I mean A LOT to scare me and this movie scared the #%^! out of me. Of course, I was watching it with a wireless headset pretty loud so I was jumping and screaming at the parts it wanted me to do.<br/><br/>Of course even without the wireless headset this movie is still scary and intense, especially when it comes to the story. First of all you don't see anything in this movie that you would consider a ghost or a demon, instead you hear noises. Yes just noises. But please don't let that fact turn you away. It's the noises and the other incidents in this movie that really give the movie the very creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of found footage films after having experienced the Blair Witch Project (which happens to be one of my favorite horror films of all time!) and this one did not disappoint me at all. In fact I am such a huge fan of this film, as well as it's sequels (aside from the 4th one which I have yet to see).<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this movie is the cliché of all the found footage movies, well most of them anyway, is that from the beginning you know that something terrible happened to them. There are some found footage movies that don't end that way and I appreciate them. But sometimes the cliché works and sometimes it's just over played a little.<br/><br/>Of course it is a worthy entrance into the horror genre and it's definitely worth watching and owning for sure! A great Halloween movie or just a movie you want to watch every now and then to get scared. I love it and so will you!"

If you've seen it, chances are, so have I. I absolutely *refuse* to own or play this film in My home for fear that it may attract evil spirits into My residence. I cannot watch this film and not feel that evil is at work here. Perhaps it is because I actually lived in a house plagued by evil spirits for a while, perhaps I'm reverting to Christian beliefs I once adhered to long ago. This movie definitely struck a cord with Me. A film that powerful definitely deserves respect and My admiration. It is a remarkably effective low budget film documenting a supposed demon that haunts a couple. It's so good, it's scary! Definitely watch, not at your house though!"
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","13 March 2012"," Great use of technology in a modern ghost story
","Heralded by many as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT for a new generation, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is one of those no-budget creepy horror films that work through the powers of suggestion alone to create an intense viewing experience for people watching blessed with vivid imaginations. In essence, this is BLAIR WITCH done in the home: a couple are haunted by what they believe to be a ghost, and set up a video camera to catch evidence of it.<br/><br/>The film is very good, thanks to the strong sense of realism that rarely departs – except maybe during the over-the-top climax, which unsurprisingly turns out to have the involvement of a certain Mr. Spielberg! Although some might find the on-screen antics boring, slightly repetitive and overly staged, I was hooked by the escalating haunting and caught up in a sense of impending menace and doom. There are many great scenes, especially those taking place in the latter half, and the bit with the footprints is supremely disturbing. Kudos too to the actors involved – Micah Sloat is saddled with playing a bit of a jerk, but Katie Featherston is believably scared throughout and reminded me at times of Heather Donohue.<br/><br/>Okay, so that climax – the last few shots – is a little overboard, but until then we get a frightening film that works hard to achieve its aims through simple footsteps and bangs where there shouldn't be. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY bears similarities to BLAIR WITCH, but I actually think it's closer in spirit to horror classic THE HAUNTING, albeit filmed via modern technology. A delight!"
"theinaniloquent","7","0","1","30 October 2011"," ""What happens when you sleep?""
","After moving into a suburban home, a couple becomes increasingly disturbed by a nightly demonic presence.<br/><br/>Cinematic praise! Considered to be the scariest movie of all time! Seen by millions and slowly gained fame. Give me a break... The movie is like Cloverfield. Expect lower budgeted and a horror film. Instead of our pre-digested horror films we have today, Paranormal Activity actually sets new boundaries with an original horror film destined to become a classic. The only reason I say give me a break is the fact that people find this to be remotely scary. I'm pretty sure that is all coming from the teenage age groups but otherwise, no. The characters were lovable, to be honest. Their chemistry, their arguments were all very lifelike and made the film better. The build up and suspense was also nice and you need to picture yourself in the situation they are going through. It is way better that way. Then we have the ending... There is, in fact, three endings to the film. I have only seen two and heard about the other and can draw conclusions that the throat slashing ending is perfect! The others were just horrible. No one knows, in fact, the original ending to the film but all we know is which one is the best and which one is the worst. The best is when she looks into the camera and just slashes her throat. That was a perfect ending to the film. The second ending was when the police arrived and then she slashes her throat. I hate the ending, considering the fact that the police get involved. They should of NEVER put them into their situation. Then the last ending is when she turns into some demon of some sort. Worst ending ever... If we are believing that through all this build up that she was actually possessed the entire time? I literally hated this ending. It needed support to work and failed in many levels. This caused flaws throughout the film. So, that is about it. The film was great, actually. The build up, the characters, that one specific ending, and the rest were all great. It's a very original premise and it is quite entertaining. 7/10."
"michael-neichl-904-632888","8","0","1","30 October 2011"," Really nice, but not without flaws
","I've seen this movie with a good friend of mine and we both thought paranormal activity is one of the better horror flicks from the last century. With that said though, there are definitely some problems with the movie too. For example i have to say the ending *NO SPOILER* (which my friends often say was the most horrifying part) didn't give me much of a thrill, there were some other scenes which were way scarier but thats opinion based. Also some scenes were too long you could argue its to give the audience a little pause and build up for more suspense but at a few moments i really thought the film was unnecessarily stretched out.<br/><br/>But now that I told you my negative parts I have to point out the positive ones as well and Paranormal Activity had a ton of great ideas for modern horror films. For example the suspense: as far as never has there been a film that build up so much uncomfortableness and suspense like this. Every time you see the timer on the camera going from fast to normal you get little thrills not knowing whats going to happen next. There are not that many jump scares but really creepy, frightening scenes. *SPOILER* my favorite being when she gets out of bed stands next to him and just staring at him, or the scene where both wake up and he asks: Did you hear that as well?"" really really good stuff *END OF SPOILER*<br/><br/>So yeah I'd definitely recommend Paranormal Activity to every true horror fan as well as people who usually don't watch these kind of movies because this one truly is something different."
"jacksondavid","Null","0","1","29 October 2011"," My favorite movie ever
","Some people say that it was bad but I will prove them wrong! Okay, some people say there where no scary scenes but the first time I watched it, I had to cover my eyes at the end. Also, some people say that they didn't react normally to the situation. SO CRYING AND FREAKING OUT ISN""T NORMAL?!? Seriously I know that the guy was being annoying about the ouigi board but the girl reacted normally. And I think a lot of people forget the part where they hear the noise and the TV turns onto a channel with no signal. This happens a lot in this movie, you hear a noise or something happens and your minds think ""oh this is gonna happen"" and nothing happens. Take the attic seen for example. Of course you thought he was gonna get hurt or something but no, they just find a picture. This is what I thought was creepy about this movie. So again I though at the TV scene that it was going to go on some scary channel. Its just me. But it didn't. Some people don't understand why they put powder on the floor because they already know that there is a demon. Well wouldn't you want to know if the demon is in your room or not? thats all I have to say. Its a great movie!"
"Horror-yo","7","0","1","27 October 2011"," Objectively...
","Cons: - a lot about it has been borrowed from other films (from specific scenes to ideas globally, to camera angles...) - takes a bit of a while to get into the flow - seems just a tad bit slow in parts - needs to be taken seriously and to be gotten into to avoid boredom, staleness and feeling like it's repetitive images and recurring footage and documentary/study oriented. So requires attention and playing along, explaining the disgruntled crowd and their criticism.<br/><br/>Pros: - well written - not a typical idea for the presence, a rather original take on the cause of the said paranormal activity - a frightening cause - well acted, believable in deed - overall buildup on the entire picture and ending climax really quite chilling - good management of the sound - unknown well managed, well interpreted, great concealed/displayed ratio.<br/><br/>All in all: could have been scarier. Not at all as scary as the hype suggests. Worth watching. Not a bad film at all."
"StevePulaski","10","0","2","22 October 2011"," Things that close doors and be a nuisance at night
","Paranormal Activity is not your typical horror film. There's no killer, no CGI, and thank goodness no Michael Bay. With a mere budget of $15,000 that will seemingly get you nowhere, Paranormal Activity proves wrong.<br/><br/>The story concerns is a young dating couple ""played"" by Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. I put quotes around ""played"" because they are themselves in the film, and they occupy their own names. There's one flaw in their relationship. Ever since her house burned, Katie has been haunted by demons. Mainly in the late night hours. ""Ghosts"" slam the doors, looks of creaking sounds make up for the lack of music, and so on. The little things that make you flinch or jump in a horror film are now put in the foreground. They are the main scares of the film.<br/><br/>Jump scares are those little instances where one of the characters turns around or something moves really fast, usually in the night time for added effect, and you hear an effect and a loud chord from the music. Normally, I'm against them. I, however, am not against suspense. In many current horror films, jump scares come seconds before an actual murder or something along those lines. The main flaw with jump scares is now that you've jumped up and flinched two or more times, the real murder will not seem as scary.<br/><br/>Here's a scenario - a woman walking alone in an eerie forrest in the middle of the night. Nevermind why, but imagine she turns around once and you get a jump scare that makes you flinch. Imagine afterwards she looks the other way and you get another huge jump. Then finally, the killer comes out and attacks her. The murder doesn't seem as scary as it would with no jump scares because you clearly saw it coming. No film would deliberately tease you with loud, obnoxious jump scares if nothing would happen in that scene.<br/><br/>But in Paranormal Activity, those jump scares are what we are waiting for. The suspense comes from the silence and the lack of music - we are waiting for something to make a loud noise so we can jump. Only in maybe two scenes I recall something actually happening that goes beyond a jump scare. It was the equivalent to a murder in a slasher film.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot too does nothing but add to the creepy vibe. I've always been a huge fan of shot-on-video horror films, meaning the film is shot with a hand-held camcorder and no tripod. Someone in the film is holding it and filming it first person style. The same thing worked in 1999 when the horror film that shocked many The Blair Witch Project came out. While mocked now, the film is without a doubt eerie and is still filmed very realistically.<br/><br/>The less you the better about Paranormal Activity the better, which is why I tried to shy away from major plot points and discoveries. I assume that maybe in ten years this will be looked seen as ""silly"" and ""stupid,"" but frankly, if you think about the realism, the quality, and the acting in the film, it's all believable, captivating, and powerful. It achieves many goals in elements that can easily be ruined in films like these. It at least deserves credit for that.<br/><br/>Starring: Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. Directed by: Oren Peli."
"nachdenki","10","0","2","4 September 2011"," Simply Scary
","There is a simple reason why I give Paranormal Activity the maximum rating (which I rarely do): It was the first film in a long time that actually scared me. Horror movies is one of my (if not the) favorite movie genre and there are a lot of good horror movies, but only very few that actually scare me (and by ""scare"" I don't mean shock, I mean actually frighten).<br/><br/>This fact alone is enough for me to give it 10/10, actually, because the movie is doing exactly what it is supposed to, and it's doing it pretty great. It has kind of an ""independent"" feeling (and it is, it was made by students) and follows in the footsteps of the ""Blair Witch Project"" documentary style: All the scenes are supposed to be filmed by the actors of the movie (although the film finds a lot of reasons for the camera to actually be a still camera on a stand). <br/><br/>I think what makes this film such an upsetting experience is that the characters play their roles as ""everyday people"" really good. The decision to go with a blair-witch kind of style was definitely the right one. You get the actual impression that what happens to that couple could happen to anyone and you actually care for what happens to them. Additionally, it becomes obvious pretty quickly to the viewer that the story will only get more intense from night to night. Finally, what makes this a really great experience as opposed to a lot of ""big"" Hollywood productions is that you have no idea how the film will turn out. It is completely unclear what happens to the two main characters and if the story will turn out good for them or not. In a lot of movies you can see the ending from far far away, in Paranormal Activity literally everything could happen.<br/><br/>So, what does that leave to say? I know a lot of people find the movie boring. For me, personally, it worked - and great. I saw it in the cinema, with about 15 other people and the atmosphere there was simply the best cinema experience I ever had, which may explain a little of my love for this movie. For everyone who did not see this movie so far: Watch it alone, watch it at night, watch it with good picture and sound quality (5.1 if possible somehow). This is the kind of movie you either love or hate. For me, it scared me and that is all I can ask from a horror movie, but rarely get - which is simply why I love it."
"HeroOfTheDay666","8","0","1","31 August 2011"," An Above Average Horror Movie, Under Certain Condition
","After hearing all the hype for this movie, I finally rented it on DVD and watched it, which brings me immediately to my first comment. Just like with the Blair Witch Project (and I will compare these two films throughout the review), this movie was made for a home viewing experience. There are a few reasons for this, the most obvious being that it is done in the ""home movie"" style, which theaters simply can't show and make it look good. The second is that this movie requires your complete attention, and if you watch it in a crowded theater, even one talkative person can ruin everything.<br/><br/>Now for the movie itself. No spoilers here, by the way. The plot is simple enough; a couple moves into a house, only to find that a paranormal presence (hence the title) is there with them. Much like the Blair Witch Project, encounters with this supernatural being grow more intense as time goes on. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that I found it to be a little predictable, but that doesn't mean it wasn't effective.<br/><br/>The acting is fine in my opinion. The actors portray ordinary people, and this comes through in the movie. I never felt like they were acting. Actually, it felt very natural. <br/><br/>With the plot and acting aside, I can now discuss the most important aspect of the movie: how scary it is. Well, this is a mixed bag. The biggest problem I had was that the ghostly activity only occurs at night, so when you see footage of the day, any tension you felt goes away because you know you are in ""down time"", and you know nothing will be there to scare you. The Blair Witch Project, however, didn't have this problem, as I felt fear during the day scenes almost as much as the night scenes. Also, Paranormal Activity is in a suburban home. Although this means more people can relate to the setting, the woods in The Blair Witch Project presented a more ominous and frighting environment. <br/><br/>The horror itself is actually pretty good. It is VERY subtle usually, with only a few ""jump"" moments being included. Due to this, many people deem this movie ""not scary."" Well, if you want a movie that uses loud blasts of sound to scare you, then this movie is not for you. Sorry that the producers tried something that takes imagination and patience to enjoy. Interestingly, much of the tension comes from the audio only. I can't really explain this without spoiling anything, so I won't. As for the visuals, the fact that the shots are done in the style of home movies makes it effective. If they had used ordinary camera work, these visuals would have been a joke. <br/><br/>To wrap things up, this movie will keep you in suspense for a good long while, with a few scares here and there, presuming you aren't the kind of person I mentioned above. I say, if you liked the Blair Witch Project, you'll probably like this. If you didn't, skip this movie. And if you liked this but haven't seen the Blair Witch Project, watch that immediately! You'll love it!"

I really don't know which would have been my idea if I knew since the first moment that it was just a movie. Most likely it should have been slow and the characters would have been a little weak.

","Gonna get this PARANORMAL ACTIVITY party started by insulting ""you people."" You People know who you are: believe in demons, astrology, gods, ghosts, angels, woobies...<br/><br/>I make this distinction because this film's impact on a non-superstitious cucumber is very different to its effect on You People, who take it for granted the events in this indie docu-style movie COULD HAPPEN, and then can't close your eyes at night for fear it COULD HAPPEN to you.<br/><br/>And writer-director Oren Peli knows just how to scare You People.<br/><br/>We think we know horror because our senses have been deadened by what the Hollywood system calls horror. Just like we think we know hamburgers because we eat at McDonalds (whether we like it or not and whether we admit it or not) - but visit a Ma and Pa griddle and suddenly the stinging of the onions leaps out at you, as does the red freshness of the ground meat patty on the crisply toasted buns; the cheese is aromatic, the tomatoes bleed with seedy juice, the lettuce is garden crisp, and a hint of ketchup cheekily enhances this audacious co-mingling of the five food groups.<br/><br/>PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a hamburger from Ma and Pa's griddle.<br/><br/>Movie works on the premise elucidated by Stephen King: don't show the monsters. Young couple Micah (if you squint real hard, a young Eric Bana) and Katie (don't need to squint to see her two mungus assets) move in together and experience the titular paranormal activity, which consists of doors moving, loud noises and sounds of people running around. But we see NOTHING.<br/><br/>Film is shot entirely on a hand-held Vidcam that Micah buys to record the phenomena. The obvious parallel is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in almost every stylistic aspect. (Like BLAIR WITCH, the footage was supposedly ""recovered"" - and edited into this movie by some nice editors who had nothing better to do than spend three months in an editing bay, then hire a marketing firm to create internet buzz, then attend film festivals since 2007 trying to score major distributors...)<br/><br/>We get the backstory when a gutless psychic (Mark Friedrichs) visits and asks Katie questions. Seems she's been plagued by demonic visitations since she was 8, so the psychic goes into Wet Pants Mode, ""My expertise is dealing with ghosts, not demons."" (Oh, so you have no expertise.) ""Dealing with demons is different."" (That's right - to deal with them, you have to pretend even harder.) <br/><br/>Micah taunts the demons with his vidcam and even sets up an EVP Microphone (oh, it's a comedy!), which makes Katie scared that he is ""angering"" the entities. Sho' nuff, when the psychic returns, desperately called by Katie for some help, he assures her by saying he can't help in the least, and wets his pants into the night, exclaiming the demon is outraged he is there. Evidence for his gutless behavior? - his behavior itself. Simply because he says ""The demon is angered,"" You People believe him.<br/><br/>Micah claims he is doing ""research"" into psychic phenomena - with a PICTURE BOOK of demons and witches... about as much research as he did on his girlfriend before moving in with her and only then discovering she's slightly cracked for hallucinating figures standing at the base of her bed. Katie keeps saying, ""Let's get out of the house!"" - but it's not the house, honey - it's YOU! And as for why Micah doesn't simply leave her, guess there's no accounting for the effect mungus assets have on guys who kinda look like Eric Bana... (And he keeps putting up with her after she refuses to have sex on camera - there's a deal-breaker right there--)<br/><br/>The scares are sudden and admittedly effective. Certain sounds at any hour of the day are scary - such as a gigantic THOOM! that rattles your ribcage - but hear them suddenly in the middle of the night and your hairs rise autonomously, whether you are a ghost whisperer, a practising catholic or a nullifidian cucumber.<br/><br/>Micah's camera spends long stretches on a tripod filming them sleeping - though the daytime acting is exceptional in that naturalistic vein, these night moments are the most fun (and not because of the non-existent sex). The timer on the camera is integral to some of the scares, and it will keep you guessing as to how they pulled some of the supernatural gags - especially the ""dragged-out-of-bed"" gag. (It's true: if your leg is sticking out of the blankets, the devil WILL grab it!)<br/><br/>On a budget somewhere between nothing and shoestring ($11,000), Peli has carved his 15 minutes, but it's a quality fifteen, with solid old fashioned thrills. He only stoops to the level of convention once - where he ramps the speed of the film to emulate THE RING's style - trouble is, that relapse comes in the film's final frames and compromises an otherwise above-average pants-browner.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is: Don't Taunt The Hamburger, You People!"

","I'm a big fan of the pseudo-documentary horror genre. Cannibal Holocaust is a sick spectacle but engaging and inventive. The Last Broadcast and even The Wicksborough Incident have moments that are gripping and a scattering of great ideas. Also, controversial opinion maybe, I really liked The Blair Witch Project. Aside from hailing a certain ""reality"" TV zeitgeist, The Blair Witch Project was moody and effective and had a great build up that kept you guessing. The eerie pagan figures made of branches, the woods at night full of strange sounds, the anxiety of never being quite able to see what was outside the frame of the shaky camera, all work together to create a little low budget masterpiece that rightfully scared the daylight out of audiences. <br/><br/>Now we've got this flat-footed attempt at ""horror"" called Paranormal Activity. Man, this was a bummer. I guess the success of shows like ""Ghost Hunters"" has given Hollywood the idea that people can get scared by little more that creepy sounds and night vision because this flick has spawned a number of imitations. As it is, Paranormal Activity has all the spooky thrills of a fake ghost video on Youtube. I prefer the Youtube videos because they are concise and don't pretend to have little more that one trick up their sleeve. Instead of being spooked, I just sat through Paranormal Activity wondering why the malevolent spirit does such boring stuff at night. He walks around, he turns on some lights, turns on the TV- basically this disembodied demon does everything I do when I can't sleep. Don't get me wrong, I see potential in the ""Ghost Hunter"" style horror movie. This stuff can be spooky if taken to the right place. But why must they be so unimaginative? <br/><br/>The only mild jolt comes at the very end, and even that is not much better than most homemade Youtube clips. In fact, I highly recommend surfing Youtube and watching the Paranormal Activity style videos on a dark and quiet night. You will be scared! I only recommend this film for people curious about the pseudo-documentary horror genre, researching or trying to make a thorough survey of contemporary horror."
"Gubby-Allen","3","0","1","13 June 2011"," Very disappointing
","Couldn't help feeling very let down & disappointed after seeing this.<br/><br/>It sets itself up OK and a few aspects of it work quite well, unfortunately it suffers from a couple of fundamental flaws, the main one being that it is a horror/scary film which isn't the slightest bit scary. I can be scared quite easily, even by the odd mainstream thriller, probably even a 15 certificate in the past.<br/><br/>Not finding it scary is one thing, but having watched this on DVD and not in the cinema, I struggled to see where the scary parts would even have been - those which caused cinema-goers to walk out.<br/><br/>The disappointment is exacerbated as there is the basis of a good film. the set-up & cinematography are good, the mood it sets works for much of the film. Broadly speaking the plot works but when you break it down by segments it is pitiful at times.<br/><br/>The first 10 mins, has the similarities of a porn film, with the dialogue & filming of the girl, the next 10 the start of a Derek Acora ghost watch show. You could accept a slow 20 mins if it was setting itself up for something better than you got.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it then takes a turn for the even worse, as their behaviour becomes completely irrational and both characters become increasingly frustrating and idiots at times - 80% of which is the boyfriend who ends as one of the daftest characters in a long time. It could've still worked without that.<br/><br/>The police, or somebody would've been called in with all that evidence at least 3 or 4 nights beforehand, someone else, a relative would've been consulted, brought in to stay or if they were remotely normal, to have taken them away and surely it was only a question of time before the bailiffs turned up to evict a couple from a mansion, one of which is a student and the others a day trader who struggled to amass an hours work in 6 weeks.<br/><br/>The final problem is that the film has a catch 22 issue throughout. Whiilst the laptop each night, works very well throughout and always remains plausible, the video camera never does. It is used for the most pointless of scenes, or dialogue with no relevance whatsover to the demons and despite the girls' protestations to turn it off, it is ignored by an increasingly puzzling and unrealistic boyfriend, but then had he have done, there wouldn't have been another hour of footage."

","I heard people raving on about how great ""Paranormal Activity"" was, so I decided to check it out one day. I'm into horror movies but only to poke fun at them. I rarely am scared by horror movies, and if I am scared, that film gets in my good graces. I was told by a few that this movie was a new, fresh genre of horror (though it looked awfully similar to BWP).<br/><br/>At first sight, the movie is, of course having a $15k budget, simple. I enjoyed the first-person home-video feel, although that is becoming more and more popular with the horror industry. However, while the realistic approach might appeal to the fearful nature of a few, it did not particularly affect me. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie really had few scary moments. It was rather cliché. Demons, getting pulled from a bed, an exorcist-type person unable to remove the demons, doors slamming shut. I will give it credit for the last 20 minutes or so, it was a tad scary, and I use ""tad"" lightly. I was very surprised at the last minute or so, when the girl killed the man, so I applaud the creators for that moment of surprise that was completely unexpected. I expected something completely different. I had a problem with the cut-off ending, and it gave me and almost ""Cloverfield"" feel. I have not yet watched the 2nd Paranormal Activity, but I hope it ties up some endings. <br/><br/>There were a few problems: 1) Not scary enough (Probably just a problem with my messed up sense of horror) 2) I found myself getting a bit bored at parts. 3) The abruptness of the ending.<br/><br/>But, I did like a few things: 1) The acting felt very natural and not scripted. 2) The surprise ending.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I give this movie a 4/10."

","I had high expectations for this film. Me and my three friends had just come back from a day out and we said ""shall we watch paranormal activity?"" I was a little apprehensive thinking it was going to be really scary. It was such a disappointment. Bland story-line, bland actors, bland film. Stupid amounts of swearing. I mean they were 'effing and blinding every other sentence. As this was my first 'horror' film I was nervous. But by the half way mark i knew this film was going to be a shoddy disaster.

","*SPOILER ALERT* i think people either loved or hated this movie for a couple reasons: 1) everyone wants special effects, gore, huge stars, or a big name tied to a movie for it to be considered ""good"" or ""scary"". the people who said they weren't scared even for a moment were either lying, or not paying attention throughout the movie. i'm not talking scared out of your mind like the first time you saw the exorcist or anything, but if you didn't jump at the sounds that were off screen, or be a little surprised at some of the things that happened, i can't ever read your reviews ever again and take them seriously. in those people's cases, they got bored within 15 minutes because they were expecting one thing and got another, so that turned them off and nothing could bring them back. to be quite honest, most of the movie was slow moving. and that's the point. this is not meant to be a Texas chainsaw massacre, halloween, Friday the 13th, or hell, even a poltergeist movie. it is designed much the same as the shining was. it tells a story. it leads you along a path, predictable as it might be, and tries to startle you along the way. if you let yourself get submersed into the character's point of view (which you should do to get the true terror of the movie) you will see that the little things that seem pointless and boring to all those critics out there, are really what would scare anyone in real life. this is more a psychological thriller than a horror movie. period.<br/><br/>2) the acting was mostly average. true. there seemed to be quite a few different sides to micha throughout the movie. at times he was strong and tough, others angry and stubborn, or arrogant and close minded... his character was not consistent, which bothered me throughout the movie. i couldn't tell if he was trying to help, or if he was in it for himself (maybe selling the video because early on he said he was getting good footage...) or if he was trying to help his girlfriend. i don't think his part as all that well thought out, and he seemed to be all over the place, which was frustrating. i also had some issue with katie's character as well. again, for lack of consistency, she seemed to want to take control and do things her way, but never seemed to actually accomplish anything, always giving way to micha, even when she swore up and down his way was the wrong way. i guess that might get into the writing a bit more than the acting, so back on track here... the ""scary parts"" were impressive and showed a great deal of what i thought felt like real emotion. real terror, shock, horror, desperation, stress and anxiety. i loved that. what i didn't love was all the in between takes that seemed forced and like they were supposed to improvise dialogue. those scenes, especially with her friend, didn't seem realistic. it seemed to me like they got quiet when the camera came near, or worse yet, tried to force a conversation just for the conversation's sake. small detail, but bothersome at the least.<br/><br/>3) finally the ending. this is what actually ruined he movie for me. we went from a demon plaguing this couple for 3 weeks, poltergeist style, into a full demonic possession and killing in a very short time. it seemed like a cop out. it seemed like the paper that we all wrote in college at one point, where we spent so much time on the body and filler b.s., we ran out of time to actually pull it all back together and write a well throughout conclusion and just said, ""eh, whatever, it's done"". that's what it felt like to me. it seems like if the movie had not had a definitive ending... or if it didn't end so quickly... or even if it had an ending similar to other possession movies, it would have flowed better (albeit making it less original so kudos for that i guess). it just didn't feel complete, and overall, it really felt like a cop out ending just to end the movie. had there been more substance to it i would have to agree that it was a blair witch type movie and deserved much higher ratings."
"quis89","6","0","1","15 March 2011"," good for the genre
","It's hard for me to really compare Paranormal Activity with other movies, because these kinds of supernatural horror movies rarely meet my personal criteria for a Good Movie. That being said, this was still an enjoyable movie, which is something else entirely, and it was better than many in the genre.<br/><br/>There's nothing really new about Paranormal Activity. It sort of mixes up bits and pieces of movies like The Blair Witch Project, Poltergeist and The Exorcist. But it still does it pretty well. I think the best part of this movie was that I was actually more unnerved by scenes where the camera had fallen or been set down or was otherwise being pointed away from the action, than scenes where some supernatural activity was being shown.<br/><br/>The biggest downside of this movie to me was just the acting. The actors aren't terrible or unwatchable, but they're just not good enough to make you forget that you're watching people _pretending_ to be filming home movies. They do a passably good job going through the motions, but since their interactions with each other are basically the only focus of the movie, it just gets a bit stale, whereas I think two really fantastic actors could have made this movie feel truly realistic.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about the movie was the set. I'm betting it was probably the house of somebody involved in making the movie, but the whole time I just could not stop thinking, why is their house so big? A young professional and his live-in girlfriend who is still going to college don't need a house with 3 bedrooms, a home office, and a sprawling living room. Maybe it sounds silly, but the shots of two unused but perfectly furnished bedrooms just felt awkward to me..."
"kenmeuskens","3","0","1","16 February 2011"," Very disappointing
","I watched this movie when it came out and perhaps the hype set me up for disappointment, but I definitely left feeling that the movie insulted my intelligence. I regret having paid the money that I did to see it instead of waiting for the DVD. I would not want to see it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. The action is slow and the plot is not believable at all. It possibly appeals to simple-minded viewers, or people that have absolutely no knowledge of the paranormal. I actually found myself laughing at some of the so-called 'horror' scenes. The best reactions I observed amongst my fellow movie-goers were some wide-eyed expressions and occasional exclamations, so I don't think I was the only disappointed person."
"Bigjon121388","Null","0","1","9 February 2011"," Wasn't scared at all
","I wasn't scared at all, and I don't say that with any pride, just indifference. This is one of the worst ""horror,"" movies I've seen in a long time. Even the Blair Witch film had a more original plot than this. <br/><br/>Here's a typical scene in Paranormal Activity. Girl and guy lies in bed. it's dark and quiet in the room. Girl is waken up by a subtle bump. Girl wakes up guy. Girl asks, ""did you here that?"" and then oh it's a ghost! That's the only explanation for it right? And then there's the scene where the girl or guy (Can't remember) is just getting dragged out of the bed. It's paranormal, and it may be somewhat scary if it happen in real life, but in a movie? No. <br/><br/>The rest of the film is about the same experience you'd get from watching a home video of you and your buddies without the advantage of seeing people you know. It's hard if not impossible to care about the two ""actors,"" sitting around the house, eating a sandwich or watching TV or flirting. It's just plain boring and it tries to take that ""real life,'feel of Blair Witch and Cloverfield and somehow does a poor job of it. <br/><br/>Anything paranormal in this movie, just isn't convincing and is beyond mediocre, in fact, things much scarier than this happen in real life everyday, whither you believe in the paranormal or not, unexplained things happen and even for someone that doesn't believe in it will see how bland the happenings of this film are. But of course if they tried to say it was actually real, or it was actually happening (like they tried to say with the Blair Witch once) It wouldn't take a skeptic to debunk it. All it would take was someone with common sense. <br/><br/>I honestly can't remember the names of the guy and the girl. I didn't really care about them. I seen the alternate ending and I still didn't care about them. <br/><br/>The saddest part of the whole thing is that, you or I could easily make the same movie with a basic camera from Walmart and Windows Movie Maker but one thing we might couldn't do is get it shown in theaters. How Paranormal Activity did, I haven't a clue but one thing that helped it was those ridiculous commercials where everyone in the theater were screaming their eyeballs out. I'm pretty sure they were paid to do this or they were just that easily impressed. I don't see how this is horror. It's a fake documentary with a few bumps in the night and that's about it. If there was anything redeeming about Paranormal Activity for me, then it was the moderate hilarity of how cheap it was.<br/><br/>Every time a movie like this comes out, like with Blair Witch and like with Cloverfield, they are fast to say how scary it is, how terrified you will be when you see it and then in most cases you aren't. I've come to the conclusion that the movies that brag about about being the scariest of them all are actually quite the opposite and the good horror movies are the ones that you never see coming."

Sadly, it's a poor excuse for macho male bravado and poor camera work.<br/><br/>The boyfriend who constantly provokes a demon that's been shown to be troubling his girlfriend? How cliché can you get?

"oneguyrambling","7","0","1","7 November 2010"," Wow - a horror film with a few actual ""scares""...
","Shot doco style in and around one house, this is the ultimate in low budget shoestring filmmaking, and is effective in maximizing what it can from minimal surroundings and FX.<br/><br/>The film is supposedly the footage shot by a young couple in San Diego in 2006, who determine that their house is haunted. This point is not really argued but taken as fact, both the partner Micah and the haunt-ee Katie frequently speak matter-of-factly about the ""force"" or ""demon"" or whatever and just accept that it is there.<br/><br/>As the film opens they are setting up a camera purchased to document events while they sleep, and the camera seems to roll at all times, while they chat, eat, and generally loll about the house.<br/><br/>So we have less a plot than some stuff that happens while Micah and Katie go about their daily existence. Katie is a student and Micah is apparently a day trader, which must mean he is a good one as they both live in a very nice looking (and definitely not cheap) house.<br/><br/>Where relevant, and it needs to be said tension building, the date and time appear on screen, so that we might see long periods of inactivity in a short space of time, this is especially important in the night scenes. The camera is especially well positioned, so that we can see both Micah and Katie as they sleep, and a conveniently opened door on the left of screen, where for 90 minutes we constantly wait for something, anything to appear.<br/><br/>It is the wait that is more nerve wracking than the events themselves. By not showing anything our minds go to places that could not have been possible on a film with a $15,000 budget, so the viewer's imagination should be credited for 90% of the scares.<br/><br/>I think the fact that I have watched so many horror movies hurt me a little here, as I am very patient in waiting for the next scare, and ""BOO"" moments don't have nearly as much impact seeing that I have sat through thousands over many years.<br/><br/>As time elapses it becomes very clear that the two are not simply delusional, as over many nights evidence mounts up on the film and sound recording devices. Early on they solicit the advice of a psychic, who seriously explains various scenarios and calmly informs Katie that it is she that the whatever is after, and that moving or running away won't help.<br/><br/>So it seems clear that the demon/ghostie things either has sat-nav, or that Katie needs to block it as a friend on her Facebook page.<br/><br/>As the severity of the ""symptoms"" and encounters escalate, the usual cinematic devices are brought in, rippling bedsheets, slamming doors, on/off lights and my favourite, the hissing audio turned up loud that has an unearthly voice on it. (Never fails to get the hairs on my neck to stand up that one. The Sixth Sense one was best.) Most of the action comes to light the next day when Micah goes through the tapes.<br/><br/>It must be said that there are some discrepancies here, it seems that Micah feels this is more of a lark, he taunts the being and tries to lure it out and I guess catch it or something. Katie explains that she has dealt with it for years and is far more cautious, she wants to bring in an exorcist type person, and often complains about the camera as being an irritant to both her and the beastie.<br/><br/>Micah is both more understanding than I would ever be (I would ask a few more questions if my wife stood over me vacantly staring while I slept for two whole hours and then claimed not to remember anything) and inflammatory, mocking Katie at the same time as he watches hard evidence that she is largely correct in her fears. He ultimately does stir sh*t up when he brings a ouija board into the house despite Katie's misgivings, and though he doesn't get the chance to formally use it the presence of the board does have an impact. (A pretty cool one too.) There is a leap of faith required by the audience about an hour in that I never really went for as it seemed just a little too far fetched, and yes I realize I am watching a movie about ghosts and that leaps of faith are necessary to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>The movie culminates in what I now know are two endings, having read about the other on the net. There was the original, more low key ending which I witnessed, and the more over the top one made for a wider release to US audiences. Having seen one and read about what happens in the other I think I prefer what I saw as it seemed to be more in keeping with the film's tone.<br/><br/>But that is not apparently what the American audiences want, as this film is now the highest grossing R rated flick of the decade.<br/><br/>The best bits of Paranormal Activity are 30 seconds snippets of very effective and audience manipulating filmmaking, the other 99% is OK, it did drag along at times.<br/><br/>It seemed that the daylight hours were simply there as an intermission between the scary parts that went on while the couple slept.<br/><br/>I instinctively kept glancing to the corners awaiting something dreadful, which is why kids are afraid of the dark in the first place isn't it? <br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. Like having a great song as the closing track on a bad album, you finish happy but wonder of the first hour or so was really that necessary.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","The longest drawn out horror...but thats what made it for me. Sorry, there is no demon @ 46:27, but that is the time in which I had to write this blog for P.A. Unlike, ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the vomiting inducing film, ""Cloverfield"" these people used a HD camera and knew how to use it. By far the best picture of this type of film this decade. Although it was entertaining the acting could have been improved. Something about that house is just creepy, modern yet ancient. I look forward to viewing the second, and I am grateful I did not view this in a cram packed theater. All in all, I would personally rate this film a strong 8/10."
"flicklover","8","0","1","3 November 2010"," An effective, unsettling experience!!!
","I was a a big fan of the Blair Witch when it came out in 1999. I do not consider myself an avid horror movie fan, but when I prefer a scary story over a lot of gore. That film worked because it created an inevitable sense of dread. Paranormal Activity takes the elements that worked in Blair Witch and improves on them. There is very little story, it basically involves a young couple named Katie and Micah that lives in San Diego that is experiencing creepy sounds in their home. Micah is filming in the house constantly in order to find evidence of the disturbances. Katie doesn't like it, but she goes along because she wants to find out what's going on. There really is no story here we just see this couple in there every day life, mostly at night when Micah sets up the video camera to film the whole night in the bedroom. The film is has a slow pace, the disturbances start to get worse as the film goes along. The movie isn't as much scary as it is unsettling. We have all been at home and heard a sound that creeped us out, the film does a great job at playing with sound and the visuals are simple but very effective. Door slams, banging sounds and some very simple but clever visual effects. The only setup there is to explain what is happening is that Katie experience similar disturbances as a child. Most of tension comes from the bedroom scenes. Micah sets up the camera in the bedroom on a stand and we see, at times with time lapse the couple sleeping, but the camera is positioned so that we could see the open door of the bedroom into the hallway. I don't like to give spoilers but the film does a terrific job scaring its audience. The movie does indicate that something is going on with a low frequency bass sound indicating that ""something is there"" and also uses shadows to indicate a presence.<br/><br/>The performances by the actors are good enough, we really don't get to know them and they are mostly having to react to what they see on camera the whole time, but they are believable as a couple. There are a couple characters such as a psychic that the couple brings in to help that provides a little comic relief. Needless to say if you buy in, you will have a good scare while seeing this film. I watched it in a half full theater and it is definitely the type of film that is better when watched with an audience.<br/><br/>Is is a great film, no. I feel that it is a great exercise in manipulating our basic fears. I feel that it also show that less is more sometimes in horror films, you don';t have to show blood and guts do scare an audience.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Jerique","7","0","2","1 November 2010"," Misjudged!
","I definitely misjudged this film. In 2009, Paranormal Activity decimated Saw at the box-office. I was not on PA's side as I found out the budget was a mere $15,000 (sorta like Blair Witch) I was unimpressed with the thought that this was dubbed ""scariest movie of all time!"" On a $15,000 budget, Paranormal Activity's gross was over 100,000x (in worldwide numbers) its original value. I figured, the special effects couldn't be anything to sneeze at.<br/><br/>I finally saw this film and I'm pleased to say, on the budget and the lack of script writing this film is very good. Its cinematography is something to be hold. Lighting during the sleeping scenes are a very disturbing blue and really keep you drawn to the screen.<br/><br/>Although the script wasn't complete and some scenes were given directions from Oren Peli to just ""talk about a certain subject"" this is well-crafted. It works very well and gets you interested in the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only dislike of the film, really, is the representation that the film is more of a documentary. It is actually all staged and fake. It's only based on a personal experience, but the fact that there is an alternate ending means that it's not real. I dislike when it's falsified.<br/><br/>I was pleased with the original ending and the silence in scenes and anticipation buildup really makes for an intriguing ending. However, I wouldn't say this is a scary film in the least. The premise and idea is disturbingly freaky, but overall I wasn't scared.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to people who enjoy horror elements and movies that touch on paranormal stuff. It's a good film and I'm excited for Paranormal Activity 2."

","People, people, people...chill out. You guys need to open your eyes and realize that bloody gore, monsters or killers does NOT make a horror movie. A good scary movie can scare you no matter what you may or may not see. Everyone seems to think because you do not see the actual ""demon"" or see any blood or violence that this movie sucks. This movie uses suspense and the unknown to scare you. If this movie did nothing for you, then obviously you need to go back to movies like Texas chainsaw massacre or something. This movie is scary in its own right and just because you didn't get your fix of monsters and blood does NOT make it a bad movie. You all have just been desensitized by common day media.<br/><br/>This movie did a good job at keeping the hair on my arm raised. Even though this movie was not all it could be, it was still good for what it was. It did a good job of keeping you wondering what was going to happen to them next. I am GLAD they never showed they demon itself. That would have actually ruined it. the idea of the unknown is what this movie is about and is EXACTLY why it is scary."

I'm sure there was a considerable amount more lavished on it after Steven Spielberg came aboard, but even then the film has a documentary look, which perfectly suites the subject matter.<br/><br/>Like ""Blair Witch,"" we are treated to a supposedly self-shot haunting. This time out, it's a suburban couple who are plagued.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Blair Witch,"" this film features some genuine frights.

"muvcritic","7","0","2","24 October 2010"," ""Found Footage"" Scares Heck Out of Audience
","(Originally appeared in Free Times, Columbia's Entertainment Guide)<br/><br/>""Scary"" doesn't have to be expensive, as proved by maverick filmmakers like George Romero (Night of the Living Dead), Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left). Their groundbreaking early films could not have been done within the confines of Hollywood. There's always too many associate producers, marketing flaks, accountants, lawyers and publicists deciding how you should make your film, so the key is to spend the least amount of money possible and not attract their attention.<br/><br/>Still, I couldn't have imagined a viable film made for $11,000.00 (which wouldn't buy you five minutes' production time on a Hollywood feature), but that's reportedly the budget of Paranormal Activity, which makes possibly the best use yet of the ""found footage"" gimmick first seen in The Blair Witch Project. It wouldn't be entirely inaccurate to describe Paranormal Activity as Blair Witch in somebody's house instead of in the forest.<br/><br/>Those somebodies are Katie and Micah, who are convinced there's a presence in their home that turns on/off lights and faucets, et cetera. The skeptical Micah sets up his video camera on a tripod to catch this nocturnal activity (or to prove Katie wrong) while he and Katie are sleeping. What we see are Micah's homemade videos, graciously ""donated"" by his and Katie's families after the camera was ""found."" There's not a single moment when you doubt the authenticity of what you're seeing. There's no musical score, no fancy camera work, no slumming guest stars (""Oh, look -- It's Woody Harrelson!"") to remind you that it's just a movie, not even any credits. There's just the relentless tension of knowing that, if humans were ever going to meet the unknown face to face, there wouldn't be any vampires, werewolves or zombies. It'd be like this.<br/><br/>There's actually nothing in Paranormal Activity that you haven't seen before and probably seen much more explicitly, if not read in books, a thousand times. I'll bet you even know someone who claims to have had these experiences; I've known several, and while I hesitate to doubt the veracity (if not the sanity) of these friends, I can't accept that our entire science can be so wrong. But if it is, then Paranormal Activity, because of its complete lack of artificiality, may be the best cinematic representation yet of that wrongness.<br/><br/>But the best thing isn't that the film may be scary or that it feels authentic. It's the fact that, despite ostensibly being shot on someone's home moviecam, Paranormal Activity is highly and impeccably structured, tighter than most A-list movies with a $200 million budget. Not a frame is gratuitous or wasteful. Ditto for the flawless Katie and Micah.<br/><br/>Put this movie at the top of your Halloween list. My only regret is that I've already seen it...although it might be fun to sit through again with people who haven't."

","This is just one of those movies that leave you feeling something is missing. Almost from the start the film strikes a level and aside from the few scare scenes it keeps the viewer just hanging mid-range. The story lacks the set-up from when the haunting started and leaves to question ""is it a poltergeist an aberration, what?). How did these two get together, why, when, where and for how long? Does he just suddenly realize there is something going on and she pops up with ""surprise I come with my own spooks"". Considering it's a faux documentary with enough ""F"" bombs to warrant the ""R"" rating a little something could have been added to spice it up. The movie could have used a little skin, skimpy night cloths, shadowed shower scene or even a little humor. It just needed something to break the monotone style of presentation.

","I first heard of this movie when I was reading the newspaper and I saw how much attention it got over America so I looked it up online and saw it was ""The scariest movie ever made"" and ""You won't be able to sleep"" and I thought, just like every other advertisement or review for a horror movie, that they would be wrong. Well this time, I am glad to say that I was wrong.<br/><br/>The story takes place with the two characters named Micah and Katie (the actor's real names) who move into their new home in California only to find out sooner rather than later, things start to go bump in the night.<br/><br/>Boo! Paranormal Activity is beyond a doubt one of the most scariest and most magnificent horror movies to have ever graced our screens. The actors were brilliant as was the cast and crew. The actor and actress who use their real names didn't know when the jumpy parts were about to happen themselves when filming so what you see is actually genuine, which I loved as it made it so much more believable. The dark and paranormal feel of the movie was definitely there and, though you knew when the scary parts were coming (timestamp in the corner), you were still spooked.<br/><br/>The story is very well written for a low-budget movie and the special effects were brilliant and used in the correct times.

"blackberrybabe","9","0","2","7 October 2010"," The best horror movie I've ever seen
","Paranormal Activity is a scary movie. It's not a ""how much blood and gore can we incorporate into this movie and get the death count up to one hundred movie."" No, it's psychologically scary and therefore is more affective.<br/><br/>I've seen many horror movies that focus on murder and blood (Halloween, Scream, Bleed), that becomes boring after awhile. You lose count of who dies and I generally find that by the end, I don't care at all. Paranormal Activity stayed with me after it was over because my mind was replaying what I had seen. It made me wonder if the paranormal really does exist and for once, I wasn't completely denying that fact.<br/><br/>I first became interested in this movie when I saw Eclipse. The trailer for Paranormal Activity 2 was shown and my interest was piqued. I rented the first, not really knowing what to expect, and was pleased to see it was a low-budget film shot in a director's house. He hired four actors for the film and did not use many special effects. Movies like this are always a gem to find when they work. And it does.<br/><br/>Here is the plot: Micah and Katie have dated for awhile and decide to live together. It wasn't until after they moved in together that she revealed a secret: she has a demon following her. They hire an expert to check the house out for any signs that it is haunted. The expert says yes, it is and the demon wants Katie.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, you see things happen, mainly at night, to let the viewer know that the demon is alive and well. A door opens and closes by itself, a sheet is drawn back on the couple sleeping in bed, lights turn on and off in a hallway. It's little things like these that are the scariest.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, more and more things happen and the demon becomes more and more angry. A picture of the couple is smashed with the crack over Micah's face, Katie is pulled out of bed by the demon and Micah has to rescue her, etc. It all leads up to the shocking and unexpected conclusion.<br/><br/>This film pays homage to The Blair Witch Project in that it's shot with a small camera and is documented. Also, the characters are annoying at times. At several points throughout the film, I found myself wishing that Katie would either shut up or be killed by the demon. She really got on my nerves. I could understand her stress and frustration throughout the film, but the way she was acting was completely childish.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the actress herself didn't do a good job. She did. In fact, both of the leads did. I found myself drawn into the story more and their talent is what made the ending so shocking for me. That and the fact that Micah is absolutely gorgeous. I kept wishing he'd dump Katie and go in search to find me. I felt that I would be a better girlfriend than Katie was. And I'm not being stalked by a demon.<br/><br/>The setting is modern-day, in southern California. The house is too huge for Micah's salary and Katie's student status, but what do you expect in Hollywood? In movies, people without money are the ones with the biggest homes. As it is filmed with a hand-held camera, graphics are minimal and there is a bluish hue when filming at night. It does not detract at all; rather remind you that this is a ""documentary"" and ""regular people"" going about their lives.<br/><br/>The sequel is what interested me in this movie and now I plan to trek to the theater to see it when it opens in a few weeks. But before I do that, I will rent this again to re-familiarize myself with the characters and pick up on things I might have missed the first time. I hope Paranormal Activity 2 is just as good as the first one. If so, a franchise will be born and two young actors will quickly climb to the A list. And who knows? Maybe there is a hint of truth to the film."
"MaximumMadness","9","0","2","6 October 2010"," ""Paranormal Activity"" fundamentally succeeds in what it sets out to accomplish, but it does have a few problems keeping it from perfection...
","Oren Peli's 2007 pseudo-documentary thriller ""Paranormal Activity"" is a film that follows a long tradition of the faux-documentary sub-genre. Following such classics as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", it seemed hard for yet another small film like this to succeed and remain fresh. Somehow, it worked. Mostly.<br/><br/>The film follows our two protagonists, Katie and Micah, a young couple. Micah, Katie's somewhat skeptical and foolish boyfriend, has recently bought a camera and plans on documenting the so-called presence that seems to be following Katie, and manifesting itself as some sort of haunting.<br/><br/>The film definitely follows the philosophy of ""less is more"", which I appreciate. The film makes heavy use of simple tactics, like the small noises you can just barely hear in the background, or the things you see only after the fact (object having been pushed over, or picture frames being mysteriously broken), and it is effective to a certain degree. Though I will say it isn't until later in the film, when the manifestations become more violent and blatant, that the fear really picks up. I understand that noises can be frightening to people who are experiencing the events first-hand, but to an audience, 60-minutes of nothing but eerie banging and strange voices can get, well... boring.<br/><br/>Also problematic is the reliance of the actors and filmmakers on conventions of the sub-genre. If you've seen any other film done in the faux-documentary style, you will know ahead of time exactly what will happen, and when it will happen. Films like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Blair Witch"" pioneered this style, so the audience didn't know what to expect. Here, we have a vague idea, so some tension is lost.<br/><br/>Also, the characters are charming and the performances are good, but there is something a little off-putting about seeing the same sort of characters we've seen before many times doing exactly what we expect them to. We know there will be tension between Micah and Katie. We know how they will develop. We just know too darned much up front, just by virtue of the fact that this type of film and these characters already exist.<br/><br/>All that being said, the film is exceptionally solid. The characters, while formulaic, are well-acted, and the film is genuinely creepy, especially during the final half hour, which to me, more than makes up for the shaky start.<br/><br/>As a person who comes from a family full of believers in ghosts and the paranormal, I was able to connect with this film in many ways, which is part of the reason why I'm willing to cut it some slack.<br/><br/>I give this film a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It's mildly creepy, and is definitely a good movie to see, by yourself or with a date, in the dark.<br/><br/>Edit: February, 2012. I recently have changed my position on this film, after re-watching it, and am raising my score to a 9. My complaints still stand, but this is a much better film than I initially credited it for, and it functions better after multiple viewings."

"drjbrrown","7","0","1","14 September 2010"," Paranormal activity in our view.
","Paranormal Activity<br/><br/>There hasn't been anything like this since The Blair Witch Project, but did Paranormal Activity do the hand-held camera idea better? This film knows how to make you insecure and nervous in your own home, and the way it's shot only adds to this effect as it feels like a voyeuristic intrusion into somebody's personal life. And in this case, the personal lives we follow are those of the Katie, who suffers ongoing torment at the hands of a mysterious unseen demon, and her husband Micah, who only really serves to worsen the situation. Both are played by low key actors, which removes the veil of Hollywood and releases the realistic elements of their lives.<br/><br/>This realism works extremely well in the horror genre: this could be you. It plays on every fear, from the corruption of Katie's childhood to the isolated way in which they both live. We never see anything away from their haunted property, and any relief in the form of helpful visitors is short lived as nobody seems willing to help. It may be unusual for a horror film that we never really see or understand what the evil force in the house really is, but our own fear of the unknown only heightens the horror. It does, however, follow other conventions: most of the really scary moments take place at night, when the unknown entity strikes when the unsuspecting couple are asleep and at their most vulnerable. I'm sure that a childhood fear of the dark is something we can all relate to, and something we'll all return to during the film. Even the scenes during the day keep us in suspense, making the audience nervous in preparation for the true horror to follow at night.<br/><br/>Overall, the film works as an interesting and genuinely scary take on the horror genre and definitely worth watching, although hardcore horror fans may find it a little slow and reasonably tame, as the scares are more psychological than outright gory.<br/><br/>Laura McCormick, Jessica Brown, Maria Perry."

Everything else can easily be explained as the normal sounds a house makes.

So was the blood curdling screaming at the end.<br/><br/>The footsteps in the powder looked fake.<br/><br/>I do wonder why they didn't think to look on the internet to find out information and assistance for it sooner. Micah was obviously computer savvy, so... huh? <br/><br/>And why oh why are they running around the house with a camera and not bothering to turn on a light when something creepy is happening? Most normal people would automatically turn on a light, especially when there are strange noises going bump in the night.<br/><br/>Now, let me say that I DO believe in ghosts and always have. However, I don't believe in demons, and I would say that idea was put into their minds by the so-called investigator. Doing so gave the spirit a form that it could use to scare them.<br/><br/>I can also say this... spirits gain power from your behavior.

"cchase","6","0","1","1 August 2010"," Heavenly Hype, Earthbound Execution
","Now that the considerable hullabaloo has died down around this flick, I figured this was the perfect time to finally see it. Like its predecessor, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the bombastic campaign that was used to roll this movie out was a marvel of hyperbole that the late, great schlockmeister showman William Castle would've loved. He had the P.T. Barnum-method of selling movies almost down to a science, understanding instinctively that as long as you have a gimmick and great pitch-line to sell it with, what did it matter if the film was crap?<br/><br/>And the producers of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, along with writer/director Oren Peli have done absolutely NOTHING to prove him wrong. The film itself is neither as horrible as some people have made it out to be, nor is it ""THE MOST TERRIFYING MOVIE EVER MADE."" There are much better films made with even lower budgets that can rightfully lay claim to that title. <br/><br/>But in Peli's defense, even though the premise is nothing new, (think of this as a much more 'up-close-and-personal' version of an episode of the Discovery Channel series A HAUNTING), he does err on the side of subtlety and understatement in the movie's more effective moments, where any other director would've opted for a maelstrom of CG effects and a thunderous soundtrack to beat the audience into the desired response. The greatest problem lies in the moments in-between the supernatural incidents, when the characters' responses to the extraordinary circumstances can leave you scratching your head in wonderment and more than a little skepticism. <br/><br/>Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat - and that's pronounced ""MEE-kah"" and not ""MYE-kah"", BTW) are experiencing some strange occurrences in their house as the film begins. Micah, a baby of the ""techno-generation"" through and through, has bought an expensive camera along with all the latest trimmings to try and capture these incidents, and couldn't be happier about getting to play with his new toys. Katie, on the other hand, couldn't be less enthusiastic, or more put out about Micah's connecting more with his gadgets and less with her sense of growing unease and distress. See, this is not her first time at this particular rodeo. Seems that there's an eerie history of this whole ""things-that-go-BUMP- in-the-night"" problem in her family background, and though little things have happened that reflected this in their nearly three-year relationship, the incidents have never been as bad as they've gotten when we meet them. And of course, things are about to go from bad to a whole lot worse. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the problem is not with the sequences where ""things"" happen...doors move, bangs and creaks emerge from the walls at unexpected times, objects in the house get moved to places where they weren't before, amongst other things. The biggest obstacle is in the way the characters are written as a couple. Katie fares a lot better than Micah on the sympathy front - she doesn't understand how or why the phenomenon has followed her for so long, and just wants to find a way to stop it or at the very least, make it all go away. Micah, on the other hand, is just about completely oblivious to the glaring fact that he's facing forces that can't be taken care of by simply yelling them down or pointing a night-vision lens at them. As much as my dislike for his character grew by leaps and bounds, Micah Sloat the actor did a great job in capturing the self-centeredness and immaturity. <br/><br/>I won't go into the complete ""WTF"" moments that take the audience out of the spell of genuine terror the movie is attempting to weave, but you'll know them for sure when you see them. And by the time it reaches what is pretty much the expected denouement, you might be left feeling the sentiment expressed in the old Peggy Lee song: ""Is That All There Is?"" <br/><br/>PARANORMAL ACTIVITY gamely tries to apply classic tropes of otherworldly tales of spookery to our very post-modern, gadget-obsessed world, but for this viewer, it ultimately misses the mark. For egg-sized goosebumps, at least for my taste, you still can't beat classic films like the original version of THE HAUNTING or even THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE."

","Paranormal Activity is a movie that divides audiences. Some people will love it, and some will not. I loved it. The scares felt real and everything was authentic. If this movie was released ten years ago, I can imagine many people believing that the footage was real and the events did occur. Every time a bedroom scene occurred, my heart went pumping. This movie is 30% scares and 70% backlash to what occurred in the bedroom. I also loved the acting. Sure Katie was too whiny and Micah was too ""heroic"", but their annoyance added to the realism. I'm glad this movie is earning what it's worth, and it's an example that anyone can make a movie and have it be a huge success. If you have an imaginative mind, you can make another Paranormal Activity-like success story. I thought this movie was superbly thrilling, a movie that I won't soon forget.<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of viewing the theatrical ending and the original 2007 ending. The theatrical ending felt too cinematic and totally out-of-sync with the rest of the movie, as if the first ninety minutes was independent and the last ten Hollywood put together in a weekend."

","It's hard to rate this one especially with the buzz and fuss it's been getting. I decided to watch it after I heard that its supposed to be one of the scariest movies made and seeing the terrifying audience reaction it got. Despite being a little disappointed at the time I came to realize that this isn't the typical 'monster, blood, violence' horror but instead it plays on you're mind. With the films extremely low budget all being shot very 'realistically' I think that it managed to scare you in a different way than usual horrors do. It plays with your psychology and how you perceive things. I think the relationship between Micah and his wife was hilarious though and his 'realistic' humor really added to the movie. I also heard that there are different endings to the movie so I think that can play a major role on its overall effect. It has it's moments of suspense and chill while at the same time the plot and story seems very realistic making it that much scarier. It was a nice change from the three billion SAW movies that are being made now and it's pulled together by its realism. I'd recommend this to all of those that enjoy horror movies and I don't just mean the Texas Chainsaw Massacre ones.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for? Paranormal Activity is waiting...;)"
"maatmouse-1","7","0","1","17 July 2010"," Blair Witch style video drama with scary moments
","I decided to watch this on Blu-Ray, having heard and read about it on the internet. This has been billed as one of those rarities: a genuinely frightening film with lots of shock moments. To some extent, it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>This film is in a similar vein to the Blair Witch Project and utilises sophisticated 'home video-ing' involving the protagonists of the movie - a young couple living together in a comfortable family home, enjoying a relatively normal lifestyle. It is the man of the movie - Micah who does the filming and his girlfriend, Katie who provides the film with some of its more scary moments, with her erratic behaviour.<br/><br/>The film starts off innocently enough with the couple using the video-camera and scene setting. It transpires that the couple have been having haunting/ghost problems with their house, most of the haunting centred on Katie. Apparently, she believes that a demon is operating in the house and it has been focussing its attentions on her.<br/><br/>The filming builds up gradually. The couple include both daytime filming and filming done while they 'sleep' in the bedroom. It is the bedroom filming which provides the most worrying moments. Minor moments include the bedroom door being opened slightly then one night it is banged shut. Other things include lights being switched on, a picture being smashed, heavy breathing on Katie, powder put down and 'footprints' appearing in it, a picture from Katie's troubled past cropping up in the attic and even an ouiji board being used and burned.<br/><br/>Both actors do a marvellous job, convincing us completely that there is something going on in the house and in the process involve us in their problem. There are no dramatic solutions, as in films like the Exorcist where priests come in and attempt to solve the problem. Both people approached seem powerless to do anything.<br/><br/>The film ends as we expect. With a dramatic moment followed by an address to the camera."

","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"", Oren Peli's directorial debut, which first started out as an independent film, made on a shoe-string budget, was shelved for two years. After a plethora of test screenings, the hype started to flood. After the immense hype, the advertising campaign demanded audiences to make this movie worldwide. Now, Paranormal Activity stands as a universal prosperity and even some have compared it to the legendary ""Blair Witch Project"". I actually quite enjoyed Paranormal Activity. I'm a die-hard fan of the horror genre and typically, a majority of modern horrors are lackluster, but this was surprisingly fresh. I know many will beg to differ, but I was actually scared during this film. However, my definition of ""scares"" are having a feeling of discomfort that just won't let up and feeling uncomfortable in an atmospheric fashion. I think most audiences are scared by the cliché ""jump scares"", so obviously they were disappointed. Still, whether you think this is a great film or a disappointment, you have to give credit where credit is do. Finally, a modern horror film that side skirts clichés, resorts to some good scares, and overall just gives audiences a knockout.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity revolves around a couple who start to hear things at night. Kate gets frightened, so her boyfriend decides to record each night they sleep, to film what they obverse and hear. <br/><br/>First off, the performances are simply terrific. The couple comes off as so authentic, that you can easily pour your shoes into theirs. The film boasts strong character development. Furthermore, the premise is great because it relies on subtlety and simplicity. Most horror stories are way too contrived and over-the-top to be taken seriously. Additionally, the way the film was shot adds to the creepiness and gives a more atmospheric look. ""The fourth kind"", which has a slightly similar story, is filmed with celluloid and it completely dampens the atmosphere. To add to that, I thought the pacing was excellent. No scenes feel too rushed or feel too tedious. This movie was very entertaining. Moreover, this movie was inclusive to a lot of ""money shots"". Money shots are basically scenes that kind of seal the deal and exude excitement. <br/><br/>While this movie is recommendable, there are still some drawbacks. For starters, while the experience is very realistic, there are some scenes that are a little contrived, which detract the experience, but very slightly. Moreover, I thought the ending was a little too gimmicky and almost destroyed the fear factor. Furthermore, I thought some of the character decisions were a little questionable.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Paranormal Activity"" is that rare horror film that's inclusive to great character development, a fresh script, and terrific pacing. It manages to crawl under your skin and it boasts of a very creepy, atmospheric vibe, which is highly significant for a horror film to do. This movie mainly works because it has the requirements of a great film and because of its simplicity. Paranormal Activity comes off as a recommendation."

","Well, thinking that this film was going to be like Blair Witch (a film I hated so much I walked out of) I was hesitant to waste my time watching it. However, a horror/thriller friend of mine convinced me that it was FAR better than Blair Witch. Well, I finally relented and purchased (actually my partner did) it and watched it with him. I was nicely surprised by it. I thought the acting from the two main characters was pretty good really, although I thought the script a little lame, but in fairness it wasn't really bad (like Blair Witch).<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, let me just say that it works as a film dealing with a subject I just don't believe in. There were two points of the film (one involving talcum powder and the other a bite mark) that I really thought were the low points.<br/><br/>For me, it's a film to watch in complete darkness (at night) and cuddled on your sofa for safety. Brilliant - loved it a lot.<br/><br/>The second time I watched it, I was alone (bad mistake) as it scared the sh.it out of me more. So much so I turned all the lights on in the house and watched Simpsons episodes on cable to settle my nerves."
"rlaing131","4","0","1","9 July 2010"," Scarry but a bit dumb
","Overall, I think it's worth watching. I did notice that most people either loved the movie or they thought it was stupid and not scary at all. Perhaps because they went into it with high expectations. I felt that while the main characters were pretty dumb and their actions/decisions often made no sense, I was still somewhat terrified during much of the movie. And yes, pretty early on I figured that she'd probably end up becoming possessed and killing him... and yes, I kept asking, why don't they just call the demon guy??? Why are you so against it??? Or maybe if they have her committed and put her into a padded room she can at least not hurt anyone else. And if the demon starts doing impossible screwy things, professionals can at least witness it and try to do something about it. BUT I still couldn't take my eyes off the screen, especially during those night scenes. In either case, I was scared, which I guess fulfills the purpose of the movie. I don't know about you guys, but if those things were going on in my house I'd be just as scared as those people (though perhaps smarter).<br/><br/>As for acting and filming, I did like it (except the part where he goes into the attic with no light). I really don't know why everyone hated the acting so much. The people really did act pretty realistic. Not like typical Hollywood actors overdo absolutely everything. And yes, their day to day activities in the house were not super exciting and action packed. That wasn't really what they were trying to go for here. I think that the scenes at night were supposed to be enough excitement. Finally, I liked what they did with the camera. It didn't make me dizzy first of all. And it was pretty realistic that if someone was going to setup a camera, they'd just choose one place to put it each night. No one in real life would be trying to change things up for excitement and a change of view. They'd do what was most practical, watch their bedroom."
"IheartCali5882","8","0","1","4 July 2010"," Less is always more!!
","Now this is my kind of horror film; something insidiously creepy but very understated. Of all the scary films I've seen in the past few years, this one managed to scare me more than most and show absolutely NOTHING at the same time. Not a very easy thing to do, but I'm a firm believer in the Hitchcock philosophy that whatever you can imagine will always be scarier than what is provided for you.<br/><br/>As the film starts, we meet Micah and Katie, a San Diego live-in couple who have been trying to get to the bottom of some mysterious occurrences in their home. They've heard what sounded like footsteps in their bedroom, some unexplainable noises coming from downstairs, lights flashing on and off, and other things. Katie believes its a spirit of some sort that has followed her since she was a young girl. Micah conveniently uses this as an excuse to purchase a state of the art video camera that he props up on a tripod in their bedroom to record what happens while they are sleep.<br/><br/>The film is shot reality TV style, a la Blair Witch. Usually this is rather tricky and the movie turns out some rather unrealistic home video camera angles, but here it works because almost all of the footage seems like scenes that a real couple would actually record. It also helps that Micah and Katie (their real names by the way)have a very natural and understated method of acting. Nothing they say or do comes off like they know they're in a movie; they talk the way real people would talk in a real situation.<br/><br/>The scare factor in PA is almost entirely based on the audience's imagination. We don't actually see anything that's scary in its own right; a moving door, swinging chandelier, footprints made in powder, yes, but no demons or monsters or ghosts ever appear on the screen. I find this technique to be 10x more effective than your standard horror movie that goes into ""grotesque"" overload. All the action sequences take place out of sight of the camera, so while we're still able to hear what is going on, our mind is running a mile a minute trying to picture the scene. Very effective.<br/><br/>If you don't have a healthy imagination or if you just simply prefer horror movies that are more ""in your face"" then you'll want to pass on this one. But if you're a fan of this type of film-making, I have no doubt you'll love it.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel! 8/10"
"jordancelticsfan","8","0","1","4 July 2010"," Simply horrifying.
","At long last, I have seen it. ''Paranormal Activity''. Now, some people have said this is ""the scariest movie of all time"". It's not scarier than the original ''Halloween'', or ''Psycho''. But, it is very, very, and all the verys in the world, scary. First off, Oren Peli did an absolute phenomenal job making this film. For this to have been a big of a hit as it was is quite extraordinary. Not much money went into making this movie. The film was shot in Peli's San Francisco home. There are only five actors in the entire film, all virtually unknown. Peli certainly made the best out of things. This is a genuinely thrilling, nicely crafted film that builds and builds on thrills and suspense, rather than gore. The bedroom scenes are such a masterwork of sheer, and utter terror, that I find myself a little uneasy about going to bed in my bedroom again. I think I'll sleep on the sofa tonight. This is what true horror is supposed to be. The performances by the virtually unknown cast make the film better. We don't get horror films like this often, that's for sure. See the phenomenon."
"dee.reid","8","0","1","3 July 2010"," A review of ""Paranormal Activity""
","Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" is actually one of the better-made horror films to come out in recent years. The movie continues the trend we saw popularized 11 years ago in ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), which contrary to a popular belief at the time, uses largely unknown actors being filmed in a documentary-style manner that elicits the notion that we're watching real footage, and that what we are seeing happening in said footage is indeed real.<br/><br/>Alas, ""Paranormal Activity,"" like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and its successors ""Cloverfield"" and ""Quarantine"" (both of which were released in 2008), are all fake. From a critical standpoint, this is both brilliant and frustrating. It's brilliant because despite what we already know that these movies are obviously fake, the style and presentation are convincing enough that what we're seeing is truly happening and is ""real"" within the context of the film.<br/><br/>It's frustrating because many times, the best and most frequently used manner of eliciting realism for such documentary-style film-making is that the camera is often hand-held, which can sometimes induce vertigo and motion sickness in those who suffer from such afflictions. Critics will also point out that the camera-work is so frenetic and unfocused sometimes that it makes it hard to make out what's going on the screen. Fans will note the exact opposite: that many times the person holding the camera is an amateur, and thus we many times only see what they see, which ironically can sometimes be very little and the disorientation they experience in said events becomes our disorientation to experience.<br/><br/>What a mouthful.<br/><br/>Getting back to ""Paranormal Activity,"" what makes this film stand out from those others (""Cloverfield"" so far is my personal favorite - I'm a fan of Japanese monster movies and it won me over - so sue me), is that everything we see is taking place inside a normal-looking suburban household. Katie (Katie Featherston) and her live-in boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are a young suburban couple who are conducting an experiment in which they are trying to document the Paranormal Activity that takes place in their home as they sleep. They set up a camera - which is conveniently placed on a tripod facing their bed as they sleep (thus eliminating the chances of the viewer suffering vertigo and/or motion sickness) - to try to document any supernatural occurrences that happen during the night when they're not awake.<br/><br/>Thus, eventually a supernatural presence does make itself known to them, and the camera is able to effectively capture every occurrence that takes place in their bedroom, and it is indeed scary. (If you see the raw footage, it is so convincing that the special effects employed to make said supernatural occurrences seem real are virtually flawless, and are incorporated into the raw film footage effortlessly.) Eventually, for those of us that remember ""Poltergeist"" (1982) all those years ago, these Paranormal Activities start out as being benign in nature, but grow in malevolence and ferocity and violence as time goes on, and Katie, who suffers from past traumatic experiences with these evil forces, begins to break down both mentally and emotionally as a result of the pressure.<br/><br/>The primary performances by Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are good in luring us into their household as they go about their everyday lives and how their everyday lives are eventually torn asunder by malevolent supernatural forces of unknown origin. The heaviest burden is placed upon the delicate shoulders of Katie Featherston, who seems to be the primary target of the malevolent forces haunting her and Micah's home. She's obviously a bright young woman, but to see her suffer at the hands of an unknown supernatural presence is quite harrowing, and the camera is quite good in documenting her gradual descent into a virtual hell. Unlike the screamers in ""The Blair Witch Project,"" you do feel some sort of connection with Katie, and feel for the pain and torture she endures.<br/><br/>Like the many sorts of movies using this formula, ""Paranormal Activity"" is incredibly well-made and the documentary-style of film-making is good in eliciting some genuinely frightening moments that increase in intensity as the film progresses. While it's not ""The Exorcist"" (1973), it is a worthy entry into the horror firmament, something a lot of horror films using standard film-making techniques are consistently failing to do nowadays.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I could really recommend watching this film at night and/or in the dark. (I cheated and watched it during the day with a friend because she confessed she couldn't do it either.)<br/><br/>8/10"

For that reason, I dare to say this movie is even UNDERrated, instead overrated. Seven stars is the least I think it deserves.

","If you've ever seen a horror movie before, you've seen how it ends in the theater ending, and odds are you've also seen (and predicted) the two alternative/original endings.<br/><br/>Even at that, the buildup the film is horrid. The hype far outweighs the actuality. The film might have been worth seeing in theaters, where other people scream the whole time. It is not worth watching in a dark room, late at night, alone or with friends. It is just too cliché and expected all the way through.<br/><br/>I'm sure you know the concept by now: 2 people live in a house, film themselves haunted by a demon.<br/><br/>All of the things that the demon does are not particularly scary, but are mainly things to make you jump in a movie theater out of the sheer volume of the sound. You take away the obnoxious volume of a movie theater, and there is no scare here and there isn't anything creepy happening that will last with you. You're better off searching you tube for the future of horror, because it isn't here.<br/><br/>On the positive side, both of the main characters are very well acted. This the only reason I give it a 3 instead of a 1.

"Tender-Flesh","3","0","1","20 May 2010"," Low Rent Demon
","Yes, the Low Rent Demon That Could. That's what this should be titled. I had very low expectations for this film, partly because it took 2 years after production to finally make it into theaters, a place it never belonged.<br/><br/>The premise is something you see every day on cable TV shows like A Haunting or Ghost Hunters or whatever. Two people move into a house, they have some strange occurrences, they record it, etc. I won't give away the ending.....because the trailer already did! Anyway, I am not a fan at all of those TV shows or hand-held camera or ShakyCam as it is also known. So, immediately, this film wasn't holding much water for me at the start. We begin with Katie and Micah, who annoyingly has his name pronounced Meeka, which is abominable. They are dating, living together, and ""engaged to be engaged."" Katie has been experiencing weird things and seeing shadows moving since she was eight, and her house burned down when she was little. Flash forward to today, I mean 2006, where Micah has purchased a camera and is now documenting anything that happens. The creators of this film obviously loved the Amityville Horror series because very often, the ""horrors"" take place right around the same time every night, sometimes even 3:15, just like in old Amityville. But, we don't have a ghost going bump in the night, we have a demon. It is obsessed with Katie and sadly never rips her clothes off to reveal the only thing anyone wanted to really see in this film. Thus, after filming begins, we get the usual haunted house trappings. Things go bump in the night, usually around the same time, sheets get moved around, lights turn on or off, the door closes, etc. Towards the end of the film, obviously the film has to lead somewhere, we get more intense happenings as footprints are left in powder on the floor, Katie is dragged from her bed, and then there is the finale. Or, rather, 2 endings. One you see in the trailer(idiot producers!) and the other is an even more unbelievable bit of tripe.<br/><br/>Now, I know there are people out there who believe in ghosts to their core and this movie will cater to you just as the aforementioned TV shows do. But the finale comes out looking like something straight out of The Ring or The Grudge and is very weak. Of course, plenty of fools think this is real film footage. I will say that acting like they are not acting is something these actors are sort of good at, better than TV haunting shows but certainly not ready for the big screen.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this plot is that the haunting itself is not believable nor is the reaction of the participants. First, when does Katie go to school? I thought she was a student. We see her study, finally, towards the end of the film, and Micah is never at work, he's always screwing around with the camera or his computer. Next, no one stays with them to verify the story. It only happens to them, and when the psychic visits, he gets some vibes, but he doesn't actually see anything good. To alleviate the issue, if the demon is so troublesome, have other people stay in the house and get some night jobs! Seriously, everything is scarier at night(not to mention that these idiots never seem to want to turn the lights on downstairs when they repeatedly wake up to bumps and thumps. Therefore, work at night! Sleep during the day! I've done it! And get a dog. And get a few friends to stay over. That's some of the more unbelievable aspects I found myself pondering during this ""film."" <br/><br/>I can't believe some guy spent 20 bucks taking his girl to see this garbage at the theater. I know, there will be some staunch supporters of this tripe who will lavish praise on its non-existent budget and what inventive people can do with just a camera. Well, that's fine, but unless you are 16, today's horror audience wants a little more than what they can find any day on afternoon cable. As far as low budget films like this go, do yourself a favor and just watch Blair Witch Project again. Even that isn't original(see The Last Broadcast to find out what I mean), but at least it has an element of fear that is sadly lacking in Paranormal Blah. It reminds me of the way many people on this site who are younger(and would be attracted to and scared by this movie) comment about how Jaws and the Exorcist are laughable. Amazing."

When the movie came out, again, everybody who knows I'm into horror told me, this is one for you, or, watch it alone...in the dark. Hee haw, here come the bone people. I waited until the hype was over to watch it, what about that, ey? The same with Avatar. I am not going to review it, the only thing I can say is, 9 out of 10 for the CGI, 5 for the story. For me it was Titanic in space. To much about a love story. I watched the theatrical and the unrated version of PA to see what's the difference. Well, it's all about an alternate ending. For me the theatrical ending was better. The unrated one is rougher. But is it worth the hype? I must admit, it's the Blair Witch of the '00. It was made real cheap, no stage settings, no special effects (almost none), no more than 5 actors, unknown so far. And a director who was unknown before the movie came out. It made a lot of money and, sadly, they are in pre-production for PA 2. Leave it please. And again, there are already some rip offs of the movie. For a horror geek, let's say, it isn't really that scary. It do has his moments but most of the time it plays with your urban fears. For non horror people out there this surely will give you goosebumps. Yes, I also got my share of it the last 5 minutes. It starts of real easy, and it builds his tension, slowly. Oh yes, it was all figured out pretty well, the editing, the fast forward and it works. Somehow, you care about Katie. It could happen to yourself. There isn't any blood in it, not to mention I mean, no nothing really. You just have to wait until the demon or entity pops up. But it is the decay of Katie that get's you. What would you do when it would happen to you? Little by little the movie get's rougher. I can agree by watching trailers that people really jumped in their seats. It clocks in just under 90 minutes and that's okay. There's a 99 minute version, way to long. The last scene really got me, the screaming of Katie. The off camera suggesting what's going on, the...well watch it for yourself. Do some activity, plug it in your machinery."

Imagine someone extracted a fair-to-middling twenty-five minute segment from one of those, padded it out with filler scenes and bloated it up into eighty minutes. Alternately, 'Paranormal Activity' resembles the product of the sixth best short story in an anthology made into a full-length movie. It's just too puny a story to carry the weight, and the movie is far too slight as a result. 'Paranormal Activity' comes across very much as a 'Blair Witch' wanna-be, although it misses entirely that movie's engaging mythos and 'ghost story' quality. The ending of 'PA' was actually pretty bad (I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was), but rest assured that the alternate ending (included in the 'Extras') is way worse. This movie would have only gotten one star were it not for the bits where the girl gets out of bed and stands still for hours. Those were about the only bits which really worked.

No review spoiler could possibly do any damage to this film. A film so poor that it will never even achieve cult status as an unintentional comedy.

"galensaysyes","2","0","2","12 April 2010"," So much nothing
","Here's another un-film pretending to be someone's home video, and gutting the language of movie-making. Construction is fragmentary; movement, composition, and juxtaposition are next to meaningless; and however any such movie is shot, it ends up looking like all the others. A few talented directors, perhaps seeing those limits as a challenge, have managed to do relatively interesting things within the form, e.g. the way Jaume Balagueró staged Rec so that the actions looked accidental rather than choreographed. By contrast, PA is just a series of indifferently written, poorly shot scenes depicting a few unexciting incidents experienced by unintelligent characters in an uninteresting setting. If most horror films are basically twenty-minute stories with padding, this one is a three-minute story--in effect a YouTube joke clip, except that you have to wait forever to get to the punchline, and when you do it makes no sense. The film does succeed as a demo reel for Katie Featherston, whose impersonation of a reality-show subject is convincing enough to carry the show, or would be if there were a show to carry. This one is so much nothing."
"davideo-2","4","0","1","8 April 2010"," Pretty corny rubbish, really, but something keeps you hooked to the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>These types of 'shaky hand held camera' horror films have been very much in the fashion over the last few years, with notable films including The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield and Quarantine. And this offering that Steven Spielberg apparently called 'the scariest film he'd ever seen', which focuses on a couple who share a big house in the San Diego suburbs that seems to suffer from a demonic squatter. It's my fault for not checking it more closer, but being a motion sickness sufferer, these films just don't appeal to me. Why I didn't switch Paranormal Activity off about half an hour in to it is baffling to me, since the plot and the two main characters just weren't engaging me that much and yes, I was starting to feel slightly ill. But despite the corny story that you can take the michael out of till the cows come home and the irritating lead couple, I was compelled to watch it to the end. Somehow, this very average, flawed film does create a genuine air of mystery with regards the supernatural presence, weirdly more so when a specialist confirms it feels more like a 'demon' than a ghost. When the mystery ending does come by, it doesn't really come as a revelation or clear anything up, and in some ways is just as laughable as the film has been up to this point, but all the same, Paranormal Activity has a supernatural hold over you. **"
"efs2","7","0","2","8 April 2010"," Spooky Little Movie
","Paranormal Activity is a story told from the point of view of a home video camera, and entirely within the home of a young couple. So, like Cloverfield, it is a variant of the style of The Blair Witch Project. But it is original enough and clever enough to be well worth watching for fans of scary movies. There is no gore or ax-wielding monster. The tension comes from a story that becomes progressively more horrifying through thoughtfully choreographed imagery and sounds. The pacing is near perfect. It drew me in and creeped me out, just like it was supposed to. One warning: there are apparently three endings, reflecting the trend to keep tinkering with movies even after they are released. The one I saw involved the arrival of police officers. And from the descriptions I've heard of the others, I think it is probably the best one."
"crossrad","3","0","1","4 April 2010"," Glaring Problems with Plausibility Stop this Being Scary
","To start with the bottom line, it wasn't scary at all! Now this isn't because I'm hard - I had to turn off the television during ""Wrong Turn"". And I am usually good at being able to suspend disbelief in order to become immersed in a film. But there were problems with this film that prevented me being absorbed, so I could not have an emotional reaction to it.<br/><br/>The scenes are very repetitive. Text appears telling us the ""night number"". Then there are six seconds of silence while they sleep with the room quite brightly lit (I couldn't do that - I need blackout blinds and all lights off). Then the ghost starts making a noise. In later scenes it does a bit more. I couldn't stop asking myself why the ghost is pacing himself - why not polish her off on night #1? If he's going to leave teeth marks, why not go for broke? There is no depth to the plot. We are never told why Katie spends her life being followed around by a ghost. Neither Katie nor Micah spend any time trying to find out. Nor do they try to protect themselves. They don't lock the bedroom door or even shut it. They don't lose sleep over it, so why should we? Compare this to ""The Hills Have Eyes"". There we have nuclear weapons testing and McCarthy era paranoia as a foundation to give the human drama real depth. And the characters react realistically to the perils as they arise.<br/><br/>The acting is good ""in the small"" in that Katie acts the part of the hysterical female convincingly and realistically. But when Katie complains about the camera we know that she won't be getting her way because then there would be no movie. The house is unrealistically uncluttered, brand new and spotlessly clean. I found out from the special features on the DVD that the house had been remodelled for the movie with for example, upmarket banisters. I think it looked too expensive and luxurious for the youngsters.<br/><br/>The ""filmed-by-the-characters-in-the-plot"" format may be acting as a constraint here. It worked well in ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" but here it is all too obvious. By the time Micah is sprinkling powder around to check for footprints, the ghost has already demonstrated intelligence, physical powers, and control over Katie's mind. It isn't believable that Micah would think the ghost would not be able to either leap over the powder or sweep up after him.<br/><br/>And the format is not so new after all - check out ""The Ghost Camera"" 1933!"

","Oh, why, why, why did the makers of this movie ruin what had been a hugely creepy little fright flick with a terribly stupid ending? <br/><br/>In the tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those gimmick movies, in which a young couple films themselves sleeping at night in an attempt to capture on screen the ghostly goings on that have been plaguing them. There's not much more to the movie than the pleasurable tension it gradually builds as the freaky happenings escalate in intensity from night to night. There are some hints at a traumatizing past for the woman and a sometimes strained relationship with her boyfriend (who she clearly wants to be her fiancé), but the screenplay doesn't go anywhere with these narrative threads. It's just as well, because the appeal of the movie lies in the fact that these are supposedly two ordinary joes filming themselves without pretense, and too much narrative would ruin the effect.<br/><br/>For almost its entire length, ""Paranormal Activity"" is pretty scary, and proves how much horror you can eek out of doors that move by themselves and things that go bump in the night. How disappointing, therefore, that the film thinks it needs to cap itself with a hard-sell finale like something right out of a big-budget horror film. It really mars the effect of everything that's preceded it.<br/><br/>The DVD version of the film offers an alternate ending that's much better and is much more consistent with the rest of the movie's tone.

It's atmospheric, boring at times and tedious and portrays what's becoming society's obsession with voyeurism with the paranormal merely the topic. We have Katie, a good-looking shapely brunette with a shrill scream, and Micah, the average-looking dumb ass warned not to bring a Ouija board into the house but does it anyway. It seems they've been living in their home for three years and have just now noticed paranormal activity; Katie even adds she's been haunted since she was a kid. Everything is video-taped and there's some shaky ""Blair Witch"" point-of-view as Micah obsesses with taping everything in an effort to get rich off of activity he doesn't really believe in as Katie gets more and more frustrated. The paranormal sounds are little more than atmosphere and there's no plot. It's never revealed just how Katie's past connects to what's happening now. Her sleepwalking is scary, Micah's powder test is supposed to be scary, but it's handled fleetingly. The unseen ghost is the real star waiting for it to appear; it actually has more personality than the two of them put together. The whole underlying ""demonic"" pretense is unnecessary; it detracts from the story to imply whatever is occurring has to be evil. Why does it ""have"" to be evil? It's merely a tool to put a scare at the end. It's a surprise, but it's not scary... It's a punchline for a long and very tedious riddle that just went way too long to get to its point."

","Paranormal Activity under the influence of Cabin Fever. The Amityville horror for the Youtube generation. If it weren't for the hype, this wouldn't stand out to be a great ghost haunting movie, but everyone is expecting the 'scariest movie of all time'. Unlike a lot of people, i did like this movie. This is a rare event in horror when i actually cared for the characters involved. Why? Because we get 2/3 of the running time jam packed with character development. It's like a slasher movie, we now no our character now we just want to see them get slaughtered, or in this case, haunted. Although the movie maintain interesting, it does take way to long to get into the big scares. They director would tease us with a few door slams, building tension and then cutting back to broard daylight. Making us wonder why didn't they decide for it to be over the coarse of one night, instead of 3 weeks.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity, believer or not, is pretty damn scary. We don't need Saw traps to make us tremble, because this is shocking, makes you jump and delivers on what you could ask for in a super natural horror. The greatest thing about Paranormal Activity is that you believe every single scratch, wail, bang and foot step. The realism is stunning. It's not just scares, but also there is mystery, that you feel really involved in and I thought was one of the movies strengths. One of it's weakness' is that the shocks are two infrequent, it's NOT the scariest movie of all time and there needed to be more. There were some touches that really made the movie scary, and I admired where the plot went, but the teasing does a grow a little to tedious, but in the end pays off.<br/><br/>Overall: Haunting, mysterious and very scary.

","So my older brother comes to visit, and brings me a DVD copy of ""Paranormal Activity"". He explains that it is the best movie he has seen in years. Deciding to give the movie a try, I set out to do just that. Late at night, my girlfriend and I get comfortable in a dark room, turn on Paranormal Activity, and spend the next hour or so wondering where it all went wrong.<br/><br/>~Spoiler Warning!~ First, the two people in the movie are clearly not emotionally engaged with each other. They appear to be in their 20's, and most couples in that age group show more physical emotion than verbal. Basically, the couple rarely hug or kiss, and even more rarely say I love you or any endearing phrases at all.<br/><br/>Second, the girl tells us that she has been haunted by some strange entity since she was a young girl. This surprises me as the couple have been together for a few years, and yet her boyfriend doesn't know anything about it? Strange things happening at night that constantly wake people from their REM cycle, would be a hard kept secret. Especially for multiple years.<br/><br/>Third, the camera sits on a tripod for most of this movie. It watches the bed, and looks out the door into a hallway outside the master bedroom. While the couple are setting things up, they turn a light on at the end of the hall so that everything can be seen. Once they turn off their bedroom light, everything goes black and white, and the light from the hall disappears. Why does this light turn off when their bedroom light turns off? Who knows. Perhaps the director was a moron and connected the switches improperly. Maybe all the outlets in the house turned off when the bedroom light went out. Or maybe, its just one huge mistake like the rest of the movie. Lets continue...<br/><br/>Fourth, when the camera is not on the tripod, one of the actors is carrying it. This reminds me of the Blaire Witch Project, which only got big due to its huge hype of ""A video cassette was found in the woods. Here is the actual footage"", which went downhill when people found the actors were in other movies a few years later. During this time of the moving camera, the actors are very good at being useless. The girlfriend wants to ignore things and hope they go away, which is very unrealistic. All while the boyfriend wants to tease the creature to see what it is capable of, simply so he can get it on camera. Poor acting is no excuse for a low budget, great actors are in low budget plays all the time, and they still have to seem realistic.<br/><br/>Fifth, the scary stuff. If you have not seen the movie, or do not want the big spoiler to be known, please don't read this section. The ""haunting"" spirit first knocks some keys onto the floor while the couple are sleeping. Can we prove this? No, because the keys are in the kitchen and the camera is in the bedroom. The spirit then bangs on a wall to wake the couple. Could this be from another source? Something outside hitting the house could cause the same effect, as could an animal climbing around in your attic. The spirit then moves the door slightly, which is seen by the camera. Is there any explanation for this? Things like this happen in my house all the time. Old houses shift, and wood frames bow during the year. We have days where doors stick shut because the frames are too tight, simply from the temperature. Two big ends that really killed the movie for me. First, the girl stands up in a deep sleep and doesn't move for multiple hours. Not really all that scary. Odd, yes. Scary, no. Second is when the girl is pulled out of bed, and dragged down the hallway. First, she is pulled out of bed by her leg and dropped on the floor, landing hard enough to wake her, but not hard enough to wake her boyfriend. Did I mention they have a hard wood floor? My 3 year old rolled out of his 8 inch high bed, and weighing only 35lbs or so, hit a carpeted floor, and I still heard it from almost 30 feet away (Through walls!!). And yes, I was sleeping when it happened. To continue, the girl lands on the floor and wakes up. She does a quick double take to see where she is, but is then grabbed and ripped through the door by some unseen force. Doors slamming, loud footsteps, standing for hours while you sleep, and when you wake up on the floor, your as calm as can be? Not terribly realistic. Not only does she get dragged away, but she doesn't start screaming until she has been pulled completely out of the bedroom. Not when she feels something grabbing her legs. Not when she realizes she is being dragged. She makes it from the bed, all the way through the door, being dragged on her chest across HARD WOOD, yet she doesn't scream for the first 5-8 feet of floor? ~End Spoiler~ After everything, I really wish I hadn't spent the 90 or so minutes fast forwarding to the ""good parts"", which weren't that good. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. This movie is such useless crap that I wouldn't wish such a waste of time on my most hated enemy. The world would be a much better place without movies like this or the Blaire Witch Project.<br/><br/>For those people that watched the movie and found it scary, I pity you, and your taste for poor movies."

On the other hand, there were no effects making this film ""a horror film"". It is not so necessary however the scenario doesn't support this leakiness. Nevertheless, the acting of cast is good. I had watched Katie Featherston (as Katie) and Micah Sloat (as Micah) for the first time. They were both nifty while Katie was dreading and Micah was not due to ""Paranormal Activities"". March Fredrichs, as The Psychic, has a persuasive acting. I could watch this film as a matter of fact. Finally, i believe that if you want to be frightened really, it is not the correct film. If so, don't forget to watch Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922), Faust - Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926), Werckmeister harmóniák (2000), The Thing (1982), and etc."

","i have to give this film 9/10, because it did what i expect of an effective horror film... it scared me a lot in a quiet way, no real BIG scare tactics... apart from the bed dragging scene..... it genuinely spooked me, it also frustrated me quite a lot.. here's my only negatives on the film..... The pig headed behaviour of the boyfriend, why on earth they hadn't got the demonologist in asap?? even the first few nights spawned enough video evidence for any sane person to run screaming for professional help..as this couple seemed so isolated during all this terror... yes we had the token friend, but surely no one would want to be suffering this virtually alone.... if you can count the stupidity of the ""I'm so tough"" boyfriend... he clearly had no respect for her past or for the dangers in meddling with spiritual paraphernalia such as a ouija board... might as well just send mr demon an open invitation... I also couldn't fathom out how they actually slept at all and WITHOUT A LIGHT ON!!! I only watched the darn film and I had to have the landing light on all night.. yes I'm a big sissy girl. its one of those films where you just know you would do things so differently.. but that's a good indication because i'm theorising and keeping the film alive.. I was very relieved to discover there is no factual background to this film as my pig husband told me, as he slept like a baby all night... thank god for the internet.... to finish, this film will bore certain people,in the same way a slasher movie makes me yawn.... but for others, like myself, it will scare the bejesus out of us and yes give us that sleepless night... a successful horror film..."

","Perhaps I could write an interesting and informative piece about the film that I just saw. And maybe part of this review will do so. After all, there is something to talk about in this dribbly piece of hogwash, however, I think it's more interesting to talk about the circumstances under which I viewed the film.<br/><br/>So let's set the scene. Tuesday night. Cheap Tuesday of course. The movie has been out for almost a month, so it's not at the hugely populated Avatar level. However, being a suburban multiplex in the holidays on the cheapest night for cinema tickets, there were enough people populating the cinema to give it the appropriate atmospheric tension.<br/><br/>The atmosphere that I speak of consisted of what I almost lovingly refer to as bogans, a wannabe hippy couple and very scared tweens (and one very scared 20 year old who groped me throughout the progression of the film. Luckily I she drove me, so the gropage was acceptable.) Throughout the film, there were the proverbial squeals, awkward and nervous laughs that follow the squeals and the judgmental ""I'm not buying this"" comments. While these actions from the surrounding patrons were quite the distraction from the actual film itself, they also proved to be an interesting factor when looking at what can help make or break a movie: the audience.<br/><br/>So while the actual film, which was trying its damned hardest to be a carbon copy replica of the 1999 small budget hit The Blair Witch Project, was not the best piece of cinema I'd ever see, it nonetheless managed to be on par with what I expected from this kind of film, and maybe a little more. I recently ran into one disturbing DVD at my local JB (of which I work at. Boo yeah!) It was a recent film release called Crush starring Chris Egan (from those old Home and Away days back in the early naughties. And yes, it's sad that I remember) which was the usual kind of teen thriller that ultimately amounts to nothing. However, the DVD back cover featured a review that noted the film as being ""a notch above the films in the genre"". And this lovely review is how I see Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>It's not a great film in not such a great genre. However, it is a piece of popcorn fun that can make you feel like you're 16 again, where you may not have cared about special effects, narrative structure, or even a good ending. Mind you, when I was 16, I did expect, crave and need these things. So perhaps the film allows you to step into another world. That of the uncaring and unbiased tween expectations. And if, in this new tween age group, my choice is between this Twilight or Paranormal Activity, then the latter will always reign supreme."

Forget the fact that you are watching a movie, think as if you are watching a documentary in discovery or nat geo.<br/><br/>The fact that there are lots of similar incidents happening around the globe is the creeping factor about the movie.

"gops-s21","6","0","1","11 January 2010"," A well directed home-video
","Now, let me be straight about this movie. It's hyped. Absolutely no doubt that it's hyped. I went in the movies this Saturday expecting another 'Cloverfield' or a 'Blaire-witch' and what I got was only a few minutes of goose-bumps. I am not saying that it wasn't scary. I totally agree that it was hell scary so much so that I didn't sleep that night after returning home. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good movie. The movie's plot development is damn slow and I am not complaining about the pace either. But in such cases the director is supposed to cover that up with some 'genuine' drama and it is here that it fails miserably. The dialogs are so dull that they never come out from 'Please don't go in there Micah. You are not going in there. ' and for the most part of its 85 minutes running time nothing really happens.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is the camera work. Now I am not saying that it's hand-held camera technique made me dizzy(I actually love that stuff) but it's the camera positioning. I mean the camera stays over at one place in the bedroom where you actually get all the scares. Instead the director should have used it at various places. May be it was the part of their plan to develop that sense of Deja-vu that you have been in the bedroom for quite some time but they could have used it more creatively.<br/><br/>Another flaw that I noticed is that there are a lot of places where you would ask ""Why didn't he just."" and this isn't good for a movie especially a horror flick.<br/><br/>On the 'up-side' this movie was genuinely scary at places. The scene where the lady stands up staring at Micah for hours and hours was damn scary and the last 15 minutes or so also provided the best goose-bumps that stay with you even after you leave the theater. It's a movie that makes you believe that there are indeed such things happening somewhere. It expects its audience to use their imagination and completely relies on it. And that is the reason why there is so much of difference of opinion towards this movie. It seriously depends upon various factors such as the place or the time or even the people with whom you are watching this flick. If you are going in a theater room fully packed with kids or teenagers shouting from every corner then the movie might turn out to be outrageously funny! It does provide you with some terrific moments that might take you by surprise BUT they only come in bits.<br/><br/>It certainly deserves a 6/10 because it's just a well-directed home video that was 'I assume', probably shot by the director with an intention to scare his friends.<br/><br/>Somebody told me that you need to be 'strong-hearted' to watch this movie. I agree that to some extent but to me the movie requires you to be 'strong-minded' because it tests your patience for most of the time."
"dfranzen70","9","0","1","9 January 2010"," Total, unflinching terror
","In Paranormal Activity, a young suburban couple is constantly terrorized by mysterious happenings during the night – loud crashes, footsteps, and more – and decides to record the events with a videocamera. Filmed on a shoestring budget, the movie is at turns terrifying, mysterious, and electrifying, and it’s probably not a movie you want to watch alone and in the dark.<br/><br/>Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) have been experiencing some sort of phenomena in their new home. Apparently, though, this has been happening to Katie for years, since she was about eight years old. As the phenomena prevent the couple from having a good night’s sleep, Micah purchases a hand-held videocamera so they can try to solve their problem.<br/><br/>They wind up getting more than they bargained for. The events worsen, and tension mounts. Neither Micah nor Katie can get much sleep, if any, and the pressure quickly begins to take its toll. They even consult a psychic, who advises them to call a demonologist (really); however, by the time they actually call the demonologist, he’s out of town – and the psychic can no longer help them.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, certainly, but I found this movie to be extremely unsettling. It is not a pleasant movie to watch, even by horror-thriller standards. Some of you may know that I’ve seen a lot of movies, and some of you may also know that includes many horror-thriller movies. Often, these movies aren’t particularly well done – they don’t have a strong plot or decent actors and rely instead on effects for shock value. Paranormal Activity brings the shock and terror by following a very simple formula, one that works very often in horror films: keep most of the terror offscreen, and your audience will be frightened. It’s what you can’t see that’ll do you the most damage.<br/><br/>In a neat, effective trick, director Oren Peli shows everything through the lens of the newly acquired videocamera, which lends quite the sense of truth and sincerity to the proceedings. So when the camera is on the nightstand, with the handy timestamp in the lower corner of the screen, we can see for ourselves what horrors await the somewhat-slumbering couple. We see what they see, which just adds to the unfettered panic. You start to believe you’re right there in the room, and that whatever is attacking Micah and Katie will come after you next.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity works because of its low budget and streamlined approach. If you’re not able to buy in to the whole idea of being scared – if you’re the kind of person who thinks of horror films as things to be laughed at – you won’t likely enjoy this one to its fullest. The movie has a slow 30 minutes or so at the beginning, but once things get moving, look out!"
"ssvikas","5","0","1","10 January 2010"," Commendable effort & realistic feel; nothing too scary!
","This was supposed to be a movie that scared many in the Western world. If you have seen those advertisements, you can’t miss the audience yelling in theatres. But for all its hype as a realistic scary movie, honestly I wasn’t scared one bit watching this one. The likes of “Ring” or “Grudge” and their sequels were far scarier actually.<br/><br/>The story is about a young couple Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherson) who seem to be experiencing the paranormal in their house. Strange footsteps, banging on doors, faucets and lights going on and off doors opening and closing by themselves compel Micah to capture it on camera to better understand the events.<br/><br/>What is worth appreciating is that it has entirely been shot on Handy-cam on a shoe-string budget of USD 15,000. Having already become a successful, the ROI figures would have just gone tizzy. As long as you don’t mind the shaky & grainy pictures and unedited sound buzz and that you only see 6 human faces throughout its near 90 minute runtime, it oozes of creativity and confidence and it scared people too! <br/><br/>So, what makes Paranormal Activity work? It’s the thought of just two people living all alone in a luxuriously huge American house. People can relate to Micah and Katie who are not stars but just commoners; the idea is to make audience feel “hey, it could’ve been us”. Then comes the western obsession with exorcism, ouija boards and yeah ‘demonologists’ to solve their problems despite their tech advances! <br/><br/>I was told that this was to be boring in the beginning with scariness picking up slowly as the story progresses. But, barring those odd scenes of doors moving and strange sounds punctuating it, you wait endlessly for something concrete. When something really happens towards the end, you’re done with your endurance. I saw two of its 3 alternate endings, which were at best unsetting, but not unexpected.<br/><br/>There is however no worthwhile explanation offered for the phenomena happening there and you have to be content with the abrupt ending leaving you tad cheated. And No, it’s not a real story; but, director Oran Peli has definitely made a wonderful effort at keeping it realistic. Ah yes, you have to give it to the director for casting the duo who have such great chemistry. And what more, Sloat doubles up as cameraman too! <br/><br/>If this movie doesn’t work in India, I won’t really be surprised. In countries like ours, the sheer number of people living in a neighborhood can scare ghosts away! But, if you’re looking for a break from the lame Bollywood fare of this week, try this flick. But yeah, if are a tad weak hearted for horror or sleep alone at home, better beware!"
"Wizard-8","Null","0","4","7 January 2010"," Not great... but better than BLAIR WITCH
","If you were as disappointed by ""The Blair Witch Project"" as I was when it first came out, you will probably understand why I passed on ""Paranormal Activity"" when it first came out, since this new movie seemed to have been inspired by ""Blair Witch"". I only ultimately rented this new movie when I had run out of other choices.<br/><br/>To some degree, I was surprised. Overall, this is a better movie than ""Blair Witch"". For starters, this movie does a better job of laying out the situation at the beginning - there's no fat in this part of the movie, and the explanations for what is happening does not come across as forced. Also, the movie is clearly TRYING to spook its audience a number of times during the running time, unlike what I felt in ""Blair Witch"". Some of the low budget effects are impressive, and will have you thinking, ""How did they do that?"" There is also a genuine feeling of building terror towards the end.<br/><br/>But the movie is far from perfect. I didn't really care if the characters lived or died. For one thing, they seem pretty dim-witted at times - if this spooky stuff was happening to me, I would immediately get out of there or immediately contact the professionals! Also, though the terror starts building towards the end, the bulk of the movie is not very spooky at all. And the ending... well, I'll just say that I thought ""That's IT?"" when the screen turned blank.<br/><br/>This is a movie more interesting than scary. It's not recommended when you're in the mood to be entertained. But if you are a low budget filmmaker who wants inspiration, or interested in what filmmakers can accomplish on a micro budget, then this movie may be up your alley."
"John_Truby","Null","0","3","7 January 2010"," It packs a punch
","Paranormal Activity isn't a great film. But it is a brilliant indie film-making strategy. In my article ""10 Story Techniques You Must Use to Sell Your Script"" (see below) I state that ""if you're writing a screenplay for an indie film, write horror, thriller, or love."" Horror is the most consistently popular genre around the world after myth. But unlike the epic-scale myth, horror can be made for very little money.<br/><br/>So why doesn't everyone just go out and make their own indie horror film? Almost everyone trying to break in does. But they don't succeed because they don't know the horror genre well enough to do it in a unique way, especially within the form's extremely confining budget limitations.<br/><br/>Writer-director Orin Peli succeeded where most others fail because he adapted the special horror story beats to a low budget and turned the lack of money into a strength. The strategy is not new; The Blair Witch Project pioneered it back in 1999. Essentially, you make the horror come out of the real and the everyday. Instead of jamming blood and gore (and expensive special effects) in the audience's face, you highlight the contrast between normal people and extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>By first establishing normal characters (played by unknown actors), you intensify the audience's identification up front. Then you build the attacks from the small and the believable to the big and the outrageous, all within the tightest space you can find. Because you start with real characters the audience identifies with, the audience experiences the attacks in a more personal and intense way.<br/><br/>At least that's the theory. But you may have noticed a huge structural flaw in this approach. The less money you have, and the smaller the space of your horror world, the less plot you have. The hero cowers in a room and the monster attacks again and again. That's the same beat, folks. The audience gets bored quickly, not to mention exasperated by the fact that the hero doesn't just get out of the damn room.<br/><br/>Peli doesn't completely overcome this basic weakness in the structural foundation of the horror form. But he uses two techniques that make Paranormal Activity a big hit. First, he establishes the everyday reality of his couple with great skill. He strings together a number of short scenes in the beginning of the story with no structural value except to show that these two actors are a real couple living in a real house. They have a believable chemistry and argue about the things real couples fight about.<br/><br/>Any director will tell you that 80% of his or her job is the casting, and these two lead actors prove that in spades. We tend to forget that one of the biggest obstacles stars must overcome is getting the audience to forget that they are famous actors playing a part. The job here was the opposite. The actors had to play the early scenes in the flat, non-dramatic way real people are in real life. But they also had to be adept at the extremely dramatic acting required in the later scenes when the supernatural attacks attain life-and-death stakes. These actors excel at both, and the performance by Katie Featherston is superb.<br/><br/>The second technique Peli uses to overcome the lack of plot in the horror form is his subtle weaving of the horror story beats (events) into the realistic world he sets up. Horror has more specialized beats than any other genre, a whopping 15. Why? It's because horror is so narrow a form, with so little natural plot, that it must have that many unique beats to carry it. Those specialized beats represent the superstructure, the horror mythology if you will, that prevents a plot with normally one beat, repeated ad infinitum, from sinking like a stone. Beats like the ""sins of the parents"" and ""crossing the threshold"" aren't just a natural outgrowth of the unique theme of horror. They create the plot complexity and character depth that this form desperately needs to last on the big screen for 90 + minutes.<br/><br/>Peli includes every one of the 15 unique beats in Paranormal Activity, but he sets the realistic base of the film so well that you don't notice them. I would argue he could have pushed the horror beats even further and thereby avoided a long stretch of sloooowwww that plagues the middle of his film. But that was a choice he consciously made, believing I suspect that he would lose the realism that was the heart of his storytelling strategy. In this he also borrowed from the strategy of the short film: focus everything to one big punch at the end of the story. It's one helluva punch.<br/><br/>Ironically, Peli's low-budget, realistic approach highlighted for me the idea that horror is fundamentally about dying. He simply sets his camera in the corner of a single room and then builds the assault. When all is said and done, great horror storytelling is about pushing you into a smaller and smaller box until your box is in the ground.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","Paranormal Activity Review by Dylan Paranormal Activity is a recent success in cinema that goes too prove that you don't need big budget effects or gore to make a great scare movie. The film goes back to the Blair Witch Project type formula which we've seen in recent films like Cloverfield and a bit was used in District 9. The films protagonists are a couple of who look to be around 25 years old. The movie starts at a point where they think something Paranormal has been happening in their house and the male lead has gone and brought himself a camera to try and document the events and capture something. Dur in the film (which couple be mistaken for reality since it has no opening or closing credits) you will go through the emotions the couple go through and this add for a more realistic approach when they argue. The movie concentrates on some classic scares rather than any gore cringing scenes like from Saw or Hostel. The movie managed to give me chills and Goosebumps down my spine which goes to prove it does it's job.

","....But walked away pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I will admit there were times I was incredibly bored, especially in the beginning, but once the night sequences were being shown, I found myself completely involved, to the point where it felt as if I was alone in a sold out, over packed theatre. <br/><br/>Micah and Katie sold me. Many critics have claimed that Micah was obnoxious or ruined the movie, but to be honest, he was my favorite part of the movie. Katie had her moments of believability, but I kept feeling annoyed by her incessant whining. Not to say I wouldn't be whining too if I was getting harassed by a demon! But sometimes I found myself thinking, ""Ok enough is enough, shut this girl up!""<br/><br/>Some of the most nail-biting and just plain ol' freaky moments for me include the small things. Such as doors slamming, or blankets moving. I found myself starting to worry for my sister a tad when Katie stood over Micah for hours, in a trance...cause I remember MANY nights when my sister did things like that, or had conversations with me in her sleep, all of which she NEVER remembered in the morning...doctor's called it night terrors, now after watching this, I'm not convinced Doc! I was on the edge of my seat 85% of the movie, not 100% only because the beginning, as I stated before, was bland. But it was needed to develop a backstory, which helped make my decision to rate this movie a 10. <br/><br/>The final whammy for me was when Katie was dragged out of bed. I STILL find myself wondering how in the world they did that. It looked so real and believable that it literally made me scream at the top of my lungs...embarrassing, I know. <br/><br/>As for the end, I was scared, genuinely 100% freaked out when I walked out of the theatre. I felt more relieved when I walked out and saw another girl with the same look I had on my face and shaking just as much! I'm a stickler for horror films, have seen a million and one of them and nothing has ever affected me the way this movie did. Maybe because growing up, I am convinced there was a ghost living in my room...not a malevolent force, just a ghost. For example it would turn off my radio as I slept, and turn on my TV. <br/><br/>When my husband and I got home from this movie, he knew what I was in for...I believe the words were ""You aren't gonna be able to sleep tonight, which means I'm screwed huh?"" It didn't help that I sleep with my bedroom door shut with 2 dogs who could sleep through an earthquake...while my 2 kittens terrorize my house EVERY night. <br/><br/>Made me wonder as I closed my eyes that night, ""Is it only my cats, or something more?"" Needless to say, since then, I sleep with my TV on at night, sort of a comfort thing for me...against my husband's wishes..."

And Egyptians knew more of death then any culture iv studied, and they worshiped cats for a reason, i have NEVER lived in a house for more then a year without owning three cats(three being a number showing up as a ""strengthening for energy"" in this case being cats, cats being your defenders against what some call Evil).

As I can see, many people think this movie is over-rated, not scary or trash. I don't think thats totally true. <br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie in a theater, prepare to not get thrilled by it. Its simply because the atmosphere is very inappropriate and doesn't create the tension. You are watching a REC footage which is trying to be realistic. No duh the budget for this movie is low, its because its suppose to be like a normal CAM REC. If you love watching those Grudge and those types of movies, then don't even bother watching and give out pathetic comments that its bad. So down to the point, this movie is not suitable for Cinema view.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch it on DVD at home, then this is really the movie you should watch. Turn off the lights in your house, watch this movie by yourself or with another person, you would find a whole different atmosphere.

","Oh! I'm having a time travel to the past! I've read many comments that were written 10 years ago when ""The Blair Witch Project"" came out. I'll try to be as objective as possible and not compare both films. <br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" succeeds in generating a sub-conscious fear in the audience by giving details such as demons, ghosts. Then, it executes the premise of ""supernatural"" events via spooky sounds, creepy images (bed sheets raising, foot prints, devil voices, doors opening, the attic, the photography, somnambulism, crashing portraits, physical violence involving getting dragged, and more). <br/><br/>The visual fear generated by the taped material doesn't leaves much for your imagination and that's where I think the movie fails. I mean, it doesn't puts to work your imagination. Your capacity to generate fear is limited because everything is showed in detail. It's OK if you are lazy :). <br/><br/>Another good aspect was having the devilish entity treated as ""someone"" rather than just a force. It was following the couple, placing hints on them, making physical contact, creeping them out, and well, you know, the ending. <br/><br/>The demonic references were very creepy. I dug the whole explanation in the books, the internet, and specially the scary drawings! Brrr. Also, the paranormal professor or whatever he was added a touch of realism and I wanted to see more of him. The demon expert was necessary but unfortunately, he didn't show up. <br/><br/>At some points I thought about many other Horror films that possibly inspired this movie. ""The Entity"" is the first that comes to my mind. That was good because films such as these that tend to generate a supposed reality; should be backed up by Horror elements that worked positively in other movies.<br/><br/>The ending was a let down and demonstrated that sometimes it's not positive to give what the audience wants; and that's a ""shocking"" last momento ending. <br/><br/>Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are decent actors and I believed their on screen chemistry. They felt like a real couple. Oh and Katie was very sexy, what a pair of legs. She's not fat, get it, she's just a normal girl with bones. As if many of her haters had thin and sexy figures."

I did not jump once, partly because you were warned when something was going to happen when you heard a low drone or hum. I watched it late at night (starting at 12:45 am) with the lights off but I wasn't bothered by it -- not in the least. But I still found it to be an interesting story and I would like to watch it again some day (at least one year from now; I bought the DVD).<br/><br/>7/10."

Now untold $Millions more via DVD rentals and sales.<br/><br/>This does not have the production values of major movies. It is a video camera owned by one of the characters, Micah (mee-kah). He and his girlfriend Katie share a home, he says ""we are engaged to be engaged"", and they notice some strange sounds in the house. So Micah decides he will videotape their bedroom every night to see what might be going on.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I wondered how he made the time each day to watch 6 to 8 hours of tape to see what went on. We also never saw him doing his day-trading job.) <br/><br/>Katie Featherston plays Katie and Micah Sloat plays Micah. Whether they are a couple in real life we don't know. The only other key character is the Psychic who is consulted but he turns out not to be much help.<br/><br/>In the process of the story Amber tells Micah that at various times in her life, since childhood, she has heard unusual things at times. She believes there is some sort of evil spirit that follows her around.<br/><br/>As the nights and weeks go by the sounds and unexplained movement of doors get more frequent and greater in magnitude, as though the evil spirit knows a movie is being made and it has to help make a suitable build-up towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting movie but not a very good one.

"jsnwong","6","0","2","1 January 2010"," A unique horror film experience
","This movie was unique to me... but maybe it's just because the types of horror films I usually watch are ones involving monsters or similar, are very predictable, and have lots of special effects / a large budget. Others say this movie is low-budget and I have to agree it looks like anyone with a camera could have done it by themselves, but I felt it was done quite well under these conditions. It took very simple things like the sounds of footsteps, the slight movement of a piece of cloth, as well as the absence of sound and played on these points very nicely. It's because of this simplicity that I was quite shaken up at points. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, you are left anxiously wondering what will happen next, and this anxiety only gets stronger and stronger as the movie goes on. However, I should note that part of the reason for this is that there are many times where things happen without any explanation / you don't get to see it happening (mostly in situations where the camera is in one room and all you hear are noises coming from elsewhere not seen by the camera), and these little 'gaps' meant for the audience to fill-in aren't small, they're quite large sometimes and leave many questions in my mind, but I won't spoil things by listing them here.<br/><br/>This movie was scary because: 1) Its not about a haunted house/place - it's usually comforting watching a movie about some haunted place and knowing it's nowhere near your own home. But this movie is based on a person and some 'thing' that follows the person around everywhere. 2) It involves events that could very well occur anywhere - again, the haunting effects were really simple things that are part of anyone's home. 3) The disturbances get worse and worse - many other horror films have the same level of 'haunting' throughout the whole movie so you end up getting numb to it over time. 4) Never do you actually get to see a monster/ghost - whatever it is, it is invisible and can go anywhere anytime. In many other films, I find things are quite scary... and then I actually see the monster and all of a sudden I'm not scared anymore. The monster might look unrealistic, or I might see its physical limitations (where it can't go, or what it can't do). This movie didn't give me this chance.<br/><br/>If you've ever watched the Blair Witch Project and enjoyed it, then this movie should satisfy you as it's very similar. In the end i'd like to give it a 6.5/10. Even though it did shake me up, it also left me with too many questions about ""what-if"" and ""why"" scenarios throughout the movie; most of which if answered in the movie would probably make it not as scary anymore."
"RainDogJr","7","0","3","31 December 2009"," Dragging her to hell
","Yesterday I finally watched on the big screen this extremely successful low-budget horror movie. As a punk rocker towards horror films I was more than ready enjoy it, to like it yet not be scared at all... even before watching PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, that Steven Spielberg wanted to disappear his DVD of the movie after watching it and being scared as f*** is like ""really? I mean, really?"". So now that I have experienced what for many is the best of the genre in a long time is for me the same, I mean is still the ""really? I mean, really?"", coming after Spielberg's story. <br/><br/>I think the situation with my aunt can help me to let you know my feelings towards PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: she didn't want to watch the Spanish hit REC on the big screen back in 2008. I saw it by on the big screen and while it didn't totally shocked me, I was glad she didn't want to experience it on the big screen because I knew she would not had enjoyed it at all. And I know that's part of the fun, but frankly and since she is my aunt and since I saw how she suffered with PLANET TERROR, well you know. Yesterday I saw PARANORMAL ACTIVITY with my sis, cousin and my aunt. I was worried, or well I was ready to see after a certain shocking scene how my aunt was. ""I only was a bit tense each time the hour appeared on the screen, but nothing more"", those were her words after watching this movie. Really there are no hardcore moments in this movie, of course that lends to the disappointment of many (my sis and cousin hated it). I wasn't disappointed but certainly I wasn't expecting something to be totally scared by. I liked it as solid and fun entertainment but definitely I will not visit it again on DVD or Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>Basically here we don't have the main characters, Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat), sort of unaware about the paranormal stuff, actually Katie knows and feels that she is being haunted by a ghost or something since she was a kid. So what we see here is thanks to Micah and his attempt to help his girlfriend by filming while they are sleeping to capture anything paranormal. It's really entertaining and, thanks to Micah, funny (Micah is at first totally skeptical, just playing around with the camera and wanting to film cool things) and it works in the regard of having a credible transformation of the main characters. We, or at least I, are never scared but we understand the hard times this couple is living (those scenes with Katie all tired of everything) and in that regard the movie works since we think in these characters as helpless young people, not quite like in DRAG ME TO HELL where we see the main character (also a young woman being haunted) at one point doing what the right stuff in order to get back to her normal life. Here Katie's only hopes are his boyfriend (who doesn't have a clue to end with the problem) and a demonologist (!) that we never see. But those scenes with the hour in the screen, those scenes that show what happens each night when Micah and Katie are sleeping are even fun to watch, not because are darn cool but just because the audience's reactions. So, I liked this movie, found it totally entertaining but just that."
"curtydc","5","0","1","31 December 2009"," Over-hyped but not worthless
","A group of my friends went to see this movie when it was released in theaters, they all came out of it glorifying the movie. Don't by into the hype.<br/><br/>I waited for the DVD, mainly because I can't stand seeing horror films in theaters, reason being I can't stand the obnoxious people who crack jokes and laugh at the scary parts so they don't pee their pants. I'm glad I waited for the DVD, because I would have been disappointed had I of seen it at the cinema.<br/><br/>There is enough praise out there for this movie already, so if that's what you are looking for you'll not get it from me.<br/><br/>So lets begin. The acting wasn't terrible, but the characters themselves were unbelievably fake. The actors do a decent job, but what they had to work with wasn't decent at all. I felt the characters were very dumb. On multiple occasions the characters are walking through their house at night looking for whatever made the bump sound. They appear freaked out, and yet, they never bother to turn on a light, instead they search aimlessly in the dark. Now why am I complaining about such a little thing? Because no one in their right mind would go walking around their house at night thinking something scary was in there without ever turning on a light. Also, they sleep with the bedroom door wide open. I know closing it wouldn't really stop anything from opening it, but at least it would give you a little extra sense of security. I'm just saying, in real life, if this were happening to you, wouldn't you close the bedroom door? Or turn on the lights if you thought something was in the house? The characters are just not believable. Next and last complaint. The movie is extremely repetitive and very predictable. Basically, the movie goes like this, it's day time, characters are talking about the same thing they always talk about and are getting less and less sleep but it's not really affecting their lives, now it's night time, they are sleeping, the camera fast forwards to somewhere around 2-4 pm time-frame, something spooky happens, the characters go looking for the cause, find nothing, go back to bed, it's day time again, and repeat. You know when the scary parts are going to happen, it's never a surprise when it does happens. The scary parts hardly even come off as scary, because they are situations that would only be spooky if it were actually happening to you.<br/><br/>So, with that, if you like scary movies, you might like this, it's not a completely worthless movie, but it's really not that good of a movie. 5 out of 10 is fair I'd say."

I find it a very interesting movie about activity in a house and it's just simply fun.<br/><br/>And unlike all the other pseudo-documentary films out there where you can't see anything because of all the ridiculous camera movements, this movie's use of a tripod makes it more enjoyable simply because you can see everything that is happening.<br/><br/>It's not gonna change anything about horror movie's and it's not super scary, it's just a solid fun movie that is best enjoyed with a bunch of friends."
"just_imagine_89","Null","0","3","30 December 2009"," Paranormal Activity
","When even the studio doesn't know what to do with your movie, it may be a sign that you may have stumbled upon something truly unique. Although many doubters may contest this fact, this is exactly what Paranormal Activity is. Using the now familiar 'found footage' device seen so often in the horror genre since the seminal Blair Witch Project (Cloverfield, Rec), the film mines its conventions to their full effect, challenging and destabilising those age-old haunted house tropes along the way. What follows is a masterclass in subtlety and minimalism, accompanied by a brutally slow build up of tension that will satisfy even the most experienced horror fan.<br/><br/>Made over seven days on a budget of $11,000, the film tells the story of couple Katie and Micah's attempts to capture their suspected haunting on film, with an ever-escalating sum of spooky encounters putting pressure on their relationship and placing their lives in danger at the same time. Once they discover that the haunting is not a ghost after all, but a malevolent demon after our heroine, things start to get really hairy and the film barely lets up from here. And in fact, Paranormal Activity dispenses with any concept of complicated storyline or plot, simply using a repeated situation and a terrifyingly mundane static bedroom shot to exert a relentless psychological grip on the viewer that will never let go.<br/><br/>And it is in this particular shot that the bulk of the film's unquestionable powers lie. As well as serving to violate the formerly safe refuge of the bedroom, the unwavering focus on such a familiar space encourages us to inspect every shadow and crevice in such detail as to heighten the impact of the slightest noise or movement. On reflection, the minimal budget allows for our imaginations to run wild, making the film inhabit our own fears and nocturnal phobias, rather than having it spoon-fed like in so much modern Hollywood product.<br/><br/>The reason for the film's phenomenal impact on audiences (it made $9.1 million in its first week of release, despite only being released in fewer than 200 US cinemas) could well lie in our boredom of the overwhelming volume of 'torture-porn' movies we have been faced with lately, and the fact that it has out-grossed the recent Saw VI says a lot for its commitment to be different. However, even with its authentic edge, Paranormal Activity is still a horror movie, with much of the character development and slow-burning tension abandoned in favour of a spectacular conclusion. As a result, the film doesn't pack as much as punch as it deserves.<br/><br/>While no doubt an outstanding addition to the canon of noughties horror film, like so many other movies the colossal hype may hinder more than help. It definitely benefits from a theatre environment, where every chill is multiplied by the tense figures all around you, but it is this violation of the domestic space that is the real clout of the film, making a home-viewing interesting to imagine. Like Katie, we are torn between closing our eyes (or stopping the camera) and continuing to witness, and we pay a grave price."
"progenmarrs","4","0","2","30 December 2009"," Starts off scary but ends as a joke
","This film started well. It successfully instilled a growing sense of dread in me and I had high hopes for the movie.<br/><br/>However, the film made a fatal mistake when it showed the video of the exorcist. This was so badly done and such an obvious rip-off of the Linda Blair film that any suspension of disbelief that had been built up was jarringly ripped away and suddenly the viewer is extremely conscious that they are just watching a movie, and a cheaply made one at that. Had the film not been made in a documentary style they may have got away with this but the juxtaposition of the supposedly ultra-realistic style and this ludicrous and badly realised fantastical sequence just didn't work.<br/><br/>After that nothing that happened in the film was scary, rather I found myself laughing as I thought of members of the film crew stomping around making the 'noises off'.<br/><br/>I also think they made a mistake making the antagonist a demon and not a ghost. For me this was too fantastic and placed the film in the realm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and not in a good way) which again didn't sit with the film's documentary style.<br/><br/>One final criticism is the way the film split up the 'scary' night time footage with the everyday stuff. It basically warned the viewer each time that something scary was about to happen. Truly scary films are those where the shocks are unexpected. I think the film would have been better if some of the activity had started to bleed into the daytime footage, maybe just some odd goings on in the background.<br/><br/>Instead of watching this I'd recommend people watch Blair Witch and Incident at Lake County for truly scary and well done examples of this genre."
"Flickpeli","2","0","2","29 December 2009"," Decent effort.
","I have to admit, this was a great idea, with decent acting and nice written scrip. But, I already knew what to expect, since I did some research about the movie, and this kind of documentary-like films based on ""real found footage"" have been made before several times. When the Blair Witch Project came out, it scared the hell out of me, my access to the internet was limited, not to mention I was younger and I came across the movie through a friend who told me ""It is real footage"". So the trick really worked on me. This time around, I saw the trailer, witnessed the advertising hype and after reading a little about the movie on the net, I exactly knew what was coming: A movie without main titles, just starting abruptly,with a very slow pace and lots of silence, barely any special effects, lots of noises without explanation and a mysterious ending where the characters scream hysterically but the camera doesn't show what is going on. By the way, I prefer the BWP ending, because you never know what happened to the characters, you only know they certainly suffered a horrible fate. I watched the movie about 2 am, on bed using my laptop and alone and in complete darkness. I really wanted to be impressed. The only creepy part was the dragging of the girl out of bed. I have respect for the director, very nice creativity, and I hope he enjoys all the money this low-budget film made for him. But please, do not abuse this kind of films anymore, it would ruin the real purpose of the technique. I hope they give it a break, and make another film like this in 20 years, to a different generation and with less advertising. And most importantly, with more fresh ideas."
"Ayreesfoxx","6","0","4","29 December 2009"," Paranormal Activity: It's Like I Can Touch You
","When it comes to watching a horror movie in this decade, the average moviegoer has two things to worry about: cheap thrills or senseless gore. If you're lucky you can possibly get both, sinking you right in the middle of a subdued snuff film with a pacified plot. Yet, every once and a while a few films come out that give pause and at least try. Paranormal Activity, written and directed by newcomer Oren Peli, takes what humans find in the deep recesses of our subconscious and use it against us: the fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>The ploy, which is in no means original or unique in any form, goes like that; take an overpriced camera, two twenty-something's that live together, and have them try and solve ""the mystery of their haunted house,"" in dilapidated Scooby-Doo antics. With the help of a ""The Psychic"" and blind stumbling, they go through documenting everything from each bump and creak, to their aggravation and paranoia. <br/><br/>Again, this concept is nothing new. Go back into the crevices of your mind and think back to 1999, when The Blair Witch Project first flashed onto the silver screen. The irrational cuts, blurry and unfocused camera-work, to help ram home the idea that this truly happened to these pitiful kids. Now, fast-forward ten years and you have this movie with, more or less, the same M.O. However the differences are noticeable. Peli graciously and appropriately forgoes those troublesome camera antics, sticking to keeping that camera stable for around half of the film, while the rest is moving around in an amount that even your Uncle Charlie at family reunions wouldn't get sick over (something that people from Cloverfield and Blair Witch had serious issues with). What's more, since the main character Micah (Micah Sloats) is reviewing and editing all of the footage as he goes, it is cut and styled in a suitable manner so it doesn't look produced, having that ""do-it-yourself"" feel.<br/><br/>As far as the cheap thrills and bumps in the night go, you are going to have those regardless of how you feel. The anticipation walking into a horror movie is going to amplify every breath and every creak, even if they weren't supposed to be there originally. Now I will say that when then first of the haunting starts, you can tell that Peli is purely trying to mess with your mind. Yet as the movie progresses, the psychological aspects begin to get to you, leaving you wading in tension a forearm thick.<br/><br/>Which would leave would superb movie, if it weren't for the leads. Micah comes off as a narcissistic buffoon, only in this hunt to amplify his own bravado and to prove to himself and to his fiancé Katie (Katie Featherston) in a ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" approach that says he can take care of anything. While Katie starts off on the right foot, only to flip- flops before spiraling down for obvious reasons that I will not mention (no spoilers here folks). The baseline is that their actions and motives throughout were so horrendous that you get lost in their idiocy. Even if that doesn't stop you, their actions will.<br/><br/>Thus, it makes it hard to remember that this is a movie set three years in the past, making their ignorance of the unknown almost passable. Paranormal activity was just sparking interest, and hence the setting of the movie, and whatever they did, they were truly making up as they went. However some things, common sense can gently prod you in the back of the mind, and say, ""Get the hell out, you moron!""<br/><br/>Again, this movie was watched and reviewed on the DVD release, and with that, I was able to see two of the three alternate endings of the movie, showing some of the better ways the characters ended. Supposedly, these two were picked because they were the best received out of the group, yet I cannot help but feel that the third that is missing was one of the better ones to see. I will say that for anyone watch the DVD, that the alternate ending is a much better end in terms of a subtler, and fitting end.<br/><br/>Why Peli thought to only put two of the three, I can only speculate. Perhaps he figured he could do whatever he wanted, since truthfully when a movie with a $15,000 production budget makes over $200 million, you can. And it is easy to see why. After you place aside the awkward characters and other minor issues, you have a movie that people have not seen in years; a movie that scares you for being there. You don't see what is there, but you assume something is. There is no green screen or CGI, just well placed camera-work. <br/><br/>It's a re-installment of something a decade past, but when done with a little work and forethought, it can be handled with fear and shivers. I myself can say I was a little tense after, wondering what would happen next, and knowing that the other nine people in the room felt the same. Some may scoff or throw it aside, but even if that feeling is there for an instant, then the movie did its job."

","Cons <br/><br/>The story line added leads to the mystery but never follows up on any of them. They don't talk about what the thing writes with the Ouija board. They don't do anything with the bite mark. I would have loved to see them visit a doctor and learn more about the bite. <br/><br/>There were some poorly written lines during the down time and character building. <br/><br/>The acting quality was little lower at these moments too. <br/><br/>The climax was a disappointment. There is an alternate ending, which is slightly better in terms of the story line but is less frightening. I'm not sure if there's a good way to end this film but I think they could have come up with something better. If you haven't scene this alternate ending you should. <br/><br/>I think all of my complaints were probably caused by the movies minuscule budget. If the film had had more money, they could have added a minor character or two and followed up some of the leads.<br/><br/>The way you watch this film has a large effect on how you see it. If you watch it in daylight and talk through the whole thing you won't enjoy it. Also, you have to be down to earth and in reality while you watch it. I think many people didn't enjoy this movie because of the atmosphere and attitude in which they watched the film. Pros <br/><br/>From a cinematic perspective the film was amazing. It took everyday things like closing doors and made it scary. When I went to bed after seeing this film, people kept slamming doors in my house and it almost scared me to death. Just the concept of using small things like this is what made the film brilliant. I really liked the way they did the camera. It brought people straight into the moment and made it real. When someone sees someone shot in a movie they hardly even blink. But when someone sees it happen in real life they could go into shock. I felt this movie bridged the gap between the TV and reality better than any other movie I've scene. Conclusion<br/><br/>I know I have more cons than pros, but the pros matter much more. The plot, script, climax, and acting could have been improved if the film had had a larger budget. Each scary scene was masterfully crafted but when the plot is view as a whole, it's kinda sloppy. This film is a great concept, which should be used in other movies with larger budgets."

","A young couple on the verge of engagement encounters what appears to be a supernatural entity in their house. Katie (Katie Featherston) makes note of being haunted by a shadowy ghost of some sort for her entire life and this spurs Micah (Micah Sloat) to decide that it would be a good idea to try and get video evidence of this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity covers nearly a month period in which the protagonists attempt to film their experiences while being haunted. It starts off relatively slow and continues so until around the last third of the film. The narrative never covers everyday but only those in which some ghostly activity at night takes place and a few scenes documenting the next morning. As a result, the film ends up being slightly shorter than expected but the run time works well in condensing the overall experience into what it aims to achieve: uneasiness in the audience. Paranormal Activity is not devoted to scaring at every possible turn but rather in creating an overall tense atmosphere for its finale. Advertisements seem to suggest otherwise but anyone expecting the usual horror affair may be left disappointed, and deservedly so as the horror sequences are sporadic and short. However, the events that occur have a realistic nature to them, granted you believe in the supernatural, and this cranks up the uneasiness associated with the horror.<br/><br/>Though Paranormal Activity is more than just a documenting of some unexplainable event as it also provides an intriguing perspective into the breakdown of a relationship. Katie is completely horrified at what is taking place yet Micah never really takes it all that seriously until later into the film. This conflict of view begins to erode at their relationship and this becomes integral to the greater understanding of the film. The narrative is not entirely ambiguous as other supernatural texts, but enough will be left unanswered to prompt further discussion on certain actions and scenes in the film.<br/><br/>While not performed by complete professionals, the acting is pretty decent and believable enough. The contrast of views between Micah and Katie are easily apparent, and the nuances in each character is performed adequately by the respective actors as Katie is serious and scared while Micah wavers from being jocular to devoted concern. The level of acting does decrease at times but considering the offering at hand it is not overly problematic.<br/><br/>The film has a budget of around $15,000 and does obviously show with the hand-held camera perspective used for the film. With this sort of restrictive camera application horror scenes have to be quite calculated. Nevertheless, the style of the film results in longer than expected intervals between horror moments.<br/><br/>While language usage contains merely a handful of F-words amongst others and violence limited to one or two non-graphic scenes, there is no nudity or sexual content.<br/><br/>Unlike the horror genre in general, Paranormal Activity is never about its different parts but rather the experience as a whole. Combined with a somewhat slow narrative pace, Paranormal Activity becomes a film that is both interesting yet frustrating. This will surely result in a clear divide between those who appreciate it and those who felt that the activity of going to see the film was wasted."

Written and directed by Oren Peli, we are transported to the home of Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), who have been hearing strange noises overnight, so they set up a camcorder to record any strange goings-on. They document each day and leave the camcorder set up overnight up in the bedroom to record what happens when they sleep. Each night it gets worse! Shot in the same vein as Cloverfield, Blair Witch and Rec, the entire film is camcorder footage, hence the $15,000 budget. It took seven days to film. When night comes you feel yourself getting tense, looking everywhere for anything that might be out of place. It is all about how scary you make it for yourself. A lot is left to your own imagination. We never see what causes the disturbances, which makes it all the more frightening! Very creepy!"
"b1lskirnir","9","0","2","21 December 2009"," Possibly the best horror film of the decade
","My biggest recommendation to the movie-watcher interested in seeing Paranormal Activity is to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do yourself the service of knowing as little about it as you possibly can before going to see it. I know that we live in a society where trailers basically give away the movie before it is even in theaters and where film industry executives will exploit this to try to connive as many people into spending their money on a movie as possible, but there is something to be said for being pleasantly (or frighteningly) surprised. I had the pleasure of being one of a select group of people who knew almost nothing about this film before seeing it and if you go in with an open mind and an active imagination it will be a rewarding and supremely fun experience.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a faux-documentary about Micah and Katie, a young couple living together in San Diego who begin videotaping their daily and especially nocturnal activities in an effort to try to capture some bizarre, possibly paranormal occurrences that have been plaguing their picture-perfect suburban home. The film is shot entirely by the characters themselves and the audience is led to believe that this is entirely ""found footage"" after the events in the film (a la Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.). What begins as an investigation of the unknown spirals downward into a truly terrifying and powerful film of relentless suspense and beautifully slow-paced shocks that send shivers up your spine.<br/><br/>The film is an exercise in the old virtue that ""less is more."" While this technique has been used by countless films such as Jaws, Alien, and Blair Witch where the trick is to show as little of the antagonist as possible, Paranormal manages to perfectly utilizing the audiences' imagination to fill in the gaps with what they really don't see. Consequently, what you DO see is just enough to make it plausible and more than enough to scare the hell out of you.<br/><br/>There are any number of things I could say about this movie- how likable the characters are, how completely convincing these performances by complete no-name actors are, how it is one of the few ""found footage"" movies where it is entirely believable that the characters would've actually shot everything in the film, how it was made for less than $20,000 and in a few weeks became the most profitable film ever produced, and how this incredible little movie with its low budget effects managed to make it onto my very short list of films that completely, legitimately freaked me the hell out. This film is evidence that even in our over- saturated market for blood-and-guts slasher films that try to scare us with cheap shocks, stock sound effects, and CGI, this is one movie that, with its old-school creeps and chills, can make the most inane thing- a bedroom, a hallway, a suburban American home at night, legitimately frightening in a way that is more personal and disturbing than many other films have ever dared to go.<br/><br/>So that's it. And please... watch it in the dark, with the sound turned up and lots of bass, for maximum enjoyment ;)"

"Siamois","8","0","1","17 December 2009"," Tense and scary
","I had heard all the praise Paranormal Activity received and was skeptical. But the movie conquered me by its efficient structure and raw execution. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't lose too much time drawing you in the claustrophobic universe of a young couple, Katie and Micah. The setup is simple. They have started experiencing strange phenomenon that might be paranormal in nature. Micah doesn't take Katie's fear very seriously and decides to buy a camera and ""investigate"" the strange happenings.<br/><br/>This makes the whole movie shot from Micah's camera. The style and feel has drawn comparisons to Blair Witch, understandably. It has the same amateurish, documentary-style shooting style, both feature a small cast of unknown actors, the same feeling that some of the lines are improvised and of course, both are horror movies that rely more on atmosphere than gore or shock to scare the audience. <br/><br/>Although I tremendously enjoyed The Blair Witch Project, it never quite scared me and I felt it could have been more tightly edited at times. Paranormal Activity progressively gets more tensed and features some truly chilling scenes. Katie Featherston (playing her namesake, Katie) is believable as one of the lead. Her character is more sensitive to the phenomenon so, especially in the movie's early stage, a lot of the feeling of creepiness must come through this character. Micah Sloat (predictably playing... Micah) is adequate, although I didn't think he had much to work with at times. Since this actor also served as cameraman, in some scenes he is reduced to voice acting.<br/><br/>Overall, Oren Peli quickly established the pace and style of this movie, documenting the paranormal stuff in many scenes while the camera lays still. We as the audience can't wait for night to fall and see what might happen next. But as far as establishing the characters and their relationship, it all seems to have been left to improv. I wish I had known a bit more about them. <br/><br/>But all in all, this movie does what it sets out to do. It has a creepy atmosphere without relying on gore, action, loads of special effects and it even avoids having one of those lame ""surprise twists"" which have been popular with movies attempting to replicate The Sixth Sense's success.<br/><br/>As my profile says, I give a rating regardless of external factors such as budget. I really do think this movie deserves a high rating. But I must praise all the people involved in this production. Kudos for using a lot of creativity and getting an amazing movie made on modest means. Proof that money doesn't always have to be an obstacle."
"matt_in_da_net","7","0","2","13 December 2009"," A nice little horror film
","Is this film scary? yes. But not in the traditional Hollywood excessive, gore fest. There is no twisted monster or psychotic, masked killer. Instead the film appeals to our imaginations, those paranoid thought we had when we were a kid and we would hear footsteps, or creaks inside the house. Or times you may have woken up in a sweat of fear, sensing someone was in the room.<br/><br/>What this film achieves is expanding on those fears, and capturing the eerie silences and noises of the night. What's more, it comes off as the real deal, like some horror footage found after the incident. I agree with many and say that it will be hard to get to sleep after viewing this film, those midnight noises will become so much more to those with strong imaginations. The eerie silence of the night will become unbearable.<br/><br/>However the film is nothing ground breaking in the horror genre. Its a simple horror film which narrowly escapes the horror cliché's attached to the setting of a suburban house at night. It does what it does well, providing a scare. But nothing more."
"symonm","9","0","2","11 December 2009"," Lives up to the hype. Very surprising!
","I tend to avoid traditional Horror films and certainly the American ones partly because everything has to be explained to the audience and wrapped up in a little bow at the end, but mainly because they're never horrific or scary at all. As an adult, there are only so many times you can put up with impossibly beautiful teens running around a remote cabin half dressed while the college kid with a grudge (and usually superhuman strength and the power of invisibility) picks them all off one at a time, but ""Blair Witch"" was different, so was ""Rec"" and most Asian horror is too, so for me there is occasionally still hope with the genre. It was therefore with some trepidation that I went expecting it mostly not to live up to the hype. Another Blair Witch knock off that won't come close I assumed. Jeez was I wrong! It's tense, genuinely scary, with some stand out moments particularly when the bed-cam scenes that aren't shown on the trailer are revealed and is so well acted from two complete unknowns who carry 99% of the film themselves that it's hard to imagine how known actors could've carried this film any better. Each to their own I guess, but I don't scare easily and this film made me jump.<br/><br/>I hope they don't go down the sequel route as there's just no need. Blair Witch 2 showed us why that's not always a good idea. So for me it's a huge and very unexpected thumbs up."
"nixskits","7","0","1","9 December 2009"," My lowest rated film to comment on so far
","It's appropriate that the average rating for this is 7 (from the 9th of December 2009 stats), as I debated what to designate this box office triumph before checking the stats myself and then discovered my vote was right on the money. Millions of people saw this and thousands have voted. There are already over 666 comments (a nice, round, evil number!) so now I'll toss my stone in the agitated pond too.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" has some creepy qualities going for it, but unfortunately, when this flick delivers, it's much too little, way too late. The two main characters are not the kind you'd want to spend time with. They complain, act like overgrown children and generally carry on like a ghost or thirteen should come along and give them the scare of their lives.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for a certain person that is repeatedly mentioned to show up and guess what? He ain't a coming! (I didn't mention that person's line of work, not knowing if that would constitute a ""spoiler"" or not.) The alleged frights in this are more than a little hokey and I felt many opportunities to really get under the audiences' skin were wasted.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this and am also quite disappointed in it. Part of me wanted to stand up at the end and yell out, ""I want my money back!"", if only to get a few laughs from others at the packed screening who agreed with my sentiments. <br/><br/>Can we get any lower budgeted film that doesn't have shaky cameras all the time? And if they make a sequel, let's get a real aficionado of the paranormal like Dan Aykroyd to put on a silly costume and accent and come investigate! That's a bloody movie idea of real interest to me. As it stands, ""Paranormal Activity"" is a story whose plot is basically a ""spoiler"" to itself! Great ending, poor everything else up till then."
"Caps Fan","7","0","1","8 December 2009"," Excellent Suspense Piece
","Engagingly played by the young leads, this ""Blair Witch""-type project delivers the goods in convincing fashion. There are not that many shock moments, but a slow buildup of suspense starts almost at once until, by the end, this viewer at least shared in the characters' apparent discomfort.<br/><br/>For me, a nice aspect of this was that I did not see the resolution coming until a minute or two before the film showed it. That doesn't happen often these days.<br/><br/>The absence of music added to the tension and the film did not go on too long. Two more plus points! All in all, then, a very worthwhile effort.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10."

","Wow, reading all of your comments, have awakened me, thank you. Those who hated this movie:<br/><br/>Get over yourselves, it is what it is a low budget horror, movie. You over anyalize it to the point that no movie can stand up to your scrutiny. I mean come on what do you expect from a $15,000, budget, Lord of the Rings? You want over the top FX and when given those FX you say they are over the top, there is no pleasing you. Since this site was created you have found a place to spew your hate.<br/><br/>For those who loved this movie, I have seen more honesty in your responses, there for, I will listen to you, yes there are plot holes, yes it starts slow, but it picks up. Is it perfect, no. Name one movie that is, and I will point out slow crappy parts, in every movie those think are perfect. That being said I know I will never have to do so. <br/><br/>This movie was fun to watch, hype or not. Reguardless get over it. Compared to the predictable crap Hollywood usually spews out, this was a fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>Did it live up to the hype? maybe not. Was it visually demanding as other films, no? Was it original, and not a copy of a previous film, yes, it was. At least they tried something new, and didn't remake a old film.<br/><br/>Hate it all you want, It did just fine in the box office, which just goes to show that people who hate everything, do not dictate what people decide to see in theaters."
"littlemissitaliangirl","9","0","1","7 December 2009"," The after taste lingered in my mouth until late in the evening
","Prior to watching this movie I had done my research. I read all of the comments on this website, I read all of the blogs about the movie. I even read all the spoilers and the 3 different endings so I knew what I was getting into.<br/><br/>A friend of mine procured a copy of the original film with the original ending (the one where she sits by the bed in a trance for 36+ hours...etc and then is shot by the cops.) A group of friends came over and we decided to watch the movie in the early afternoon. We cut out all of the lights and made it dark, but it was still day time which gave me the whole day to get over the movie had it actually scared me.<br/><br/>I'm an avid horror film goer and not many scary movies frighten me, and I must say, while watching PA, I jumped a couple of times, but wasn't scared to tears. The movie ended and I thought it was an over-all decent movie. I wasn't scared and I didn't seem to be frightened at all. We spend the rest of the day (literally hours and 6 movies later) in my living room having a good time.<br/><br/>Around mid-night, my husband and I went to bed. Living in the middle of 3 apartments, every noise I heard, kept me awake. It was like a lingering after taste that is horrible after you've eaten something that you thought was good. I popped in another movie (Pixtar movie)which I watched over and over and over through the course of the evening until I had to leave for work this morning. Sleeping with the light on and jumping at the sound of the water running through the pipes or the neighbors walking around, terrified me.<br/><br/>A job well done by the movie and I am hoping that tonight I will get some rest due to my insomnia from last night."

The plot is original and very well done. This is not some daft old horror remake or rip off. Its original and chilling in the same way. Second is the acting. Not the best and not perfect but solid enough for the film. Third and finally is the special effects. I was amazed that this film was made for only 15,000 dollars because some of it is worth more than that. Especially one sequence at the end.WOW My only problem which is minor was the hype. its not that scary as many people are saying it is. I only jumped 1.5 times and i covered my eyes 2.5 times. its not enough to make me go crawling at the back of my chair.<br/><br/>Overall however this was a great experience to watch and leaves you with a sort of chill and mystery at the end.

How very wrong you are....<br/><br/>This movie isn't for the weak of heart. I am a huge horror fan (Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.) and not one of those movies has affected me, or even made me freak out at places. This movie DOES. From the first instance of ""Paranormal Activity"" in this movie. My heart starts racing. And as the movie goes on, more disturbing things happen that just make you think; ""what is going to happen next?"" You can prepare yourself all you want, but it WILL NOT work.<br/><br/>The first instances that you see could be passed off as fake, but as the film goes on. You simply cannot contradict what you see..... And don't say ""nah, I can contradict it all."" Because I did as well, and I changed my view on about the 4th night something happens...<br/><br/>After the first time I watched this movie. I was mentally affected. I remember going to sleep, over 4 hours later. And not wanting to close the door all the way due to what I saw in the movie.<br/><br/>Even though I had watched this movie twice on DVD before going to the cinemas. My heart still started to race when all the activity started. And I knew what was going to happen. But there were some added scenes in the movie, and an entirely different ending. Which I found to be a lot better than the ending on DVD. And as soon as I saw the different ending starting to happen. I thought; ""here we go, whats going to happen now?"" And I still wasn't prepared for what happened.<br/><br/>This movie, not only from being a great film to watch at home, has an UNBELIEVABLE cinema experience. I went today, after seeing the movie twice on DVD, and you just get a feeling that no other movie can get you to feel. The audience, as a whole, gasped, jumped and went ""oh my god"" at all the perfect times. Trust me, watching it in the cinema is about five times better than watching it at home just due to the audience being there.<br/><br/>It is well worth the admission fee to watch this movie, and I would gladly watch it again....

"dj_xand325","6","0","1","5 December 2009"," Paranormal Activity is a relatively original, raw, frighteningly realistic portrayal of a cinematic haunting.
","Paranormal Activity follows a young couple, as they become tormented by an evil spirit. The instant allure of this film is, of course, the 'super original' pseudo-documentary format otherwise famed in 'The Blair With Project' (1999) and 'Cloverfield' (2008). While I can agree that this approach to horror is a nice break from the usual gore-fests we're terrorised by in modern horror, 'Paranormal Activity' still feels ragged and radically uninspired. 'Cloverfield' offered a stagnantly boring yet realistic point of view in the event of a monster attacking New York (which we know is a tired scenario). 'Paranormal Activity' is doing the same, getting a concept as old as death itself and filming it with a crappy camera. That's OK with me; I admire the film's moments of frightening intensity and tense entrapment yet for most of the 86 minute running time, I was left bored by the predictable story and shallow script.<br/><br/>The desperate state of modern horror doesn't translate financially; 'Paranormal Activity' cost a measly $15,000 to produce while it enjoys profits exceeding $100,000,000 since release. This astonishing financial success is backed up by an ample plethora of positive critical acclaim, yet that doesn't leave me convinced. Nor could I ever imagine that this would really be a horror of true quality measuring up to the classics. So in that respect, the film met my expectation.<br/><br/>The quality of the film was largely two-fold. On one end, there's the psychological ferociousness and suspense of the night scenes yet on the other end, we got a bold disparity of archetypal characters and lame script-writing. The man of the couple, Micah (Micah Sloat), is more of a terrifying microcosm of Christian Bale, Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise than a striking male protagonist. His goofy, alpha-male persona was an annoying distraction – even more so than his wife, Katie (Katie Featherston), who's plainer than Leona Lewis in a coma. The script was disappointing, unoriginal drivel, increasing the film's pivotal reliance on the somewhat dynamic format most obviously displayed in the night scenes. These moments had a great atmospheric nature; creating unbearable tension, entrapping the audience in a state of suspended inescapability. These snippets impressed me, showcasing a multitude of psychological horror that the genre has been starved of in recent years. As you can probably notice from my contrasting words, the quality of 'Paranormal Activity' is about as temperamental as a bipolar woman on her period.<br/><br/>While the pseudo-documentary format pioneers the moments of heightened terror, it simultaneously shoves the film down the road of mediocrity. Such a style demands short running times, which left the film feeling bare and undeveloped whilst the solitary camera use felt restricting at times, almost leaving too much emphasis on what we don't see rather than what we do. Of course, this restriction creates the suspense, but I felt there were missed opportunities for more climactic shocks that doesn't really come until the very end. I was left wanting more at the conclusion of the film, the immense night scenes wetted my appetite but I wasn't given the opportunity to take a bite. The film teases you with an intriguing point of view and dangles various semi-scares for the audience yet it doesn't deliver beyond that. That is where this horror slumps.<br/><br/>The independent, perhaps revolutionary transcendence of 'Paranormal Activity' is something to embrace – horror being a dying genre, I respect attempts to refresh it. But, this attempt is futile and lagging. Its junctures of great quality only frustrated me as it shot itself in the foot with lame casting and script-writing. I can't help but wonder how the $15,000 budget was spent...<br/><br/>6/10"
"powermikee","7","0","1","4 December 2009"," Not the scariest film ever but definitely scary
","I've watched a lot of horror films and I don't know about you, but are modern day horror films just not scary any more. Fancy CG effects, popular Hollywood actors and great camera work, but still you feel nothing.<br/><br/>I'll summarize PARANORMAL ACTIVITY for you. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY has none of that. It was made on a budget of $15,000 and in 2 weeks. The story is cliché - a couple that are been haunted. There are times where the acting is very average. Most of the film follows the same cycle...Micah the boyfriend videotapes Katie doing everyday stuff...he makes a joke, does something stupid, they have a fight, they go to bed...and something spooky happens...they wake up and the cycle continues again, increasing in spookiness.<br/><br/>This is the thing, I should hate this film, BUT i don't. Why? Because as flawed as it is, it did something many films have not being able to do in a while, which is scare me. I actually thought twice when i got home, turned off the lights and got into to bed, and that's the point.<br/><br/>Low budget or not...that is what horror films are all about! We have all been through it...it's the middle of the night you wake up because you heard a noise. You get up to check what it is. Turns out to be nothing, but how did you feel for that moment when you were walking around the house in the dark? Did your heart beat speed up? Did you feel cold inside? That's exactly what this movie will having you feeling.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is not like going to a fancy theme park and riding on amazing rides...this is like getting together with a bunch of friends and playing UNO and you end up having more fun than you would have at the theme park. It's simple, but sometimes our world tries too hard to be glossy and shiny and we miss the point. This is fear, real fear of something that in the middle of the night we all think is possible and that is why I liked it.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see monsters or lots of blood...well don't bother watching this. Most of the time you'll see doors being slammed and hear weird noises. Not that scary ha? But...how scared would you be if this happened to you? That's what got me.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have about this film is I think they should have kept the horror going and made it unbearably scary. Getting audiences to the point of nearly exploding with fear would have put this in my top ten of horror flicks. They ended it too soon.<br/><br/>Definitely check it out."

If your girlfriend tells you she's been having demonic experiences since she was 8, dump her quick, no matter how good her boobs are.<br/><br/>2. If you buy a high end video camera to videotape her demonic experiences, she's not going to let you tape questionable home movies on it.<br/><br/>3. The lower your budget, the more invisible your demonic entities are likely to be.<br/><br/>4. If your budget is really low, film the whole thing on video in your own house with a couple of unknowns and don't have any special effects.<br/><br/>5. Oh, and make sure you have a really effective viral marketing campaign.<br/><br/>I'm being unfair. I can testify to the effectiveness of the campaign: the cinema was full (mainly teenage couples, there was a lot of raucous laughter). But I can also testify that the audience reaction shots in the trailer aren't faked - that's exactly how the audience behaved.<br/><br/>Strong echoes of Blair Witch and Cloverfield with this one, in terms of ""found footage"" (and, like Cloverfield, this one takes about 20 minutes to set up, which is 10-15 minutes too long). But this is a much, much better film than Blair Witch. There is clear plot progression and, despite the absence of special effects (with the exception of one very brief but terrifying effect), a great deal of genuine scariness is created with sound and a few physical effects.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of horror films over the years and most of them are much of a muchness. This one, to me, merits the hype: it is a scary film and well worth a visit if being scared is your thing."
"freemantle_uk","2","0","1","2 December 2009"," A bad, over-hyped horror film
","Paranormal Activity is one of the surprise hits of 2009, and the highest grossing in history. From a $15,000 budget it has so far made over $100 Million. It is a simple horror film about demonic haunting, using a hand held camera style like in The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.<br/><br/>The film is told retrocepticly, with the action taking place in 2006 in San Diego. It tells the story of Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston), a young couple who had been together for 3 years. Katie had has some sort of demonic spirit ever since she was 8-years-old. Micah plans on filming the nightly events. Katie is desperate to get rid of the spirit and asks a psychic (Mark Fredrichs) to help. He suggests the being is a demon and advices to call a specialist, and tells Micah not to try and communicate with the being. Micah ignores the advice and sets out to do his own experiments and research. Things start off small, like the door moving in the middle of the night and strange sounds. But slowly things get worst, with Katie sleepwalking and the demon getting more annoyed. It affects Katie and Micah's relationship and it starts to break down.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews suggests that this is meant to be one of the most scary films ever made. Sadly it isn't. There is no real threat, and for the most part the demon just seemed like a minor nuisance. They should have shown more of a threat, like the demon hurting Katie, or Katie turning to self-harm or harming Micah in her sleep. There could have shown things like a message being written in blood or as my brother suggests, showing the demon beliefly in the mirror. It's only the very last scene that is worth seeing and prevents me from giving this film a lower score. Many scenes and themes have been copied from other films: style wises it copies Blair Witch Product (awful) and Cloverfield (great), Signs (both ideas and scenes), The Ring, and films like The Exorcist and the Omen. A horror film can pain homage to other films, but its own ideas, themes and scares should stand on it's own film. Many of the scenes were too conventional and most of the scenes were more funny then scary. So was some of the interplay between Micah and Katie, but there relationship felt more natural and down to earth. They were pretty good actors. When I was in the cinema there was only one person who seemed scared during the film and audience actually laughed when she first screamed. For a fairly short feature film, it actually went very slowly. For the most part not much happens. What should have happened was the first 30 minutes should have been used to get to know the characters, and then slowly build up the tension and the threat in it's own internal universe.<br/><br/>A problem filled film, but does have a decent last scene. But I know there is going to be a sequel."

Embellishing the plot any further would do this film a disservice as this is a tale best viewed cold, the chills within are best kept shielded and then unleashed on your maiden viewing.<br/><br/>The film is shot in the Blair Witch-esquire hand-held 'found footage' style and it works wonders in giving you those first-person chills. The use of the static-cam during the night scenes (when most of the action happens, mind you) and the use of silence ups your senses tenfold as you concentrate on picking up any activity of the paranormal variety, ultimately making the frights more intense when they do happen. This is the reason Paranormal Activity's inventive, discreet scares are far more unnerving than lopped limps and exploding skulls (no matter how awesome they may be).<br/><br/>The story of how this film came into fruition is actually just as interesting and jaw-droppingly staggering as the tale itself. Shot on a strict 7 day schedule by a first time filmmaker (Peli – a man with no film training) in his own home with a store bought hand-held camera and on a measly budget of around $15,000 – Paranormal Activity's modest production may lead to one of the most profitable films in history (currently grossing around $100,000,000 and climbing). For you math fiends out there, that's a victorious 98.5% profit. Yowsers! It was even planned to get a big-budget makeover but sane heads prevailed and released the original in modified form.<br/><br/>This really an event film that needs to be seen at the theatre with a few people, for then you can scrutinize the picture on a large screen as well as enjoying the (mostly lack of) sound in a completely ambient environment. This movie is all about senses and imagination! I have also seen the version going about the internet and passed around on cheap DVD's. This version sucks camel cock! Not only do you lose the vital ambiance but it is the original cut which is missing some cool scares as well as having a terribly different ending involving police. Steer clear of this version, it's an abortion. See it at the movies (out this Thursday).<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is an inventive breath of fresh air in a stale and musty horror environment. Be sure to catch it on the big screen and avoid spoilers. It is limited, but works within these limits with grandiose confidence. Big budget or gore-seekers need not apply.<br/><br/>http://www.sorryimlate.com/reviews/paranormalactivity.html"
"Troy_Campbell","8","0","1","30 November 2009"," A deserving money-making gem in an otherwise drained genre.
","Presented as real footage in true Blair Witch style – although talk show appearances in 2009 by the two stars dispel that claim – this eerie chiller has received word-of-mouth seldom seen in the cinematic world. Shown at two film festivals in October 2007 then January 2008, it was shelved until Paramount dusted it off for a limited release on 25 Sep 2009. It's opening weekend only returned $77K but it was the hype surrounding it that was the real bonus. Over the next three weeks it went on to make $41 million and as I write this it has grossed over $103 million in the U.S. alone. Have I mentioned it had an estimated budget of $11-15K? <br/><br/>Israeli director Oren Peli makes his debut with Paranormal and what a debut it is. He is able to wring tension out of a story that is anything but new and he makes old, tired genre techniques feel fresh again. Where creaky steps or heavy breathing in your average modern horror movie will generally induce eye-rolling, Peli makes it indisputably terrifying. However the thing that impresses the most is his tremendously believable visual effects. It's unclear whether CGI was used or if Peli came up with ways of doing it in front of camera; without researching you would never know. To have seamless effects like this is rare and it elevates Paranormal from spooky to pant-wetting. Just try and stay calm when powdery footprints appear next to the couples bed in one petrifying scene.<br/><br/>Peli's end result is aided heavily by his lead actors. Their organic performances add an edge to the picture that your glossier horror flicks rarely feature. The usual tics of couples everywhere are inherently visible - Katie getting stroppy with Micah for his playfulness and immaturity is a humorous highlight – and at no time does it feel like the actors are unknown to each other. Finding out they are a real-life paring wouldn't come as too much of a surprise.<br/><br/>A deserving money-making gem in an otherwise drained genre.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"doctorsmoothlove","7","0","1","30 November 2009"," Blair Witch/Cannibal Holocaust sequel?
","2009 is ending as one of the poorest film years in recent memory. It is nearly December and there are no clear favorites to win awards both here and abroad. What I will recall when I revisit 2009 will be how it commercialized viral advertising. Paranormal Activity and Precious began as no-budget or low budget films that captured millions of dollars for the companies lucky enough to purchase their distribution rights. The former film is finally the sequel to The Blair Witch Project all of us have subtly hoped would exist. The two films are so uncannily similar that such a comparison is unlikely to be considered bold. How does one produce a follow-up to a film budgeted only $25,000? By, creating one for $15,000 less ten years later.<br/><br/>Director Oren Peli, former video game designer, draws from earlier survival-horror video games and impressionist films for the scares in Paranormal Activity. I will admit having jumped a few times during my screening. When I wasn't jumping, however, I remained at edge. There are no ghosts, axe-wielders, or other obscenities. I was constantly trying to determine what phenomena were happening. Through minimal effort, even the simple closing of a door, Peli constructs a situation that is uncompromisingly frightening. Even the actors never learn what is happening. The film is better than most contemporary horror films because it evokes a mystery to sustain our unease even when no action is on screen. I'm just sad that I'm spoiled by gratuitous horror pictures to not be fully immersed by the experience of Paranormal Activity.<br/><br/>The scenario follows a couple as they pestered by something in their San Diego home. Not a lamia, not a shape, just something. It does have footprints, which appear human-like. The man in the couple places a hand-held camera on a stand at night and attempts to film ""it."" Unremarkable nights are the norm, but occasionally something does happen. The woman, said to be the cause of it, moves about, stands silently, or goes outside while the man sleeps. Perhaps Peli had ideas about how to appeal to traditional horror elements but, thankfully, nothing more occurs. Strange noises abound without cause and objects are relocated. Still no motivation is given to the antagonist.<br/><br/>I didn't see this film until after the first weeks of its release, but the backlash it has received is mind-boggling. The same nastiness was also directed to its predecessor and would have probably afflicted its grandparents. We as movie goers and critics should be humbled to watch a film that evokes an approach to terror film making (as Karloff put it) that is widely vanished from Hollywood productions. It is better to watch and wait than to shower with blood. Both elements can be used effectively together, yet few films manage to do it. Why do people still enjoy Freaks, Bride of Frankenstein, or Nosferatu? Those beloved films were limited from excess too, but are still widely viewed. Even if people are not frightened as much as they would like, they can still appreciate authenticity. Paranormal Activity is the best horror film that has emerged from the United States this year."
"Brettto","Null","0","2","30 November 2009"," The power of hype, the failure of genre...
","Oh crap why did I pay £7.00 to see this. I so wanted to believe! That an unknown film maker on a shoestring budget had really delivered a terrifying experience. That I would have trouble sleeping etc. Thanks for making me see how easily my desires can be manipulated. A successful exercise in hype, that's the only reason I'll remember this piece of god-awful, plodding pap.<br/><br/>If you've seen this by now, let's reminisce now on how wanky it was. A psychic who looks like a geography teacher adds precisely zero back story with his lame protestations that the presence in the house is 'too much for him' As if! and the bloke who he suggests never shows up! Having seen Drag Me To Hell, Amtyville Horror, The Exorcist etc I well understand the genre dictates certain staples - concerned clergyman or 'man in touch with the other side' who puts the willies up the audience with his vague mumblings of encroaching evil. The innocent protagonists have to be clueless and powerless to stop this happening, and the audience demand to see at least the horror in the faces of the actors, if not the actual horror itself. But Paranormal Activity labours every point it tries to make. From tired knocking sound to goose bumpy sleepwalking this poorly paced shocker meanders through the clichés to a dismal end that leaves no one wishing for a sequel. Somewhere in the mix the film maker had a shred of good intention and a grasp of cranking up tension, but the finished article is simply not good enough for general release. Only hype has saved it from laughable box office returns. Avoid at all costs."

","Paranormal activity is not one of those typical horror movies that give you periodic jolts but instead one that keeps you rooted to the spot with your heart clenched. It is only the grasp that tightens when you aren't fully prepared, and loosens when you're at your breaking point, just so that you can sit through it without having a heart attack. <br/><br/>While it awakens memories of another horror movie, it can be interpreted as trying to glimmer in the shadow of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It was the director's intentions. Nevertheless, it is a shadow that exceedingly towers and then insolently looks down. For its meager budget of $15,000, I personally am glad that it grossed over $100,000,000 at the box office.<br/><br/>Straightforward as it may be, its principal characters are played so effortlessly in the most naturalistic way, subsequently making them comprehensible. Micah and Katie, despite their idiosyncrasies, are both pleasant, likable people. Katie's enthusiasm from the day she moves into her boyfriend, Micah's house, gradually dies down like the hope of a cynic fading away with time. The movie keeps getting more and more ""freaky"", a term used endlessly to describe any kind of paranormal activity that occurs in the ""haunted"" house. Without exempting it of its nobility, there is one trivial question I'd like to ask. Why doesn't Katie move over to the other side of the bed? Wouldn't it keep her at a safer distance from the demon? Isn't Micah the adventurous daredevil? I cease to believe that it was a deliberate goof.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just a must watch but must be watched alone with headphones in a dark room. But beware, once you've finished watching it, you're going to be stared at by every inanimate object from every corner in the room including the corners themselves. No, it isn't just me."
"lastdaaavid","6","0","1","30 November 2009"," hilariously over-hyped
","Firstly, after reading the FAQ about the various endings, I regretted that I saw the unrated version as both the theatrical and film festival endings would probably have left me with a slightly more positive response to this movie. I found the unrated ending very flat. In its credit, I enjoy how low-budget and D.I.Y.-friendly this movie is. It is warming to see something that is frightening that doesn't rely on a Hollywood budget to deliver its scares. However, it is definitely not the 'scariest movie ever'. My main problem with was the lack of suspense created by the camera fast-forwarding when set up beside the bed at night. Would you enjoy someone fast-forwarding the movie you were watching to the scary parts? There is little suspense because of this. While I understand that it would not be possible to show all night, perhaps some red herrings would have created more of an atmosphere. That aside, there are some good frights and I can see this scaring people! Not awful, but really not deserving of the hype."
"RickHarvey","8","0","1","30 November 2009"," lower the budget, higher the realism
","you have to take this movie for what it for. it cost 15 thousands dollars to make and only consists of two main actors. the whole film is shot in one house, under one roof. the terrors all happen in one room, the bedroom. What makes the film terrifying is the low budget of it. Everything feels real. you can only create this atmosphere by using an low price camera and production. If you ever watch you tube videos of ghost and demons , then you will know the chilling effect it has on you compared to these horror films today that use special effects that are worth millions to try and scare us. this film however makes a door slam seem horrific.<br/><br/>you will either find it scary or not scary at all. If you believe in the paranormal ( like me ) then this film will be scary as hell but if you don't then this film is not for you. For instant, the getting dragged out bed scene, that alone is just terrifying. all the terror happens at night, where the couple leave an camera running through the night hoping to gather evidence or for the man's sake, for coolness. This is where the film is successful. it leaves you wanting more of the night time horrors just like SAW, when you always want to see one more trap. the bedroom is the one place we feel safe but the director totally demolishes that safety.<br/><br/>The acting was good all the way through. Some may complain about the pace but i found it just right, letting you build the suspense. One thing i loved was that is was believable. there was no cheesy spirits or effects or unbelievable attacks. This is thanks to the low budget which keeps the realism. But then this leads me to the thing i hated the most and that the ending. It reminded me of some you tube video when an amateur shows off his cheesy effects. There is another ending which i heard of which sounds much believable.<br/><br/>What i suggest is that you watch it alone at home because at the cinema the scary scenes are ruined by the laughter and screaming of teenagers when really it needs to be complete silence for the film to have it's full effect. But i warn you, when your in bed at night, the faintest noise will take you back to that room and will send a chill down your spine while you feel something under you bed sheets"

","Katie and Micah, a young couple are being plagued by some strange noises during the night. Micah buys a video camera to record the events.....<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a rare thing. It is a genuinely scary American movie! The key to its success, is simple. It doesn't rely on gore and violence. It has genuine scares, and builds to a very unsettling ending. What also helps is the performances of the leads. Katie Featherston is brilliant was the events get worse, and is very convincing as she begins to fall apart as events get worse. Micah Sloat playing the boyfriend is also good, despite being possibly one of the most annoying boyfriends ever on screen.<br/><br/>Oren Peli, the writer and director gives as much time to the deteriorating relationship between the couple, as he does to the actual scares too. This helps the actors be more convincing as the events escalate.<br/><br/>The use of sound is important to the success of the movie. There is no music, which is understandable given the movie is meant to be the footage of the events. As a result, the sound is key to the success or failure of a lot of the scares, and it works wonderfully well. Both unsettling the audience, and leading to other scares.<br/><br/>Crucially, the director/screenwriter never fully explains what is happening and why. After seeing the movie, I have my own theory and I'm sure other people have theirs, but as befits the story, he credits the audience with intelligence.<br/><br/>There are little flaws in the movie, but nothing that will spoil the movie. And as I mentioned, the ending is very unsettling.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have said the movie is one of the scariest movies ever made. I would certainly add it to that list."

This film is by the far the best. It is the only film that actually frightened me and I don't just mean it made me jump. The film is perfectly timed so that you feel tense before anything really happens. By half way through he film any time it went to the shot of them asleep I was already feeling uneasy. It is the only film that emotionally effected me in any real way.<br/><br/>The cinema was really full and many of the people there talked a lot and at first I thought it would ruin the film. However the film was so great people quickly shut up. Many people in the audience screamed during the scary bits. More than a few people could be heard saying how scared they were just before the really scary bits. After the film I heard several people saying how much they loved this film.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate the camera style and the sometimes annoying acting of the woman you will love this film. I don't understand the people who say they didn't like this film but each to their own. Most people I know who have seen this film love it.

"yevonwm","10","0","3","26 November 2009"," Truly terrifying
","-- Quick introduction about my review --<br/><br/>I found this film to be truly terrifying. I'm a male in his mid- twenties, quite into horror films and have watched them frequently recently. There are a lot of reviews slamming this film by people angry that there was hype surrounding it. It's just a film. I don't watch a lot of TV, I'd seen the trailer maybe 3 times in the cinema and had not discussed this film with anyone other than the person I went to see it with. If the viewing experience of this film depends on your cynicism, the amount of hype you're exposed to and the atmosphere around you then my angle is: - I'm a very cynical person, I complain constantly and expect masterpieces when I go to the cinema. - I was exposed to limited hype but understood this to be a popular film that looked promising. I understood nothing more than the trailer and queue sizes of the cinema before viewing this film. - I was nearly late to the performance and was in a packed cinema full of people chatting until the film started. The crowd were very animated, constantly gasping, screaming and commenting loudly during the film.<br/><br/>-- My Review --<br/><br/>My experience of this film is one that I'll never forget. The actors gave a truly spine chilling performance that gives me goosebumps when I recall any scene from the film. The plot is really well managed, it's an uphill roller-coaster that constantly plays with the audience but never letting them loose. The effects leave nothing to be desired, they were perfect for the film and you would never guess that this was a low budget film, in fact you end up thinking 'They did all that with how much?'. The low actor count creates an appropriate feeling of isolation that complements the film. <br/><br/>The film contains no music but it has a lot of sound effects and ambient sounds. I think music would have ruined the atmosphere they worked so hard to create. The main actress gives a really mind blowing performance, there is no point that you doubt her performance in a truly challenging role. The film is truly compelling to the point where I had to keep reminding myself, 'its not real' and make a conscious effort to distance myself. The film deals really well with your own scepticisms about the paranormal and the characters take up opposing views on the argument to leave you to make up your own mind.<br/><br/>-- A Warning --<br/><br/>Personally I think it's really undersold that this film is terrifying. I really would warn people to understand this before seeing it. You may find that you are one of those people that feel bored during this film but if it stimulates you in the correct way ... well my heart was pumping so hard I started to get worried."

","Put a camera in a bedroom for three-quarters of a homemade film and there's plenty of ""extra-curricular activity"" to keep viewers on edge. However, in the case of this low-budget mokumentary by Israeli-born newcomer, Oren Peli, the only activity we're supposed to see - and believe for that matter - is the paranormal sort. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloater, a twenty-something couple from San Diego, conduct an investigation into the strange goings-on in their suburban style home. Micah is the film's trademark skeptic enjoying the humor of playing ghost-hunter, while Katie is the ever-cautious female lead, shaken by an experience with the supernatural when her childhood home mysteriously burned down. Years later, she is hounded by a malevolent specter, which prompts Micah to gain evidence of the haunting on tape. The couple go so far as to consult a dubious psychic, but when Micah attempts to contact the spirit through a ouija board, their circumstances spiral towards a terrifying, sinister peak.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity thrives on the power of suggestion. Footfalls in the dark, demonic voices on audio, and the occasional spontaneous door-slamming mimic the usual predecessors to the heart-stopping mainstream horror of a Hollywood blockbuster. On the other hand, the scenes that pit viewers with the tangible side of terror succeed only in stealing from the film's raw presentation of a genuine haunting. As a result, a midnight mad struggle down a hallway is immersed in hopeless cliché and likable to comic relief.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the chemistry between the characters is decidedly credible, though the lack of interaction with the world outside their home makes them less like the every-day individuals viewers are supposed to relate to. Regardless, Peli casts his lead roles in a rare and praise-worthy style. Many classic films of the haunted-house genre (The Amityville Horror, The Shining, and The Changeling to name a few) feature a male character corrupted by a spirit (or spirits) which eventually drives them to the brink of insanity. Peli, however, goes down the same path as William Friedkin in the 1973 smash hit The Exorcist. Do not be mistaken - Katie Featherston is no Regan MacNeil, but her performance relishes in the tender side of the emotional trauma associated with demonic encounters. Featherston's expression culminates as the only portion of the film evoking an understanding of the film's events, if not outright belief."
"cylet","7","0","1","22 November 2009"," This is NOT a movie for cinema
","I watched that movie in Germany with German dubbing -.- I must say, it's really hard to dub that movie, because I think there are many things gone lost, that are important for the atmosphere. But in our cinema there where a great laughter all-around. And that destroyed the feeling totally. Okay, some things happened in the movie seemed to be kinda silly, but nevertheless this movie must been watched at home - when it's dark outside, you're alone and you got a great TV with a surround-system. In my opinion this would be the perfect situation for watching this movie perfectly. So save your money for the DVD/BluRay (you can spend it for 2012 ;))and enjoy it at home...alone...in the dark... oh...I forgot: keep your light in the bathroom switched off ;)"
"Cassiopea_Fay","7","0","1","19 November 2009"," Overall pretty decent
","I have to admit, the beginning of the film did appear rather tame in regards to some of the scarier scenes. However, once the story progresses it gets more appealing and intense.<br/><br/>The scary parts are rather subtle (For one thing, you NEVER see the demon. All of the creepyness is based on his actions and nothing on his physical appearance. All you get is this invisible presence) Which is actually a nice change, since in a lot of movies you always see the ghost/creature that is tormenting the person or a household. It makes a lot of the ""making you jump"" scenes more unpredictable.<br/><br/>The best part was by far the ending. Even if the entire first 80 minutes of the movie doesn't make you feel chilled, then the last part will. Seriously! In the theatre, there was a couple of people making fun of the movie. Then once that ending happened, literally those same people screamed (Ah, it was amusing). If it wasn't for that ending my rating might of been lower, it kind of made the movie really.<br/><br/>The rest of my critique is more in regards to the cinematography. It goes from night and day rather quickly, and some scenes with the couple talking can feel long. Thankfully however, the camera won't make you nauseous since 90% of the time it is stable.<br/><br/>Was it the most greatest, scariest movie of all time? Not really. But it wasn't bad either. It's worth a go, just make sure you get into the mood and atmosphere. And keep an open mind, enjoy the small things."
"bearfaceproductions","10","0","1","18 November 2009"," Truly Frightening, yet...
","Is a bit disturbing. I do not know what rating to give this film. It should either receive many stars for succeeding in the horror techniques, or should I take stars away from it for almost scaring me to death (I slept with a bible that night). Normally I don't mind movies scaring me, but this was to much. I covered my eyes in almost every night scene. Something I didn't like was the missing of a climax in the film, it just went on until it ended. The plot was very unusual. I don't think this is a film to watch at many times, I think it should only be viewed once. The movie deals with demons, which is something I do not like since I do believe in the paranormal. So the point of my comment is that you choose how many stars should the movie receive based on this comment. If you want a movie that really scares you, this is a good movie. If you wanna see a film with a well thought out plot and that has only a few scare tactics, it's not a film you would wanna see. But hear me when I say that this is one of the scariest films I have ever seen."

","By concept I mean the way this movie was shot. I admit that I liked this perspective in earlier movies, and I thought Cloverfield perfected it, but right from the start of this movie I thought that the gimmick is wearing off now.<br/><br/>Surprisingly this film is quite good. From the beginning I was worried that this movie would descent into cheap scares and other stupid 'boo'- effects, but luckily this is not the case with Paranormal Activity. The acting is one of the things that could have been improved on. Especially Micah can be very unrealistic sometimes and even obnoxious. But other then that it is a entertaining film that delivers what it promises. Its also kind of strange that the entire movie only takes place at a house, and I wonder how Micah payed for that camera when apparently none of them have a job...<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity never really gets scary, but it does build up a lot of atmosphere and suspense, and the ending is surprising. Even if you are not a big fan of the home-video style videography Paranormal Activity is still worth checking out."
"armandox","7","0","3","16 November 2009"," Good and genuine depiction of a demonic haunting
","There's been a lot of controversy about this movie, and there'll always be. People expecting to be entertained (read: scared) by a well developed plot and/or some gore effects will surely be disappointed. People expecting good character development and glamorous camera-work also should favor other movies above this one. If however you like to be thought-provoked and enjoy imaginative horror-flicks you can give this film a try, and probably like it as well. I went into this movie being for one a fan of the horror-genre and second having a great interest and knowledge about the paranormal. In that respect I can say that this is one of the few movies that delivers! If you ever wanted to know/experience what a haunting or poltergeist phenomena, if you will, are like, then this film gets it more right than many other (over the top) haunting/possession movies.<br/><br/>You are thrown right into the film just after Micah bought himself a (quite huge) video-camera. This to document the strange occurrences happening in their house which focus themselves on Katie. There's no real character development, and that's a strong point of the film, because if you buy a camera to document some weird and frightening phenomena you don't really worry about developing a character, plot, looking good or making great dialog, let alone thinking someone would ever think about putting it on the big screen... You just want to film what's going on from a scientific or interest standpoint. That's just the way it is done in this film. You're presented a reel of film 'as is'. A documentation of all the happenings in the house.<br/><br/>The clever use of mainly sound is what provokes a lot thought and wondering with the viewer. Not showing someone being slashed to pieces, but just a frightening noise which makes you as viewer think: ""What on earth was that?!"". This is on par with what a real haunting would play out like. Rarely you 'see' ghosts, but more often you hear or feel them while they play their fear-inducing tricks on you. Katie becoming more desperate and lost and Micah becoming more and more aggravated inducing the downward spiral of 'negative energy' which demons and ghost happily feed of, and therefore in turn become stronger and more malevolent.<br/><br/>The more up-front theatrical 'Spielberg' ending of this movie is good and effective, plus it leaves things open for a sequel. Myself however, I liked the original ending a bit better because of the simple fact that it makes you wonder what happened downstairs and provokes more thoughts and pondering... The filmmakers really put their thoughts into this movie and did their homework regarding hauntings very well! Nevertheless I can see why there are people who feel this movie to be worthless. You can't please them all, and thank God for different tastes. However, people who want to take a tense emotional, and besides that genuine ride into hauntings and the paranormal should really not miss this one! I won't say it'll scare you witless, but it'll sure make you think, and think again!"

The worst and most powerful event that happens is within the last few minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activities is a scary movie. It was intended for an audience who enjoys that adrenaline rush from being scared out of their minds. The purpose of Paranormal Activities is to do just that. It is filmed in a documentary style to give it the effect that everything on screen actually happened instead of filming it like a normal movie. While filming the movie in a documentary style to give this effect, it was not actually true like it is supposed to appear.<br/><br/>As I said before, Paranormal Activities was intended for an audience who enjoys the adrenaline rush from scary movies, and the purpose of Paranormal Activities is to do exactly that. The movie gives the audience the effect that what is on screen is actually happening through the documentary style of filming. The movie accomplishes its purpose very well, according to people I've talked to who have watched it. I, too, was scared at times during the movie. Using the documentary style of filming was very effective in accomplishing its purpose."

","Do you remember curling up under the covers as a child to hide from whatever monster was surely standing at the foot of the bed? ""Paranormal Activity,"" filmed mostly over a one-week period for a mere $15,000, perfectly recreates that feeling of terror in an adult setting.<br/><br/>The ingenious trailer shows members of a college-age audience at an early screening shrieking and jumping up in their seats in reaction to the events of the film. The effect of these early screenings was to generate so much positive word of mouth that ""Paranormal Activity"" has widely out-performed the sixth entry in the popular ""Saw"" franchise at the box office.<br/><br/>The premise is simple. Katie (Katie Featherson), a graduate student, has been stalked by some sort of malevolent spirit since childhood. Her partner (they're 'engaged to be engaged'), Micah (Micah Sloat), decides to take action after they move into a new house. The movie consists of the footage from Micah's camera, which he carries around the house during the day and uses to record him and Katie while they sleep.<br/><br/>""If you do try playing games with it, that's inviting it in,"" warns a psychic (Mark Fredrichs). He plainly asserts that Katie is being haunted by a demon, and his instructions are simple: leave it alone and the disturbances won't get any worse.<br/><br/>Naturally, Micah proceeds to sarcastically taunt the demon (""What is your quest? What is your favorite color?"") and leave a Ouija board for it to use to communicate. He wants to solve the problem all on his own. The results are not pretty.<br/><br/>The tension in ""Paranormal Activity"" is so extreme that I was often forced to look away from the screen. The premise alone is terrifying – the demon will follow Katie no matter where she goes, so there's no safe place to hide. First-time director Oren Peli's wisely chooses to hold back a thorough explanation. He knows that what we do not understand is scarier than what we do.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the film is one of absolute quiet punctuated abruptly by moments of horror. ""Paranormal Activity"" defines 'doing a lot with a little.' It's amazing what Peli can do with a bed, a door, and a few other household objects.<br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" obviously owes quite a bit to the low-budget mockumentary ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999). The unknown actors of both films improvised much of the dialogue, resulting in natural, believable performances. Katie Featherston is completely convincing in the tormented central role. Micah Sloat's character is more complicated: he does care for Katie, but he's stuck in the childish mindset that he can get rid of the demon on his own. <br/><br/>""Paranormal Activity"" is a rare horror movie that will leave you nearly as scared a day later as you were when you left the theatre. It's not just a rehash of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but a well-acted, creative, and terrifying experience."

The fear in this movie comes from the suspense, the feeling that something might happen any moment; in short, rather than just displaying a horror scene to you point blank, it simply provides a few hints and then lets your mind do the rest.<br/><br/>If you wanna truly enjoy the movie, I repeat, don't watch it in the theatre."

","This move gave me chills up my spine and made my hair stand on end with the creeps.<br/><br/>I liked this movie for the following 10 reasons: <br/><br/>1. Actor/actress who are like everyday people in an everyday situation make the film believable. Makes you think this could happen to you - you can totally relate.<br/><br/>2. You want to slap-the-crap out of the boyfriend - that gives credibility to his performance.<br/><br/>3. The same for Katie, you want to protect and save her but alas, you're helpless! Not to mention she's not supermodel-hot but hot like you could actually be dating her in real life hot!<br/><br/>4. The hype over the similarly shot Blair Witch Project was waaay bigger than this movie yet I thought that movie sucked until the very end, this one is slow at first but you can understand why. There is a graduation of demonic experiences as the film moves along...it requires the slow start!<br/><br/>5. The screams are the best ever for a horror flick.<br/><br/>6. It's not over the top with gore, sexuality, or scary music. The film is simple and that's why it works.<br/><br/>7. If you can understand that someone staring at you while you sleep is super-creepy then you'll love this movie!<br/><br/>8. This is not a movie for those who love to be WOWed with special effects - real creepy doesn't need such antics.<br/><br/>9. After the movie, you could literally have heard a pin drop - everyone in the theater was (stunned is a real ""hypey"" word but yeah) like damn - WTF and that's an awesome feeling!<br/><br/>10. It's exactly how you want a scary movie to make you feel by the end. No bells and whistles, just a simple, weird, creepy plot that punches you in the face at the end......done - sleep tight."

","Paranormal Activity stands out as a motion picture virtually flawless in execution. Oren Peli's use of framing, spooky lighting, and intricate sound blend together so seamlessly that you never question that the events unfolding are in fact recorded history. Unlike Blair Witch, from which Paranormal lifts its approach, this film succeeds in creating the illusion of reality. The performances are 100% natural - there isn't a false note to be found in the film's running time, and Peli's use of basic horror conventions like the ""haunted house"", ""demonic possession"", as well as that really cool scene in thrillers where a character tells a story about the villain (in this case a demon) that absolutely chills you to the bone.<br/><br/>In short, if this film doesn't get under your skin then it's on too tight."

"happyendingrocks","9","0","2","5 November 2009"," Add Paranormal Activity alongside E.T. on the ""Movies That Steven Spielberg Has Ruined"" list
","I want to be very clear right off the bat that my 9-star rating refers to the original director's cut of this film, which, before Steven Spielberg got his idiotic hands on it, was one of the most genuinely frightening film experiences I have ever had. However, the theatrical version of Paranormal Activity is a neutered homage to the original that deserves something much closer to a 6-star distinction.<br/><br/>The hype that went along with this film's wide release run set a bar that would be almost impossible for any movie to reach, so I'm not at all surprised that so many people have commented that Paranormal is not nearly as scary as they were expecting it to be. Had I not seen the director's cut of this film first, I'd be inclined to agree with that assessment. However, as it was originally screened for the festival audiences who helped generate the hoopla, Paranormal Activity not only reaches the fearsome crescendos hinted at in the marketing blitz, it handily exceeds them, delivering the most tense and harrowing horror blitzkrieg I've felt in years, or perhaps ever.<br/><br/>It's clear that Spielberg's aim was to take this niche indie thriller and dumb it down for mass audiences, who prove every time the weekend box office grosses come out that they don't enjoy films that require intelligence as a pre-requisite for enjoyment. By lobotomizing a unique offering like Paranormal Activity, which asks the viewer to draw upon the strange sounds and unexplained phenomenon we've experienced in our own lives to fully insert ourselves into the horrific miasma we find our characters in, the most terrifying moments in this film lose much of the punch they had in the original cut, and the dynamic of the film suffers immeasurably.<br/><br/>In the director's cut, we know that the demonic presence is gradually becoming more powerful because each new scene of night terrors features louder and more ominous manifestations, and the unseen entity's physical interactions with our characters grow more intense as the film moves forward. In the theatrical cut, in which all of the sound effects were re-dubbed, the loudest and most menacing audible phenomena actually occurs early in the film (in fact, the aspect of the original that scared me the most, the idea of some malevolent presence calling your name in the middle of the night, is omitted from the theatrical release). Instead of mounting scares guiding us through the enhancement of the entity's presence, the theatrical cut pauses to make sure that the idiots in the audience are catching on, offering them some newly-filmed and audaciously stupid Real World-ian confessional moments where our characters stare into the camera and tell us ""it's getting worse"" and ""I can feel it watching me right now"".<br/><br/>Other changes are so pointless that we have to wonder why time and money was even spent on them. On PA's journey from director's cut to dummy's cut, a foreboding and shapeless shadow appearing on the couple's bedroom door was removed, altered, and re-inserted, giving us... a different foreboding and shapeless shadow on the bedroom door. Even worse, an extended sequence delving into the demon's origin, accompanied by a very creepy back-story and some deliciously frightening video footage, is relegated to a post-script in the film's theatrical incarnation, and the deliciously frightening footage was left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Let's truly consider the implications of watering down sound effects that already chilled the blood and axing a grisly and powerful scene that added further implications to the terrifying scenario... So, Spielberg's plan to make this horror film better was to make it LESS SCARY? <br/><br/>The biggest change between the two versions is, of course, the ending. While the theatrical ending adds a couple final ""boo""s to the affair, the current climax of Paranormal Activity actually doesn't make any sense when you're forced to ask yourself why a demon that has gone the entire film without showing itself would suddenly decide it wants to play in front of the camera. Again, this device reveals that Spielberg didn't trust mass audiences to be satisfied with the more subtle and creepy ending that graced the original cut. <br/><br/>You know what? He was absolutely right... Most modern film-goers would have bemoaned the fact that we never see what happened to Mikah the same way they complained that we never saw a witch in The Blair Witch Project. <br/><br/>But the vision of this film so brilliantly presented in the director's cut is clearly not intended for that audience. Like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity is built on the horror of what we CAN'T see, which, for anyone with an imagination, is far more frightening than anything that can be conjured on camera. We don't NEED to see what happens to Mikah because we can hear it just fine, and the screams that emerge from downstairs when his body is discovered off camera in the director's cut tell us everything we need to know about the nightmarish scenario we are then forced to picture in our minds.<br/><br/>Comparing the two versions, it's painfully clear that nothing added or subtracted in the theatrical cut does anything to make Paranormal Activity scarier or improve it in any way, and, in fact, every instance of change diminishes the power of this film.<br/><br/>This point will hopefully be moot when the film arrives on DVD, which should sensibly allow viewers to choose between the two cuts. I urge anyone who has yet to see PA to ignore the theatrical option and stick with the film that the director originally wanted you to see. And for those whose only experience with Paranormal Activity was the diluted semi-scary offering you saw in theaters: until you see the un-doctored version, you truly haven't experienced this astoundingly terrifying film yet."

","Paranormal.<br/><br/>–adjective of or pertaining to the claimed occurrence of an event or perception without scientific explanation, as psychokinesis, extrasensory perception, or other purportedly supernatural phenomena. <br/><br/>Activity.<br/><br/>–noun, plural -ties. A use of energy or force; an active movement or operation.<br/><br/>Fear. -noun. A distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc., whether the threat is real or imagined; the feeling or condition of being afraid. Concern or anxiety; solicitude: a fear for someone's safety. <br/><br/>Paranormal Activity (PA) is a low budget 'indie' film following the trend of The Blair Wtich Project. It rose to fame on public demand and word of mouth, some of that word of mouth disparagingly referred to as hype. With a shoe string budget, a handful of unknown actors and a reputation of being the next best thing since The Exorcist, it blew Saw IV or VI out of the water. Those expecting a flash, entertaining flick with great cinematography and bells and whistles will be bitterly disappointed. Those understanding and accepting of films like TBWP, seeking the film for what it is, and not what it isn't, will be affected by what it presents. PA is a reality show with a box of tricks. These tricks are not necessarily intended to precipitate mass screaming, but to create the effect of an authentic haunting. The characters are very natural and believable, and thus it becomes easier to suspend disbelief when nightly occurrences, increasing in tension and emotional impact affect the lives of Kate and Micah. PA plays on and exploits the fear that exists in the safe haven of our own home. 'That' creaky floorboard, 'that' thump on the stairs or in the attic. This film is for anyone who has ever thrown a blanket over themselves in the darkness because the blanket protects and shields from the eyes of the unknown entity. PA breaks that rule.<br/><br/>The plot is simply the haunting of two characters, Kate and Micah, in their home in California. There is a division of night and day. Day time gives us the characters and their exploration into what is occurring in the house. Night time gives us what the camera shows during the period of slumber - or not. The occurrences start simply and build gradually toward the inevitable. Most of the time the audience can believe what is happening. What we see looks authentic and is well done, simplicity over blatant theatricality. Once or twice I found it hard to breath. Not because I could not breathe, but my breath in the dead silence of the theater was magnified in my ears which were straining for the slightest sound as my eyes scanned the darkness. Where PA suffers is the with the occasional spell of overacting. The tension builds slowly throughout until most of the viewers are pinned to the screen. Then overacting disintegrates the effect. These spells are few and far between, but significant enough that my wife laughed on more than one occasion where the viewer was intended to stare in horror. The real power of PA is actually felt, at least in my case, after leaving the theater. Since we believe the characters, we feel and empathise with what is affecting them. It hurts us to see them sleep-deprived, with a dividing line between them due to tensions arising from the invasion of the entity into their personal lives. There is something that gets under the skin. Evil in this world does not have to be the crimes that are reported in the media. Evil exists on a very basic and fundamental level and does not always see the light of day in tabloid or camera. The ending is, well slightly typical of Hollwood. Apparently Spielberg had the ending changed which makes me shake my head. They could have, and more than likely should have, left it alone; but politics being politics, it did get a nationwide release.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, perhaps one of 'the' most authentic films of its genre. With the correct mindset and a little patience the discerning viewer is rewarded. <br/><br/>B-"

","And I am by no means a horror light weight. There seem to be two reactions to this film: it either haunts your dreams or it leaves you seriously wondering why it scares everyone. I can't speak for everyone else but for me it was so terrifying because I could identify with the 'real people' and story line to the point that I imagined I was watching a real account of a demon haunting. The acting was fantastic, the plot was very interesting, the pace was perfect and there were very little special effects. Many people have commented on it being 'so unrealistic' but I don't think it was at all. Yes Micah was very sceptical and not the smartest but I think that was because he didn't really start believing until at least half way through the film (like many of the people who post that it was unrealistic). Once he did start to believe I think he was so confused,exhausted, worried etc. that he just wasn't thinking clearly.<br/><br/>Come on people....you're actually going to sit there and tell me that Katie getting pulled out of bed and dragged down the hall by an invisible force wasn't scary???

","After a few months of odd previews showing users' reactions from a night vision camera, and keeping this title under the wraps, I was intrigued by its upcoming. After it was 'demanded' in my city, the new trailers began to air, and I must say, it seemed interesting. After that, I began to hear how it was ""The scariest movie of all time!"", from several sources: Z100, BloodyDisgusting, AOL, Yahoo!, even my local news! I was pumped, it seemed awesome. I hadn't got around to seeing the movie until Halloween, which was near perfect timing, if not THE perfect time to see it. Went with two friends, and began to watch. After the film was done, I was left feeling like a donut: a huge, empty gap in the pit of my stomach. What happened to the ""scariest movie of all time""? I mean, I will get onto my detailed section, but it was way over-hyped on the scare factor. Personally, floating bedsheets, loud noises, and a man thrown into a camera (all shown in the trailers), seemed to, well--bluntly: suck. Now, let me explain the movie more before I get to the point. The acting was real, I must admit, it did seem like this was real. From start to finish, the movie does authenticate itself into feeling real. The viral filming in a first-person view of the camera from either Micah or Katie, mostly Micah, was interesting, and reminded me of Copperfield, which I liked for a similar reason. The 'paranormal activity', no pun intended, was very interesting, but as I said: that's all it was. The bottom line was: this movie is great; a very good THRILLER. I personally don't classify it as a horror movie, simply because it doesn't scare the true fans of horror. Sure, it well scare the general population, and it did, a la the huge amount of hype. But please, let me expand on my comment. It is great, because the story is so rich and deep, and above all: 'real'. From the filming style, to the 'paranormal activity', and even to the characters genuine and believable acting, this film delivers. Not to the standards of ""the scariest movie of all time"", but it definitely is extremely interesting throughout, and will want you begging for more as the credits roll. But that has been answered; a sequel in 2012. And before I close, I do want to say: I hope this does not become a franchise of a different couple or person each and every movie, experiencing different things. I can look that up on YouTube or use my imagination. I personally think the sequel is unnecessary, but I do hope it clarifies certain things in the film.<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE<br/><br/>(Pro's) Interesting throughout. A solid, B-list (always good to see) movie. Filming is done very well. Actors aren't acting; they are 'real people'. <br/><br/>(Con's) Over-hyped. NOT the scariest movie of all-time, I assure you this. Too short; really wanted to see more, but not in sequel form. <br/><br/>Overall: 6.8/10; 3/5; ****<br/><br/>The verdict? Go see ""Paranormal Activity"". If your city hasn't 'demanded it', then I recommend you better get to clicking!<br/><br/>~ Frankie<br/><br/>P.S. Hope you enjoyed my first-ever review, more to come with enhancements along the way! Happy Movie-Going! ^_^"

"domaidomai","10","0","3","2 November 2009"," Amazing, terrifying... if you watched it.
","First off - I have a bit of an axe to grind here. I'm old enough to have seen enough reactions to movies in every genre and there's one thing in common with certain people who review books, music and movies and give them excessively poor reviews; they are generally reviewing something they didn't actually experience.<br/><br/>If you don't surrender yourself to a horror movie, or suspend belief of some sort during it, you're not going to be scared. Anyone can half watch a horror movie and not get scared by it. If you are watching a horror movie trying to satisfy some macho egoistic urge to prove you 'aren't scared by the ""scariest movie ever""' then you aren't going to be scared. If you half watch while making snarky remarks with your friend whenever a 'scary' scene comes (and they're usually very easy to predict with PA given the cues) then you won't be scared. If you are Jim talking to your friend Steve while watching the movie then you won't be so scared because you're just Jim talking to Steve about a movie that's on. However, if you become Micah and Katie and for the most part erase your own identity while watching the movie you WILL most likely be very scared, very scared. Especially if you've had somewhat similar experiences in your real life. You'd be scared in real life if you were in their situation.. very scared. If you can believe in a book's characters and become them, you will be much more effected by their tribulations, plights and joys then if you're just read words on a page, far removed from the actual story. If I wash dishes and carry on a conversation while a song I've never heard is playing, I'm very unlikely to enjoy the song. If I sit in a dim room with headphones on all alone, I'm much more likely to enjoy the song. At the very least I can put myself in the place of the songwriters, or journey much further into the vibe or feeling of the song. I can see the song for itself and movies are no different.<br/><br/>So it's not an amazing feat to watch this movie and not get scared.. if anything the opposite is true. It's much easier to disassociate yourself. If you are able to surrender yourself to the movie and still find it boring and give it a bad review then that's fine. But if you're like every Jim and Steve I've sat beside in a movie theatre, I have no respect for your review and think it should be discredited, because Jim and Steve don't watch movies."

","Don't trust the hype. I was really scared to watch this movie, my husband bought the tickets and I was still hesitant to sit through this movie and that's because I'm a total wimp when it comes to horror movies. Anything related to the supernatural scares me for days and sometimes even weeks. It just physically affects me. <br/><br/>So hearing, reading all the hype that came out of this movie, I was holding to my seat as it started. The first few minutes into the film, I did not feel relaxed, rather was building up tension thinking this is going to be it. But, but but, as the movie progressed I only felt calmer and more relaxed.<br/><br/>Let me spill out some pros and cons related to this movie: Pros: 1. For the low budget cost of this movie, its pretty well done. 2. It's not really that shaky like others have mentioned, at least I didn't feel much of it. 3. This movie will scare young adults (13 - 17), but will be a good laugh for anyone over 20. 4. The movie has a lot of jokes and it's not that boring.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. It's not scary, let me repeat this. It was not scary. If you get scared by the slightest noise in your house, then you maybe scared. 2. I felt the movie was too short, it's almost as if I wanted a really suspenseful ending, but it wasn't good (something which I expected)! 3. I watched this movie, came back to my house, was sitting in my room and I heard a thud thud thud and lights flicker, and I know, I was just laughing like crazy! :-) <br/><br/>I give it a 7/10 since it might scare teens, and it was pretty well done."

Now this kind of movie wasn't one I would be excited about once I got out of the show but it did stir up some interesting conversations between me and a bunch of people that watched the film.<br/><br/>To those that say it wasn't scary I would say it was supposed to be more or less like a real life adventure not some over animated CGI or something over dumbed with a lot of freaky music.<br/><br/>Movies like this stir my imagination up even more which is good because it motivates your mind even though the topic was a bit disturbing.<br/><br/>It's not the kind of film you take your girlfriend or a blind date too so they will grab your arm I seen more people more disturbed watching it rather then ducking their heads down.<br/><br/>I do not think I will be buying a two story house anytime soon either so this movie might effect the house buying market! I would suggest to people that want to see it you must have a good imagination and love surprises otherwise you will be disappointed that is all I am going to say!"

","It's the open doorway that keeps you on edge. That's where our eyes are trained. Something in the house is making those booming noises, and the anticipation of its source materializing within the black rectangle fuels our fear, because the ""mis-en-scene"" feels spontaneous. There's no music cue to brace us for any imminent surprises. Micah, the daytrader who moonlights as a naive art-house filmmaker, employs the long take to good effect, which allows you to search the frame for paranormal activity without the didacticism of camera angles and editing. The scares aren't canned; the scares are fresh, generated from a build-up of long-simmering dread. The scares are based on observation, not cheaply earned through flash cuts, which only startle the moviegoer. The objective distance between the camera and the bed that contains the sleeping couple is deceptively artless. The camera isn't looking for the demon, you are: the camera is passive, forcing the moviegoer into a more pro-active mode. ""Paranormal Activity"" makes you a ghostbuster among ghostbusters, in which the camera is subjugated, transformed into a corroborator to the sentry, that is you, who looks over this woman, and to a lesser degree, this man. From the open doorway, the hall running north to south can be glimpsed, and the stairwell that connects to it. The moviegoer measures the proximity of the potential demon traversing the hallway to the couple's room towards the camera, and realizes how vulnerable Katie seems, especially since Micah is sleeping on the wrong side of the bed, the side closest to the doorway to her left, as if she's protecting him. Even worse than the prospect of a malevolent presence methodically approaching the bedroom from the farthest reaches of the entrance/exit, that malevolent presence could manifest itself without warning from the hallway parallel to their room, revealing itself where the wall gives way to the threshold of their sleeping chamber without a musical soundtrack to orientate the moviegoer of the transition between the build-up and the reveal. Unlike other horror movies, we're not told in advance of what is, hypothetically, supposed to terrify us.<br/><br/>The moviegoer never sees anything bodily enter the room, but there are the footprints, captured in posterity by the baby powder that Micah deposits on the floor. It changes the rules: the demon can get to Katie without detection. Katie's sleepwalking, and her dramatic snake-like slither off from her bed, jolts us, because the doorway serves not only as an entrance, but as an exit, as well. The moviegoer is rendered powerless, and maybe, unconsciously, a little guilty too, since the film surreptitiously makes us responsible for Katie's safety(the demon was in the room and we missed it), even though we know that the events on the tape had already transpired. Such is the faculties of digital video to project a present tense ambiance. We're the last line of defense; we're doing Micah's job. By all appearances, the amateur filmmaker uses his girlfriend as a human shield against otherworldly harm. Katie's safety becomes secondary to, in Micah's own words, ""good stuff"". At the time of its creation, the ""found tape"" that would become ""Paranormal Activity"", was never a formal film, but nevertheless, Micah puts Katie through some compromising positions that violates the pact between a filmmaker and his actor, none more so than the moment he employs the ouija board to draw the demon out. ""Paranormal Activity"" gets to the essence of the exploitation film. Micah creates a setting where the girl is put in jeopardy, and somewhat dispassionately records her suffering, because he never takes the matter of the demon seriously enough. Like genre film itself, horror especially, the filmmaker and the audience are having fun.<br/><br/>But what about Katie? Well...see for yourself, what her feelings are on Micah's machinations to drum up action for his home video."

","Just got back from seeing this film and can't wait to own it on DVD. I've been a huge fan of sci-fi, horror and gore for so long I'm almost completely desensitized to them and haven't been properly scared in a very long time. This film leaves most of the scary stuff up to your imagination. A ""creature"" is never physically seen and falls into the same creep category as Blair Witch. Although Blair Witch was an entertaining film in its simplicity, this film outperforms Blair Witch by leaps and bounds. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat give excellent, believable performances and really make you feel their anguish, especially Featherston.<br/><br/>I can tell you one thing...if you're prone to nightmares from seeing a scary film, get ready for some lulus. There are some especially creepy moments that made me jump and call out ""Oh S--t""!"

","I'm not going to repeat the gist of what most of the other posters have already stated about this ""mockumentary"" film. I'm not going to agree with the comments about not being able to sleep after seeing it or that it was the scariest movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I AM going to say that the hype is DESERVED because this is another one of those cool indie films that follows the adage ""Less is More"" and that no place is scarier than one's own imagination.<br/><br/>Go watch this film with an open mind. Don't expect stellar acting, a full-circle storyline, or things to be dealt with ""appropriately"". Humans RARELY deal with stressful situations ""appropriately"". I myself came away from the theater (last night!) thinking of what I would've done differently, would've changed, etc., and I'm no film student, but this movie stands on its own because it scares you WITHOUT over-the-top gore, violence, tragedy, or needless extraneous romantic couplings. If Hollywood could produce more ""scary"" films without all those things, I'd actually go to the theater more than three times a year again.<br/><br/>Go to a matinée if you don't want to pay full price for a ""blockbuster"" caliber movie, but I wouldn't recommend going alone.

"Anyoneatnowhere","8","0","1","1 November 2009"," If you liked The Haunting, Blair Witch Project, The Changeling etc...
","I prefer horror movies and ghost stories that are about something that isn't tangible. Movies like that force our imagination to run wild and leave you feeling like a raw nerve up until the climax when you get the payoff - a big scare and (sometimes) a revelation about the being itself. <br/><br/>Anyone who's lived in an old, creaky house during their childhood will probably remember getting scared by noises, a tap on the window or a dark figure in the corner. Of course, there was nothing there but the feeling you had then was a sort of helpless terror. A feeling triggered by an over-active imagination, a belief in ghosts and a primal fear of the dark. <br/><br/>OK, I'll stop with my personal gushing over how scary my pathetic childhood was but I wanted to explain why I personally found this movie so scary. Sure there are no big scares until the end but you can feel the tension go up a few notches each time it switches to those god damned night-vision shots. <br/><br/>It's definitely not a flawless movie but it's simplicity is endearing and (if it hadn't been for the obnoxious viral marketing campaign) I would have given it a higher score. I loved it but this was one of the most over hyped movies of the decade and that ruined it for a lot of viewers.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter, though. In the end, you'll either love it or hate it. Just watch it alone, with the lights out, in a creaky house and see how long it takes you to fall asleep that night."
"coldstick","8","0","1","1 November 2009"," An excellent experience
","*Very mild spoilers* Let's get a few things out of the way. First and foremost, this is not really a movie designed for mainstream audiences--I predict it will disappoint many (or even most) of those going to see it. If you are unable to tolerate anything other than the conventional Jerry Bruckheimer type film with digital monsters, gore, etc. then save yourself the trouble and stay at home. If you're planning on seeing this, you probably have at least some idea of what this film is like (Blair Witch + haunted house). Needless to say, it is foolish to pay to see a movie you already know you will hate.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Paranormal Activity is a definite success as far as I'm concerned. The characters are totally believable, the build-up is excellent, and the pacing is perfect. Whether or not it will make you ""jump"" in your seat depends on how well you take horror films. I almost never jump in my seat (this film included), but was still able to appreciate the suspense and sense of dread created by the ""night"" scenes. When I was 12 years old or so, I was scared to death of being home alone in my house, especially at night. Every small creak in the floor boards meant that a possible stranger was there, in my mind. Obviously, I've long since grown out of that mindset, but PA helped bring it back a bit! The movie isn't so much ""scary"" as it is just plain creepy. I'm glad they went with the ""demon"" angle, because a ghost just wouldn't have been as eerie.<br/><br/>If there's any downside to the movie, it's that it ends somewhat abruptly (perhaps just a hair more information would have made it more satisfying) and feels a little short.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I greatly enjoyed the film and am not sure how much more I can write about it without giving stuff away. If it sounds like your cup of tea, give it a go!"

","Let me start by stating that this movie was definitely not scary. It was horrifying and utterly disturbing!!! Simply watching the trailer was a harrowing experience!!! I don't know whether it was the acting, the plot, the camera-work or simply all of them combined that made it so, but I do know it was enough to have me sleeping with rosaries all over me for a night (or more by the time this is posted). <br/><br/>Adding to the horror was the fact that there was no music, simply a deep, foreboding and almost hellish rumbling tone that seemed to warn us that something was about to happen. <br/><br/>But nothing I write here can truly pay tribute to this film and its demonic atmosphere. The acting, the sounds and the fact that I felt a tug on my leg when Katie was pulled from her bed just made me want to follow the group leaving the theatre halfway through. But I stayed and I'm glad I did. Now I can brag to all my peers that ""I"" saw ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" and lived to tell the story. <br/><br/>So to end this comment, I pose a warning to all ghost hunters out there.

"nate878","5","0","1","1 November 2009"," A lacking experience
","(minor spoiler in concern to the nature of the ending)<br/><br/>Digged-up from indie-horror is the film Paranormal Activity. Follow a couple who are plagued by a demonic presence and an ever-present camera. <br/><br/>This is, by far, one of the most deceitful little horror films of the twitter-era. Promising scares and mind-bending horror, you are instead served with atypical ghoul pranks and inter-relationship bickering throughout a majority of the film. <br/><br/>While the director does what he can to keep you in the mind-set that this is real, the mockumentary eventually falls flat near the end, especially with the husband's lax response to ever-increasingly unsettling events. <br/><br/>This isn't to say the film is without some tension and suspense alongside perhaps a couple cheap scares. The otherwise invisible demon seems to have a tangible and disturbing presence in the second half of the film, but ultimately the violent ending just didn't justify the dull hour or more of door swinging, wall-banging, possessed sleep-walking and silly arguments between the tormented couple. <br/><br/>At the least, I don't recommend wasting $9 seeing it in theater. Perhaps a cheap rental at best."
"giftofgodoflove","9","0","1","1 November 2009"," Ignore the bad reviews AND the hype: see it for yourself - an effective film
","The movie is a good scary film. It uses the 'less is more' philosophy very well. The characters seemed real, like they could be your own friends, or just someone you know from work. The atmosphere seemed real; the couple's home looks like the home of a friend of mine. Further, how the character's start off normal, and then gradually descend into their own personal, paranoid sort of madness. This really unnerves me. Madness itself is undesired enough. But to see normal people - someone you could easily know - gradually become more and more angry, or paranoid, or spooked, to the point where they're on the verge of madness creeps me out. For I can't help thinking I'd react the same. People who weren't scared are either lying or don't get scared by nearly anything.<br/><br/>There's also no good reason to think this movie isn't scary. The ending isn't bad or unnatural. It flows nicely from what came before. She lunges at the camera, because the camera is the symbol of the interloper. The demon despised the boyfriend's arrogance and insolence. And the demon despised the camera because it was the symbol of the boyfriend's attempts to infringe on the demon's privacy.<br/><br/>Further, some don't like the boring scenes. Well, if they don't like them, don't watch the film. It's not for them. The movie takes it for granted that the audience is going to be smart enough to know that the movie is designed not to look like it cared about how things were being filmed. For example, if you're making a home movie, and you accidentally leave the camera on a counter while the two characters are off screen talking or arguing, then this is a completely natural thing you'd expect from footage claiming to be taken not by professional movie makers, but normal everyday people who happened to own a camera. If you come to the movie knowing this, then you expect these so-called boring scenes. If they weren't there, we'd be suspicious of fraudulent editing. The fact that they are there makes the movie feel even more real. And this is the basic fact the movie deals with: this is real footage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some people thought it was funny. Well, this is says more about their own psychological sensibilities than it does about the quality of the film itself. If you think the paranormal activity that lead up to the full possession of an innocent woman funny, then either you are psychologically demented or you really were scared and your laughing is a defense mechanism. If you want to be all macho and prove to the world that the movie was crap because of how macho you are, then you are going into the movie with the completely wrong frame of mind. If you heard a bunch of hype, then I'm sorry. But do not judge the movie based on the hype, period. This will ruin your skills as a good judge of the movie. Judge the movie on its own terms and in its own context.<br/><br/>Also, you can't fault the movie because you think the characters did something dumb. The movie is what it is. It's marketed as being live footage of real people being haunted by a demon. If the character did stupid things, then guess what? That's what the camera recorded them as doing. You can't fault the movie itself for the acts of the characters, especially in a film like this one. The proper conclusion to draw is that the character acted stupidly, not that the movie itself is bad.<br/><br/>As a side note, it seems like all the bad reviews of this movie are written by morons who can't even write a grammatically correct sentence. Yes, that's a clue.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Ignore the hype and the unrealistic denunciations of this film being the least scariest movie ever made. Both are extremes, and so both are critically unreliable. The former is made by those who want to be a part of something special; the latter is made by those who just want to feel macho. Ignore them both and see it for yourself. Suspend your imagination, put yourself in their shoes, and allow the crawling suspense of the film make you feel a little disturbed. If you don't feel it, it's not for you: you're in one of the categories I mentioned above."

I have not seen a singe original Idea or a truly Scary moment in a long time, and I love to be Scared out of my mind when I watch a horror (Thats the whole point?!?! Hey who doesn't like being scared). ""Saw"" was a pretty cool movie but no where near what this film does to you, watching ""Paranormal Activity"" I have had yet again more proof that to make an effective horror movie you need to be original, talented, and try to mentally put the audience in the same situation.<br/><br/>I wont reveal anything about the story or plot but I will tell you that this movie uses the same basic principles for any thrilling experience used in movies over the years, making us fear what we cant see because we don't know where it is at that moment (Jaws, Alien) it creates such Tension that you find yourself breathing hard and physically shaking. I think the best way to ""enjoy"" this movie is watching it for the first time without knowing that in fact it has a director or actor's, but instead knowing that you are watching actual footage of paranormal activities in an everyday American home.<br/><br/>I think that Hype is an issue here because most of the people that go to the theaters to watch this are already in the state of mind to expect certain things, they are watching the movie from a wrong perspective, you are expected to be scared when instead you should watch it feeling pity for the two main characters every time they are going to bed. I have waited for a long time to have this kind of movie and I am glad it came from a 10,000$ budget and a digital camcorder, it should Shame other horror movie directors in showing them that they have failed yet again in creating sometime this effective with millions of dollars.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to Anyone, ANYONE!!! as long as your up for it because your in for a big scare.

","I heard the hype like the rest of the audiences did, but I have to admit that it was very well done demon flick.<br/><br/>Take in mind that there are no real big special effects, very little blood but it had a hellava creep factor. It deals with the subject of demons and possession, and what happens after the lights are turned out at night. Paranormal Activity plays on our night fears of monsters lurking in the dark.<br/><br/>Most impressive are the casts of unknown actors. Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat looked like the perfect matched couple. And these two when acting terrified, especially Katie are very believable characters and I see very lucrative acting careers ahead. Micah who played the skeptic never changes but Katie is very expressive from going from good to evil.<br/><br/>I would recommend this as a good spooky film to see. The ending is VERY unsettling as well as the subject of demon possession. However, if you like slasher flicks, or non stop action thrillers with special effects--pass it up. Paranormal Activity will be remembered as one of the low budget films like ""Night of the Living Dead"" to become a horror classic."

After 20-30 minutes the movie really started to dig in. A damn f*****g scary movie. Very creepy and freaky. I'll never forget this movie in my life ever. I can literally hear my heart thumping for scene after scene. Half-way through it, part of my mind was going like this, ""okay man, enough of this movie. Just shut the damn movie off and get to bed.

Very much. I accept I am a chicken. From now onwards, for some days or even weeks I won't be able to stay in total darkness with my mind buzzing not knowing what's in front of me nor behind me. But I am impressed with the movie. The fact that not a lot of background music was used in the movie made it so natural. I felt like I was in that room. I could the tension.

You'll be pissing in your pants. You will be scared. frightened and horrified. Make no mistake about. Those who think they are tough and can't be scared, you need to take look into this. I guarantee you that you'll become a chicken by the end of the movie. Anybody who says that this movie is not scary, don't listen to them. They are either lying or trying to scare the hell out of you.<br/><br/>This movie is not for the weak of heart. Try watching this movie alone at night. Better watch it with someone to be safe. I read online that after viewing this movie, Steven Spielberg thought the DVD given to him was haunted and brought it back to the studio in the garbage bag. Just think how scary it would have been.<br/><br/>I hear they are going to make a sequel. If you ask me, no sequel is needed for this movie. It would drastically ruin it's reputation. I bet my life that if they go with it they add lots of special effects and background music which is so unoriginal. I don't need them to turn a brilliant movie into a joke by making a sequel.<br/><br/>Just leave this movie alone. It's scary, creepy, freaky, horrifying and brilliant this way.

"Suicide_Saint","7","0","2","31 October 2009"," Paranormal Activity: An Instant Classic
","What do classic horror films such as Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, Halloween, and others have in common? These films create an atmosphere of suspense, they illicit strong emotions, they tell a captivating story, and they accurately display characteristics of human nature that allow viewers to develop a connection. How many times have you watched a film and felt nothing when you see random teens being hacked to pieces by some anonymous maniac? Paranormal Activity carries on the traditions of horror classics like no film in recent memory, including the dreaded ""Blair Witch Project."" Let's be honest, once people discovered that it was not real footage, it lost all of it's ability to frighten.<br/><br/>Director Oren Peli takes a minimalist approach to the film. The simplification of the environment, characters, and camera angles allows the audience to focus on the events taking place. This can be a risk, as the acting and storytelling must be strong to maintain active engagement. The two young actors deliver strong, convincing performances. Also worthy of note is that the absence of activity and development of realistic surroundings make the escalation of the haunting delver such a significant impact. <br/><br/>The subjects of the film are Katie and Micah, a young couple in their 20's. We quickly discover that the two have been hearing some strange noises and have decided to document the occurrences in hopes of discovering / solving this incongruity. These characters are no doubt reflective of the target demographic of the film. Katie is a student pursuing a degree to become a teacher. Micah is a businessman (day trader) who has casual interests in sex, guitar, and electronics. Sound familiar? <br/><br/>One of the most fascinating elements of this film are the intricate parallels between the relationship and the haunting. At the onset of the film, Katie and Micah appear quite happy and undoubtedly comfortable with one another. Slowly, there relationship begins to diverge and unravel in direct correlation with the ""occurrences"". This separation begins with a very mild split in interests: Micah wants to film the two in some ""extracurricular activity"" but Katie will not agree to this. A small, but noticeable disagreement Then, after the first evidence is captured, Katie invites an ""expert"" in the field of paranormal activity to the home against Micah's wishes. This character plays a small, but significant role in the film as he directly states that haunting are fueled by ""negative energy."" Even with this undeviating warning, we see a continual departure from equivalence between Katie and Micah. Micah's pride drives him to an uncompromising state of masculine defense. Micah's inability to ""fix the problem"" leads Katie to lose faith and place blame and misguided frustrations on Micah.<br/><br/>The culmination of the tribulations within the relationship occurs when Micah directly defies Katie's adamant request not to attempt any agitation of or communication with the presence. Micah ""borrows"" a Ouija board and further antagonizes the entity, leading to our first significant illustration of the growing power of this force. Katie is more enraged than ever with Micah; they leave the house in a climactic argumentative state. Immediately following Katie's outburst and the couples' departure, the Ouija board bursts into flames. This is paramount, as it symbolizes how tumultuous the emotions can be between two individuals. In other words, the success of one's relationship with his/her significant other is reflected in their surroundings. People in successful, rewarding relationships will often view the world with a more positive outlook. The more disparity, heartache, and despondence in a relationship, the more negative the surroundings. Shattered relationships lead to addictions, depression, and in some cases, suicide. Is it such a stretch that Katie and Micah's tempestuous relationship could bring about this dreadful haunting? <br/><br/>Watch this film alone or with that significant otherat homewith the volume up and the lights down. Watch for moving shadowslisten for creeping footstepsbelieve in Paranormal Activity."

","Saw this last night and it was a great little indie horror film, in the same tradition of other great, low-budget films like Blair Witch, Halloween, (Jack Ketchum's) The Girl Next Door, or the original Clerks. For the posters complaining about how the movie ""looks cheap"" and has amateur acting well...it was made for $15k in one week and features novice actors. If you go see this expecting the same level of acting and production values as in a typical, big budget Hollywood production, then yes, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>For what it is, it is quite well-done and is a hell of a lot better than a lot of recent horror films to show up in theaters in a while. I think most of the people commenting on how bad this film is probably have not seen very many (if any) such small, low-cost, independent movies and can only compare it to the blockbusters - hence they are disappointed in the final product because they are used to the big effects and top-notch production values (and I'm not being an indie snob, I don't think a film is automatically great just because it is an ""indie"". So, yes, if you think that films like ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Saw VI"" are great films - you will probably not like this.<br/><br/>I saw a private screening of this and I will say I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much in a theater. In general, I tend to avoid theaters because I hate having idiots around me talking or playing on their cel phones during a movie. But this is a film that is tailor-made to watch at home, late at night, with all of the lights out."

Some due to the terrible music, some due to laughable faces, some due to anemic girls climbing out of wells ...<br/><br/>But after a decade or so, finally there is a movie, which actually gave me the creeps.

","If you are looking for a film that does ANYTHING other than scare you, you won't like Paranormal Activity. This is not a thinking man's film. I spent the entire film telling myself that I would be reacting to the situations in a completely different manner than the characters did (like most sub-par horror movies.) Also, some of the actual ""incidents"" didn't make a whole lot of sense either. However, there can be an enjoyable experience in watching this film. <br/><br/>Think of it as a haunted house. I went into a haunted house once and in one room there was a bed and a TV with static. The next room was a church setting. That doesn't make sense. It isn't realistic, but it's done that way to maximize the scares. If you approach Paranormal Activity the same way as you would a haunted house (not expecting an impeccable plot and and a whole lot of realistic acting) you may find yourself enjoying the movie a lot more. <br/><br/>Even if you drop your expectations in plot and acting, this film may or may not be scary based on what makes you squirm. This film makes you jump, it has you searching the screen for what happens next and it has a very eerie/evil atmosphere. It does not have a genius directing deep tension and creepiness within a well written plot.<br/><br/>Go see it if you want to have fun and goof off with friends. DO NOT go into this as a film connoisseur. You will be disappointed.<br/><br/>If I were to rank similar films... 1) Blair Witch (scared the crap out of me, but only good for one viewing.) 2) Paranormal Activity (lots of fun, but left me wanting more.) 3) Cloverfield (the most unique of the bunch, but not very scary.) 4) REC/Quarantine (the most pointless remake of all time, the original didn't do much for me either.)<br/><br/>Is it just me, or is this sub-genre of horror films full of underachievers."

","The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of the camera usage. I was motion sick after the first 10 min. The story was cool, pretty convincing. My son wanted to look it up to see if it was real when we got home. The Blair Witch like filming made it almost impossible for me to watch. It was so bad I felt like puking and could only watch the bedroom scenes because that was about the only time they used a tri-pod. It sucks that they did that, I would watch it again if it wasn't for that. If you have no interest or imagination you won't like it. But if you dig this kind of stuff I think you will like it. If it makes it to the TV I hope they loose some of the shaky camera work. It was overdone.

The Quiji board scene was great, although not really frightening. The only scene I found ""freaky"" was when the girl was dragged out of bed and into the hall.<br/><br/>This is Blair Witch Project all over again.

Pacing is an issue as the film starts out at a glacial pace before picking up on the suspense in the second half. Micah's forays into research were a tease that led nowhere, as a maybe previous victim named Diane was never explained nor explored. I also really wanted to see the Demonologist come to the house. This character was brought up as a would-be savior for the couple's situation, but never materialized. Performances by the psychic and the friend were throw-aways, but Katie did a good job going into an escalating state of fear and paranoia. I really hope to see Katie in more roles, in bigger movies, in the future."

","Watching this film, I was sort of reminded of The Blair Witch Project or Open Water. Movies like this show that you don't need a big budget, big stars or grand special effects to make a quality film. This film was made two years ago and has just two main actors. It clocks in at 85 minutes and doesn't even have a soundtrack or credits and yet it is the film everyone is talking about. I liked the fact that unlike so many horror films it doesn't use gory special effects. I have always loved ghost stories and watching this made me think of my Boy Scout days telling stories around the campfire. SPOILER ALERT, this film is slow to get started but once it gets scary watch out. The last scene of this film made me feel like I had swallowed an ice cube whole. Ahhh! you'll be scared."
"bramb600","9","0","1","28 October 2009"," It does a lot with very little!
","Paranormal Activity is a horror movie that is basically found footage of a couple, Micah and Katie, who decide to tape the paranormal events that are happening in their home. It's very low budget and is very similar to The Blair Witch Project except it all takes place indoors and it's much better.<br/><br/>As you might know, Paranormal Activity has a very large amount of hype behind it. What most intrigued me about the film were the rave reviews from critics. One review even went as far as saying that it was the scariest film of all time. This quote is probably what most of the hype was generated from. Now that I've seen it, I don't think that it is the scariest film ever, although you might be able to say that it was the scariest of the decade. It doesn't even get intense until the last 20-25 minutes, but it's very creepy and suspenseful all the way through. It's really impressive how people are saying that it's so scary when there are barely any scares. There's a scene in the movie where Micah and Katie are sleeping with the camera running and the door moves slightly. When that happened, everyone in the theatre was shaking because they were expecting something really shocking to happen. When you can get people getting scared by the smallest things in your movie, it has to have some excellent suspense.<br/><br/>The performances were also solid. Everyone acted like a normal person may act in a home video. All of the dialogue was actually improvised, but I could even tell because the actors had great chemistry. They were completely believable as an actual couple.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed how well the film was edited and it was especially impressive for such a low budget. I really liked how the movie only showed the night scenes in a time lapse, only stopping for important moments. This kept the movie more interesting and run along much faster, because the beginning was somewhat slow but it wasn't a major issue. In the movie, you are calm during the daytime and the movie suddenly becomes tenser at night. I liked how they used comic relief during the day to keep the least interesting bits of the movie more entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was. This time was also used efficiently for character development, which helped me care for the characters, even though Micah wasn't really that likable.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is a film that must be seen in theatres. I believe that it's an experience in the theatre, that can't be compared to watching it at home on DVD. Watching it with a huge crowd is amazing because you feel what they are feeling. If someone makes a sound, you will be able to hear it because the movie is so quiet. For me, hearing a crowd react to a shocking moment in a horror movie makes the scares more satisfying. However, this could backfire because obnoxious people may be screaming and cracking jokes at inappropriate times. They usually shut up when the film catches their interest again which can't be too long because the movie is so exciting. Seeing a door move slightly isn't going to be scary when watching the film online, because it lacks the theatre experience.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I thought that Paranormal Activity was one of the scariest movies I've seen in a very long time, but that's only if it's seen in theatres."
"danny_Ortmann","10","0","3","27 October 2009"," Shivered all over
","Alright let me start up with this: I'm from Germany and I haven't heard anything of this movie before I actually watched the last 2 hours. Hence I have not been affected by the ""hype"" which is mentioned in most of the comments I read before I decided to write one myself. By pure accident I found this movie on a website on which you can find streams of current cinema movies and other stuff. Reading the description ""After moving into a suburban home, a couple becomes increasingly disturbed by a nightly demonic presence"" didn't make me watch this movie. But the comments of other people did. For example: ""Hammer Film!! Der Beste Horror Thriller Aller Zeiten. Damn!!"" (translated: ""Great movie! The best horror thriller of all time"").<br/><br/>I really do not want to argue that the American people calling this movie ""pure hype"" or whatever just proved their own dullness yet another time... But dudes really... This movie is so well done and appears so freaking authentic that I can hardly take someone serious claiming that he was bored for the whole length of the movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion it was so incredibly well done how the tense grew and how the movie went straight forward to its climax by starting with scenes in which you simply were afraid of WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. From scene to scene it then changed to getting afraid of WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IN THAT BEDROOM. You know you can either say that you're totally not into this kind of stuff like ghosts, paranormal phenomena and so on OR you admit that you simply CAN'T TELL if there is something like demons, ghosts etc.<br/><br/>Speakin' for myself I was just sitting in front of my screen, shivering all over and after the movie ended I involuntarily started crying simply out of a feeling of relief that this tense was over now. Man, I'm used to every single major horror movie like the Saw movies, Halloween movies, Hostel, The Grudge, Quarantine, Cloverfield etc., but this movie totally f***ed me up. I'm really into this kind of movies like Quarantine, Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity. I enjoy this hand camera movies that give you the feeling of being a part of what's happening. <br/><br/>Like I said before... I don't know if it's just the fact that Americans are too dull to put themselves into the person that is filming everything with his hand camera or if they still think they're the greatest nation in the world and they don't have to be afraid of anything but their own dullness. I mean come on... You re-elected George W. Bush. GOOD JOB!<br/><br/>Best horror movie I have ever seen."

We sat wondering when it was going to get scary. However it was very predictable and the only thing scary about the ending was the fact that I was turned away sipping my drink and looked up at the wrong time. I will say for the budget spent it was a very good film. However for anything except a straight to DVD movie it left wanting.

Dialogue kept to a minimum building slowly adding more intensity to the tension of the situation. Culmination with the climax at the END of the movie. A CLASSIC old school Horror MOVIE. Kudos to the director and cast. Limited blood and gore, what is left to the imagination is always the most frightening. Great job for a generation of newbie viewers to this type of genre.<br/><br/>One thing sets this movie apart in this day and age, which makes it exceptional. Is the use of many old school tricks from classic horror movies that are now anywhere from 100 to 50 years old! For example the footsteps in the powder on the floor, doors moving without assistance. Bedsheets curling next to a sleeping victim. I think the first time I saw that I was scared to death when watching ""The Invisible Man"". What kids in the 21at century are even familiar with such fun? These guys know their classic horror/suspense film movies and hopefully learned something from FILM SCHOOL. The fact that LESS is MORE is scary! Single camera shots...seemingly isolated characters...tearing apart emotionally but needing one another. No musical score. In fact the film was as fun to watch a second time as a silent! A wonderful complement to the actors and directors.<br/><br/>In addition, the use of camera colors for night shots was well done...sepia tones at night add to the suspense of the intruder with the hour counter in the corner for added tension. Then BAM color! The fear of the 'UNKNOWN' as the ethos of the film and the stubborn man who must protect his WOMAN at all COSTS, great stuff.<br/><br/>Hopefully this movie will inspire more thought provoking movies than straight out gore and masochistic violence produced under the guise of Horror flicks."

The acting (this particular acting style is actually very actor friendly...but you cant take that away from it all) and execution is as close to flawless as it can come. There was not one point in the entire film where I had a chuckle or felt removed from the encompassing power of the film due to some flaw in the production.<br/><br/>This was the realest, and scariest horror film ever produced, in my opinion. That opinion might contradict my issues however, because while execution is good as said...the ending is not very good. The problem is that the apex of the ending (the man getting thrown into the camera) has already been exposed in TV spots- so we were all ready for that moment to pass, and then ready for something more!!! The real knocker! Instead, the last few seconds is very...dull, in my opinion, and the ""startling"" ending is frankly pretty cliché'.<br/><br/>However, I had to really focus in on my disdain for the ending before being so critical, because honestly this was the most pleasing film I have watched in a long time....since Cloverfield (which had a good ending :)"

","I'm not one for slasher flicks, so I liked Paranormal Activiity. The first 25 minutes or so are giving you the feel of the characters and a history of what is going on. The activity starts out pretty simple, just an unnoticeable scratching on the walls. You can tell that the boyfriend doesn't really take it seriously,until the video camera starts picking stuff up. Then he thinks hes some kind of ghost hunter and in spite of being warned to just ignore it and let someone more experienced handle it, he encourages the activity. Which is all fun and games until the being drags his girlfriend across the room and bites her. I'm not going to go into the ending and the movie wasn't ""It made me so scared that I left the theater and couldn't sleep"" but it was enjoyably scary and I would recommend it.

It is genuinely creepy and surprisingly well-made, but it really isn't very scary. As I sat in the theater, absorbed in its story and characters, people around me screamed needlessly and threw their popcorn up in the air. They were not goofing off, but were actually quite frightened.

"LadyLiberty","7","0","1","25 October 2009"," So Good, It's Scary!
","Paranormal Activity is a very unusual movie even when you don't consider the movie itself. It was made in 2007, but is only just now enjoying a theatrical release. It took just a week to film, starred a couple of unknown actors who used their own names in the movie, and was filmed at a cost of only about $11,000 using the director's own home as the set. The director also wrote the screenplay, and it was the first time he'd done either. But because Paranormal Activity enjoyed a tremendous grassroots fan base which demanded wider release (the publicity campaign for the movie was also utterly inspired), we're now all able to see this little film.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is filmed and told entirely from the point of view of a video camera purchased by Micah Sloat. He and his live-in girlfriend, Katie Featherston, have been experiencing some strange happenings in the middle of the night, and Micah wants to use the camera to see if there's anything really there. Micah and Katie joke about the camera and about whether or not anything's really haunting them. Even so, Katie takes things seriously enough to contact a psychic (played by Mark Fredrichs), but Micah even laughs at that.<br/><br/>The psychic doesn't think the situation is funny. In fact, he tells the couple that he's pretty sure it's not a ghost that's their problem, but something far worse. Katie is terrified, but Micah is excited. What if he can actually prove something's going on? You can almost touch his anticipation as he sets the camera up to film in their bedroom every night. But then things start to happen, and that's when even Micah realizes that the paranormal activity going on in their home is no laughing matter.<br/><br/>The story told by Paranormal Activity isn't entirely different from things we've seen or heard before, but the way it was handled was a stroke of brilliance. By letting us effectively be voyeurs in someone's home over the course of a few weeks, we're intimately involved in everything that happens. That intimacy makes every twist and turn all the more shocking.<br/><br/>Even what appears to be home video, however, wouldn't give us the sense that we know these people and are experiencing what they are if the script wasn't good. Fortunately, the script is more than good. It's completely and utterly believable. The people talk like real people, and they react like real people. There are no geniuses or heroes here, but people very much like you and me. It sounds odd, but the truth is that it's a whole lot harder to write ""reality"" than it is to write something quite a bit more fantastic, and Oren Peli did a stellar job.<br/><br/>In fairness to Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, even a great script couldn't have saved this movie if the acting was either too stiff or over dramatic. It was neither. I swear it was as if we really were spying on somebody in the privacy of their own home. If either actor had been over the top in their performance, it would likely have ruined the entire ambiance the director was trying to set. Neither did; they were perfect.<br/><br/>Oren Peli's direction was excellent. How do I know? I couldn't see his hand anywhere. Everything flowed naturally. Once again, the reality of Paranormal Activity was striking, and that can't happen without careful effort. The cinematography, while reminiscent of films that have gone before (The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield come immediately to mind), was nicely done with both stationary and hand held cameras. Finish that off with some solid edits, and you've got an independent film that's better than a whole lot of what's being put out by the major studios.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: I like horror movies, so I see a lot of them. The best ones have me jumping or cringing in my seat. But a rare and notable few have me scared not just in the theatre, but after I've left. So if you want to know if Paranormal Activity is genuinely scary, well, I'll tell you this: I did everything I could to take my mind off the movie after I saw it. I even went and saw another movie. But when I got home and got ready for bed, there was nothing I could think about or do that would convince me to turn off the light in my bedroom. Nothing. Now, how good a recommendation is that? FAMILY SUITABILITY: Paranormal Activity is rated R for language. I honestly think that it should hold an R rating for the very adult and genuinely terrifying subject matter alone! This is not a movie for those who are easily frightened, nor do I recommend you take the kids. Movie geeks and horror freaks (who know enough to realize that blood and gore does not necessarily equal horror), however, will love this one.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: None."
"jelly_belly_43","8","0","1","24 October 2009"," A really enjoyable horror film!!!
","I thought this movie was very enjoyable. Just got back from the theater and I must say it surprised me. It started slow but it kept my attention... I felt that when something happened off screen that it gave it an even more sense of horror, or rather i say suspense. I just kind of leaned in my seat impatiently awaiting to know what happened. The night time thing was a great idea! When it finally went to where they were in bed i eagerly awaited the timer at the bottom to go to real time and then watched in suspense. Also I think its the best ending since the end of ""The Mist""...<br/><br/>Personally I thought it was better then a lot of the other crap that is classified as horror nowadays and is probably the best horror film I've seen in the past few years. Was it great? No. Was it enjoyable? Very much so."
"sherwelthlangley","6","0","1","24 October 2009"," Draws on innate human terrors, but falls short
","When I first heard, by some accounts, that this was as scary or scarier than the Exorcist, I was immediately skeptical. To a degree, I hoped I was wrong, but I was not. <br/><br/>The film is shot in mockumentary style, which is a device used to boost the ""scare factor."" People are more likely to be frightened if horrific events are caught on home video. There are certainly moments that make you sit on the edge of your seat, but the actual pop-out moments are a little bit disappointing and anticlimactic. <br/><br/>Each night the couple films is supposed to get more and more frightening, which works to a degree, but that makes much of the film drawn out. The structure is lacking to a degree and parts are considerably predictable. The most frightening moments take place near the end of the movie. <br/><br/>The couple's experiences with the demon are not really consistent with what is conventionally known about demons, which raises a few eyebrows.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie does a good job of scaring most people (a girl in my theater even broke down crying afterwards) and does elicit a high suspense level, but it is by no means a great movie. The Exorcist does a better job at character development, conflict, and plot structure, which all help to boost the terror factor."

They said on the radio this is one of the scariest movies ever made and people have to request it at their local movie store to get it on DVD. I couldn't believe that so I downloaded it and gave it a watch.I know how many reviews there are on IMDb so I thought one more can't hurt. I honestly can't believe the positive reviews on this movie. It's ridiculous that people think this is the scariest movie out there and that your going to loose sleep over it. I am a horror movie buff so it does take quite a bit to scare me and this movie did get the heart racing a bit but every time the scary stuff started it let you down quickly. I don't really like the one camera view the whole movie and this movie is a documentary more then anything not an actual movie. I don't know if this is based on a true story because they dedicate the movie to the 2 main actors. If this actually happened in real life it would be terrifying but to bad this is just a movie and it's pretty boring for the most part. I won't spoil the ending but's it's pretty predicable and actually really let's you down. I did like the movie for what it was and did keep me entertained somewhat so it get's 5/10!!

","Although I was skeptical going into the theatre, I will admit that some parts were truly frightening. I understand the the idea that the ""boring"" parts are there to lull the audience into a comfort zone before inducing heart attacks when the scary stuff goes down. The problem was that this intermediate fluff comprised far too high a proportion of the total film. After a few minutes of building suspense, scary stuff should have happened. Instead, the scary stuff happened when I was already bored to the point of no return. There were only a few scenes that were extremely scary, but they were nowhere near sufficient to even consider the possibility that this is the scariest movie of all time. There was a much more horrifying scene in the recent remake of The Omen, where a mask-wearing Damien haunts the girl in the bathtub (I think while she is asleep). M. Night Shyamalan has a knack for this hard-to-describe type of horror; scenes in which not much happens but that manage to cause heart-wrenching panic in the audience. Paranormal Activity fails to accomplish this until the very end of the movie, and only barely."

"robsea32","4","0","1","23 October 2009"," Terribly disappointing movie, not scary, Blair Witch lite at best
","I was very disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>One of the big problems with this movie is that it fails to build tension. Part of the issue is that the camera is stationary for the majority of the movie -- part of what made Blair Witch so nerve wracking was the constant movement. You are constantly waiting for things to happen in Paranormal Activity instead of being assaulted by images, so by the time something actually happens it can in no way live up to the anticipation in your mind -- scene after scene the scares fell completely flat for me. I'm not one of Blair Witch projects biggest fans, but it was far scarier as a film then this film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are a lot of problems with the writing of the film. The acting is good, but the characterization is bad. The boyfriends' obsession with filming each and every event goes too far out of the realm of believability after some of the more severe events in the film occur. The movie also was annoying expository -- the characters never really engage as real people would in a situation like this and thus it seems as if they are performing all of this for the benefit of an audience. Blair Witch found a way to feel authentic but this seems terribly put on, a similar feeling I got from Cloverfied, which possess some of the same annoying traits.<br/><br/>The writing actually introduces a few ideas that would have made the film more interesting -- they allude to the idea that perhaps SHE is the demon right from the start and that instead of the ghost following her around from house to house (which is opposite of the standard rule in ghost films) that she is actually the demon and is in turn haunting him. This might explain how a picture of hers might end up in the crawlspace. This of course would have been an interesting twist, but the movie never develops it and instead suggests that it is more of standard possession, with her being taken over by an entity. It also fails to deliver on several other loose plot-lines, such as the story about the woman who experienced the same types of disturbances, along with the demonoligist, instead of fleshing these out they just abruptly cut back to more of the same shadows on the door, noises in the hall, footprints in the powder show. It gets very tedious after about 35 minutes.<br/><br/>The ending bugged me a lot as well. In a movie that resisted using any kind of obvious CGI, they clearly jazz up the ending with some computer assistance and cheapen the whole film in the process. The ending of the film is especially reminiscent of Blair Witch, with almost the same sequence of events (woman screams, man screams, silence, camera gets knocked over into a from-the-floor askew shot). Blair Witch was at least brave enough to never reveal the woman at the end of the film, where this film throws in the demon face and reduces itself to a standard run of the mill zombie flick.<br/><br/>I just found the whole thing to be a huge waste of time and not scary at all. It probably didn't help that nobody in the theater aside from a couple of 17 year old girls shrieking occasionally in the back row seemed very involved with it either. I'm impressed with the movie they made for $40,000 or whatever this movie cost, but the rave reviews seem completely unjustified in light of the rather paint-by-the-numbers film-making."

"The_Dead_See","3","0","1","23 October 2009"," Don't buy the hype. If you really want to be scared watch ""Noroi"" or ""Rec"" instead.
","Paranormal activity wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best of the ""found footage"" subgenre of horror either. And it most certainly isn't ""the scariest movie of the decade"" as I've heard claimed. It doesn't even come close to the Blair Witch Project, lacking the intelligence and the longevity of the final sequence altogether.<br/><br/>In fact, it's just a pretty average hand-held style movie with one or two creepy moments towards the end. Nothing that will keep you up (unless you only watch Dora The Explorer) and nothing particularly inspired. The acting is proficient enough and the night-time setpieces are samey but well done. It brought to mind the old BBC Ghostwatch mockumentary that was in fact much scarier. I would put this one on a par with the lower level found footage movies like ""The Last Broadcast"" or St. Francisville Experiment."" If you want to be really scared by works in this genre I recommend ""REC"" or ""Noroi: The Curse"" -- both of which leave Paranormal Activity in the dust."
"danieleclaudio","6","0","1","23 October 2009"," Haunted by the Blair Witch
","The comparison is inevitable. I think The Blair Witch Project is a better film. Way better. While Paranormal Activity was also shot as a low-budget mockumentary, the acting is so obvious that it makes it hardly believable. For instance, the trance-like state in which Katie is when Micah finds her sitting on the swing looks so fake that it is almost laughable. That is not to say that this indie flick lacks its merits, like the absence of pointless cheesy effects, but the overall scare factor is low and the suspense takes too long to develop. Also, there is no way the ""Rancho Penasquitos Police Department"" would have released the footage upon which Paranormal is based. Yes, I know we are dealing with fiction but, once the movie ends, even the more gullible should realize such impossibility.<br/><br/>It is highly advisable for those who missed Blair Witch to watch it, then they might have second thoughts about Paranormal."

Real life paranormal events, if such a thing truly exists, will not be compelled to follow a theme/plot line/ending approach as taught in drama and film schools.

"jorge-jonathan","2","0","2","23 October 2009"," Not Impressed, and a warning to all Wuss men out there
","This film is not scary. Matter a fact it's not even entertaining. One thing PA does is to prey on is our own ""fears"", ""Doubts"", ""Misconceptions"", and above our ""Ignorance."" And it does it well. <br/><br/>I was talking with a good female friend about this film telling her how dumb it was for the couple to be getting all this footage and to not be trying to get it out there, or get help in general (a psychic doesn't cut it). The fact that the woman has been tormented by this ""ghoul"" for a couple of years already, and then gets mad at her boyfriend for trying to help (Ouija Board etc. ;-) is hilarious. They should have broken up right then and there with that scene. Even with the footage of seeing it light on fire. <br/><br/>Then he gets mad at her for trying to go and find ""outside"" help (the Psychic/doctors etc.). LOL. Do we have a pattern here? Yep, it's called IGNORANCE!!!! I even love it how they mention something about Texas (stereo types anyone??)<br/><br/>Let's focus on Character development for a second. I found no reason to care for this couple. I believe the director (who wrote the script) failed greatly in getting you to really understand what it is that they were going through. I did get that they were totally helpless and pretty much had it coming to them (really, if you have footage of doors slamming and sheets moving, Ouija boards burning, and you don't go for help, or get the hell out of the house, then I have some awesome beach front property in Kansas to sell you). <br/><br/>You have a couple who lives in a house that is supposedly ""haunted."" Then you have them getting some ""amazing"" footage. With the stuff they were getting you'd think that CNN or FOX news would be at their door step cataloging their every move. Seriously, is this couple really that weird? They have no friends (aside for that one girl who comes over to talk about you guessed it...Ghosts!! lol) Do they do anything besides sit around record themselves thinking about how haunted their house is?<br/><br/>Is everyone really that bored with movies coming out that they had to latch onto this one like it was some savior of the ""scary film"" genre? <br/><br/>Seriously, for the budget it was made on I give it props but for the raves everyone is giving it (7.9!!?? LOL). The dialogue is mediocre at best and the pace moves slower than molasses. <br/><br/>How much was this film made for again? $11,000? That means that the studio can spend 20 million on advertising and still make a profit. But films like these are geared around ""word of mouth."" ;-)<br/><br/>Bravo to the director (it's like Winning the lottery, with what he just did with getting everyone to latch onto this film)<br/><br/>I'm not going to compare anything ""scare"" worthy because I don't think anything is scary anymore (everyThing has literally been over used...watch the original exorcist or rosemary's baby...and to think those movies used to be REALLY scary...now you literally fall asleep watching them...we've become desensitized...) but I will say the Blair Witch Project is still very much more original than this movie, and based around the same premise of ""it could be a true story."" <br/><br/>Hell, my female friend was even trying to convince me that PA was a true story and that it did happen etc. LOL. Is it me or do people really just want to ""believe""? <br/><br/>For reviewers to say things like ""this film physically affected me"" or ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist"" really makes me wonder if people are actually getting out and ""Living"" life to the fullest. Or is everyone just going home everyday to a lifestyle dictated around a 9-5 job they hate and a Prime Time television schedule that they somehow can't live without because they are terrified of getting out and trying new things. <br/><br/>There's one scene at the end where Micha is like ""that's it, we've gotta get out of here...blah blah blah..."" and then his girlfriend (who's supposedly being possessed by the ""demon"" is saying ""I don't want to leave, let's stay...blah blah blah..."") Though Micha is shocked that she would say this ((or is he that daft to even realize that his girlfriend has totally lost it and is psychotic herself now because of this ""demon"")) he simply says something along the lines of ""this is messed up"" and walks out of the room to allow yet another night of sleep in that house...lollollol. <br/><br/>This is one of many examples where I feel the director failed to make me believe that this was a real couple who loved and cared for each other. You have Micha who's no more than a Wuss with a dog collar around his neck beckoning to his girlfriend's every call (when she says ""jump"" he says ""how high""). And you have Katie who doesn't even know that she's in danger even though she's been getting tormented since the last house that burned down lol (typical female stereo type in all thriller/horror films). Of course they're doomed. Micha can't even choose his own tie to wear in the morning and Katie is literally sitting around waiting for a real man to show up and lead. (She does end up stabbing him, which, after all the mistakes we see him make, didn't surprise me...There's even a scene in the film where Katie asks Micha ""what are you going to do?""...I believe she asks this three or four times ;-)<br/><br/>I've decided that this film is a lesson to all men who don't know how to ""lead"" the way or really make their women feel secure and safe around them, both in the bedroom and outside the bedroom."

","I'm going to give it a 6, because I didn't find it very scary and I hated the ending (don't know which one I watched since there is an a alternative ending). However, this movie is possibly the first of its kind to approach the subject of Shadow People. I don't have any problems talking about it, but many like me do. All that is said by Katie (except the burning house) is in fact real, maybe based in someone's testimonial. There are three kinds of entities, the ""hat-man"", the ""hooded-figure"" and the ""demon from the trees"" (as I call it). Ever since I was a little boy until I was about 25 I used to see this shadowed things. However, unlike the movie, this things don't interact or speak to us, except the ""demon from the trees"", which may try in several occasions to attack us, and yes, its screams are very similar to those in the movie. I used to be scared to death of these things, until I noticed that fear is what drives them (the movie also brings this up). However, no possessions ever occurred and no photos were ever stolen. It's difficult for me to talk about this, because I always fear that they can come back. Believe it or not and I don't care, but these things exist.

","Many factors contributed to the overwhelming success of Blair Witch including marketing, writing, directing and the most crucial aspect, acting. Unfortunately the acting here is sub-par which isn't to say that the leads didn't do their jobs well but on more than one occasion, it felt like a college drama ad-lib class and having just one of those moments, let alone several, destroys any illusion that this is a real documentary. In real life, people talk over each other as they scream and argue. They do not wait for someone to finish speaking. Blair Witch knew and hit this aspect on the mark.<br/><br/>Another real deal breaker was just the immaturity of the lead characters, not to mention any real character development. I honestly got fed up with them both for being both stupid and passive and began rooting for the ghost about halfway through the film. The fact is: no one likes a weak main character in a horror film. The only thing they are good for is fodder for the baddies.<br/><br/>Finally, the pacing of the film was really poor. Sporadic moments of terror and fright that never really felt like anything was building up, especially with so much downtime and extraneous exposition in between the scares.<br/><br/>All in all, a decently creepy low budget film with good effects but substandard writing and unsympathetic, childish characters.

","Its shocking to see how many people are saying that Paranormal Activity is fantastic or, an amazing horror film or even, the scariest movie of all time. Come on! Really? What kind of standards do people use these days? Anyway, the story is the following: a couple ,Katie and Micah, move into a suburban house and after some time they become increasingly disturbed by a presence that may or may not be somehow demonic. In order to figure out what is going on Micah buys a camera which he carries around the house by day and at night sets it up in the bedroom (where most of the paranormal activity takes place) in hopes of catching something. The film is presented in a faux documentary style and it was shot exclusively by a hand-held camera and most of it takes place in this small suburban house. Despite the fact that there's only one set and two actors the film engages the viewer completely although I think either the pace was too slow or the movie was dragged out a bit. The actors did a great job as well. Now, don't get me wrong, I think the idea for this film is great and the director did a great job considering the resources he had but in regards to the ""horror"" itself, there's a couple of really scary moments but other then that, its just your average horror flick, don't think, even for a second, that this movie is terrifying or as so many here are saying, "" the scariest movie ever"".

","Paranormal Activity is a well-executed and entertaining film however it is not entirely original. It is the story of a couple who suspect there might be an evil spirit haunting their house. They decide to film the paranormal activity by using a hand-held camera. I have seen many movies about houses haunted by spirits but not one that is shot by hand-held camera in an amateur style. This makes the movie somewhat believable. But other than this idea, the film falls short of offering anything original. It has some scary moments and the suspense builds up nicely but when you get to the ending it feels like ""Blair Witch Project"" in the house. If you like ghost stories and haunted houses, I recommend my favorite movie of the genre, ""The Others""."

The house in the movie is a very typical southern California house (looks like houses on my block), and the whole movie was made for just $11,000. Yes, thousand. No missing zeros there. It's shot 'camcorder style' ala Blair Witch Project, only better (not so damn herky-jerky all of the time; they use tripods here and there). And it's not just a bunch of whiners lost in the woods, either. It's intense, yet very ordinary looking (the cast looks like they could be in the audience next to you) and claustrophobic. This one actually delivers the goods (unlike Blair Witch; I've coughed up scarier stuff than that movie)! And it's nice to see a horror film rated R that is not full awash in blood, over-the-top CGI visual effects or stitched together with hyperactive, over-stylized editing.<br/><br/>There are a few 'Exorcist' type moments here and there (thick, intense quiet broken by sudden, abrupt 'spookiness'). There are other nods to big ""E"" as well, but I don't want to give too much away. This movie is very clever in that it takes a very modern, 'un-haunted' looking home (in the 'burbs of San Diego, no less) and in the span of an hour and an half, turns it into a place of genuine dread and suspense (much as the big ""E"" did back in 1973 with an upscale house in Georgetown). With no-name actors playing the leads, it's much easier to believe in what you're seeing as well (it wouldn't work if it were Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz; it would burst the illusion right away).<br/><br/>I never jumped out of my chair or anything quite like that (and I didn't have my 'jump-meter' with me; aka as, ""my wife""), but there were many moments that I felt genuine, involuntary tingles up and down my back (and NOT from a recent backache, either). PA takes a while getting started (something else I liked about it; it builds the suspense very incrementally). And there are almost NO visual effects; it's all creaking doors, strange noises, etc. A very old- fashioned haunted house movie retooled for the Blair Witch/YouTube generation. Only this time, it really works.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how expertly this one really plays on your nerves! Clever, innovative and genuinely suspenseful. No matter how I steeled myself for the scares, the involuntary spine- tingling came on rather fast and furious. This is a very good little haunted house movie (but it needs to be seen on a movie screen; trust me on that. No matter the TV size, home video will definitely reduce it's impact). And as far as many other recent horror movies go, ""Paranormal Activity"" has almost NO obvious visual effects (and almost no gore, either), but with suspense and dread so heavy they're almost separate characters in the film! And the bedroom 'overnight' scenes are so effective, you will see them imitated en masse very soon, I predict.<br/><br/>PA is well worth checking out. In its own way, it is right up there with ""Legend of Hell House"" ""The Haunting ('63 version)"" and George C Scott's brilliant, ""The Changeling"" in that it's minimalism is the key to its success. A model of horror restraint, and yet all the more terrifying for it."
"rball41139","8","0","3","18 October 2009"," Movie was great!!!!!!!!
","Overall this movie was a great movie, it has some slow parts but when it kicks it up a notch get ready. It will have you picking the seat out of your butt. After seeing it my wife was afraid to even go to sleep, it is very disturbing of what might happen to anyone while they are in the comfort of their own bed and asleep. At the end of the movie there was a standing applause that is something I have not witnessed in a movie theater in a long time, I have to admit at times the movie made me jump and had my heart pounding and I am a horror fan through and through. If you want to go see a movie that will give you a good scare than this is it, although I do not recommend a child going and seeing this movie (if you want to be able to sleep at night) lol. This movie it a must see......."
"freaky_dave","8","0","2","17 October 2009"," Pretty good movie for Halloween
","I enjoyed Paranormal Activity, but I would not say that it is the scariest film of all time. However, it was creepy and had quite a few jump scares.<br/><br/>A young couple moves into a house where they are having nightly visits by something ghastly. THe guy Micah decides to tape it and see what is happening, and Katie (the girl) agrees at first, but as the events become worse she becomes more disagreeable. THe events escalate as the movie goes on, and everything leads to a disturbing ending which was a little too predictable given the circumstances, but it still worked pretty good. I of course will not give anything away.<br/><br/>Made on a budget of only 15,000 dollars, the movie surprises. Once again the less you see is always much scarier then when you see too much. It is a lot like THe Blair Witch Project without the nauseating feel of a moving camera that some people complained about with that film. THe camera does move some, but not enough to cause any stomach problems associated with movies like this which have a documentary style.<br/><br/>THe two actors, who have barely any experience as actors, are pretty good and actually have chemistry. I enjoyed it, and it is a real good movie to see during Halloween which is only two weeks away. It is definitely much better than any of the Saw sequels which are basically the same exact thing with lots of gore minus the scares.<br/><br/>It may not be the scariest movie of all time, there are quite a few other films scarier, but it was creepy and disturbing in its own right. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to be scared, and when I say scared I don't me just grossed out."
"xjuteveux","9","0","2","17 October 2009"," Better then the Blair witch...depending...
","This movie has been compared to the Blair Witch Project due its ""real life, hand held cam-corder"" scenario. I remember when I first watched that movie, I was in 7th grade and my sister was like ""mom would be so pi**ed if she knew I let you watch it."" Not only was it the least scary movie I had ever seen, it was unrealistic. Although I saw it in the middle of the day on DVD.<br/><br/>Paranormal activity is definitely a movie you need to see in theaters. Everyone can relate to hearing a strange noise, a creek in the house or that bump in the night. This movie takes it to a whole different level. Its in this way that the movie makes it more relate-able to the audience then movies of its kind in the past. Its this relate-ability that makes the movie more creepy, as opposed to outright scary. Its the things you don't see rather then what you do that will freak you out the most. The movie makes you feel safe in the day time scenes, and dread bed time, because you know something strange is about to happen. It keeps you in anticipation throughout the whole movie, and makes you genuinely concerned for the main character's welfare toward the end.<br/><br/>The downsides to this movie is that its a little predictable. During the middle of the movie I could already tell how it was going to end, but it was still chilling to say the least. The only thing I would change is to have more of a build-up for the end.<br/><br/>Don't go into this movie expecting blood and gore and people hacking each other up. And please, do this movie justice and see it in theaters, so you don't have the same tragic perspective like I did with the Blair witch project."
"kjt92840","9","0","2","17 October 2009"," A Fun Suspenseful Movie!
","This is an amazing film, that unfortunately has been hyped up to much that it will get tons of hate. If you can get past that and enjoy the for what it is, you will find yourself having a fun scary time.<br/><br/>This film has good character development(especially for a horror movie). It is also laid out very well. The scenes that occur during day time are vital for what is going to be in store for the couple that night. There is also some very funny lines in the movie, Micah was hilarious (also a bad ass).<br/><br/>I'm not going to give you a run down of the film and let you know what its about because its been said a million times. But I will let you know that its not the scary film of all time but it is a good scare. It has its moments that will creep you out beyond belief and just want to cry. The last 20 minutes or so will have you stuck in your seat with your mouth dropped in disbelief. It's a great little cult film that will have it strong fans that will defend it and the haters that will go to the end of the earth to make those who love it hate it. But see it and have a good fun time. I'm sure what the director wanted in the first place!"
"Abztrakt","9","0","2","16 October 2009"," Genius.
","Very seldom do I walk out of a theater, and actually talk about the film. Me being a move mogul makes it hard for me to appreciate a film for every attribute. This film got under my skin. It starts out slow, like every other horror movie, and just builds up, but you can feel something different. The build up isn't like a typical thriller or horror, it just builds and builds until the powerful ending comes into play.<br/><br/>Acting: Very well done. Directing: Phenomenal Art of Photography: Very well presented.<br/><br/>It's almost impossible to fully explain how this movie left such a mark, but I'll try. This film takes the 'life after death' take, and makes it something fresh and creepy. Documenting the decay of moralities and personal psyches'. This is a film that had me held in shock and awe from the beginning to the abrupt and rather disturbing ending.<br/><br/>I'm not easy to scare, but when I came home, I was looking over my shoulder and listening carefully for anything that was out of place. The nightmare feeling that this film leaves is unprecedented, it's very top of the line, and it's a feeling that I never get from films anymore, so, I would consider this film one of the best of it's times. And to shorten it into smaller terms, picture this film as ""The Blair Witch Project"" if it waited a few more years before release, and if it was directed by someone with a little more experience.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended for anyone."
"grlady2908","6","0","2","16 October 2009"," Funny, slightly scary, ruined by hype
","This was a pretty good movie but the thrill and fear of it was absolutely RUINED by all the hype. When you imagine a movie to be so scary because you hear people telling you they are having nightmares? You go in expecting to much and walk away with too little. I am the BIGGEST chicken in terms of scary movies and this movie barely scared me.The night time scenes were VERY brief and daytime scenes too long and drawn out and more comedy then anything. Hard to really be scared by a few 5-15 seconds night time clips in between long dialogue filled days. Don't get me wrong, the concept was pretty genius. It's original and something that can't be done again. It was funnier than I expected but wasn't looking for a comedy. Almost ZERO visual effects. Every scary scene could have been done by a buddy of theirs hired to pull sheets off the bed or bang on the wall etc. etc. etc. I would watch it again but only for entertainment, not to be scared."
"landindonner","6","0","2","15 October 2009"," I don't want my money back, but would have been better on DVD
","I had a couple of issues with the film. 1. One point docked for being similar to the Blair Witch Project. I realize BWP was 10 years ago and it is a good time to get a new 18-30 crowd a fauxumentary scare, but the concept cant get bonus points as a lot of comments are suggesting. 2. I full disagree with most comments about the performances. The girl being so ""scared"" never shed a tear. There was a key semi-closeup where she was sitting on the bed and appeared to be crying. Her eyes were dry and then she started wiping. Also, she wore a bra constantly. No girl wears a bra to bed in a cohabitative relationship. The male lead also wasn't genuinely callous, brave, concerned, or vulnerable. If I saw what he saw on screen, I would be either really scared and showing false bravado, or outwardly confrontational. 3. there were a lot of scenes filmed by the couple during this ordeal that were unnecessary. like sitting at the kitchen counter discussing nothing. at least BWP seemed like edited reels of ""found"" footage. There was no other reason for these scenes other than to bridge the paranormal scenes.<br/><br/>With all that said, the creepy scenes are creepy. Especially the scenes of objects being moved by invisible forces.<br/><br/>I think it would be much more fun/scarier watching it next Halloween, with all the lights off, in your own house, with your significant other. No need to see it in the theatre"
"Roadwarrior85846","5","0","2","13 October 2009"," A good movie but I was expecting to be more scarier
","The movie, Paranormal Activity, is about a boyfriend and a girlfriend, Katie and Micah, taking footage around the house studying some...paranormal activity! But what makes this movie a lot more interesting is that this thing that is haunting poor Katie has been stalking her since she was a child. But according to a psychic, this isn't an ordinary ghost. It's a demon. Ooooohhhh now we're getting somewhere!<br/><br/>Parnormal Activity has its few jumps and shocking scenes but most of the film had.....comedy? What I mean is that the character Micah is not afraid of the demon and constantly mocks it in the most idiotic ways. If Micah was more serious and frightened like his girlfriend, Katie, it could have been better. In my opinion, he pretty much killed the movie. <br/><br/>For the jump scenes, it kind of feels that you know it's coming because before it comes, you'll hear rumbles and thumps. If they took those two sound effects out and just let the ""jump"" happened in full volume, I would have crapped my pants. Sadly none of the ""jump"" scenes didn't scare me.<br/><br/>The scenes that kind of freaked me out this most is when Katie gets out of the bed in the middle of the night and just stares at Micah for hours. To me, that is a little bit freaky. But everything else is all mild.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is good but not scary enough. Everybody is saying ""its the new Blair Witch Project,"" but to me, this movie didn't top the Blair Witch. To be honest, I jumped more from Drag Me to Hell than Paranormal Activity. My advice, go and watch the movie, enjoy it, but I'm warning you that you WILL sleep like baby after you watch this film."

","""Paranormal Activity"" is the little movie that snuck into town in October of 2009 and made everyone pee their pants. I saw it with a fairly large audience and I suggest you do the same because audience reaction is a big park of this movie's experience.<br/><br/>The movie starts fairly slowly as we are introduced to Micah and Katie, a young couple living together in a house in San Diego. Nice house, even has a pool. He's a day trader and she's a student. He's kind of immature and full of himself. She's introspective.<br/><br/>As everyone knows by now, this is a ""found footage"" movie a la ""Blair Witch Project"" as we see what Micah's video camera picks up over the course of several days as he tries to document the ghost or demon that has been bothering Katie since she was 8.<br/><br/>The camera rolls while they sleep and we see little things. A door moves a couple inches. Another night, a light goes on the hallway, then goes out. Then, more happens. A whole lot more.<br/><br/>The movie is almost entirely Micah and Katie. She has a girlfriend who drops in. They invite a ghostbuster-type psychic, who totally wimps out and hightails it.<br/><br/>The movie has a kind of pulse â€” safety during the daytime awake scenes, followed by excruciating tension during the sleeping scenes when you have no idea what you will see or hear.<br/><br/>Whatever is haunting Katie is attached to her, not the house. So moving would not solve the problem. As the movie progresses, fear turns to terror and she becomes all but immobilized.<br/><br/>As the jump moments built and built, the audience moaned and yipped. A few screamed out loud. The final 10 minutes had them gripping their armrests.<br/><br/>I have learned that three different endings were shot. No doubt they will be included in the DVD. As for the one used, it delivered the movie's biggest shock and it sure worked for me.<br/><br/>As we filed out of the theater, one teenage girl, visibly rattled, said she was sure she would not be able to sleep that night.<br/><br/>This is an instant classic, destined to take a place at or near the top of the list of the most frightening movies ever made."
"skeletonman13","10","0","4","11 October 2009"," Without a doubt one of the scariest movies of the past 10 years
","Every time you see a preview for a movie that says that ""this is the scariest movie of the last (enter # of years here) years"" But this is actually a movie that lives up to that title.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity is without a doubt one of the scariest movies of the past decade. It is absolutely terrifying, and after initial viewing, i promise you, that you will have lots of trouble sleeping after watching it.<br/><br/>The movie taps into one of those primal fears of what goes on in your house at night, that creepy feeling that someone is watching you, seeing that big shadow on the wall thats not yours, and the fear of ghosts/demons.<br/><br/>The movie is really a great horror film, following in the tradition of the original ""The Hauting"" and ""The Exorcist"" this film is a perfect mix of the two films with a little ""Blair Witch Project"" mixed in. There is no blood/gore, no sex/nudity. Just a great horror film that pulls out all the stop to scare you without showing anything.<br/><br/>Paranormal Activity starts very slow, but within roughly the first 20 mins into the first night scene you will be creeped out immediately. The ending is also one of the major part of the movie that has still be burned into my memory since I saw it on Friday, today is Sunday. I'm not as much trouble falling asleep but it still is somewhat hard to every time this film floats though my head.<br/><br/>I urge you to see this in the movie theater, where it is much better (though it also depends if your audience is well behaved and quite) see this film with an audience is the most enjoyable and terrifying experiences I've ever had in a movie theater.<br/><br/>When i saw this on Friday, it was still limited midnight releases, but when i got home i read that Paranormal Activity had passed the 1,000,000 point and is now getting a wide release to all theaters this Friday.<br/><br/>You should really catch this in the theater if you can, trust me it will be all worth it. Paranormal Activity is really one the scariest movies of the past 10 years that i would rank up there with the original ""The Hauting"", ""The Exorcist"", and other horror classics. I give a perfect 10 stars."
"moviemanMA","8","0","2","9 October 2009"," Scary is scared of this movie
","Before tonight, I can say that I have never seen a person run out of a movie screaming. After tonight, I can say I have.<br/><br/>I think that sums up the feeling of Paranormal Activity. This film follows in the same style of film-making as Cloverfield and Quarantine using hand-held cameras by the actors themselves to give the audience the feeling that this is actually happening. To say that this film didn't scare me would be a lie. I wasn't the one running and screaming out of the theater, but I was among the vast majority of the audience who was on edge ready to jump at the fall of a hat.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 2006 (it was probably filmed around this time because it was entered in some festivals in 2007). The main characters Micah and Katie live together in a nice home where for a while they have been experiencing strange occurrences in the night like footsteps, banging on the walls, and voices. Micah gets a video camera to document the situation. This is where we jump right in.<br/><br/>Katie has been troubled by this since she was a little child. Apparently it has followed her back. It is quite evident that whatever has come into the house is not welcome. Every night Micah sets up the camera in the bedroom and records to see if he can catch the ""haunt"" in the act.<br/><br/>Little by little we see this happy couple become pestered, tormented, and pushed to the limit. Micah's camera is our only source of evidence (and the only camera filming) and we see it all. This film really does crawl under your skin. Micah and Katie act as realistic as possible given the circumstances they are presented with. The actors names are actually Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston. They are really the only people in the film with a few friends and the help of a psychic.<br/><br/>This film succeeds mainly because of the mood filmmaker Oren Peli creates. We are given a nice back story for these characters and we feel for them. It's almost like watching a home movie. This realistic effect enhances the supernatural aspect of the story, making every bump in the night and strange occurrence that much more believable.<br/><br/>Even with the low budget, guerrilla style film-making, the effects are excellent. There is no music in the film, one thing that most good horror films don't use. Silence is the ultimate suspense enhancer. If you can cut the sound, make your audience lean in a little, and then blow them away with a scare, you have won them over. There are several times where this is achieved either by showing something or not showing something. Anticipation and just the waiting for something to happen makes the scare element extremely potent.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film lag a bit, but it only adds to the home movie aspect of the story. It can't be scary the entire time otherwise the suspense wouldn't be there. We are never sure where we are going to go. Every time we fade to the couple in bed we know that something is going to happen. We see the bed, the door, parts of the dark hallway, but other than that we are given very little and we have to wait and see what happens next.<br/><br/>Writing about this film is giving me the chills. I would be lying if I said I haven't looked over my shoulder once or twice. This was a good old fashioned scare-a-thon with a lot of thrills and plenty of chills. I am very impressed with this first feature by Peli. Tremendous job and a complete success. He achieved exactly what he aimed for: to scare the pants off of people."
