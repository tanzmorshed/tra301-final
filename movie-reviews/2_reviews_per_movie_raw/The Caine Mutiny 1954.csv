"theowinthrop","10","77","97","9 October 2005"," Ironically, our Navy's best remembered ""mutiny""
","Historically there were two great United States Naval mutinies. In 1842 a naval sloop, the U.S.S. Somers, had a court martial for three crew members (one, Midshipman Philip Spencer, was the son of Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer), which ended with their being found guilty and hanged. To this day there is debate if Spencer (a troubled youth) was even serious about seizing the ""Somers"". The other occurred in 1944 at Port Chicago, California, when, a few weeks after a terrible accident that killed many men loading ammunition on a boat, their replacements refused to work under existing unsafe conditions. This led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision - against the workers, who claimed they were not under military law. <br/><br/>But the best known mutiny in the American navy is that on the U.S.S. Caine, during the hurricane that preceded the battle of Okinawa. That this is a fictional mutiny does not seem to attract any attention. THE CAINE MUTINY was a successful novel, Broadway play (""THE CAINE MUTINY COURT MARTIAL"") and a great movie. It remains the American equivalent of the mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty.<br/><br/>The performances of the leads, Bogart, Johnson, MacMurray (his second of three great heels), Ferrer, Tully, and E.G.Marshall are all first rate, as are the supporting cast (which includes Lee Marvin, Claude Atkins, and Jerry Paris - all of whom had quite substantial careers after this film). Only Robert Francis did not have a substantial career after his fine Ensign Keith - he died in a plane crash in 1955.<br/><br/>There are mental images from the film (mostly connected to Bogart's Queeg) that people remember - even spoof. Every time you see some character showing nervous ticks, if he or she pulls out a pair of small metal balls and roll them in their hand, it is a salute to Bogie's originally doing it in THE CAINE MUTINY. And his magnificent moment of success: ""the strawberries"", and how he proved the theft with geometric precision, remains a signal that the person speaking has too many fixations.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film makes Queeg better (if still sick) than the play does. When cross examined by Greenwald at the court martial of Maryk and Keith, Queeg is asked about whether or not he overused his right to free transport of liquor and other items from Hawaii to the mainland from the navy. Queeg at first denies it, but when Greenwald says he can bring in (as witnesses) people connected with the sale of the items and the transport of them, Queeg suddenly remembers that he might have. This is not in the film, but it shows that Queeg was not all that clean an officer.<br/><br/>That aside, the impact of the film is still terrific half a century after it was shot. It illustrates that personality flaws frequently causes the problems that affect all of us, and that we need more understanding of each other's problems to avoid the bigger ones. From a case of over-extended battle fatigue, the crew of a warship are driven to accept an act of mutiny against it's captain in an emergency situation. And it almost gets two officers disgraced or hanged."
"drdcw","8","85","113","23 March 2002"," Bogart and MacMurray shine in this adaptation of Herman Wouk's masterpiece.
","Great novels often disappoint when brought to the screen, but superior acting performances make The Caine Mutiny a classic on its own merits.<br/><br/>The movie takes place on a destroyer-minesweeper in the Pacific during World War II.  To the consternation of the Caine's crew, a popular captain (Tom Tully) is replaced by a disturbed despot named Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), who finds himself in over his head.  As the stresses of command multiply, Queeg's paranoia and cowardice soon become apparent to Lieutenant Thomas Keefer (Fred MacMurray), a writer in civilian life.  Keefer continually tries to convince Executive Officer Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) that Queeg is insane, but Keefer won't help Maryk when the Exec asks Keefer to help convince higher authority that Queeg should be relieved.  During a typhoon, Queeg's poor seamanship nearly capsizes the Caine; Maryk relieves him by reason of insanity and saves the ship.  Maryk and Willie Keith (Robert Francis), Officer of the Deck when Queeg is relieved, stand trial for mutiny.  They are reluctantly defended by Lt Barney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer), who must expose Queeg's mental illness to save the defendants. In so doing Greenwald forces the Caine's officers to examine their own motives regarding their roles in Queeg's relief and their lack of loyalty to him.<br/><br/>Bogart is brilliant, giving the greatest performance of his career, his quirky mannerisms and tortured demeanor contrasting starkly with his usual roles.  MacMurray is superb as the glib slippery novelist who must eventually deal with his own cowardice, more damning than Queeg's because of his intelligence and insight.  Johnson plays Maryk more timidly than he appears in the book, to the detriment of the movie.  Ferrer gives a solid performance.  Tully excels as the crusty Capt DeVriess, Queeg's predecessor.<br/><br/>The weakest part of Wouk's book is the largely irrelevant romance between Willie Keith and a nightclub singer of whom his wealthy mother disapproves. Unhappily this vapid subplot finds its way into the movie, serving only to reveal Francis and his love interest May Wynn as lousy actors whose mercifully brief cinematic careers were well deserved.  Important character developments in the novel could have been included instead of this unnecessary pap.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, The Caine Mutiny is a must see for serious movie fans. Bogart and MacMurray give performances which remain fresh and compelling with every viewing of the film.  You can't ask more from an actor than that."
"perfectbond","9","62","82","25 February 2003"," Outstanding film
","The Caine Mutiny works well on so many levels. It is a great insight into navy life, a first rate legal drama, and an unforgettable character study. Jose Ferrer and Fred MacMurray are superb, and indeed so is the entire cast, but the film clearly belongs to Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg. It's a real treat to see 'Bogie' in a film where he isn't a gangster or a romantic with a gruff exterior. Bogart spectacularly conveys the sheer complexity of his character: the quirks, the devotion to duty, the demand for perfection, the refusal to accept his own fallibility. It is a truly exceptional performance. Strongly recommended, 9/10."

","Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) was simply a man who had seen too much of war With the excitable tendency of rolling a pair of steel balls in his hand, he censures the error of incorrectness on everything but himself falling as an easy victim to the intrigues of self-serving officers who felt that their panicked captain is mentally not suitable to command the ship <br/><br/>A subplot, seeming to lack common sense, between two young lovers (Robert Francis and May Wynn) only served to lessen the concentration and distract our attention from the real story Also, at the court-martial, a long trial sequence, was clearly anticlimactic, though it included the film's most tense and unforgettable scene, that of Queeg disintegrating as he pronounced his statement <br/><br/>But we had noticed it all before, after all, aboard the Navy destroyer, the U.S.S. Caine We had seen Queeg as a strict disciplinarian and a compulsive, unstable commander, earning, in his limited imagination, the total disregard of both officers and crew So we knew what would occur when he got on the witness stand <br/><br/>""The Caine Mutiny"" is a splendid character study, a tale of bravery and cowardice at odds with one another The film received seven Academy Award nominations included one to Humphrey Bogart who delivered a terrific performance"
"Doylenf","Null","27","35","15 April 2001"," Bogie loses his marbles...the strawberries are missing!
","Humphrey Bogart received an Oscar nomination for 'The Caine Mutiny' as the eccentric Captain Queeg who finally collapses under pressure. The story leading up to his downfall is an engrossing one--and more complex than any surface description can convey. That's what makes this such a fascinating movie. Nothing is what it seems. No character is painted in black or white strokes--but beneath the surface lies deception, especially in Lt. Keefer (Fred MacMurray). Usually a lightweight actor, MacMurray delivers one of the film's craftiest performances. So does Van Johnson as the decent executive officer who takes over the controls when Queeg snaps. As many have pointed out, the only true weakness of the film is the attention given to a budding romance between Robert Francis and May Wynn which does nothing to advance the plot. The complex drama ends with a stunning courtroom scene in which Jose Ferrer gets a chance to do some heavy emoting. Max Steiner's score includes a jaunty, catchy main theme but is otherwise not one of his most interesting scores. An excellent film that makes you think how things might have been if--if only...but then there would have been no story. All in all, quite an achievement, well worth your time. The book by Herman Wouk was worth reading too."
"moonspinner55","7","26","34","26 August 2007"," Conflicted emotions and loyalties, a conflicted captain, and a conflicted movie...
","Director Edward Dmytryk and screenwriter Stanlet Roberts, adapting Herman Wouk's novel, certainly didn't set out to make an anti-Navy movie concerning a junkyard Naval ship beset with a paranoid captain, and indeed their ""simple"" dedication at the end is to the entire United States Navy, yet the plot mechanisms are slanted in that direction even if the handling is not. Beginning the picture with a green ""Princeton tiger"" and Naval Academy grad attempting to woo a band singer before duty calls was a safe, stolid move, yet Wouk's story manages to cut much wider and deeper than the Hollywood generalities, and once his plot gets cooking the film is vastly entertaining. Humphrey Bogart is the new by-the-books captain aboard a Naval bottom-feeder, quickly driving his crew and his vessel into the ground with his idiosyncratic behavior. Dymtryk is careful while introducing all the different personalities aboard ship, and he doesn't want us to miss a trick, yet in the film's final stages (after the court martial, when defense attorney José Ferrer has his say), the tone of the picture does an about-face and hopes to show us all sides of the situation. The filmmakers want to have their cake and eat it too, and the resulting epilogue goes down like bad medicine. Still, the performances are first-rate, particularly by Bogart and, in perhaps his finest acting turn, Van Johnson. *** from ****"
"hitchcockthelegend","9","11","13","4 March 2008"," Powerhouse Bogart in powerhouse drama...eventually.
","The striking thing about the film to me was that it starts out seemingly as a jovial piece, it's light hearted in structure for the first third but then we are introduced to Humphrey Bogart's Captain Phillip Queeg and things start to change rather dramatically. Capatain Queeg takes command of the USS Caine and promptly tries to whip the shoddy (had it good for too long) crew into shape, but soon the cracks start to appear in the Captain's persona, and during a violent storm the crew decide enough is enough.<br/><br/>Adapted from Herman Wouk's much lauded page turner, The Caine Mutiny triumphs in spite of its flaws because it lulls you in craftily to then unleash quality drama in the form of Bogart's quite brilliant performance as Queeg. It's a class show from Bogart as he plays out the various forms of sanity with terrific results. Backed up by Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer and Van Johnson the film isn't found wanting for acting gravitas, sadly the direction from Edward Dmytryk does plod at the times when the film cries out for impetus, and a romantic subplot involving Robert Francis's Ens. Willis Seward Keith has no right to be here, since it really is a waste of time. Yet they are forgivable flaws, for this be a cracking picture that is essential for Bogart purists, and essential viewing for those interested in a quality story telling up there on the screen. 9/10"

","Having served in the U.S. Navy for 32 years, I can accurately state that many of the characters and situations depicted in Wouk's book and in the film are all very real.... from the fresh faced Ensign Keith assuming the outboard ship was the Caine, to getting blown off his feet by the shocking sound of a steam whistle, to the SNAFU of attempting to stream sweeping gear, to Queeq's introductory monologue in the wardroom, and thousands of other details. To those of you who assume that men of the likes of Queeg, Maryk, Keefer, Keith, DeVries and others just couldn't exist in the USN, you need to enlist, go to sea, and experience the smell of cabbages and stack gas for yourself. Or take my word for it!"
"zwrite2","7","12","15","17 September 2007"," Flawed movie, but some very gripping scenes
","Humphrey Bogart's performance in ""The Caine Mutiny"" was the second-best of his career. Only his performance in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" one of Hollywood's best-ever, was better. And, yes, I did watch ""Casablanca.""<br/><br/>Bogart's outstanding acting makes the movie's gripping scenes even more compelling. The best scene is his falling apart on the witness stand  a sort of subdued version of Jack Nicholson's memorable breakdown in ""A Few Good Men."" The other great scenes were when Van Johnson takes over command of the ship as Bogart vacillates during a typhoon and the hunt for the missing strawberries.<br/><br/>Throughout ""Caine,"" the writers do a good job of showing how Bogart's Captain Queeg is an incompetent officer and one of those petty jerks everybody hates  a compulsive authoritarian who tries to make up for his lack of substance by focusing on rules so he is always right and everyone else is wrong.<br/><br/>The confrontation between Bogart and his subordinates, the disputes between the officers about what to do about Queeg, the transformation of the Van Johnson character, and the canniness and cowardice of the Fred MacMurray character are also positive elements in the movie.<br/><br/>All this makes the ending absolutely infuriating. Jose Ferrer's speech is beyond ludicrous. It's based on two premises  MacMurray was the brains behind the mutiny and the mutiny was unjustified. Half the movie is about MacMurray laying the groundwork for the mutiny so Ferrer's conclusion is news only to himself.<br/><br/>The second premise is just dumb. Bogart had acted incompetently and cowardly at sea twice before the typhoon  and blamed others for his mistakes. Ferrer's declaration that Johnson would not have had to act against Bogie during the typhoon if officers had months earlier accepted their captain's plea for help  and Johnson agreeing with Ferrer  makes no sense. Lives were in danger during the typhoon. Period.<br/><br/>The conclusion has the stench of U.S. Navy censorship.<br/><br/>I noticed that many IMDb posters rip the romance between the young officer and his girlfriend. This is interesting since there are countless 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s movies with unconvincing romances that appear to be patronizing attempts to win over female viewers, and many of those romances are barely criticized.<br/><br/>The romance in this movie is less distracting and time-consuming than many others. At least I can see what the writers were trying to do  make us interested in the young officer so we viewers care about what happens to him later on. This works up to a point. It ultimately does NOT work -- not because the romance is uninteresting, but because the officer's character is NOT developed. He is an uninteresting observer for most of ""Caine,"" and he is a milquetoast when he takes stands on principle later in the film.<br/><br/>Robert Francis' lack of development in ""Caine"" compares unfavorably to the transformations of Jack Lemmon and Charlie Sheen in ""Mister Roberts"" and ""Platoon."" It doesn't help that Francis is not a good actor.<br/><br/>The writers should have spent more time developing Francis' character instead of using 35 minutes before Bogart enters the movie or they should have downplayed Francis and focused on Van Johnson instead.<br/><br/>I gave ""Caine"" a 7.<br/><br/>ZWrite<br/><br/>P.S. -- By the way, nominating the actor who played Queeg's predecessor instead of MacMurray for a Best Supporting Oscar is preposterous."

","My memories of this film are formed from a long time ago. I was about 10 or eleven when I first saw this film and my impressions of it have never changed from that day to this. In my opinion it is probably one of the best films ever made. From the opening sequence to the last frame , it is a gripping tale of how humans react when under intense pressure and when lives are a stake. I feel that Humphrey Bogart's performance underlines the ongoing brilliance of this incredible actor, he plays this part to perfection. It is worth noting that compared to modern movies of the same genre, it is hard to find a performance that stands up to Bogart's skill in this role. I actually preferred this role to his generally acknowledged high in Casablanca! I cannot leave this short review without mentioning Jose Ferrer's supporting role as the Naval Defense lawyer. Quite simply it was and remains masterful - a consummate performance! I highly recommend this movie and would expect that it is in the top 100 movies ever made."

","In what would be one of Humphrey Bogart's last motion pictures before his death in 1957, one of the most sterling actors of all time gives a poignant and most memorable performance as a lonely, broken commander of a naval mine-sweeping ship who desperately seeks the acceptance and loyalty of his otherwise uncaring, subordinate officers.<br/><br/>The perpetrator of this treachery is the Communications Officer, Lt Tom Keefer (Fred MacMurray). A cynical know-it-all who actually knows nothing, he plots a course of deception and cowardice to convince Captain Queeg's first officer, Lt Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) to believe that the Captain is unstable and that he (Maryk) should step in and ""relieve"" the Captain of his duties. The first officer tells Lt Keefer in no uncertain terms that he will not be a party to his suggestions, but only after several unsavory incidents from the Captain, does he take Lt Keefers suggestions to heart.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ensign Willis Keith (Robert Francis), a Princeton graduate is emotionally involved not only with the affairs on ship, but with a pretty night club singer, May Wynn (her name in real life). Through out the movie, at least where ""Willie"" is concerned, its a see-saw scenario between military protocol and romance. Add to this the obsessive, compulsive nature of Willie's mother and things become very interesting.<br/><br/>This motion picture differs in most in the fact that it has two climaxes which work together. The typhoon and the court martial. These two integral elements help explain the other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Herman Wouk and directed by Edward Dmytryk (Till The End Of Time, The Young Lions) The Caine Mutiny bridges the gap between staunch patriotism and heart felt emotion. It is by far Humphrey Bogart's last tribute to the motion picture industry and everyone who loved him.<br/><br/>(Special note: Almost everyone, as of this writing, who appeared in this motion picture has passed away except for Van Johnson, who will turn 89 late this summer. Robert Francis who played Willis Keith, died in a plane crash not long after this film was made)."

They would rather watch those two movies on television than drink or listen to music.  <br/><br/>""The Caine Mutiny"" is one of the best ensemble movies ever made; also, it is the last great war movie.  Back in the studio days in Hollywood, you could afford to have many top leading actors in one movie.  All the actors gave great performances in this movie, but the actors Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson, Tom Tully, and Robert Francis gave their best performances. <br/><br/>
Humphrey Bogart gave a performance that was totally unlike himself.  Most of his performances were part of his colorful personality.  In ""The Caine Mutiny"", he was nothing like the paranoid Navy captain.  Fred MacMurray plays another great heel, and Jose Ferrer plays another heroic, dashing guy. <br/><br/>The Academy Awards should have an award for best ensemble acting.  ""The Caine Mutiny"" would have won that award hands down!"
"Arthur21743","6","13","19","15 September 2006"," A Movie As Schizophrenic As Its Antagonist
","This movie is about the ravages of war and what it can do to a man under the strain of combat.<br/><br/>But much more than that it is an indictment of an armed service that remained in denial when it had a problem until forced to deal with it, and then treated the ones who brought the problem to light as the enemy. In other words, the old ""Shoot the Messenger"" mentality.<br/><br/>The details: A ship's captain snaps and has a nervous breakdown at a crucial time. A junior officer relieves him of command in order to save the ship and the lives of all aboard. A company of three of the captain's junior officers had previously gone to speak to the admiral about the captain's bizarre behavior and then one of them backed out. He was made to look gutless and yellow for doing so, but he was really just being practical. He recognized the futility of trying to tell a system that operates in denial -- where covering things up when they portray the system in a bad light is SOP -- that they have a problem.<br/><br/>The attorney for the accused put on a competent defense and then spat venom at his client after he got him declared not guilty of mutiny. How dare he shame the nice war-hero captain who had done so much for his country! See? If they had just let the captain sink his own ship then he and they would have been dead war heroes and everybody involved would have been properly mourned and remembered. This way they had to deal with the reality of one of their heroes having lost it because he couldn't take the pressure.<br/><br/>I sat there at the end of this movie and wondered if this movie was as schizoid as its antagonist. The subordinate officer followed the rules according to Article 1088, was later vindicated, and the movie called his actions ""Mutiny"". What was the message? Follow the rule book and relieve a senior officer when he shows mental incompetence and you deserve to be judged a rat fink later? Hardly a recruiting technique designed to attract the finest to the service of their country, is it?<br/><br/>In the end this movie deals -- whether consciously or unconsciously -- with the age-old conflict in the mindset of the military armed services: Do they put the country first, or the service itself? It's a balancing act that will always go on in a free society, where a country's domestic enemies are the most dangerous and insidious of all.<br/><br/>We need our finest at the helm -- the ones who aspire to high command for the most noble and unselfish of motives. And we need armed services that deserve such a class of men and women. Insofar as The Caine Mutiny depicts reality in the armed services, we have a ways to go."
"AlsExGal","9","8","11","2 July 2016"," A psychological drama that begs the question - who is the real villain here?
","In the 1950's films about the problems that you encounter during wartime that have nothing to do with the enemy itself began to appear. This was one of the best. WWII threw all kinds of people together from all walks of life. There were the core career Navy along with the many who were drafted into the service because of the war, maybe disrupting plans, but they planned to make the best of it.<br/><br/>This is the situation on the USS Caine. A new captain arrives, Lt. Commander Philip Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), professional navy man. At first, it just looks like the captain is a strong advocate of discipline, something the Caine has apparently not had much of up to this time. But then he starts seeing things that aren't there - like insisting that a man in the distance isn't properly dressed for a drill - the officers look and see that he is. He does things that indicate he could be paranoid, and that being under the strain of wartime he could have lost his nerve OR he could just be a captain that likes strict discipline. The truth would be in the eye of the beholder. You don't want to be an officer on the Caine arguing point A if the person you are making your argument to is an admiral that sees point B and believes you are just a whiner, or worse, a mutineer.<br/><br/>In the midst of this are the ship's three officers. The instigator that brings about the eventual mutiny is Tom Keefer (Fred McMurray), who was a writer in peacetime. He tries to convince Lt. Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) as well as the young Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis), that the captain is mentally ill, headed for a breakdown, and possibly taking the ship with him. Keith is easily swayed by his older fellow officers, just a high society college guy who has always done what mama told him to do. Maryk is the most independent minded of the three, most interested in doing what is right. So when Queeg seems to lose his nerve in a typhoon and refuses to give an order that will save the ship, Maryk takes in all he has been fed by Keefer, considers the situation, and takes control of the Caine based on navy regulations that are germane if the captain is incapacitated. Only thing is, the captain hasn't been shot or taken physically ill, and Maryk and Keith are put on trial for mutiny before a court martial. Keefer has managed to play both sides of this and stay safely out of harm's way, having never voiced his opinions of the captain in front of anybody but Maryk and Keith.<br/><br/>Second billed Jose Ferrer, who doesn't appear until the last part of the movie, earns his second billing as the navy attorney who is disgusted by his clients, yet agrees to take the case. It's a tricky business proving innocence in this case, because he is not allowed to directly attack the integrity of Queeg, because that is an infraction of naval law in itself. And on terra firma, Captain Queeg no longer feels the pressure he did at sea and is particularly charming and articulate. What's worse, Keefer is looking after his own neck and throws Maryk and Keith under the bus to save himself when on the stand. How will this all turn out? Watch and find out.<br/><br/>Just an aside, a few people have said that the bit about Keith and his girl are just padding. I beg to differ. It shows that in spite of being head over heels in love, Keith does not have the nerve to stand up to his mother and tell her. If Keith can't stand up to mom, what chance would he have with Keefer? He was a follower in the first degree.<br/><br/>Bogart was great here as a guy who is supposed to be the villain in a way, but has a completely sympathetic part. As Ferrer's character points out, when everyone else was all tucked away safe in their beds, it was people like Queeg that kept the navy going in peacetime, before the war. The scene before the mutiny where Queeg basically goes to the ship's other officers for help after he realizes he is so strongly disliked and comes up empty adds further sympathy and thus ambiguity to his part.<br/><br/>This is great storytelling about a group of people who have nothing in common brought together to fight a war which in this case yields tragic results. In other words, it is very realistic. I highly recommend this old film."
"Howlin Wolf","5","11","17","21 April 2007"," Man going overboard...
","One thing it's really good to see is Humphrey Bogart showing his range and giving a truly vulnerable performance. Cynicism is usually the protective armour of a Bogie character, but in Queeg we have the opposite of a cynic - a man so obsessed with doing even trivial things by the book that his underlings decide he is no longer fit for his job. To understand and embrace routine is obviously necessary in military life, but this rigid adherence ultimately becomes a distraction from performing his necessary duties. It's a perfect showcase for how the pressure-cooker atmosphere of always living with the threat of war can make otherwise tough men crumble.<br/><br/>It's a subtle show from Bogart, his demonstration of illness encompassing a number of tics which get worse as he starts to unravel from being judged up there on the stand. It's a cleverly escalating portrait, and the film never feels rushed, but for me the story started to get less interesting once everybody entered the courtroom. I generally don't like legal dramas, because out of necessity the focus becomes more on the mechanics of the plot than getting to examine human personalities. This is just a personal preference, however, and if you're a person who combines an admiration for Humphrey Bogart with a passion for the technicalities of the law, then I don't see how you could go far wrong in selecting ""The Caine Mutiny""."

One of those film makers jailed was Edward Dmtryk who later directed THE CAINE MUTINY .Knowing this it's obvious what the subtext is .

This mirrors the experiences those people appearing in front of The House Of Un-American Activities had when they stood up for principles .<br/><br/>The crew of the ship USS CAINE find themselves under the command of Captain Queeg a man who can be expected to install discipline upon a sloppy crew . As the story continues it becomes clear that Queeg is a man who can't see the bigger picture because of small details . The ship cuts its own towline due to Queeg reprimanding a sailor . That's jut the start of the crews troubles since he is a man of petty obsession such as believing there's a copy of a key being used by someone to steal food supplies . Fearful this might lead to disaster Lt Keefer suggests to Lt Maryk and Ensign Keith that there's a calamity in the making and during a typhoon Lt Maryk takes command of the ship in order to save the Caine and the crew . But Maryk finds himself on a mutiny charge , a capital offence and Keefer won't lift a finger to help Maryk . It's a good premise with a good cast . Bogart makes a memorable film character and we can empathise with Maryk's dilemma and feel resentment towards Keefer because we've all experienced that type of betrayal to a small extent <br/><br/>Where the film fails is that the story isn't well told . Much of the character focus is on Ensign Keith played by Robert Francis . Francis is certainly a pretty boy well suited to matinées but Keith is a spectator to events and ultimately a superfluous character . You get the feeling that he's cast to make THE CAINE MUTINY appeal to a prospective female audience and we've got subplots featuring Keith's mother and girlfriend . All this holds up the subtext featuring betrayal of friendship and intelligent points on practicalities on the chain of command . This means THE CAINE MUTINY is a good film but not a great one"

","At the beginning of the trial,the lawyer,played by José Ferrer arrives with a wounded arm:no connection with the story,no affect on the end of the movie, completely gratuitous.So why? In ""the sniper"" (1952),there's also a mutilated arm.Some historians of the cinema think it must be Dmytryk's remorse,because he became an informer during the McCarthysm.Some kind of self-punishment.Who knows?Strange indeed.<br/><br/>For the movie itself,its only flaws are the bland scenes between the Princeton lad and his squeeze.But everything else is absorbing,and Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best interpretations,acting with his hands (and his famous marbles that were to become almost legendary) as much as with his tormented face.Actually,he almost never stops twitching. Bogart gets good support from Fred MCMurray in a very ambiguous part -did he ""help"" Bogart's paranoia?Ferrer would be inclined in favor of this hypothesis-,and Van Johnson.<br/><br/>In spite of a conventional last scene,""the Caine mutiny "" leaves a bitter taste in the mouth:where does madness begin?Who is responsible  of Bogart's neurosis?Who are the good guys? Is the villain the one we thought?The last scene between Ferrer and the mutineers bring everything into question.Ambiguity will come back to the fore (particularly in Brando's character)in Dmytryk's subsequent ""the young lions"" (1958)."
"bkoganbing","9","18","33","5 October 2005"," A Studio Summit Type of film
","With the breakdown of the studio system in the Fifties, players no longer tied by contract to studios could command there own salaries. And the studios facing the competition of television paid them. It would have been almost impossible to make The Caine Mutiny a decade earlier. Three of the principal players Humphrey Bogart(Warner Brothers},Van Johnson,(MGM), and Fred MacMurray(Paramount)were all tied to other studios. But come the Fifties and Harry Cohn puts together a great cast for a great ensemble production at Columbia. <br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart got his third Academy Award nomination, but lost to Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront. Brando had been nominated and lost for three straight previous years, he was not to be denied again. In fact Bogey when he won for The African Queen in 1951 upset a heavily favored Brando. Some kind of poetic justice there.<br/><br/>There's a scene when Bogart takes command of the USS Caine from Tom Tully who's run a pretty slack ship up to that point. He gives Bogart a peace of advice about taking an easy strain, that the Caine was a tired ship. He didn't realize that he was talking to a tired captain.<br/><br/>Maybe someone in the Navy should have realized that and given Bogart a much needed rest. But they didn't and thereby hangs a tale.<br/><br/>The crew and the officers of the Caine, used to the easy ways of Tully, get real resentful of Bogart. But they also notice some disturbing behavior patterns in Bogart. It's a fine line that Bogart in his performance has to walk. Other reviewers compare his performance in The Caine Mutiny to his work in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Both characters disintegrate mentally, but whereas Fred C. Dobbs has nothing to hold him back, Philip Francis Queeg is in a command situation with the lives of his crew and of his ship at stake. And Queeg is not an evil man.<br/><br/>Fred MacMurray by now had shown he could do a lot more than the light comedy leads Paramount usually put him in. As Ensign Keefer who plants the seeds of mutiny on the Caine, he's shown to be a really shallow character.<br/><br/>Just as shallow is young Ensign Willie Keith played by newcomer Robert Francis. He's the hotshot from Princeton who's newly assigned to the Caine. Up to the point of the mutiny, it's his eyes in which we see the action on the Caine unfold, first with Tully in command and then with Bogart. After that it's Jose Ferrer's viewpoint as the Defense Counsel at the Court Martial.<br/><br/>Most reviewers single out Bogart and MacMurray for the most praise in the cast. I think Van Johnson is sadly overlooked. He's got a very complex part. He's the decent executive officer who sees Bogart's disintegration, doesn't know what to do about it, and gets manipulated by MacMurray. The key scene for him in the film is to convince Navy lawyer Jose Ferrer he's worthy of defending. Johnson does very well in that scene, maybe his best performance on film.<br/><br/>Jose Ferrer doesn't get into the film until it's two thirds done and then he dominates. He's a bit of a manipulator himself at the court martial. He also provides the real final verdict of the affair of The Caine Mutiny.<br/><br/>Tom Tully for playing Captain DeVries also got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actor category, but he lost to Edmond O'Brien for The Barefoot Contessa. Tully's character is critical here, he provides the contrast between himself and Bogart as men and as commanders. He's also not mentioned enough in critiques of the Caine Mutiny.<br/><br/>Most of the time I like for films to be resolved. But the very strength of The Caine Mutiny as drama is that the issues are unresolved. Could certain actions by the members of the crew, by the Navy itself prevented the whole thing? Just how culpable were the men and officers of the Caine in a mutiny? <br/><br/>You may scratch your head at the conclusion, but you'll also be breathless by the depth of the performances in this fine ensemble film."
"Itchload","6","14","25","22 January 2003"," Great moments, but severely flawed movie
","I went into this movie a tad iffy on Humphrey Bogart.  I liked him, but I just didn't see the total appeal.  Needless to say, I gained a lot of respect for him after watching this, and he's easily the best (only good?) part of this movie.  His performance is a great aside to his usual steadfast tough guy role.  The scenes involving his decent into exhaustion/mental breakdown are done well, and not without a hint of humor (wacky strawberry misadventures, ext).<br/><br/>However, that's about where the positive aspects of this movie end.  For starters, the ridiculous Oedipus complex subplot with Robert Francis' mother is redundant and tiresome.  It's a big strain on the viewer to immediately figure out he needs to ""not always listen to mother."" Not helping things is the ridiculous, out of place romance with May Wynn, which seems to exist in a different movie.  It really damages the mood and pace of the film.  In fact, Robert Francis might deliver one of the worst performances in a ""classic"" film that I've seen.  He's extremely wooden, and contrasted with<br/><br/>Bogart and MacMurray, he just can't carry any weight at all.  (the rest of this paragraph contains ""spoilers"" so watch out) In addition, MacMurray's character's odd decision to sellout his friend in court just gives some uncomfortable moral ambiguity to the movie that it really doesn't need. The movie's descent into lame coutroom drama can't be faulted too much, as that plot convention hadn't yet become a cliche in 1954, but it certainly hasn't aged well.  The whole courtroom sequence is like pulling teeth, and is nearly unwatchable.  And the after-victory party which is ""crashed"" by the intoxicated defense lawyer who preceeds to give one of the lamest speeches in cinema, playing up the over the top moral ambiguity that MacMurray's character already uncomfortably instated didn't make any sense given the movie's first hour and  half.  Bogart went crazy, all the sympathy we need to feel for him was given in Bogart's great acting performance, the audience did not need to be batted over the head with it, especially in a scene late in the film where the movie's steam was rapidly deterioating.  Finally, the last scene, which sort of takes on a wacky ""all's well that ends well"" feel seems tacked on, as if we're supposed to feel relieved at wooden stiff-Francis' learning experience.  ""The dedication to this film is simple--The US Navy"" was also a copout for a final quote.  The movie wasn't a total condemnation of the Navy, why kiss up?  The movie had its themes in mind, let them stand on their own.<br/><br/>Well, that was a pretty big rant for a movie that I overall would recommend. The scenes with Bogart were great, but every time the film left the Caine it sunk (I didn't even realize what an awful pun that was until I typed it)."
"tohu","6","10","17","2 November 2007"," Superb second half, pity about the first hour.
","This is a film of two halves. The first half is dreary and below average. The second half is superb.<br/><br/>That excellent second half of the movie concerns the actual mutiny that took place aboard the USS Caine. The principled, anguished officers (played by Van Johnson and Robert Francis) are egged on by their two-faced shyster colleague (Fred MacMurray) to take command of the ship from the increasingly paranoid captain (Humphrey Bogart). Whether they were right to do so is then played out in a superb courtroom drama, where military lawyers (E.G. Marshall and Jose Ferrer) take opposing sides in questioning all involved.<br/><br/>This part of the film - the mutiny and its aftermath - is gripping, brilliantly acted and full of aching moral dilemmas. Bogart, in one of his final screen roles, is absolutely magnificent as the flawed anti-hero, and MacMurray, Marshall and Ferrer also give great performances. Indeed, if the film consisted of just this part of the story it would be one of the best of its kind.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, someone in the production team decided that this drama needed a long introduction, so we have to sit through a meandering first hour before we get to the meat of the movie. Some of this over-long first hour is given to character development, but too much of it concerns unnecessary side-shows like the completely superfluous love affair between Francis's character and his sweetheart back home. The result is that many viewers will have switched off from the movie (either emotionally or literally) before the good stuff begins.<br/><br/>And that's a real shame because this really does mar what could have been a great film. I'm almost tempted to recommend that you should switch on after the first hour and just watch it from there - but that would be to disrespect the film. It is what it is and films should be judged on their entirety, not in segments (however tempting it is to do so).<br/><br/>So, on that basis, The Caine Mutiny deserves a 6, when without the first hour it could have garnered a 9. In production terms, for a film made in 1954, it looks terrific (though the widescreen shots of the ship being tossed on the waves during the typhoon scene lack the reality of more modern effects) and it is the acting of the leads that stays in your mind long after the film is over.<br/><br/>Given what I've said, I suppose the question that matters is: is the latter part of the film good enough to make it worth your while sitting through the slow beginning? And the answer is yes. After all, there are some great actors on display here, and in top form too. At the end of the day, that has to be worth waiting for."

Keith likes when DeVriess is replaced by the veteran Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), who demands discipline on board. But soon Kefer notes that Queeg is paranoid and coward and induces Maryk and Keith to meet Admiral Halsey and to disclose Queeg´s behavior and paranoia. However, Keefer backs down when they are ready to meet Halsey afraid of being misunderstood and punished.

And ""The Caine Mutiny"" also boasts brilliant performances, literate dialogue, a vivid sense of place and a sweeping score. The only weaknesses are the periodic lulls, caused (as virtually every reviewer has pointed out) by the thoroughly uninteresting romance between Francis and Wynn, and the rather obviously integrated grainy stock war footage in a battle scene. These weaknesses, however, are too minor to seriously affect this film's excellence.   (***1/2)"

","Humphrey Bogart continued his impressive streak with this Academy Award-nominated movie about a navy captain whose heavy-handed and sometimes dangerous approach to things resulted in a rebellion among some of his cohorts.<br/><br/>Obviously, the music in ""The Caine Mutiny"" is pretty hokey, and the love story drags the movie down a bit, but you can't deny the effort that the cast members put into their roles. In the end, it's not about whether Queeg was right or wrong; it's about the things that people do in desperate situations (and that sort of situation is bound to arise out at sea in the middle of a storm). After all, Queeg had spent years in the armed forced, so what did you expect him to do? And then the trial scene is one of the most intense in movie history.<br/><br/>Above all, it's good that Edward Dmytryk was able to find work again. I recommend the movie.

","A patchy but very watchable novel adaptation,with some fine performances(MacMurray,Johnson,Ferrer),but this is Humphrey Bogart's movie.His usual persona of an amiable,trench-coated tough guy with a heart of gold is totally jettisoned here,as the character of Queeg is a nervous,paranoid,jittery wreck who is clearly unsuitable to be a US Navy Captain.Despite this,Bogart still makes his character oddly pitiable and sympathetic.His crumpling under Jose Ferrer's questioning in the courtroom scene is a great piece of film acting.The film is unbalanced(as everybody notes)by the pointless romance between Willie Keith and May Wynn,but the last word should go to Bogie himself.An anedocte claims he was once asked how he managed to convey the paranoia of Captain Queeg so accruately.""Simple.Everybody knows I'm nuts anyway!"" was the alleged reply!"

","Bogie, Johnson, McMurray, Tully, Marvin, and Akins are first rate.Bogie and McMurray are particularly good playing complex, unsympathetic characters.

Who cares about them? Get back on board the Caine, quick, before I fall asleep.<br/><br/>Jone Ferrer chews up the scenery. His performance is not congruent with the other performers. He is supposed to be angry, but boiling over with rage? No. His loudness obscures the important point he is making during his drunk scene.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a slight disappointment given the great material the book provided.

","Humphrey Bogart turns in one of his very best performances as the quirky Captain Queeg who takes over command of The Caine, a war-weary armored ship, in the last days of the Second World War. His senior officers, played by Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, and Robert Francis, have a hard time accommodating his strict stewardship and begin to question his authority. When The Caine gets active duty, tensions mount, tempers flare, and the crew gets mutinous! In the background there is lots of action, a banal but innocuous love affair, some schmaltzy humor, and a strong unquestioning dose of 1950s feel good American patriotism mixed with some new Hollywood Jung/Freud psycho-babble.<br/><br/>After the mutiny on The Caine, the movie ends with an even bigger bang--a terrific court-martial that pits defender Jose Ferrer against prosecutor E.G. Marshall. Jose Ferrar wins over the officers in the end and his final interrogation of Queeg (Bogart) remains one of the most powerful courtroom scenes in any movie made since. The end of the picture leaves us with a riddle and some judicious comments from Jose Ferrar about social rank and true loyalty.<br/><br/>What makes this film such a classic are the tremendous performances by all the actors, from a very young Lee Marvin as a lowly seaman to all those already mentioned, each is flawless. Stanley Kramer produced and this is his best effort, far better than later movies such as ""The Defiant Ones"" or ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.""<br/><br/>For any fan of Bogart, good dialogue, or intriguing story lines, this movie will delight. One of the best -- watch it!"

The rest of the cast is also stellar, particularly the underrated Fred MacMurray. This is a wonderful film."
"schappe1","9","8","15","17 March 2006"," Quite a Crew
","One of the pleasures of viewing movies made in the 1950's is seeing all the familiar faces. Many of the actors us baby boomers grew up watching on TV got some of their first big chances in the ""A"" movies of the 50's. Aboard the Caine, (or, at least, in the movies) are: Fred MacMurray of ""My Three Sons"", (already a star, of course), Warner Anderson and Tom Tully of ""The Line-Up"" E.G. Marshall of ""The Defenders"", Lee Marvin of ""M Squad"", Claude Akins of ""Movin' On"" and ""Sheriff Lobo"", Jerry Paris of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", Herbert Anderson of ""Dennis the Menace"", James Best of ""Dukes of Hazard"", Robert Bray of ""Stagecoach West"", as well as frequent TV guest actors such as Whit Bissell, Arthur Franz, Steve Brodie and Don Dubbins. There's also Kenneth McDonald, one of Perry Mason's favorite judges, playing, naturally, a judge. It's the type of movie where every role, no matter how small, is played by someone who makes it memorable.<br/><br/>Of course, the stars shine. This is one of Humphrey Bogart's most famous performances. He covers all the bases, showing Queeg as a reasonable man when not under stress but a fanatical micro-manager when he feels himself losing his grip. MacMurray, for the second of three times in his career, turns his ""nice guy"" persona inside out. The others are ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Apartment"". (In the first the author was Cain. In the second the ship was the Caine. In the third they raised cain.) Van Johnson, a much underrated actor has the best, (but not the only good) role of his career as the true blue Navy guy who gets swayed by MacMurray into risking his career. The unfortunate Robert Francis, who died in a plane crash the next year, is a rather stiff actor but his earnestness seems to fit his inexperienced character, (even has it totally fails him in the romantic scenes in the pointless subplot). Had he lived he probably would have had a Tab Hunter/Troy Donahue type career. This film would probably have been his peek in any case.<br/><br/>The measure of a great film is if you project yourself into it, having conversations with the characters and wondering what you would say or do. This film sucks you into it about as much as any. What would you have said to Captain Queeg when he called that meeting? (I'd have asked him what he meant by ""constructive loyalty"".) I'm also impressed by a movie that doesn't give me what I expected. Trial movies are supposed to either be about heroic prosecutors bringing dangerous criminals to justice or about heroic defense attorneys protecting their innocent clients from a miscarriage of justice. Here we have a lawyer who would rather be the prosecutor and a ""victory"" that is really a tragedy.<br/><br/>By the way, I know of three actors who adopted the names of characters they played, (there may be more). Dawn O'Day changed her name to Anne Shirley when she played Anne Shirley in ""Anne of Green Gables"" (1934). Byron Barr morphed into Gig Young when he played Gig Young in ""The Gay Sisters"" (1942) and Donna Lee Hickey became May Wynn for this picture. Thus, ""May Wynn"" is playing ""May Wynn"".<br/><br/>One last thought: I wonder if Humphrey Bogart's ""Caine"" ever passed by Jimmy Cagney's ""Reluctant"" during its travels."

","If you are in the navy and your terminally stressed-out captain, during a typhoon, alternates between paralysis and giving lunatic orders calculated to make the ship highly liable to founder, do you not relieve him of his command ? What else could you possibly do ? Drown along with the rest of the crew ? Perhaps there would still be a court-martial.<br/><br/>Most reviewers seem to be in two minds about this movie. Virtually all are agreed that the romance is completely irrelevant, and belongs somewhere else, if anywhere. Most consider it otherwise well-acted, at least by Bogart, MacMurray and Van Johnson. Most consider the end scene with Jose Ferrer turning up drunk and jingoistic to be embarrassing. For some reason it nevertheless seems kind of interesting and memorable. I remember my mother talking about it in 1955. It's dated, and yet it isn't, and still seems strangely effective."

He deserved his Oscar for The African Queen, but I think that he should have gotten one for this movie too. He was great. I wouldn't go that far and call this movie a masterpiece, it's close, but not as close to Casablanca greatness. But the acting was at it's best. You already know what it's about, so I'm not gonna tell you about that, but I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a very good, classic, different movie.

","A huge critical and commercial success in its day, ""The Caine Mutiny"" is even more involving and entertaining in 2017. Not only is Bogart's brilliant performance undimmed, but Time (and repeated viewings) have allowed us to appreciate the subtlety of MacMurray's viperish portrait, while Francis' early death (I think he made only two more movies before being killed in a light plane crash) has given a poignancy and intensity to his scenes. <br/><br/>May Wynn's career never really took off despite her impressive debut here. Beautifully photographed and costumed, she lends added glamour to both the Yosemite location episode and the nightclub bit where she sings ""I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me"".<br/><br/>And it's also good to see Lee Marvin in a characteristic early role. Another actor deserving commendation and also not usually mentioned in reviews (even though receiving a Hollywood award nomination), is Tom Tully. <br/><br/>From the very opening credits, rousingly scored by Max Steiner, we know we are in for a treat. And we're not disappointed either. Superb acting from a marvelous cast, a solidly suspenseful script with sharp dialogue and fascinating yet involving characters, highly competent direction, superbly attractive Technicolor photography, crisp film editing and masterful craftsmanship all around, in a big- budget movie which for once does its original novel full justice. In fact, Hollywood professionalism at its best. <br/><br/>Even the details and incidental touches are painstakingly accurate. Take Francis' first glimpse of the anything but ship-shape Caine and its slovenly captain (notice how delightfully dapper he is though, when he re-appears at the end). <br/><br/>Bogart gets my vote for his finest performance ever in this riveting story that captures the attention from start to finish, thanks to its excellent script and capably realistic direction. Bogart's portrayal stands up to the closest scrutiny. Francis is also most convincingly sincere, whilst May Wynn (a young actress who has taken the name of the character she plays here as her screen nom-de-plume) makes an attractive heroine and sings most pleasantly. (Whatever happened to her?)<br/><br/>An Actor's Recollection: I loved playing the part. I don't know if I'd jump at the chance to play a villain again — unless of course the movie was done as well. — Fred MacMurray."

","Those HUAC hearings sure knocked the stuffing out of director Dmytryk....Is this movie by the man who made that scorching indictment of antisemitism, Crossfire? Fraid so. Not that it's all that bad, but he pulls so many punches here that all dramatic tension this movie should have had just drains away. You get the feeling he was so afraid of getting into hot water with the Navy that he deflated the central point of the movie: was Queeg incompetent or not? Answer: yes, but he couldn't help it. His officers weren't nice to him,see? No,not really. If that was all it took to send him over the brink, he should have been a ferry skipper, not a Navy officer. All actors have been much better in other movies, and dearly as i love Bogart, even his performance was below his usual level. Strawberries, indeed! But the final insult to intelligence was Ferrer's drunken rant at the end,where he accuses everybody of having ulterior motives for accusing Queeg. Worst of all of course is McMurray's character: an intellectual! Who writes books! Sickening! At least Queeg never went to Princeton, or something along those lines. In short: you've won, but hang your heads in shame.Why? For not letting Queeg sink the ship? The captain may be bonkers, but he's still your commander? It seems to me that Dmytryk put in this ridiculous rant to assure the powers that be that mutiny is wrong at all times. The mutineers were right in saying Queeg was crazy, but wrong for disobeying orders. So both parties were both wrong AND right? Now I'M the one who's going crazy! It's too bad this movie was made in the creatively crippling Fifties, and not ten years before or after. You might say Dmytryk was a bit like Queeg: he had the abilities to excel, but lacked the courage to take charge. Now this movie, like Queeg's ship, just goes round in circles."

","In order to provide Bogart with Oscar attempts at the end of his career he jumped to supposedly complex roles, which were often just 2-dimensional heels. Bogart was a professional but it was his bad fortune to require these roles in the '50s, a very poor time for drama; the doldrums between noir and the French new wave. There probably is a great drama to be generated from a supposed U.S. mutiny. It very well might star Humphrey Bogart as a character like Captain Queeg. If this had been made in the forties it would have had a chance, but by the fifties dramatic efforts had become regressive and shallow, mired in spectacle and production merits as a tool to wedge people away from their sofas and TVs.<br/><br/>The 2nd half devolves into the standard dumb courtroom sequence, a format beloved by crappy writers for it's ability to infuse some cheap drama into a movie. Will there be surprise testimony? an outburst? Will a jerky witness shoot himself in the foot? ...can you name a single movie with a courtroom scene where two of those three things don't occur? <br/><br/>Robert Francis plays the wholly unnecessary part of a whitebread, dull as-a-post Momma's boy who finds it easier to mutiny than he does to put his mother in her place. Oy vey! He also kills time in a conventional love story that has no reason to be here. The sub-plot might as well have aliens in it, for how little any of it matters. The signature characterization of Queeg as an insecure guy who nervously plays with some steel balls at moments of vulnerability is as thin as paper. Van Johnson is the only actor here who's asked to show any range. <br/><br/>The largest of the movies sins after its hokey dramatic arc is the infuriating over-scoring of the movie. Max Steiner, never a very imaginative composer, takes two motifs; an original theme, and From the Halls of Montezuma, and blares them endlessly to convey two points: ""The plot is thickening"" and ""Although we all hate Captain Queeg, we're still pro-military!"" Mmmmm, won't you please, please, please pound me over the head with one of these two stupid music selections again? This is the last time I can watch an over-scored movie from between 1930 and 1960. I really cannot bear anymore of this unsubtlety after Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick, The Heiress, etc.<br/><br/>This movie is about as complex as a game of tic-tac-toe, and perhaps about as compelling. If you want to see Bogart play a heel, just rent Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I'm with Dave Kehr who wrote, ""Dymytrk's ham-fisted direction does little to alleviate the obviousness of the drama and the thinness of the characterizations"" But I can sum those points up even quicker, ""Pffff-f-f-f-ffft!"""

","As far as war movies are concerned, this is among the very best because it focuses so well on characterizations. Although Bogart was excellent in the film, I found myself most satisfied with two characters--Jose Ferrer as the prosecutor and especially Fred McMurray as the Mr. Know-it-all who pushes the 2nd in command to mutiny--only to ultimately shows his cowardice and leave the 2nd in command holding the blame. I've known people like McMurray's character and so it was really nice to see this portrayal. As far as characterizations go, about the only film I can think of that gets it better is TWELVE ANGRY MEN.<br/><br/>One important note: The book is very different from the movie in that Queeg, though a poor leader, was NOT incapacitated by fear and self-doubt. The crew taking control of the ship was NOT warranted, as it clearly was in the movie. My advice is to read the book and see the movie--they're both exceptional but different."

","The Caine Mutiny is regarded as a classic thriller of a mutiny aboard a naval ship in World War II that turns into a court room saga. In fact 'A Few Good Men' is really an updated remake.<br/><br/>The destroyer Caine is a small creaky old ship whose rather relaxed captain is replaced by Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) a disciplinarian. As time goes on he upsets both his officers and crew and shows signs of paranoia, stress and even cowardice.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Thomas Keefer (Fred MacMurray) who was a writer before being called up notices the signs of mental illness and tries to convince Executive Officer Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) to do something about it. Maryk refuses at first but finally takes over command when in a storm Queeg nearly capsizes the ship.<br/><br/>Maryk and some of the other officers stand trial for mutiny and they are reluctantly defended by Lieutenant Barney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer) only after other military lawyers have turned them down.<br/><br/>Of course it is not going to take much for Greenwald to expose Queeg's instability, under intense pressure Queeg takes out his stress balls. However Greenwald reserves his ire after the trial on Keefer for engineering the mutiny so one day he can publish a book about it and Maryk as well as others for not helping Queeg when he asked for help and it was clear he had seen too much of war.<br/><br/>The film loses focus often when it concentrates on an irrelevant love story between an Ensign and his girlfriend. The film also has an uneven tone, not helped by the musical score.<br/><br/>However Bogart delivers another 'against type' performance. His Queeg starts out confidently before spiralling downwards. There is solid support from Van Johnson and Fred McMurray whose character really is cynical and slippery, therefore rightly exposed at the end of the movie."
"ackstasis","6","3","5","1 May 2008"," ""Here's to the real author of the Caine mutiny.""
","'The Caine Mutiny (1954)' is a film that, for me, never quite came together. It's less than the sum of its parts, and a somewhat cumbersome amalgamation of solid performances and good ideas, but without any clear narrative thread. I don't think it would be unreasonable to assume that the film was heavily influenced by the success of Fred Zinnemann's 'From Here to Eternity (1953).' Both take a strict military environment and include sparing snippets of war-time conflict, but focus largely on the issue of military authority. However, 'The Caine Mutiny,' perhaps aiming to match Lancaster/Kerr or Clift/Reed, also attempts a clumsy romantic subplot, which feels too poorly-developed to have any lasting relevance with the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart, as one would expect, gives the film's most memorable performance, his continually-paranoid and antagonistic leadership eliciting a curious mix of hatred and pity. Even so, Bogart had already displayed superior talent as a mentally-deteriorating personality in both John Huston's 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)' and Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950).' Fred MacMurray is excellent, playing Keefer, a likable would-be novelist and a self-confessed coward, who, rather than overcoming his shortcomings in order to save his friend's life, unceremoniously abandons and betrays him. Nevertheless, he's hardly played as a villain, as though the film accepts that this is just the way that some people are.<br/><br/>Robert Francis has enough charisma to be a good supporting player, but he's simply not strong enough in the lead role. Given time, he might have developed into a big star, but a plane crash in 1955 tragically cut short a promising career. Female co-star May Wynn, aside from having a very good singing voice, is unconvincing in the role of Francis' sweetheart, her acting appearing strained in many of the romance's most intense moments, which aren't, in actual fact, very intense at all. José Ferrer makes an impressive second-billed cameo appearance at the film's climax, playing the lawyer who dutifully defends the accused mutineer, but resents the ship's officers for facilitating, through their own inaction, Cmdr. Queeg's illness; I liked how the conclusion shrewdly blurred the lines of villainy and heroism.<br/><br/>The film's strongest scenes are those that involve Bogart, as his character, a ""ticking time-bomb"" of denial and paranoia, threatens to destroy all those under his command, and I particularly liked the use of the ball bearings to signify Queeg's escalating nervousness. Nevertheless, Edward Dmytryk, as a director, has yet to impress me as much as I would have liked him to. From the three pictures of his that I've seen  the other two being the hard-boiled noir 'Murder, My Sweet (1944)' and the climbing adventure 'The Mountain (1956)'  he tends to strike me as a very workman-like filmmaker. He gets the job done, of course, and often does a good job of it, but you'd be tentative about blindly choosing one of his films from the DVD shelf. However, I'm perfectly happy to accept recommendations for any Dmytryk films that might break this general mould."
"Snow Leopard","Null","3","5","11 May 2001"," Excellent Psychological Drama
","The heart of ""The Caine Mutiny"" is the psychological struggle between the U.S.S. Caine's neurotic Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart, who gives a great performance in a role that was somewhat atypical for him) and his officers, most of whom have their own inner struggles.<br/><br/>On a first viewing, the movie is an effective and gripping drama.  We first agonize over the dilemma of the officers who wonder whether they should openly resist their Captain as his grip on reality continues to deteriorate, and then, after the inevitable confrontation, we anxiously wait to see whether the officers will be punished for doing what they were convinced was necessary.  Both of these are enhanced by an outstanding cast and by many interesting sequences and attractive visuals.<br/><br/>Repeated viewings are also satisfying, since they make it possible to get a deeper appreciation of each officer's motivation, and of how each one's actions are reflective of his own personality and his own problems.<br/><br/>The main story is framed by a beginning and ending involving young Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) and Captain De Vriess (Tom Tully, who is terrific in this smaller role), the crabby old captain who preceded Queeg on the Caine, plus a sequence in the middle involving Keith on leave from the ship. This device (or sub-plot) does not work nearly as well as the main story, primarily because Ensign Keith's love interest and family difficulties slow things down considerably, without adding much interest to his own character. This is really the film's only noticeable imperfection.<br/><br/>Although set in World War II, it is not really a war film, and thus is well worth seeing even for viewers who are not interested in war movies. Anyone who enjoys excellent characterizations, psychological tension, or just good cinema, should enjoy watching ""The Caine Mutiny""."
"skay_baltimore","5","7","17","25 December 2011"," Some old movies are timeless; this is not one of them
","Frankly, I was disappointed after having watched The Caine Mutiny. I expected something much more powerful, and all I saw was a dated film, with spotty acting, and a film saddled with a weak romantic sub plot.<br/><br/>More than anything else, however, I felt that the ending was a complete blow off of everything that came before it. Queeg was clearly incapable of making proper decisions, especially during the typhoon. The court martial was held, and the accused was vindicated. Then the defense attorney came along and undermined all of that, as if winning the case was an affront to the lunatic Queeg. Please...that's an insult. And that's really how I felt after spending nearly two hours watching this movie -- insulted.<br/><br/>Maybe censorship in the 50's necessitated such an ending, but if so, it's a major weakness of The Caine Mutiny. I happened to like Bogart's portrayal of Queeg, contrary to some other posters, but the way the film ended really made me question the validity of the film itself. If the producers felt uncomfortable making a statement that could have been interpreted as advocating mutiny in the military, they shouldn't have bothered to make the film in the first place."

","Some 25 years ago I met Jose Ferrer at a function. I told him that The Caine Mutiny was one of my favorite films and novels....but I had one question. I asked what was the significance of the wrap around bandage on Barney Greenwald's hand. He chuckled and said that not many people have asked him about that.<br/><br/>Mr. Ferrer said that he was very excited about the role of Barney Greenwald after reading the novel. In the novel Greenwald has a bigger role in going back to his training days as a Navy Pilot and the struggles in the Navy fighting the anti semitism that was rampant at the time . He felt that aspect of the novel into Greenwald's tribulations to make it up the ladder as an officer should have been in the film. However in the early '50s the temperament in Hollywood was not to make waves in that direction. He stated that the Writer and Producer did not want to go that way....being Jews themselves...thus he, a Catholic from Puerto Rico felt he had to make a statement. So the bandage was a form of silent protest known to his family and a few friends.<br/><br/>He also had a short point about the famous scene where he threw Champagne into Fred MacMurray's face. The take you see was the first one filmed. The Director did a number of others since liquid got on the camera lens filming behind MacMurray's head...however they could never get the intensity of the original take so that there is a very quick cut when you see the liquid hitting MacMurray.<br/><br/>A Great movie. Mr Ferrer was more than gracious in spending time with me. A real gentleman."

","Yes it seems dated on the one hand. I agree with other reviewers that the romance is contrived and adds nothing at all to the story. On the other hand, watching Captain Queeg slowly lose his mind and the increasingly stressed crew try to deal with it- very interesting. Building to a climax where a hurricane threatens the ship. Queeg is paralyzed with fear and cannot take appropriate action. The junior officer must relieve him of his command in one of cinema's most dramatic moments. From there, the movie does tend to drag a bit, with the ensuing court martial.The ending makes little sense, where the defense lawyer apparently feels so guilty and horrible after winning the case that he has to get stinking drunk. Good film overall for students of psychology or history."

","Outstanding drama concerning an up-and-coming naval Lieutenant (Johnson) whose loyalty to his new skipper (Bogart) is tested when the captain's odd behaviour raises questions about his competence and stewardship of the boat and its crew. Reluctantly, Johnson is forced to confront Bogart's apparent mental deterioration, but there's another key player in the saga whose role must be exposed.<br/><br/>Bogart made so many great films, and this in my opinion is one of his masterclass efforts. You might take issue with the romantic interlude of Francis and Wynn's largely extraneous characters, but it's difficult to ignore the impact of Bogart, Johnson, MacMurray and Ferrer in their respective roles. Once were a hero, now reduced to a nervous victim, Bogart effortlessly transitions between capable commander exhibiting superior wit and judgment, to pathetic, humourless sideshow as Johnson steps up beyond his self belief to take control of what he believes is a sinking ship. MacMurray is a real sleeper, the scene in which he's chastised by Ferrer is a perfect reckoning.<br/><br/>Boasting a supporting cast of future stars and veteran character actors (Lee Marvin, Claude Akins, EG Marshall, Arthur Franz and Whit Bissell), blacklisted director Dmytryk's movie is an epic character study that is as gripping in its simmering tension as it is poignant in its ultimately bleak conclusion.

","Greetings again from the darkness. This film was nominated for seven Academy Awards (no wins), including Best Picture. Watching it today, it seems clear that the courtroom scene with Humphrey Bogart in the chair as Lt. Cmdr. Queeg drove this film to the heights it reached. That few minutes is as powerful as anything Bogart ever did on screen. Unfortunately, he would pass away (esophagal cancer) less than three years later.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is solid enough as we meet newly graduated Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis). His first Navy assignment is aboard a minesweeper (junkyard Navy) and the veteran officers quickly note his disappointment at not being assigned to a more prestigious carrier. Those veteran officers are played by quite a list of actors: Van Johnson plays no-nonsense Lt. Steve Maryk, Fred MacMurray plays the cynical wannabe novelist Lt. Tom Keefer, and Tom Tully plays Cmdr DeVriess, who irritates young Willie with his laid back approach to command. We also see Lee Marvin and Claude Akins as part of the ship's rag-tag crew.<br/><br/>A shift occurs once Queeg replaces DeVriess. Queeg brings a tough old school Navy approach to the ship and is easily thrown by the sight of an untucked shirt. Over a short amount of time, the officers begin taking note of the odd behavior of Queeg. MacMurray's character acts as an armchair psychologist, and more importantly, an instigator for the other officers. He is sure Queeg is unstable and unfit for duty. The climax occurs during a typhoon and Lt Maryk (Johnson) takes the abrupt step of relieving Queeg of his duties ... an action that's never actually occurred aboard a Naval ship.<br/><br/>Soon Maryk and Willie are brought up on charges of mutiny. At about the 90 minute mark, their attorney makes his first appearance. Jose Ferrer plays Lt. Greenwald, the only naval attorney who would take the case against the highly decorated Commander. Watching Queeg (Bogart) on the stand is just about as good as acting gets. Ferrer is exceptional as well.<br/><br/>This film is about the character of men and their reactions to situations in which they are trained to act otherwise. It's based on the WWII novel by Herman Wouk, and the screenplay is by Stanley Roberts. The film is directed by Edward Dmytryk, who you may know as one of the ""Hollywood Ten"". Dmytryk spent time in prison for his lack of cooperation with HUAC, and his previous involvement with the communist party. The score is outstanding and was composed by the famous Max Steiner, who was also responsible for a couple of other films you may have seen: Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. It should also be noted that this was the second of five total films made by Robert Francis (Ens Willie Keith). The 25 year old up and coming actor was killed in a plane crash the year after this film was made."

","This one scene is worth the price of admission. Bogey's gradual disintegration on the witness stand, as the beleaguered Captain folding under relentless cross-examination, is one of the truly great performances on film. From the point at which he begins to unravel, reaching into his pocket for the little steel balls to begin rolling them nervously in his sweaty palm, to the almost unbearable moment of tragic epiphany, when Bogey suddenly realizes the effect his paranoid ravings have had on his fellow Officers ... absolutely brilliant. And as the defense lawyer forced against his conscience to be the instrument of torture which exposes Bogart as emotionally shattered, in order to defend his client on the mutiny charge, Jose Ferrer gives a near equally compelling performance. While ruthlessly tormenting Bogey into revealing his raging paranoia, Ferrer somehow finds a way, without words, to simultaneously and powerfully communicate to us, the viewers, his intense sympathy for his victim, and in so doing, forces us to experience it. Pay attention the next time you see the picture, it's all there in his eyes. One truly great film."
"Thomas-White2","6","2","3","26 July 2006"," Bogart saves the film, but barely
","If there's ever been a film that needs to be remade, this is it. Normally I'm not in favor of remaking old movies, but this is an exception. My only reservation is that it would do some dishonor to Boagrt's performance, which was a good one, although not his best. Other than that, the screenplay is stilted and in some cases betrays the book, the tone is overly melodramatic, and most of the acting is wooden -- especially that of Van Johnson, who was a dreadful choice for Steve Maryk. If they'd carved a wooden figure out in his general shape and stood it in the scenes and did voice-overs with his dialogue they would have gotten better performances. Robert Francis was not much better, although he did look the part, and the May Wynn who portrayed May Wynn (???) was a annoying squeaky-voiced little non-entity who either should have had more of a character or should have been left out completely. Fred MacMurray did his best but didn't have any real passion. I would say that Jose Ferrer did a great job as Barney Greenwald but for the fact that Edward Dymytyk's main instruction to all the actors seemed to be to act as stiffly as they possibly could. Someone needs to go back to the original novel and start over again. Meanwhile, this will have to do."
"JamesHitchcock","8","2","3","16 April 2005"," Memorable Wartime Psychological Drama
","The film is set on a US Navy minesweeper during the Second World War and tells the story of the difficult relationship between her Captain, Philip Queeg, and his crew. Queeg is deeply unpopular, not only with the enlisted men but also with his subordinate officers. His predecessor in command, Captain DeVries, was relatively easygoing, even slack, but Queeg is an obsessive disciplinarian, determined to enforce Naval regulations to the letter, especially with regard to trivial issues. He insists that shirts are always tucked in, makes all the men get short haircuts, and turns the ship upside down in a vain attempt to discover the truth about a small quantity of stolen strawberries. Despite his obsession with doing everything correctly, he himself seems to be an indifferent, even incompetent, seaman and is suspected by some of his fellow-officers of both cowardice and mental derangement. Things come to a head during a typhoon when Queeg's indecision and bad seamanship seem to be endangering the safety of the ship. His second in command, Lieutenant Steve Maryk, with the support of some of the other officers, takes over the ship on the grounds that Queeg is no longer mentally fit for command. For this act of insubordination, however, Maryk finds himself on trial charged with mutiny.<br/><br/>The film's defects are mostly of a structural nature. I have never read Herman Wouk's novel, but it is clear from the film that it could have furnished enough material for two films, a war film dealing with men at sea and a courtroom drama dealing with the court martial. I felt that the balance between these two aspects of the story was unsatisfactory; much more time is given to the sea story than to the courtroom drama, which I felt was rather rushed. Although this is a relatively long film, at just over two hours, I felt that it could have been longer to do justice to both aspects of the story. (It is rare that I feel that a film is too short; excessive length is a much more common fault). Another structural weakness is that the first half of the film concentrates too much on Willie Keith, a junior officer who plays a subordinate role in the alleged mutiny and who is not placed on trial, especially as the actor playing him gave one of the weaker performances in the film. I felt that more emphasis should have been placed on the character of Maryk from the start. If the filmmakers had wanted to cut material to keep the length of the film down, they could easily have dispensed with the subplot about Willie's romance with a nightclub singer and his relationship with his domineering mother.<br/><br/>In most other respects, however, this is an excellent film. The best thing about it is Humphrey Bogart. Although he gave many excellent performances in his career, Queeg is a very different role to the ones he normally played. Bogart's most frequent screen persona, seen not only in his private eye roles like ""The Big Sleep"" but also in films such as ""Casablanca"" and ""The African Queen"", was that of the tough guy, outwardly hard-bitten and cynical but inwardly decent and honourable. Even in his mid-fifties, however, he was clearly keen to extend his range as an actor, because we see him for once portraying an emotionally vulnerable character. Queeg is not a wicked tyrant like the Charles Laughton interpretation of Captain Bligh, nor is he (despite what Maryk and some of the other officers think) insane. He is rather an ordinary human being, driven over the edge by the stress of command. This is spelt out for us in the scene at the end of the film when Lieutenant Greenwald, Maryk's defence lawyer, tells a few home truths to the officers who have failed in their duty to give their support to their captain, but it was always evident from Bogart's interpretation. 1954 was a good year for Bogart, as he also starred in two other fine films,""Sabrina"" and ""The Barefoot Contessa"". <br/><br/>There are no other acting performances that are particularly outstanding, although I liked Jose Ferrer as Greenwald and Fred McMurray as the cowardly Lieutenant Keefer, who incites Maryk to take over command and then, to save his own skin, lies on oath about his part in the affair. Keefer, a novelist in civilian life, is a good example of the sort of intellectual who knows the world from books but knows little of practical matters or human nature. (I wondered if he represented Wouk's comment on some of his fellow-novelists). This is, however, a film where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. What is memorable is not so much individual performances, apart from Bogart's, but rather the way in which the contributions of the various actors, and of the director, combine to produce a tense, exciting and memorable psychological drama of men facing up to the stress of war. A film well worth seeing. 8/10"

This extraordinary movie is one that we all can relate to as, whether you served in the military or are a civilian, we all at one time or another have had a superior who simply did not belong in that position. The genius of THE CAINE MUTINY is that it is a relentless drama that offers up one classic scene after another, powered by an outstanding cast that gets the most out of their characters. MacMurray is interestingly cast, against type, as a first class heel who actually is the one who started the mutiny in the first place. Van Johnson is equally engrossing as the epitome of a fall guy, not to be outdone by Jose Ferrar as a Joe Friday/Jack Webb-type attorney who brings out the real Captain Queeg.

","Although this movie has a few serious flaws, it manages to overcome them, thanks to an outstanding cast, a, snappy script, and the very serious subject matter surrounding the mental stability of a military officer. Another solid attribute is Max Steiner's score, especially the muscular themes that so magnificently accompany the sailing ships at the beginning and the end, a moving and meaningful tribute to the US Navy.<br/><br/>The movie, to me, is rather sluggish for the first half hour until Bogey finally appears as the enigmatic Lt. Commander Queeg. If you're a fellow Bogey fan, you can count on another one of his many outstanding performances to maintain your interest to the end.<br/><br/>The sub-plot involving Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis) and May Wynn (the actual name of the actress is also May Wynn) is not only unnecessary but goes so far as to degrade the rest of the film, preventing it from being the great work that it otherwise would be. Although ""I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me"" is a sweet, little ditty, couldn't Ms. Wynn just sing the song as a nightclub act without all of the rest? And is the excursion to Yosemite merely a deliberate attempt to offer viewers relief from the claustrophobia of the dilapidated ship or a promotional ad by the National Park Service? Notice that there were no mobs of tourists and exasperating traffic jams at Yosemite back in 1954. It must have been nice, but I wouldn't know.<br/><br/>No wonder that Bogey fought for this role and agreed to accept reduced compensation for it. He was undoubtedly drawn by the challenge of Queeg's complicated character and circumstances, so, in response, how could we as viewers not appreciate his captivating portrayal of Queeg? He also receives strong support from Van Johnson as Lt. Steve Maryk in one of his best performances ever, from Fred MacMurray, as the pompous, cynical, and gutless Lt. Tom Keefer, from Jose Ferrer as Maryk's reluctant and conscience stricken defense lawyer, Lt. Barney Greenwald, and, last but not least, from Tom Tully as Queeg's dedicated but sea weary predecessor, Commander de Vriess. Do you remember Tully as Ginger Rogers' kindly, understanding uncle in the very melancholy ""I'll Be Seeing You""? These two memorable and widely differing roles demonstrate the depth of Tully's overlooked acting ability. On the other hand, Francis is painfully out of his league with this seasoned bunch.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal too much about the military trial to those who haven't seen the movie, but no matter how psychologically unstable Lt. Commander Queeg may be, especially at a moment of crisis, the question of a possible combat disability inevitably arises, and it's up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. Should an officer's disability be ignored until he becomes a very real threat to his ship and to the lives of his men? The answers to the questions raised here are not simple, and the lack of clarity at the end adds to the movie's thought-provoking depth.<br/><br/>And what of Lt. Tom Keefer, the derisive and disdainful novelist-intellectual who instigates the humiliating campaign against Queeg but then lacks the ""guts"" to stand up and to take responsibility for his actions? I couldn't help from wondering whether the original novelist, Herman Wouk, questioned his own position as a writer who hides from the line of fire behind the safety shield of a typewriter. See this one for the intelligence of its challenging content, for its hard hitting dialogue, and for the exceptionally talented cast, at least for the most part, who successfully bring a powerful script to life."

Only in his mid fifties when he surveyed this role, he was near the end of his life, and looked it. Haggard, no doubt from many years of smoking, drinking, and the Hollywood lifestyle, it was sad to see. But, as always, he delivered. The rest of the cast gave exceptional performances, to a man, the dialogue was literate, and the courtroom scenes riveting. The scenes shot at sea were also realistic, and well done. Really, a superb film that, although I've seen it several times over the years, never fails to entertain. And Mae Wynn was a doll, although her career was brief, and the young Robert Francis might have had a long and distinguished career had not fate intervened.

","Thirty-eight years before Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson stood trial as Colonel Jessup in Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men, Humphrey Bogart delivered a parallel and equally magical performance as Lt. Commander Queeg in The Caine Mutiny. Both films center around the trial of subordinate officers and enlisted men who did what they thought right. Both films featured memorable performances that highlighted the strength of their supporting casts. If anything, one might say A Few Good Men's writer Aaron Sorkin used The Caine Mutiny as a source of divine inspiration. Above all, The Caine Mutiny remains a viable source of discussion on leadership and an admirable work of art.
The film takes place during the deadly Pacific island hopping campaign of World War II. When newly appointed Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) is assigned to a minesweeping ship, the USS Caine, he immediately realizes the ship and its crew are in poor shape. Very soon, the ship's captain is relieved and replaced by Lt Commander Queeg (Bogart). At first the captain seems rational, but as time goes on, his erratic behavior and mental unsteadiness show through, putting the vessel in risk of destruction. During a typhoon, Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson) and Lt. Keefer (Fred Mac Murray) decide remove the captain of command to save the ship, a mutinous act for which they could be hanged.
Bogart delivers arguably the most realistic performance of his career in his portrayal of paranoia and fear. He highlights the negative aspects of toxic leadership. Everything, from the accurate portrayal of ship life to the disconnect between officers and enlisted sailors, is palpable. The film uses real ships, attack boats, and uniforms (thanks to the US Navy) lending even more realism to the two hour drama. The only distracting element is Ensign Keith's on and off again relationship with a woman back at his home port. The choice to include this in the script seems as though it was meant to highlight the officer's humanity and remind the audience what he is fighting for. But for me, those scenes are long, distracting, and rather drab.
The Caine Mutiny features Bogart at his best. It is hard to fathom that the actor had cancer during the film's production. Still, the USS Caine and her crew have stood the test of time. The film is equally as enjoyable and relevant as it was nearly 50 years ago."

","Another of the films my father goes on about, so this one's for you, dad and while I can see why he reveres it so much, found some flaws in it which slightly lessened my admiration for it. Undoubtedly a brave film, with its implicit criticism of US Navy practices, the film of course has much wider points of view to posit on themes of heroism, duty and loyalty, but muddies its own waters along the way so that it misses some of its marks, rather like the Caine itself on some of its training exercises. <br/><br/>The faults of the film as I see them are a rather unnecessary sub-plot on fresh-out-of-naval-college Ensign Keith's love-life, the insertion of perhaps just too much stock footage and the lack of motive shown by amateur philosopher-cum-doctor-cum-writer Fred McMurray, who to me seems miscast here in an it-doesn't-work against-type role as the cry- wolf Iago encouraging others to wrest Bogart's faltering Captain from duty on the grounds of what is called throughout ""paranoia"", but what today we would recognise as battle- fatigue.<br/><br/>Aptly, therefore, the film has delusions of Shakespearean grandeur in its plotting and characterisation and has at its heart a performance from Bogart that would grace any production of the Bard. He takes almost half an hour to make us entrance but dominates the action from then on with a marvellous twitchy performance which reminded me of no- one so much as tricky Richard Nixon. Van Johnson is excellent too as his usurper Maryk, but baby-faced Richard Francs as Keith lacks gravitas, Jose Ferrer is too showy as the defending solicitor who gives Queeg enough rope to hang himself while McMurray fails to resolve his character's moral contradictions by acting in the one sardonic key throughout.<br/><br/>After the riveting trial scene, although itself is let down by the crude insertion of Queeg's glowing testimonial appraisal of Maryk which comes from nowhere, the film really founders as you detect the heavy hand of the Navy ""censor"" on the tiller when firstly McMurray's Keefer weaselly drops in on the celebration of Maryk and Keith's ""Not Guilty"" verdict, still failing to explain his motives but gets accepted by the guys and then Ferrer punctures the mood with a clumsy ""don't judge him too harshly"" speech at once admonishing Queeg and indicting Keefer so that they might as well have re-run the pre-titles legend reminding us that the US Navy never has and by implication, never could countenance a mutiny.<br/><br/>To some extent I can forgive the whitewash conclusion as a necessary sop to the authorities at the time (so that the movie could get made at all), but looked at today, the compromises seem excessive and blunt the moral message of the movie. That and some suspect failings in character motivation and development ultimately work to its demerit but looking past these failings and bolstered by Bogart's courageous playing of an accidental villain, there's still much to enjoy here."
"JKwiat5787","Null","1","1","10 June 2008"," A couple of points...
","I've seen this movie many times, and generally have lots of good things to say about it. Everyone who's seen it knows how good the acting was, especially Humprey Bogart, who, so I'm told, was wracked with pain from cancer at this time. I more remember Fred McMurray as the kindly father from 'My Three Sons' and as the 'Absent-Minded Perfesser' so it was refreshing to see him do a different role and do it well. Probably the next best performance was by Van Johnson, as the executive officer, loyal to his captain at first, who, in the end, jeopardizes his career in his attempt to save what seems to him a foundering vessel. But there are a couple of things I want to say, all regarding the 'yellow stain' incident.<br/><br/>One, unless I performed as badly as the Commander Queeg had in that incident, he would have lost my respect as well. He performed the acts of a coward in a combat situation when all around him were functioning properly. Coupled with what else happened, of course he lost the respect of his officers. There is a difference between deference to authority and true respect for one's leaders. That's why unpopular officers in Vietnam ended up being murdered by their own men. (Of course, the general discipline breakdown of the army in Vietnam bred these things). <br/><br/>Two, when this happened, the entire Fifth Fleet, our 'sledgehammer in the Pacific', was supposedly on hand, supporting this landing. Ships and aircraft are everywhere. Am I to understand that nobody but the crew of the 'Caine' knew what was going on? Somebody, somewhere, MUST have seen the ship drop that dye marker and retire at high speed, and wondered 'Hey, what's that old destroyer doing? I've never seen anybody do that in an amphibious landing. Are they supposed to be doing that? The ship doesn't look like she's been hit...what's going on?'<br/><br/>Lastly, I think it IS possible for a coward, in peacetime, to rise to the command of a military unit, especially a small one like a destroyer-minesweeper. Does anybody know how well they will perform when they realize that people are actually trying to kill them? I've always talked a good fight but since I've never been in combat I can't guarantee that I wouldn't be the biggest chicken in any outfit. I think, given human nature, the people who accurately predict that they will perform poorly in combat will outnumber those who will predict accurately that they will perform well in the same situation. the real surprise comes, I think, when the soldier in combat finds he CAN function in his first engagement. But then there's also that reaction to having killed your first man..."

","If it weren't so tragic and serious, I could see ""The Caine Mutiny"" being a comedy in the tradition of ""Hogan's Heroes.""<br/><br/>That being said, Humphrey Bogart gave a masterful performance as the mentally deranged leader of the ship. Makes you wonder how a person this ill could assume such an important position.

As would happen 6 years later, Fred Mac Murray was passed over in the supporting category again for ""The Apartment.""<br/><br/>Bogart's in and out behavior was well done here. His distorted face and handling of his arms gave us a devastating performance of a commander who is in deep emotional trouble. We see all the signs- the emotional outbursts, asking for apologies, degrading subordinates by calling them all kinds of names, constant agitation, need for perfection, picking on the asinine so as to get a reputation as a solid leader, Bogart finally cracks on the witness stand just as Ida Lupino did in the 1942 classic, ""They Drive By Night.""<br/><br/>E.G. Marshall seems to have made a career as an attorney. Did he ever go to law school and take the bar exam? Jose Ferrer is engaging as Barney Greenwald, the attorney for Van Johnson-accused of leading the mutiny against Captain Queeg. (Bogart.) During his outbursts, Queeg would certainly give you that queasy feeling. As for Ferrer, he even looks Jewish to match his name!<br/><br/>I found the picture to be average, with a love story thrown in.

","Though most of the action takes place aboard a mine sweeper in the 'junkyard Navy', the real drama occurs in the tense courtroom scene and it's aftermath in ""The Caine Mutiny"". The spiral of events that result in Captain Queeg's (Humphrey Bogart) mental breakdown at first has the viewer sympathizing with Communications Officer Keefer (Fred MacMurray) and Executive Officer Maryk (Van Johnson). That however is turned entirely on it's head by the cunning insight of defense attorney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer) once the military trial is over. The film will test your willingness to accept first impressions and brings to mind that things are not always what they seem.<br/><br/>The military court scene is brilliantly done. When Queeg reaches for the steel worry beads, the sound of the metal clacking will be enough to create the doubt needed in the minds of the military judges as to his fitness for command. Up to that point though, it looked like Queeg's service reputation was a slam dunk to send Maryk and Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) to a court martial or worse.<br/><br/>Here's a question - when Bogey's character becomes determined to expose the strawberry thief on board ship, where did he get sand from to conduct the experiment? Why not sugar, it was already part of the mess menu. Just wondering.<br/><br/>Seeing Lee Marvin and Claude Akins in non-descript early roles as 'Meatball' and 'Horrible' aboard the mine sweeper was a treat for this viewer, along with the uncredited appearance of character actor James Best. Fine performances are also put in by E.G. Marshall as Commander Challee at the trial, and Tom Tully who book ends his role in the film as Commander DeVriess.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart's performance as the tortured Queeg earned a Best Actor nomination, and in fact was his most stirring performance in a military themed film. Apart from his gangster persona, Bogey also did quite well in ""Action in the North Atlantic"" (1943); ""Sahara"" (1943); and ""Battle Circus"" (1953). All are recommended by this fan of the actor."

However, Maryk turns to him and suggests that the three of them take the boat over to the aircraft carrier to tell the admiral about Capt. Queeg. As Maryk is telling this to Keefer, watch how that self satisfied grin slowly turns to concern and alarm. Keefer felt self assured and ""in charge"" as long as the dirty little secret stayed aboard the Caine.

","The board has voted and the result is unanimous.  This film has been thoroughly reviewed here, but having seen it this evening again on tv I feel the need to put in my two cents worth.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have read the novel, some haven't.  I'm in the former category, in spades.  One wonders how Wouk could have dropped the ball so badly after writing such a great first novel.<br/><br/>The play ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"" drops the Willie Keith story entirely, a sensible decision.  But Willie is the central character of the novel.  The film is flawed by including his character and love interest at all at the same time it revolves around the concept of all star casting.<br/><br/>Willie is not supposed to be a handsome callow youth.  He is in fact overweight and suffers from lordosis.  He only gets into the navy because the doctor feels guilty that he kept Willie waiting all day.  Willie should look a little like the actor who plays Alfred in Miracle on 34th Street. Richard Dreyfuss might have managed the part.  This very complex, almost Shakespearean plot involves not only everything that the movie shows, but Willie's coming of age.  In fact, at the end, he captains and then decomissions the Caine as a much changed young man.  <br/><br/>It must have been an impossibility for the producers to reconcile everything within Wouk's incredible novel.  But instead of their silly compromise with pretty boy Robert Francis and ""May Wynn,"" they should have written a whole new character who is seen only in the context of the dynamics of the Caine. That's major re-writing, but if you can get those kinds of performances out of an all-star cast that knocks your socks off, the other obvious adjustment should have been there too."

","I'd pit Jose Ferrer's lawyer Greenwald (the defense counsel in THE CAINE MUTINY) all by himself against the three attorneys of A FEW GOOD MEN. That Cruise/Nicholson film has many redeeming features, but it is rather shy about the issues of shared responsibility and what purpose authority (good, bad, or insane) serves. The CAINE MUTINY goes after the matter head on, and doesn't get lost hero-worshipping the attorneys (like FEW GOOD MEN does). Bogart is excellent as the Caine's captain, and Fred MacMurray smiles and charms his way perfectly in the role of Tom Keefer. Which one of them is the real coward? Van Johnson is also very good as Maryk, the officer that subverts his captains authority in the middle of a typhoon. The film, despite the very good acting of the leads and the tight, gripping courtroom section, is burdened with a slow-moving romantic subplot. It sometimes seems like quite a nuisance, as if some other film somehow crept in. There is also the very old-fashioned special effects during the typhoon, which stand out badly. They may have been cutting-edge in 1954, but versus the computer-generated illusions of today they simply look too much like toy model boats. Regardless of the dated visuals and awkward romance, this tale is still a  remarkable movie. By the time Attorney Greenwald drunkenly thunders out the REAL judgment at the end, the slicker, carefully paced (and modern) A FEW GOOD MEN seems shallower and obviously imitative."

"sldmseen","7","1","1","2 May 2000"," Bogart, crew, & navy shine, but love interest sinks.
","First things first here.  The beginning expository on Ensign Keith and his ensuing love interest with the singer May is absolutely annoying, and persistent up until the climax.  It manages to be both laughable and pedantic at the same time; a real slice of cinema's version of 50's love and americana.  My guess is that it was inserted to broaden the movie's appeal or extend its length, since almost all of the scenes involved can be removed without interrupting the real narrative here.<br/><br/>And the ""real narrative"" here sure is something.  I'm sure from the other comments here you know the story, so let's look at performances.  Ensign Keith, sorry to say, is ineffectual, but his ""new man on board"" character is needed to give us the perspective to watch the interplay between XO Van Johnson and Com Officer Keefer Fred McMurray, in a very nuanced role that shows a great ability to convey malevolence under a seemingly benign surface.  Johnson is solid but uninteresting as the staid, honor-bound officer deciding between loyalty to his CO and duty to his crew and the navy.  The XO's lawyer, Jose Ferrer as Greenwald, is slightly over the top, but appropriate to the task at hand.<br/><br/>The best part and signature role here is of course Bogart's as Capt. Queeg. Failing to see the malevolence of Keefer in their midst, the officers writhe under Queeg's ever more paranoid persona.  Bogart's small frame manages to own the screen in the presence of these larger men simply by sheer force of will.  In fact, in the courtroom scene climax, as he describes how all the men were against him, the shot is a close-up from below with nothing but Queeg's head and shoulders and ravings all about him.  At this point, though, we've nothing but pity for a man too many years at sea.  Finally, Keefer is laid out as the true villain and coward by Greenwald, and we understand how, in a way, all the crew really was against Queeg from the start.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart and makes people continue to watch it is Bogart playing a magnificent example of a navy man fallen, and wonderful counterpoint of McMurray as a cowardly Iago to the crew of the Caine.  Just wish we could edit out that love interest."

Aside from such quibbling, the story is gripping and builds nicely to the climactic courtroom scene. Good work all around from Fred McMurray (whose memory will unfortunately always be sullied by ""My Three Sons""), Jose Ferrer and Van Johnson, and of course Bogart in his quintessential role as Captain Queeg. Robert Francis as Ensign Keith is a tad too earnest, in a Boy Scout sort of way, for my taste, though this is doubtless what they were looking for in the part (I note thru IMDB that his career ended with his untimely death in a plane crash shortly after this movie was made). This really is - to use the overworked term - a classic."

","Life aboard a warship in wartime is tense.  If a captain starts to show signs of extreme eccentricity, what is his subordinate officer supposed to do?  Obey orders, no matter how ludicrous, or damaging to ship's morale? Continue to respect the captain's rank, while despising the man?  Article 184 of the US Navy Code (in 1943, at least) provided for a subordinate to relieve a commanding officer against the latter's will.  However, the tiniest error of judgment in invoking Article 184 would render such a course of action nothing less than mutiny ... and mutiny is a capital offence.<br/><br/>    Newly-commissioned Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) is a blonde, athletic, all-American boy who believes in the Navy and wants to do well.  He is dismayed to learn that he has been assigned to the USS Caine, a rustbucket minesweeper with an unkempt, ill-disciplined crew.  To make matters worse, the quirky Captain De Vriess takes against the new ensign.  Oddball skipper and oddball crew love each other, and Keith despairs of ever seeing the Caine ship-shape.  When De Vriess is suddenly replaced by Lieutenant-Commander Queeg, young Keith assumes that his troubles are over. In fact, they have just begun ...<br/><br/>    Humphrey Bogart is memorable as Queeg, the urbane martinet who goes to pieces under the slightest pressure.  It did not often fall to Bogart's lot to play weak men, but here he shows that his repertoire is large and varied.<br/><br/>    The true star of the film is not Bogart, or even Jose Ferrer as Greenwald, the sharp lawyer.  It is Van Johnson, playing to perfection the part of Steve Meryck, the ideal officer.  Not especially bright or mentally flexible, Meryck is none the less a diamond of a man, reliable in a crisis, firm but fair with subordinates, a man to whom integrity comes as naturally as breathing.  Pulled one way by his strong ethical sense and innate loyalty, and in the opposite direction by a desire to protect his ship and his crew, Meryck's tormented conscience is the heartland of the film. Johnson is utterly believable as this decent but limited man.  As the seeds of doubt begin to germinate in his mind, the mutiny takes shape.  Two great symbols mark the climax of the story - firstly the storm at sea which represents the emotional tempest on the bridge of the Caine, and secondly Meryck's wrenching of the controls from the 'frozen' hand of the skipper.<br/><br/>    A great cast includes Fred MacMurray as Keefer and Lee Marvin, graduating to speaking parts, as Meatball.  Keefer is the ironic, detached intellectual who shows his true colours under pressure.  Marvin is Marvin, and we wouldn't want him any other way.<br/><br/>    The scene in which the trio of proto-mutineers visits Admiral Halsey's flagship is a feast for the eyes in a film strong on visuals.  The massive carrier looms over the tiny launch, emphasising the moral authority of the Navy and the tenuous nature of the mutinous enterprise.  The colourful deck parade is not only visually pleasing, it underlines the eccentricity and unimportance of the Caine.<br/><br/>    Several aspects of the court-martial fail to ring true.  Lawyers do not order their clients to plead in a certain way - it is the client who instructs the advocate.  The order in which the witnesses give evidence may contain a certain dramatic logic, but it makes no legal sense at all. Greenwald tells Queeg all about a document before asking the witness to identify it, and makes points in cross-examination which should properly be left until his closing speech.<br/><br/>    Edward Dmytryk, one of the blacklisted 'un-American' directors of the McCarthy era, put together in 'Caine' a motion picture of outstanding quality.  The strong Max Steiner score includes the jaunty Caine theme. Real-life combat footage is seamlessly spliced into the amphibious landing sequence.  Perhaps the shipboard drama needs the change of air provided by the Yosemite interlude, but I for one found the love interest to be ... well, uninteresting.  Apart from this, the Stanley Roberts screenplay is strong, drawing as it does on both the Herman Wouk novel and the subsequent stage play.<br/><br/>    The intense close-up of the sick man as the crack-up begins, and the haunting rattle of the ball-bearings, are powerful dramatic devices.  The up-beat ending stresses the continuity of Navy life and the inherent resilience of the American Way.<br/><br/>    Great stuff."

","So World War II, the biggest event of the century, just ended and the best film topic they had was a fictional mutiny on an tow ship that does nothing? You couldn't find any compelling real-life stories, eh?<br/><br/>Tsk tsk. This courtroom drama could be interesting if the viewers are kept in doubt as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, for example in 12 Angry Men (1957). But the first half of the film demonstrates it clearly, at a very slow pace. Humphrey Bogart, the subject of the mutiny, doesn't even come onto the ship for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Then, he's supposed to be crazy but the way it's dramatized and acted just isn't that thrilling. Even the scene where they might lose the ship itself somehow is underdone, lacking the witty dialogue and tension of, for example, the mutinies in Crimson Tide (1995) or Star Trek (2009).<br/><br/>The courtroom scenes are pretty lackluster as well. The actors involved don't seem to get very heated and that communicates. The romantic side plot adds nothing. The side plot with Fred MacMurray is supposed to be a shocker but is both telegraphed beforehand and brushed off as nothing afterwards. Also, I'm sorry to say it, but thrillers and special effects have come a long way in 60 years. The film shows its age.<br/><br/>I would give the film a watchable 5 or 6 if it weren't for the preachy tone at the end. I won't spoil the ending for you, but the verbal sparring about incompetency vs. mental illness vs. duty vs. showing respect for those who sacrificed just didn't move me. (That being said, the high point of the film with Bogart's speech was dead on.)<br/><br/>I'm forced to give The Caine Mutiny an unwatchable 4 out of 10, sort of a bonus 5 for failing to do a WWII story that's in any way relevant or actual."
"dgl1199","9","3","6","18 March 2009"," I give it 9 strawberries and 2 silver balls
","Not a perfect film, and not the greatest acting, but clever and interesting nonetheless. Humphrey Bogart is Lt. Commander Queeg, a career officer who assumes command of an aging WWII warship, the USS Caine. Caine is a rusty, combat fatigued, holdover from the previous war. Built as a destroyer and converted to wartime use as a minesweeper. Queeq replaces his predecessors competent yet relaxed style of cammand with a by-the-book, structured, attempt to re-affirm military deportment, efficiency, and morale. It gradually becomes evident that Queeg is not wrapped too tight. His rigid, officious nature reveals quirks in his personality readily identified by another officer, an amiable, aspiring author, and by extension self-dubbed ""judge of human nature"", as characteristics of mental illness. A hasty retreat during a combat operation, a ship-wide search for the fictitious perpetrator behind a quart of missing strawberries, and the Caine's severing of a tow line during target practice deepen the crew's doubts about the new captain's competency and mental solvency. It all comes to a head during a Pacific typhoon after Queeg is paralyzed with fear and indecision, ignoring his XO's pleas to make maneuvers to prevent the ship from capsizing. He is relieved of his command by his XO who, backed up by the young OOD Ensign Keith, once a staunch fan of Queeg, immediately issues the necessary orders to save the Caine. Upon return to the states a court martial is ordered, charging the XO and Keith with conspiracy to commit mutiny.<br/><br/>The screenplay obviously struggled to translate the story to film. It is replete with staggered logic and unclear motivations. Why does no one mention during the court martial that Queeq froze like a Popsicle in the storm? This was the cassus belli of the mutiny. Casting was hit or miss. Bogart speaks of his days as a ""lowly ensign"" a mere 7 years earlier, yet by the time of filming the man is clearly old enough to play an admiral. Queeq is supposed to be around 30 years old. Although Bogart had some memorable moments, his casting choice remains bewildering. However his breakdown on the witness stand remains one of my favorite moments in any film. Fred MacMurray was a great choice as the duplicitous Lt. Keifer, the author and antagonist behind Queeqs dismissal, and who like Peter to Jesus, denies later he had anything to do with it. His intentions are crystal clear, to punish the Navy whom he hated. Van Johnson's portrayal of Lt. Maryck, the XO, was excellent although he tends to vacillate from loyal, competent, naval officer to intellectual twit a little too much. Robert Francis played a respectable green Ensign Keith. His character makes a nice arc, albeit wooden, from a freshly frocked officer eager to please Queeq to secondary mutineer. Francis died too young. He might have developed himself into a more nuanced actor with a bit more range and depth. The romantic subplot involving him and May Wynn was useless, unnecessary, and boring as hell. The best actor in this film is Jose Ferrer, the naval lawyer who defends Maryck and does so magnificently. His blend of starch and humanism was the most real of any of the characters. His performance in the post trial scene as he drunkenly confronts the ""man who should have been on trial"" was absolutely spectacular. <br/><br/>Overall the film is very viewable and entertaining. It does have a nice flow and pace to it. The fact that it was largely filmed on actual U.S. navy warships makes it even more watchable. Although it does not do justice to the original tale in terms of character development or dialog. Caine Mutiny does pay off in the end as all roads lead to Keifer. Highly recommend to bright boys everywhere. Kay?"

Keefer, must surely have felt about their actions. It is almost as if when Jose Ferrer berates all the officers, he is berating the audience as well. Captain Queeg is a fascinating character from the moment he brings those little silver balls out of his pocket in his first meeting with his officers. From the beginning of his tour of duty, his own actions begin to call his judgment into question. By the time of the penultimate scene during the typhoon, the audience is likely to be convinced that Lt. Maryk and the other officers had every reason to commit the mutiny. Lt. Greenwald does such a masterful job of making Captain Queeg reveal his paranoia on the stand that the audience still floats along thinking that the mutiny was the right thing to do. But by the time Lt. Greenwald speaks at the party, the audience is shown another perspective--that the whole mutiny was the logical result of the initial doubts that Lt. Keefer put in Lt. Maryk's mind earlier on and that maybe Captain Queeg, as an honored Naval officer, deserved more respect after all. Sure, Captain Queeg was eccentric, but did he really deserve to be the victim of a mutiny? Of course, the only way to know for sure would have been to not have the mutiny, continue to follow the Captain's orders, and see whether or not the Caine would have survived the storm. If the Caine sank, then Queeg should have been relieved of his duties by mutiny. I don't know if the odds would have been worth it for all the officers and crew of the Caine."

He is totally believable as Captain Queeg, who is guilty of mutiny. Was he insane or just misunderstood? Queeg's final crack up on the witness stand at Lt. Maryk's court martial is justifiably famous, and is among the great scenes in cinema. It is now impossible for any character in any film to play with a pair of steel balls and not think of Bogart. Look for Lee Marvin, Jerry Paris and Claude Akins in supporting roles. This is excellent entertainment and should not be missed.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart absolutely dominates the screen with one of the finest performances of his career. Most of the fan and critic polls I have seen over the years of the greatest movie stars of all time invariably place Bogart in the number one spot, and when you see him in this role it is easy to see why. Yet you contrast this film with THE MALTESE FALCON or THE BIG SLEEP, and you realize that he had a capacity to play a surprisingly wide range of roles.<br/><br/>Conclusion - Film acting simply doesn't get better than this.

","Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, Robert Francis, and Jose Ferrer are all involved in one way or another with ""The Caine Mutiny,"" a 1954 film directed by Edward Dmytryk and based on the Herman Wouk novel.<br/><br/>Bogart is Captain Queeg, who follows the no-nonsense Comdr. DeVriess (Tom Tully) as captain of The Caine, a worn out minesweeper. It becomes apparent almost immediately that he's not all there, particularly by Lt. Keefer (MacMurray), who's writing a novel in his spare time. I suppose today we would call Queeg burnt out from years of service on difficult missions. He's okay one minute, and the next he's got the ship running away from battle or conducting an exhaustive search for a strawberry pilferer. During a raging typhoon, he loses control of the ship and himself - in fact, his hand has to be pried off of an instrument, and he gives orders that would, if followed, sink the ship. The second in command, Lt. Maryk (Johnson) takes over the ship over Rule 184 of the Naval code, and everyone follows his orders. A court martial, with Lt. Greenwald (Ferrer) defending Maryk against his better judgment.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what to say about the conclusion of this film and Greenwald's drunken speech, but it's an excellent movie with marvelous performances by all involved. Bogart is stupendous as the whacked out Queeg, and his increasing discomfort during testimony is masterful. The always likable Van Johnson does a great dramatic turn here, as does Fred MacMurray. I used to think of Fred MacMurray as the world's most bland actor - having seen a lot of his work now, he definitely could go well beyond ""My Three Sons."" His manipulative Keefer is central to the film. Robert Francis, who died at the age of 25 in a plane crash the following year, plays a newcomer to the Navy, Ensign Keith. Boyishly handsome and all-American looking, Francis was a perfect military type, and if his acting wasn't stupendous, he fit well into this type of film and held his own against the vets. He has an extraneous subplot involving a singer (May Wynn) whom he's in love with. Lee Marvin has a small role, but his knowledge of the Navy made him important, and he served as an unofficial adviser on the film.<br/><br/>This is a complicated psychological drama that bears a good deal of thought. We who are not in the military or from military families undoubtedly cannot fathom the seriousness of an actual mutiny. The question is asked indirectly if it could have been avoided and blames everyone involved. Whether or not it could have been avoided, who knows. The fact is, Queeg couldn't handle his assignment. Since he wasn't going to say anything to the higher-ups, I suppose it would have been best if the others had gone to the Admiral as they planned and succeeded in getting him removed. Would they have succeeded? I wonder how likely that scenario is - possibly not very likely. So we're left with a bunch of people going down with their ship rather than cross the captain.<br/><br/>In the end, The Caine Mutiny is the story of courage - Queeg had courage but suffered from battle fatigue; Maryk had the courage to make a controversial decision, but let himself be talked out of approaching the Admiral by Keefer; and Keefer was a yellow-bellowed sap sucker. It falls to Keith, the newcomer, to learn important lessons from each man. He starts by standing up to his mother - seeing his growth is probably the reason for the subplot."
"Whythorne","6","2","4","6 January 2008"," Excellent plot and script crippled by awful soundtrack
","""The Caine Mutiny"" is an excellent example of one of those movies that has a lot going for it but is hindered by a few unsuccessful elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the biggest culprit is one of the most annoying soundtracks ever composed. The music gives this film a cheap and dated quality. It is brassy, much, MUCH too loud, and occupies far too much time in the film. Further, it continually uses the same obnoxious theme melody throughout, with some excerpts of familiar military themes (marine's hymn, reveille, etc.) thrown in from time to time...all done in an overblown manner. It is an incredible distraction to a film that otherwise would be quite excellent. And because of its invasive, irritating nature, it is impossible to ignore it.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good for the most part with a couple of exceptions, most notably the part of Ensign Keith played by Francis. Francis is one of those typical young actors in the mold of a Tab Hunter that seemed to be much sought-after during the fifties. Unfortunately, he was a very poor actor. If this was a minor role, it would not be such a problem. But the Keith character is a central one. In addition to his role aboard the ship, he is utilized for a subplot involving a romantic conflict between his girlfriend and cloying mother. Actually, the film's story would have benefited by the exclusion of this subplot altogether.<br/><br/>But the soundtrack is the biggest drawback. It is unfortunate, because the story of a ship's officers growing increasingly disgruntled with their Captain Queeg, their eventual taking control of the ship, and the subsequent court martial trial is actually quite riveting and otherwise worth seeing. It's sort of like watching your favorite team playing in the championship game, while a fan behind you is blowing an airhorn in your ear."

The direction which was made by Edward Dmytryk was very good and he presented very well the mentality of the captain and how his behavior and his choices affected everybody. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that for one more time Humphrey Bogart who played as Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Van Johnson's who played as Lt. Steve Maryk and Fred MacMurray's who played as Lt. Tom Keefer. Finally, I believe that ""The Caine Mutiny"" is a good movie and you should definitely have to watch it."

","The very compelling and powerful story of the events leading up to a mutiny on a World War II US Navy Destroyer-Minesweeper 'The Caine'. As the story begins the ship's captain (Bogart) has become increasingly paranoid as a result of battle fatigue. When the ship runs into a storm the officers are torn as to what action to take as the captain becomes more and more isolated and possibly a danger to the ship and crew.<br/><br/>The film was well directed by Edward Dmytryk who had made several very good noir films and received an Oscar nomination for Crossfire. This was a comeback for Dmytryk though as he had been one of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Hollywood Ten and was not only blacklisted but also imprisoned for Contempt of Congress.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the utterly convincing Humphrey Bogart who is cast completely against type as the deteriorating Captain Queeg. The remainder of the cast including Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, Tom Tully and E.G. Marshall give good performances but nothing like the performance by Bogart.<br/><br/>The film was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Herman Wouk.<br/><br/>The film would be nominated for seven Academy Awards, although it would win none. The film was also a huge commercial success.<br/><br/>At the insistence of the Department of Defense the titles at the beginning of the film tell us there has never been a mutiny upon an American Navy vessel.

"dimplet","Null","0","0","6 August 2011"," What happens when Charlie Allnut gets promoted
","We don't really know what an actor can do until they play an out of character role. In Capt. Queeg, Humphrey Bogart shows his stuff playing an anti-hero, a person we love to hate. And he does it with the modulated ambiguity needed to create uncertainty whether he is truly crazy or just a jerk. But Bogart began his career by playing such anti- heroes, so this performance is no big surprise. His real out of character performance, ironically, was in Sabrina. <br/><br/>There are some weaknesses to this film that have not aged well, mainly the psychological diagnostic babel. Was Queeg crazy? That really depends on the definition of crazy, which isn't real clear from the book consulted, which I guess was part of the point. His rigidity in following rules, and inability to change his mind in light of changing circumstances were his key problems, which might be considered a mental illness in some situations, yet is expected in the military, at least until you get to a position of command.<br/><br/>Queeg's problem was that his personality was better suited to a No. 2 in command, not the decision-maker. Yet this was not drawn out clearly in the film. These traits also showed up, ironically, in Adolf Hitler toward the end of the war: rigidity of decisions, and inability to change his mind, which some say was the result of his Parkinson's disease. <br/><br/>The Robert Francis role doesn't make sense in the film; why would a Princeton grad get assigned to a WWI rustbucket? Wikipedia's summary of the book provides the clue: He was a royal screwup in midshipman school, and the Caine was punishment. Also, his relationship with May Winn was less than honorable; in the movie it is less than pointless. Nevertheless, Robert Francis does a fine job up against some big stars in only his second movie. He died the next year. <br/><br/>The trial was interesting. You could feel the defendants losing hope, and having doubts in their own decisions, at least in terms of the definition of mutiny. There was little doubt what might have happened to the ship in the storm. Therefore, when the truth came out, it was a sufficiently interesting twist to still be surprising. <br/><br/>However, if you think about it, the Navy probably knew Queeg was a screw-up when they assigned him to the Caine, hoping to keep him out of trouble. Such behavior doesn't come out of the blue. <br/><br/>People have compared The Caine Mutiny to Mr. Roberts, with some justification. Just picturing the performances of Bogart and James Cagney side by side in my mind, two crusty old mobsters playing sea captains, brings a smile to my face. Of the two, Mr. Roberts is the stronger movie, and can be watched many times. <br/><br/>The Caine Mutiny is certainly worth watching, as is any Humphrey Bogart movie. It is a fine example of Fifties drama. But it sounds like a lot has been lost from the adaptation of the book to the screen."

The film is an excellent study of life on one of the U.S. Navy's smaller ships during World War II. However, the film has difficulty focusing on the main character. Queeg is a means to show how Willie comes of age. In the film, Willie's character becomes secondary. This explains why the love scene doesn't fit.<br/><br/>However, read the book. The movie is great. The book is excellent. It scores a 10. In the book the love story ties in. It is necessary. The ending of the book is completely different from the film.

"parachute-4","9","0","0","23 October 2006"," Bogart's masterpiece
","We all get to serve under a ""Captain Queeg"" at some point in our lives, so all audiences can identify with the characters in this story. Hermann Wouk, the author of the book, was a US submariner in WW2 and its tempting to speculate as to whether Queeg with his steel marbles was based on a real person. I think the character is most likely a composite, but so many of the sequences, like the ""strawberry incident"" ring true to anyone who has served in the armed forces or large bureaucracies.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart, ably supported by a star cast, does an masterful job with an extremely demanding role. A lesser actor could easily have killed the part and turned the film into a comedy (compare with ""Mr. Roberts"", which is INTENDED to be a semi-comedy) Bogart's Queeg isn't funny....real ship's captains never are.....but though we identify with the long-suffering crew throughout the ""action"" part of the film; by the end of the trial, we are starting to get the picture from Queeg's point of view and the US Navy's point of view, and this was always Herman Wouk's intention in the book.<br/><br/>I've always been a Fred MacMurray fan, and I rate his portrayal of the slimy Tom Keefer as top rate. Keefer is another character who we all run into sooner or later in life. I liked Tom Tully's De Vreiss (""War is hell, Willy"") and check out the young Lee Marvin as Meatball. Whether Richard Widmark would have made an even better Queeg than Humphrey Bogart is problematic. I think he would have been too laconic and nasty. Bogart's Queeg is incompetent, neurotic and high-strung, but fundamentally not a BAD person, and this is true to Hermann Wouk's literary original. (Widmark didn't miss out. Some years later he was cast as an exceptionally nasty and fatally unbalanced ship's captain) <br/><br/>In style, the film is a good, fast moving presentation let down a little (for modern audiences) by the ""toy ships in a bathtub"" typhoon sequence. However, I'm sure that state-of-the-art 2006 special effects will appear rather quaint to audiences in 2056, and in any case, how would you go about filming a shipboard sequence in a REAL typhoon.<br/><br/>This film is a true classic, and largely due to Bogart's definitive performance, it would be exceptionally difficult to produce a credible remake. They tried to sneak up on it a few years ago with one called ""The Trial of the Caine Mutiny"", but that was a flat effort and is in no way comparable to the 50's original.<br/><br/>R. B."

","When the USS Caine's Captain shows some sort of mental disorder that puts the ship in danger during a typhoon the second in command officer takes over command and faces a court martial for mutiny. Such is in a few words the story based on Herman Wouk's famous novel brought to the screen skillfully by director Edward Dmytryk.<br/><br/>""The Caine Mutiny"" turned to be a very good film that could be divided in two parts: the first one at sea where Commander Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) develops his emotional instability due to past stressing war actions that made him a sick man and his officers debate on what the correct decision should be; the second one deals with the Court Martial that Lt. Meryk (Van Johnson) has to face for taking over the ship's command. Both put together add to make this most interesting movie complete.<br/><br/>A highlight of the film is the very well selected cast. Bogart delivers a fine performance as the troubled Quegg very different from most of his other appearances in the screen. Van Johnson is good as the officer who has to make the big decision knowing what the consequences can be for him. Josè Ferrer shows his undeniable acting class as Johnson's attorney. But what really surprised me was Fred MacMurray's outstanding acting as the selfish and unreliable Lt. Tom Kieffer who encourages the mutiny but lacks the guts to sustain his position in Court; I never thought of MacMurray as much more than a correct actor but somehow he manages to build here a classic performance, probably his best ever. The scene where a drunk Ferrer confronts him for his behaviour and throws his drink at his face is memorable.<br/><br/>The romantic affair between Robert Francis (one of the Caine's young officers) and May Wynn doesn't do much for the movie but it doesn't hurt it either.<br/><br/>All in all, this is good cinema and a must enjoyable film to see every once in a while."

The innocence and style of the time is sorely missed, as is this generation of film making.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is at his best, as is Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray. Robert Francis was a fine up and coming young actor playing one of the lead characters also, who's film career was so unfortunately cut short. Among the many fine features this film offers, we see excellent reacting and authentic true to life responses to a highly realistic and credible situation aboard the confines of a war ship.<br/><br/>All the elements and characters in a fine story are present in this film, including the heroes (Johnson, Francis), the villain (MacMurray), the antagonist and disabled(Bogart), and the innovation needed by normal human beings in a highly abnormal situation.

","Starting off with one of Herman Wouk best fiction books, Edward Dmyrtryk and Stanley Kramer, produced an excellent post world war II film. Better than the majority of its ilk, typically slathered in thank yous and references to the US Navy (the Navy helped make these movies, and were an absolutely necessary partner for boats, consultants, and even extras).<br/><br/>Managing to tell its very interesting and plausible story of the first ""alleged"" mutiny on a US Navy ship, I am certain there were lengthy conversations between Kramer, Wouk and the Navy. Having said that, the film does a fine job of capturing the book's story, right down to the complex character development necessary for it all to make sense.<br/><br/>The early 1950s, a time of exuberant recovery, both economically and socially, was just the right audience for a pro-American, pro-Navy fictional film, that also challenged authority, command, and many of the foundation elements of the post WW II military machine. Without translating the movie into an attack on any of these foundations to society, a more subtle, intellectual story of intrigue, loyalty, cowardess and the applications of the Navy's strict rules, is its main story.<br/><br/>As with many of Kramer's works, the characters are well developed, interesting, and each have their own flaw that will ultimately play a role in the story. This classical method of simultaneously developing the characters, as the plot takes its twist and turns, is artfully executed by Dymytryck.<br/><br/>The two stand-out actors, however, are Jose Ferrer, the less than enthusiastic legal defender to the mutineers, and that master of complex thoughts, Humphrey Bogart. With great supporting actors, all perfectly cast, this movie moves quickly and with virtually no room for error.<br/><br/>There will be moments when the somewhat saccharine or overly sarcastic nature of the time and place get to be too much, but this is quickly over shadowed by action, intrigue and a boat load of personalities, who keep you thinking.<br/><br/>I wish that movies today had as much uniqueness and complexity as this particular film has. Bogarts character, while maybe a little tired from too many years at sea, is actually an insecure, loving man, who fails to gain the loyalty of his crew. He tries, and in ways that would win over most men, but ultimately he fails, due to the already established lack of support the crew has taken on, triggered by an individual, with an agenda, and the fear created by a mis-informed mob.<br/><br/>See this film and try to put yourself in Bogarts shoes.

This may be his finest performance - convincing, engaging, and making all the other actors look that much better. He never steals a scene, upstages the other actors, or turns this into a Bogart movie, but he is the reason this film is considered a classic. If it weren't for his portrayal of Captain Queeg I wouldn't even consider wasting my time writing comments about this film.<br/><br/>Fred MacMurray also deserves special mention in a role that many stars wouldn't have the confidence to accept - that of a weakling and a coward who slowly unravels before your eyes.

The plot is much more important.<br/><br/>What was odd to me was this love interest thing that seemed to have no place in the movie and the overbearing mom issue that was never really addressed. It's a movie about a mutiny and suddenly people are off in Yosemite romancing each other? It just didn't seem to work.<br/><br/>And then the court martial. The win was a little too easy. And the speech at the end by the defense lawyer. Hey, that captain was off his rocker, but because he'd supposedly done some other things well earlier in his career, the men on that ship were supposed to let him get them killed? And the idea that after he'd exhibited unbalanced behavior that his plea for ""help"" was supposed to be trusted by the officers and if they had listened he wouldn't have freaked out in the typhoon? Maybe, but not real plausible. I think most people would be quite wary by that time and would have trouble trusting him when he asked for help.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bogart did a fine job and there were good turns by the others, but the movie just kind of fell flat, IMHO."

","Humphrey Bogart, already seriously ill with esophageal cancer caused by a lifetime of chain smoking and chronic alcoholism, was far too old to play Captain Queeq, who was only supposed to have been an officer for seven years. Aside from the awful miscasting of the lead role - which should have gone to Richard Widmark - Tom Tully also gives an awful performance and it is a real mystery how either the talentless Bogart or Tully were nominated for Oscars. Robert Francis was very bland as the young ensign and the romance was completely irrelevant. The film is so slow, dated and boring. That homophobic racist Fred Macmurray plays his usual wooden, charmless self and Van Johnson looks even uglier than he did before. Everybody in the film is far too old. How this crapfest was nominated for seven Oscars is amazing, thankfully it didn't win any.<br/><br/>1/10 - the one and only good thing about the film is Jose Ferrer, although he doesn't appear until near the end."

","Watching this film, I found it rather easy to imagine Humphrey Bogart not playing Captain Queeg, but instead playing Richard Nixon mulling over his enemies list in lieu of the most likely suspects to have pilfered the strawberries. Bogart's intensity here is brilliant as he caroms back and forth between discipline-oriented naval officer and frightened paranoiac. His meltdown in the witness chair is one of the more memorable court-room scenes in cinematic history. While Bogie is the main event here, Jose Ferrer turns in an outstanding performance as the defense attorney. Fred McMurray is also tremendous in the role of the real ""Yellow Stain,"" Tonm Keefer. I find it fascinating that one of TV's most innocuous 60's sitcoms dads played morally deficient characters in his two best film roles (the second being the amoral Walter Neff in ""Double Indemnity"").

"m-bogaerts","Null","2","5","5 December 2004"," A great opportunity missed!
","The problem I have with this film is that I have read Herman Wouk's magnificent novel probably once too often. There is so much to think about in this masterpiece. It is a story set against the background of Pacific battles in World War II, but it is far more than that. <br/><br/>It is also a magnificent description of the way to adulthood from a brat like Willie Keith, spoiled and overprotected by a dominant mother and grown up in luxury. When he joins the Navy and falls in love with May Wynn, he has to learn what real responsibility is. However, it is not only Willie who misjudges the situation when the Caine crew falls under the command of the emotionally unstable Queeg. Both Willie and Stephen Maryk are misled by their admiration for the intellectually very strong author Tom Keefer and it is not until after the mutiny trial, when he is in command of a warship himself that he manages to grasp the full impact of the events before and during the mutiny. What did I find back of all this in Dmytryk's movie? Almost nothing. There is a bit of psychological depth in the film, but only when Queeg talks to his staff, pathetically begging for understanding and loyalty, but soon realizes how little he is understood and how much his position is undermined by his own failed leadership. Furthermore, the relation between Willie and May is so important in the novel, and in the film it is nothing more than a time-wasting intermezzo; the acting is not convincing on top; dialogues are nothing but small talk and no attention is paid to proper characterizing of Willie, to me the real protagonist of the story. I do not think this is a good film. It misses too many chances. Whether the complexity of Wouk's novel can be grasped in a motion picture of reasonable length is another question, here is maybe an interesting opportunity for a remake, another attempt, half a century later! In spite of great actors like Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray, I cannot mark this film higher than 5/10."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","1","2","4 March 2016"," Bogart and MacMurray are superb
","First off, I just watched this in Blu Ray, and although not perfect, it is a very good transfer, and I think worth the upgrade.<br/><br/>This is, perhaps, the best performance Humphrey Bogart ever put in to a film, or if not, certainly one of his best. Captain Queeg was a complex character. It's too easy to look at him just as a coward or just as a paranoid. Queeg is a rather complex character with ever-changing moods, and Bogart was able to capture all the various subtleties, including the scene where he asks for the help of his officers, but then realizes he has failed. However. the penultimate scene is, of course, in the courtroom with the ball bearings; a truly classic movie scene, and in my view it should have won Bogart the Oscar.<br/><br/>However, somewhat overlooked is the very strong performance by Fred MacMurray. MacMurray is really underrated today, but throughout his career he demonstrated time and again that he could handle comedy and drama equally well. Here, he plays a bit of a coward who pushes the other officers to act, but then doesn't help them at all. The film wouldn't have worked half as well with MacMurray.<br/><br/>The other actor here I'll give credit to is an actor I never really liked -- Jose Ferrer. I always thought the most dominant characteristic of Ferrer was his own ego, rather than his acting. However, here he was quite good as the lawyer defending Van Johnson.<br/><br/>While I don't think Van Johnson was outstanding here, he was good, and the film is a good reminder that Johnson didn't only appear in fluff comedies and romantic films. He had a number of very good dramatic films, as well.<br/><br/>I can't quite make up my mind about Robert Francis. Of course, his early death prevented us from seeing how he might have matured in Hollywood, but I felt that he was not handsome enough to be a traditional leading man. He does alright here, and it is through his eyes that we see the story.<br/><br/>I always thought this was a hard film to criticize, but upon this most recent viewing I found a significant flaw -- the court-martial segment. Next time you watch the film, pay closer attention to it. With the exception of Bogart's part of it, the courtroom segment is remarkably superficial.<br/><br/>However, all things considered, this is a very good film, and I recommend it. It's one of the rare war/military films that I watch."

Tom Keefer (Fred MacMurray) that Queeg is insane and removes him from command during a typhoon. Afterwards, Maryk is court-martialed, along with Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis), who helped him.<br/><br/>Bogie and MacMurray give excellent performances; two of the best of their long careers. Bogart was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Jose Ferrer, as the defense attorney for Maryk and Keith, makes a valiant effort at stealing the picture from Bogart. Van Johnson does quite well considering he's more known for his musical comedy roles. Tom Tully shines as Queeg's predecessor. Supporting cast includes the likes of Lee Marvin, Claude Akins, and Jerry Paris. Robert Francis is OK but perhaps comes up short alongside the powerhouse vets in the cast. His romantic subplot is the weakest part of the film. Francis' career was brief as he died in a plane crash the following year. This is his best-known work. There are a lot of memorable moments from this fine film but probably the best is Queeg's insane search for who stole some strawberries! Top cast, director, and script. A classic everybody should see."

In the movie, the scenes of the romance between Ensign Kieth and the nightclub singer add little to the plot, and not much to the character development, in the book, he was the main character, and most of the events were seen through his eyes. In fact, the book ended with him becoming the captain of the Caine on her last voyage home after the war. As noted, there were masterful performances by Humphrey Bogart and Jose Ferrer.

","It was the 9th Birthday for one of my best life friends. On or about March 31, 1955, a whole bunch of us 4th Grade Boys were invited to the Senese Family House at approximately 6200 S. Marshfield.(NO GIRLS,IF YOU PLEASE!! Uh, Yuch!!) We were all classmates at St.Theodore Grammar School, only a stones throw from their house.<br/><br/>There were 7 Senese kids, 4 boys and 3 girls. Gene ranked 3rd behind oldest Don and sister Therese.(then, after Gene we have Celeste, Geraline, Gerrard and Greg.) Their Dad, Leo Senese, was an auto mechanic working for a local Chicago Cartage Company and still had the reputation from his youth as being a really great Baseball Player(in High School). ""Hard Hitting"" Senese was how one of the local newspaper guys described him,kinda like my Dad, Clem Ryan; but that's another story.<br/><br/>We all knew that this would be a great party, as Mrs. Senese's reputation for throwing a great party was well known through various Church functions(Boy Scouts, Altar Boys, Holy Name Society, etc.); as well as their other get togethers. Every kis in attendance would be very happy with the shindig! And it is elementary that good eats, cold pop and a home made Devil's Food Birthday Cake all add up to a great time. It certainly did on this day.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't enough, we were treated to a trip to the show! In the old neighborhood, this meant the old (noe gone) Ogden Theatre at 1625 W. 63rd Street. Gene's big brother, Don(the late Donald Senese*)had been given the job of providing the escort and perform supervisory functions on the excursion.(What a great Party! I hope that scale Model B-29 Flying Fortress, World War II Bomber was enough of a present!) The Picture was THE CAINE MUTINY(Stanley Kramer Productions/Columbia Pictures 1954), which was still at the shows then, winding down its run with the neighborhood houses like the venerable Ogden. <br/><br/>I can't remember a 2nd feature, of which there usually was one. But, this was great! We had a Bugs Bunny, the Coming Attractions and this Picture, a War Movie yet! Well, with risk of sounding like an ingrate to our most gracious host Senese Family, the movie was 'all right', but a trifle short on the Action Sequences and heavy on the talk scenes. At was at least light on those ""mushy"" kissin' scenes and had hardly any girls at all! It was a number of years later, at least 25 had gone by, and we rented THE CAINE MUTINY from our local video store, Classic Video on 63rd Street & Albany. This gave a previously unheard of chance to view the film again, only this time it was with benefit of age, experience, knowledge and (we hope) wisdom. The VHS cassette afforded one the ability to watch through, no commercials for Jim Moran's Courtesy Motor Sales or Mages Sporting Goods Stores, etc. Or, the film could be re-run, stopped and re-run again.<br/><br/>More importantly, this time the film was understandable. The story line, though set in time of War, had a greater relevance to all of our human nature, no matter who we were as a people or a person. The conflict of World War II served as a most serious back drop to the human tempest we follow here.<br/><br/>The Lonely Business of Commanding Men and the roles performed by fellas from the various social stratum and all walks of life are examined in detail. We see the Service Life through the eyes of the various characters, many with flawed views or self serving agendas. Commradiere, trust, friendship, rivalry, manipulation, betrayal, exploitation and self aggrandizement are all explored as two sides to the same scales.<br/><br/>In the proverbial nutshell, a Court Martial is convened to determine the guilt or innocence of a group of subordinate Commissioned Naval Officers serving on the Mine Sweeper, the U.S.S. Caine. An incident on board ship during battle lead to the forced relief of the Commanding Officer,Lieutennant Commander Phillip Francis Queeg(Humphrey Bogart)by the next in command, Lieutennant Steve Maryk(Van Johnson). Lieutennant Tom Keefer(Fred MacMurray) and Ensign Willis Seward Keith(Robert Francis) are considered among the most culpable. Naval Staff Lawyer,Lieutennant Barney Greenblatt(Jose Ferrer) is appointed as Counsel for the Defense.<br/><br/>The Stanley Kramer Production, Directed by Edward Dmytryk of the written for the screen play by Stanley Roberts & Michael Blankfort(additional dialogue)is beautifully filmed by Frank Planer and has a vibrant, meaningful Original Theme and Incidental Musical Score by Max Steiner.<br/><br/>NOTE: * Dr. Donald Senese, Ph.D.(1942-2006).

The acting is solid from the main characters down to the smaller parts. Bogart gives a terrific performance doing a masterful balancing act with Queeg's character, not quite sane but never totally insane. The movie starts a little slow and the subplot with Francis and his girlfriend is not necessary and could have been trimmed from the film. But once the ship pulls out of harbor the real movie begins. The message of the movie could have been simple, but the intelligent screenplay reveals the complexities of the crew's behavior.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is loaded with familiar faces: E.G.

","I never tire of watching this unforgettable film which conveys a story, although fictional, could be applied to a real life situation despite it's unbelievable improbability.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as Captain Philip Francis Queeg gives one of the greatest performances in his acting career as the paranoid skipper of the minesweeper USS Caine who attempts to bring his own brand of naval discipline to a previously slovenly run ship. <br/><br/>His eccentric but quite plausible actions are interpreted by his crew as those of a dangerous psychotic fueled by the outspoken comments of know all sub exec. officer Thomas Keefer a budding novel writer played by Fred McMurray who gives an outstanding performance as the sniveling Judas who will betray his fellow officers in a future court martial of of Executive Officer Lt.Steve Maryk well played by Van Johnson.<br/><br/>When Maryk relieves Queeg of his command at the height of a typhoon he is charged with mutiny and reluctantly defended by Jose Ferrer as Lt. Barney Greenwald . Greenwald is brilliant with his eloquent prose who torpedoes Queeg's testimony at the naval tribunal and exposes his failure of command.<br/><br/>At a following dinner attended by the Caine's officers, Greenwald turns up somewhat inebriated and remorseful as the result of his successful court action and uses the occasion to denounce Keefer in a toast by throwing a glass of wine in his face. This is one of the most riveting scenes in the film and a perfectly natural sequel to a well told drama. Robert Francis as Ensign Willie Seward Keith gives this film it's principal, moral in the story theme as the newly enlisted naive naval officer who quickly learns that the real U.S. Navy is very different to the fundamentals he learned at the naval academy.<br/><br/>Along with the stirring musical march score by Max Steiner so descriptive of the Navy just tops off this film as one of the finest productions of all time."

","""The Caine Mutiny"" is a great Film, make no mistake about it.

Jose Ferrer shines as Greenwald.<br/><br/>There is one element missing from the film and that is the underlying theme of anti-semitism.  Having viewed a television presentation of ""the Caine Mutiny Court Martial"" from the 1950s(with Lloyd Nolan as brilliant as Bogart was as Captain Queeg), the anti-semitism was placed right out on the table with  Judge Advocate Challee stating that  Greenwald was a pretty good Lawyer ""for a Jew"".  <br/><br/>In the film version Greenwald's confrontation with Keefer is an interpreted as an act of Greenwald's conscience getting to him.  In the Play, Greenwald(played wonderfully by Barry Sullivan) reveals his true feelings. He tells us  ""Adolph Hitler goal was to conquer the world and rid it of Jewish 'Vermin' and melt them down to soap. And while Hitler was marching through Europe, who was on the home front protecting Mrs Greenwald from this maniac.  Was it her son Barney?

I owed him better.  He kept Adolph Hitler form washing his hands with my mother""<br/><br/>This film was made with the co-operation of the US Navy.  They rejected several versions of the story until Stanley Roberts came up with an acceptable one(and got an oscar nomination for it).  the addition of these elements into Greenwald's speech along with the depiction of navy personnel may have been too much of a cross to bear for the US Navy.<br/><br/>Although anti-semitism and other racial biases had been the subject of previous films, it was avoided here.  <br/><br/>""The Caine Mutiny"" is a great film that still holds up today.

","Watching Van Johnson's confusion, his desperate attempts to do the right thing and his inability to understand when things go wrong make his perhaps the best performance in ""Caine"". But the gradations get pretty fine, since his, Bogart, MacMurray and Ferrer each are career making acting displays: none really need to put anything else on their resume. The nuanced writing allows situations to appear to be one thing, only to turn out entirely differently--this movie is full of contradictions. The bad guy isn't really the bad guy, the good guys are far from good, and even the savior, Jose Ferrer, turns in a magic tirade near the end that really shatters any hope of the viewer trying to keep a straight good-evil dichotomy mindset. In fact, the long speech he makes could easily have turned preachy and didactic, but the clever writing and his strong acting avoided that. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the flaw in the movie is much as others have noted: it has an enormous hole in the center where the main character is supposed to be. Ensign Keith is a poor character and Robert Francis plays him horribly. Good enough for B Movie Westerns and Sci Fi, but simply not in the same league as everyone else. And the love story should have been edited out--it's distracting and pointless. There is some argument for having a vapid character kind of surveying the events, as a kind of stand in for the viewer, but here it kind of empties out the center of the movie, only the strong performances of the other actors and the writing keep the whole thing from imploding, collapsing into a big mess. <br/><br/>Bogie of course should have won an Oscar for that performance, really remarkable. His later work is too often overlooked, as it is his best. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge Herman Wouk (author of the book) fan and usually find his writing to be a bit bloated and dry.

"fred-houpt","5","3","13","7 January 2012"," This mutiny has not aged well
","Having not seen this film or having read the novel, I approached it with no preconceived notions other that so many on IMDb have given the film so many accolades. Alas, I will not be joining that group. Watching this film in early 2012 I was confronted with a depiction that was overtly jingoistic and so fawning towards the US Navy, that I found the preening gestures to be detracting, robbing the story of any possible objectivity in the story telling. While I am not unaware that every film will mirror the times in which it is crafted, I found the musical score to be mediocre and too strenuously fixated with reproducing a gallant and martial atmosphere. Subtlety this film had none. Some critics have noted and I will agree with them that the first half of the film really drags. I also feel that the romantic peregrinations of Ensign Willie Keith are unnecessary, weakly depicted and developed. Watching it now made me cringe, with the watered down tension of his divided loyalties towards his mother and the woman he asserts he is in love with just comes across as unconvincing, drained of real passion, conviction and angst. It doesn't help the movie that the two actors playing the roles had practically no sparks between them. That entire part of the film, even if it is in the book, could have been left out.<br/><br/>My impression of Bogart as the mentally unhinged Captain was that he was miscast for this role. Bogey, for me at least, was too wooden, stiff, an obvious land lubber trying to make himself look like a seasoned sea dog and I didn't buy it for a moment. I kept on waiting for him to pop a cigarette in his mouth but not once is he seen smoking, which, as hilarious as it might sound from a health point of view, was his trade mark in so many of his films. Another thing I was quite surprised at was how short he was. Every time he stood beside Van Johnson or Fred MacMurray, both quite tall men, Bogey look so much smaller, which of course he was.<br/><br/>Much has been made of his recourse to fidgeting with with balls of some metal, and even if it is in the novel, the way he acts this out looks contrived and with no subtly. Imagine if it was Charles Laughton portraying this captain as he had on the film ""Mutiny on the Bounty""? Bogart's Captain is portrayed more as someone who is severely anal retentive, given to ridiculous attention to details that have about as much place on a minesweeper as they would on a chain gang. That type of spit and polish with harsh consequences for insubordination belonged on a big battle ship, not a rusting hulk.<br/><br/>I found the emotional projections of every single person in the film to be too cautious, unnatural, forced, self conscious of being an ""act"". Fred MacMurray, a talented actor, hardly breaks away from his monochromatic portrayal, and strangely so. The only person in the film who evoked a few moments of real emotion was Jose Ferrer, whose sneering revulsion for the defendants is a welcome jolt of a real moment of conviction.<br/><br/>A word about special effects and stock footage. The film used three sources to show the boats. One was shot either on a stage or on a real boat, another was stock footage from WW2 and the weakest was the model ship being shot in a large tub. The model scenes looked at today will only make you laugh. I suppose that in 1954 people didn't much care if the ship looked like a toy; they focused on the overall story. I am someone grown accustomed to quality effects and looked at now, the storm tossed boat looks silly and amateurish. <br/><br/>The premise of the drama is not impossible to conjure but I felt that it lacked enough life and death held in the balance to convince me. Bogart's reaction to seeing the mutinous defendants outside the court room was typical of how odd the relationships were. He was not the least bit perturbed by seeing them and he greeted them as friends. The court room drama was the strongest part of the film and I will grant that watching Bogart's character fall apart was the climax of the film. However, it was a short moment in what is otherwise a rather dreary and muted film. You would think that the actions taken in the middle of a typhoon to save everyone on board from imminent drowning would have evoked a stronger reaction from all concerned but you won't find it here. I was bothered that the film does not tell you what became of Bogart's character, Captain Queeg. All that we know is that the defendants won their case and that Queeg lost. I found the lack of follow through to be a weak point. All in all, the film looks very dated, the actors all look devoid of conviction and by comparisons to other boat films, this one is flat. Not impressed. Go and look at what Laughton and Gable did on the other Mutiny film and then you'll see action worth writing accolades for. Not here."

But after the first three weeks (and before that, eighteen months in campaign/president-elect mode) of Trump's time in office, it's impossible to not see the parallels with him and Captain Queeg (though I'd say at least Queeg didn't seem to come from a life of privilege and yes men).<br/><br/>And at first it wasn't readily apparent - Queeg comes off in his first scenes like a tough taskmaster, but perhaps nothing out of the ordinary for hard-case Captains in the navy or army and so on - but as one notices the decisions he makes, or doesn't make, or what he focuses his attention on (all men having their shirts tucked in is one thing, but during a ship maneuver that requires his attention, or the whole 'strawberry' incidence) and then quickly dismisses the reality around him as hogwash and act like the ship was in a poor state that had to be completely overhauled (and it didn't, and his aims to make it better just come off as... strange somehow).

Probably not in anything that can change anything, but as someone who writes and thinks critically about such things it's curious to see such patterns repeating themselves in history. But besides all of that, and whatever it can do, I should be here to tell you whether the movie is good or not. It is at times an excellent picture, with some caveats that I'll get to, and most of all the reasons to see it are for the screenplay, which is a wonderful adaptation by Stanley Roberts of the Woulk novel, and Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>Though he isn't the only notable performance of the film - Van Johnson does a lot with a character that isn't the brightest guy but knows right from wrong, and in his whole career this should be marked as one of Fred MacMurray's major accomplishments, in the subtlety of what he does - Bogart brings a vulnerability to this man, a sense that there's something mixed up even in the moments when he's in command and the men respect him. He never overplays a thing, and because it's Bogart at first as the audience we want to give him the benefit of the doubt... about what, it becomes clear, is hard to tell. But he also sells on the eventual reality of the mental instability of Queeg, like with the rattling of the balls in his hand, but at the same time we don't misunderstand him. How he got to this point even has a small ring of tragedy: was he always this untrusting and paranoid and mentally unstable? Surely being in the navy for eight years he was competent and a good officer. So there's a small ring of tragedy amid the rest of the drama.<br/><br/>What makes the script stand out is that it gets better, more compelling, as the movie goes along. In the first twenty minutes it's watchable, but it doesn't feel like much in the way of conflict is going to happen, as the direction from Dymytryk is standard - competent but nothing to remark upon - and he lays in too much of the score (not a bad one by Steiner by any means, but 'too much' can be a problem when a scene should only have dialog), and the performance from Robert Francis, as it is through a lot of the film, is stiff and too basic (although it occurred to me, aside from it being his debut as an actor, it was part of the point to have one guy who was a straight-arrow officer, but even with this he lacks any personality to sell anything, which includes the bits with his girlfriend May Wynn, who is also only okay).<br/><br/>But once Queeg comes on the ship the picture takes off in a clearer direction and becomes engrossing simply by the nature of this man - his unpredictability, his lack of responsibility in key moments or ignoring things told to him (those mess hall guys ate the strawberries! rats!) What will be the tipping point and then, after this, how is the court martial going to proceed? <br/><br/>This last section is anchored by EG Marshall on one side and Jose Ferrer on the other, and is chock-a-block with dialog (later Altman would make a TV movie out of a play called the Caine Mutiny Court Martial), and all of it comes off from these actors in excellent ways. What does law and order mean in such a situation? Though not all of the acting is great, and near the very end a scene with Jose Ferrer seems to be there to spell out a lot of things that could have been handled with less melodrama, there's a wonderful morality and questioning of power to this story, about taking a long hard look at what happens when it's ""The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and my way."" It can be applied to a lot of things in real life, which is what makes it stick in the mind... probably too well now..."
"Hitchcoc","9","1","3","6 December 2016"," MacMurray as a Bad Guy
","The beauty of this film is that there is no black and white. Bogart's Queeg should have been relieved of duty before because of his unpredictable emotions. He is mostly correct about the ship. They have been fortunate to function well under a liaises faire commander. Queeg is blood and guts and tries to push his agenda on the crew. They are not great sailors because they begin to undermine his authority, yet are self righteous about their motives. The incident with the strawberries is nutty enough; Queeg on the verge of a nervous breakdown. But, of course, command decisions later are the real reason for the mutiny. The men know they must do something and mutiny followed by a trial occurs. When the chips are down, MacMurray gets going. He is the wise guy who embraced the mutiny until the trial began to go badly. Queeg is pathetic at this point, but his service record is worthy of respect. Great movie."
"jdschreiber-21034","9","1","3","29 May 2016"," Excellent Story And Cast
","The Caine Mutiny, while little remembered today, is a great example of how a stellar book can be adapted into a great movie. Featuring an excellent cast and an engaging story, all while looking visually spectacular, The Caine Mutiny is an underrated classic from the 1950's.<br/><br/>The movie stars Robert Francis as Willie Keith, an ensign who is assigned tho the USS Caine. There, he meets Lieutenant Commander William De Vriess, Executive Officer Steve Maryk, and Communications Officer Tom Keefer. Shortly thereafter, De Vriess is replaced by the hard-nosed yet uneasy looking Captain Queeg. Keefer suspects the captain may be paranoid and is unsuitable to run the ship. Maryk becomes irritated by this suggestion, yet soon realizes it after Queeg orders everyone on the ship to search for a quart of frozen strawberries at 1 A.M. Maryk relieves Queeg of command during a storm, and is put in a court-martial.<br/><br/>The film is well shot, especially the exterior of the ship during the storm, and the Technicolor works in favor of the film, providing a more beautiful setting to the film. The setting allows the viewer to be drawn in easily to the movie, its characters, its story, and is never dull, even in the prolonged court scene, always remaining interesting until the credits roll.<br/><br/>Queeg is easily the most interesting character. Queeg seems to be a man who puts morale as a top priority, yet is shown to be mentally unbalanced and has showings of paranoia. Yet at the same time, he never truly loses his sanity, and retains enough of a normal attitude to look normal to outsiders.<br/><br/>This is why the role works so well. There's such a fine line on his paranoia that he really could just be eccentric, and not paranoid. However, his breakdown while being cross-examined in the court proves his paranoia to be indeed true.<br/><br/>An interesting parallel brought up at the end is how similar Keefer is to Queeg. Keefer is shown to be a coward, bringing up Queeg's paranoia, and yet doesn't act on it, reaping the benefits when Maryk is at the court-martial, and lies on the stand about Queeg's behavior, effectively proving he's as cowardly as Queeg is paranoid.<br/><br/>The Caine Mutiny is an excellent film, and strangely, is largely forgotten. The only thing that even bogs down the movie slightly is the romance between Willie and May. Otherwise, the movie is a testament to film adaptations of books, and is a definite must-watch for any movie fan."

","My main draw for seeing The Caine Mutiny was Humphrey Bogart, who I like a lot particularly in Casablanca, The African Queen and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. After finally seeing it, The Caine Mutiny is my definition of an interesting but uneven movie.<br/><br/>I have to say The Caine Mutiny is a well made movie. The cinematography shows a lot of skill, and the settings and costumes are very nice to look at. There is also a wonderful music score from the legendary Max Steiner that enhances the mood of the film very well.<br/><br/>Bogart himself is marvellous as a complex albeit rather unsympathetic character, while I personally don't cite The Caine Mutiny amongst his best films, I would do so amongst his best performances.<br/><br/>Fred McMurray and Van Johnson are also very good, alongside Bogart's their characters are among the most interesting of the film, particularly McMurray. Jose Ferrer doesn't show up until towards the end, and while the drunken rant left much to be desired written quality-wise Ferrer does do what he can with the role.<br/><br/>The Caine Mutiny is also beautifully directed.<br/><br/>The film's story is an interesting one, especially with the courtroom scenes, however it is not always a very exciting one. I felt it dragged towards the end, and the scenes with May Wynn and Robert Francis were rather dull and stilted.<br/><br/>Script-wise, there is some thoughtful, intelligent and meaningful dialogue there, but there is also the duller scenes with Wynn and Francis and the drunken rant that did let it down. Most of the characters are well-written, particularly Bogart's and McMurray's, but some like Tom Tully's for example didn't engage me.<br/><br/>Again, most of the performances were fine, however I think Tom Tully struggled with a rather bland character, and May Wynn and Robert Francis's characters are not only dull but they also manage to be equally so.<br/><br/>Overall, interesting but uneven film. Worth seeing for Bogart, the score and the courtroom scenes but a few other bland performances and some dull scenes and pacing brought it down. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","Wow, every year I have to pull out my DVD about twice to watch this film....a fabulous movie, one of the best of all time....combination war story and drama at the same time. Who could ever forget Humphrey Bogart's performance as the neurotic Captain Queeg....in my mind Bogart's best performance ever, even considering ""African Queen"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""......story concerns a young ensign (Robert Francis) who is fresh out of the naval academy and assigned to a boat full of misfit sailors and officers - the USS Caine, a mine sweeper, far down the food chain as far as navy ships and commands go. Francis first encounters a down and out, worn out captain, played by Tom Tully, who manages to critique Francis to the point of near harassment. After Tully is dispatched from the Caine, a new captain, Bogart takes over and things then really go over the top. Captain Queeg (Bogart) is a wound up, worn out, neurotic who distrusts everyone and seems incapable of running a naval vessel. Things quickly deteriorate on the Caine and the officers aboard are ready to throw Queeg overboard after so much harassment by him. The neurotic scene where Queeg questions his officers about two pails of missing strawberries is a classic......then check out the scene in a typhoon where it appears imminent that the Caine is about to founder and tip over due to Queeg's inability to command. Van Johnson as the ships second in command puts on a memorable performance....he overthrows Queeg (per article 184 of naval regulations) as unfit and unable to command. Naturally Queeg goes berserk at this point in the film during the typhoon and emotions run sky high. After the mutiny a trial takes place in San Francisco. Brilliant part of the movie the entire trial scenes where officers and enlisted men alike are put to the sword by the prosecuting attorney played by E.G. Marshall. Jose Ferrer as the defense attorney in an outstanding role trying to defend the men of the Caine. Best scene when Bogart gives a brilliant performance trying clumsily to defend his actions on the Caine on the witness stand. He slowly starts to unravel and disintegrates from intense questioning about his capabilities as a captain and fit sailor. Check out the scene when he pulls out the steel marbles and twirls them in his hand astounding the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney. Pure screen magic. Fred MacMurray as a con artist, cowardly officer who secretly plots to overthrow Queeg puts on a dandy performance. In short, this is a great film, a true classic. A skimpy love story in the background with Ensign Keith (Francis) and his girlfriend adds a little twist to the film. How did Humphrey Bogart not get an Oscar for this film???? Hard to believe...... One of the all time great Hollywood classic films."

"clive-38","10","1","3","11 November 2000"," Another powerful performance by Bogart with top supporting cast
","""The Caine Mutiny"" features one of Bogart's most powerful roles - he was brilliant as the paranoid Captain Queeg and in my opinion should have won the Best Actor Oscar for this part. He was nominated for the award but was beaten by Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" which was of course another great performance so it was difficult for the Academy voters to choose. ""The Caine Mutiny"" was nominated that year for six Oscars but did not pick up one! Also nominated for Best Actor were Bing Crosby for ""The Country Girl"", James Mason (""A Star Is Born"") and Dan O'Herlihy (""The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"").  The film had an outstanding cast including Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, E. G. Marshall, Lee Marvin, Tom Tulley and Claude Atkins. A gripping storyline (from the novel and play by Herman Wouk), top drawer acting, beautifully photographed in Technicolor and produced by Stanley Kramer. The weak part of the film was the totally unnecessary love story between Robert Francis and May Wynn (I wonder whatever happened to them?). This slowed down the whole film (which ran for over two hours) and it would have greatly improved and tightened up the story by cutting out this romance which was extraneous to the plot anyway.  Director Edward Dmytryk did a magnificent job handling the impressive cast and particularly in the courtroom scenes when Captain Queeg (Bogart) is on the stand: ""Ah .. but the strawberries, that's where I had them. They laughed at me and made jokes but I proved beyond the shadow of a doubt and with geometric logic that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist ... "" What a cast! What a film!  And in common with most of Bogart's films this is worth repeated viewings. 10/10. Clive Roberts."
"Kayt R","10","1","3","18 August 2000"," A stellar cast brings forth an intense film
","The Caine Mutiny is more intense and psychologically thought provoking than most films billed as `suspense thrillers'.  I've never been a fan of war movies in general; I've seen too many documentaries like Atomic Café to comfortably sit through yet another us versus them flick. That being said, The Caine Mutiny's use of war is not about America infallibility, it is about human reactions in times of intense emotional pressure.  The film shows how tension and power can disintegrate sanity and loyalty, and that rarely is any situation clear-cut.<br/><br/>As soon as we board the Caine, Keefer (MacMurray) begins a rapid-fire summation on the goings on aboard the ship. He quickly proves himself as witty, highly intelligent, sure of his judgement, and carefully arrogant. The complexities of the character  (which, for fear of spoilers I will not discuss) are stunningly depicted by MacMurray. If Bogart had not been brilliant in his portrayal of Queeg I suspect MacMurray would have stolen every scene he appeared in. And this is high praise because both Steve Meryck's portrayal of Van Johnson, and Jose Ferrer's as Greenwald are impeccable. The ensemble is almost completely above reproach, but I'll return to that.<br/><br/>Bogart, as we all know, is stunning. His lectures to his officers is just as rapid and self-assured as Keefer's running commentary.  Bogart carefully allows for the mental entropy of his personality to become more visible as the movie progresses, which quickly separates his temperament from that of MacMurray's. Bogart's scenes in court have insured that I'll never be able to watch a Jack Nicklson in A Few Good Men ever again, but that's not totally a bad thing. What struck me most about how Bogart was filmed was not the intense camera shots of his hands, or constantly moving eyes, but the fact this was the first movie I'd ever seen his short stature emphasized. While it has been ignored, avoided, or jokingly commented on in many of his prior films, it has never been utilized in such an adept manner.  Almost every scene he appears in he is noticeably shorter than those around him are, even when he is seated. It is as if his paranoia is being subtly, visually reaffirmed.<br/><br/>And the downside? The movie contains a romantic plot that adds nothing to the film; it tempts you to fast forward or go to the lobby for popcorn. It wouldn't be such a bother if the romantic characters had depth, but they don't and it's a shame. Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) should be a compelling personality, as he is only character who starts out innocent and stands to transform the most. Francis' performance is flat. He exudes listless delivery and a dim, handsome face that reminds me of Starship Troopers and old episodes of Thunderbirds Are Go. A pity.<br/><br/>I've never read the book, I suspect that I will eventually, but I cannot comment on the adaptation.<br/><br/>And I'd like viewers to lovingly think of Nixon's infamous Checkers speech when Capt. Queeg discusses his homelife."
"gcrokus","9","1","4","24 March 2009"," Some Angry Men
","""The Caine Mutiny"" is one of those movies that is really noteworthy because - well, how many mutiny movies can you name? If you put mutiny as a plot keyword into IMDb, you get 110 hits. A great many of those are TV show episodes, and only a few of the movies are memorable.<br/><br/>""Amistad"", ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", ""The Caine Mutiny"", these are a few that come to the fore. And ""The Caine Mutiny"" is in my view probably tied in quality with ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" - the latter being the 1935 version with Clark Gable and Charles Laughton. I have not seen the critically acclaimed ""Amistad"".<br/><br/>The cast of ""The Caine Mutiny"" is really quite special. There is not a sour note in any of the performances we see. In particular Fred McMurray plays a turn as a bit of a rabble-rouser aboard the Caine. I think it is the best role he ever had. Van Johnson, as second in command, is equally well suited for his part, and it too may be his best work. Some think Bogart's interpretation of Queeg is extraordinary, but I think his role in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" may be at least its equal.<br/><br/>Seeds of doubt regarding the Captain (Humphrey Bogart) are sown early on. The crew of the Caine watches him perform some questionable actions, but I will leave it to you to determine if Captain Queeg is at any point unfit for duty. What some would call the crucial scene is directed superbly, with some character's lack of action as important as those in action.<br/><br/>Nearly all of the elements of a great movie are here. The soundtrack is not very interesting but I don't think anyone cares in this case. And the look of the movie is right, in every regard - shipboard, the courtroom, the bit of San Francisco we see while the Caine is in port there. There is even a romance as a plot thread.<br/><br/>The court martial, held of course towards the latter part of ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954), is in its own right worth seeing. Jose Ferrer and E.G. Marshall as lawyers are worthy adversaries. It rivals in its effect the somewhat contemporary Henry Fonda classic, ""Twelve Angry Men"" (1957). The outcome of the trial presents we the viewers with some lingering questions, and rightly so. Mutiny is no small matter in the military, and discipline is certainly one of the cornerstones of an effective fighting force.<br/><br/>This is a four star picture."
"treadwaywrites","9","1","4","17 March 2009"," This Film Deserves A Salute
","This film is one of the great 1950s movies about a WWII naval ship with numerous conflicts on-board. The very independent officers of the Caine also have some issues with the Captain (Humphrey Bogart) which culminate with a court martial trial. The film is reminiscent of other great naval court-martial films such as Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), Sea Wolf (1941) and Treasure Island (1950).<br/><br/>Based on the best selling, 1951 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Caine Mutiny was originally adapted for the Broadway stage (by producer Charles Laughton). The story follows young Willie Keith, junior officer, who has come aboard the worn out ship, The Caine, which is a less than stellar ship when it comes to reputation and discipline. The Captain of the ship is replaced during an assignment by another Captain by the name of Queeg. Queeg has had an illustrious career and is determined to bring the tired old mine sweeper back into Navy regulation. The officers on the Caine don't give Queeg any slack and not much favor and quickly he loses the respect of the crew. After a crucial mission the Caine and the rest of the fleet is caught in a hurricane which results in Queeg losing command and a trial of two of the officers one of whom is Keith. <br/><br/>Even though Keith (Robert Francis) is considered a main character the two characters that end up with the screen time are Lt. Commander Philip Francis Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) and Lt. Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) with a nod going to Lt. Barney Greenwald (José Ferrer). There is just no way that meek little Francis can hold his own against Bogart. On the screen Bogart has such presence that the audience is forced to root for him no matter what is incapacity seems to be. The court scenes which take up the last act or 1/3rd of the film are almost a toe to toe face-off between Bogart and Ferrer with both of them winning. The acting is thick in the picture's Technicolor backdrop. <br/><br/>To think that The Caine Mutiny could have such star power and have the good graces of the Navy when the ship and the officers are portrayed as sub par is unbelievable and must rest on the shoulders of Bogart. Director Edward Dmytryk doesn't seem a likely candidate to get the Navy's approval given that he is one of the original blacklisted ""Hollywood Ten."" The direction is great as is the acting. This was Bogart's last great role (he died three years later). The film was nominated for 7 Oscars but could not take any."
"MrVibrating","10","1","4","4 October 2006"," A classic.
","With excellent performances all around, a water-proof script, and good directing, The Caine Mutiny stands tall to this day. Unlike many other movies from that time, this one feels and looks modern in many aspects, and with its, for the time, quite long running time(2 hrs and 5 minutes) it still doesn't feel stretched or dragged, in fact, some subplots would have been good if they were expanded.<br/><br/>Bogart's performance is really gripping and believable. The way different people react differently to his actions and how their opinions are formed is high above average movie standard. Although I haven't read the book I'm guessing a lot of it shines through, which is really lucky. A more navy-friendly movie would have ruined a lot.<br/><br/>The Caine Mutiny is a little of this and a little of that. There's the usual ""boat in the pacific/oppressive captain"" plot, then there's the psychological plot, then there's a courtroom section, and of course, the moral problem of mutiny itself.<br/><br/>For its age, The Caine mutiny is crisp, fresh and well-made. If you feel like watching a classic that doesn't have the oppressive weight of age over it, then this is a great choice."
"rmax304823","Null","1","4","29 September 2001"," Novel Film
","There have already been almost 30 comments on this film and I agree with most of the points made, so I'd like to say a few things about the translation of Wouk's novel in film. The comparison sheds some light on what some people have seen as weaknesses in the film, and it brings up I think the problem that some strong points in the novel are lacking in the movie. <br/><br/>First, the novel is big and fat, but it is Wouk's best if only because it has a tense, nicely honed narrative and is in fact a rattling good tale. It's a fine novel in many respects. The bonds between Willie and May, and between Willie and his mother, belongs. They provide a kind of parallel to his character's maturing aboard ship. Unfortunately, the main narrative of the film needs to be so condensed already that his romances should have been left out. <br/><br/>The movie needed to be longer, I'm afraid, even without the 1950s love interest. What emerges gradually in the novel is thrust in our faces in the film in order to pack as much action and drama into the visuals as possible. The episode in which Queeg's cowardice becomes apparent, instead of involving an engagement between the Caine and a single shore battery, has the ship plowing through a forest of spouting explosions. We've seen it before. And the typhoon, when it comes, doesn't build in intensity; it's suddenly there on screen, hitting like a sledgehammer. It's not the fault of the screenwriters. They've done a good job of investing the residual lines with meaning, and even provide a new one that perhaps should have been in the novel: when Queeg is introducing himself to his wardroom he makes the remark that, ""The way those subs ganged up on us, I thought they had it in for me personally."" Neat! The novel also has a long introductory section on Willie at midshipman school which was properly left out. (As it was left out of the Reader's Digest condensation.) <br/><br/>Wouk's book has little in it about anti-Semitism in the Navy, except to say that when it occurs, it's overridden by the anti-Semite's sense of fairness. The speech about Judaism given by Greenwald at the party reflects his own worries. He's railing against Hitler, not the Navy. Wouk's book reflects a patronizing attitude towards the crew, who are uniformly small minded and mostly dumb, and who are variously derided repeatedly as ""animals"" or ""admired for the pure morning light that is in them,"" which only tells us that Wouk found nothing to admire in them or he wouldn't have resorted to such junk. Mercifully, this class snobbery is barely apparent in the film. <br/><br/>A few more irresistible points. All the characters are too old for their parts. And, if they had to use the romantic subplot, where in God's name did they find Robert Francis and ""May Wynn""? (That name, by the way, was already too top-heavy with symbolism.) Willie is a pivotal character in the book, if not in the film, and poor Robert Francis looks like a pug-nosed spoiled kid at the beginning, where it may be appropriate, and also at the end, where it's not. At no place in the film does he do anything that resembles acting. The final exchange between Greenwald and Bogart is fine except that it comes and goes too quickly. The disintegration in the novel, a result of the traps laid by Greenwald, seems a sudden and hardly motivated fracture in the movie. The first captain, Tom Tully, is described in the book as having ""a voice filled with irony and authority."" Tully, whom I've often admired, reduces this complexity to simple sarcasm and contempt. Maybe he didn't have time to do more. And Greenwald in the novel is given a shambling, almost shy demeanor, like Lieutenant Columbo, completely at odds with his courtroom cleverness, so that his forceful questioning comes as a shocking surprise. Jose Ferrer misses this and comes across as consistently sharp and resolute. <br/><br/>I enjoy this film each time I see it. Yet, one look at the relatively new destroyer that poses as the Caine and one yearns for the broken-down World War I hulk of a converted minesweeper that was the Caine in the novel. Someday, someone might make a truly great film out of this finely written novel. They keep remaking classics that don't need improvement. Here's one that could use some updating. Imagine that climactic typhoon with CGI."

","Being a late boomer on old movies, I've recently started watching some of them. I saw ""Casablanca"" for the first time about a month ago, and I basically thought it sucked.

In short - I feared another ""Casablanca"".<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>THIS was a great movie. Bogie really did deliver the goods in this one, and though it wasn't a huge part, Jose Ferrer was absolutely nails. Great acting in the rest of it as well, and it was a surprise to me to see Fred MacMurray play the part of a loser.<br/><br/>Probably would have given it a 10 had it not been for the few strays of Keith's love life, and the toy ship in the typhoon was a little bit silly - but hey - it was 1954, so they did what they could.<br/><br/>Great, great movie."
"kellyadmirer","10","1","5","14 September 2009"," Humphrey Bogart takes on ... Richard Nixon
","""The Caine Mutiny"" always has held a special place in my heart. It is not for everybody, being more a character study than anything else, but if you give it a chance, you may fall in love with it, too.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart reportedly read the novel (which I recommend as well) and then campaigned for the part of Captain Queeg. Since he was at the peak of his influence by then, he got the part and was surrounded by an all-star cast led by top director Edward Dmytryk. It's hard to find a single bad performance in the picture, though some will fault newcomer Robert Francis, playing pivotal Ensign Keith, as being wooden. That may be true, but his acting naiveté in my opinion fits the character rather well.<br/><br/>Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray, two of the top leading men of the day, are awesome in their roles supporting Bogart. If that wasn't enough, Lee Marvin, Jose Ferrer, E.G. Marshall, Arthur Franz and Claude Akins, any one of whom could carry a film on his own, were hanging around to give some flavor. There aren't many women shown, but May Wynn is vivacious as Keith's troubled girlfriend.<br/><br/>Bogart, who was nominated, is mesmerizing as Captain Queeg. Invariably, Hollywood historical dramas have a very contemporary focus. There are subtle clues throughout that the screenwriters had a very specific person on their minds while working: Richard Nixon. Nixon was very much in the news of the day, completing his meteoric rise to the Vice Presidency under Eisenhower. His World War II naval career was eerily similar to Queeg's, commanding backwater cargo handling units. His famous sloganeering resonates with Queeg's (""I kid you not""), and his eccentric mannerisms such as the famous two-handed ""V"" sign echo Queeg's handling of ball-bearings when nervous. The real tie-in, though, is Queeg's board-room meeting when he asks the officers for their help rather than their enmity because he really is a normal guy with a wife and a dog. Afterwards, MacMurray's character cynically notes that this was a pathetic attempt at winning sympathy ""because even my dog likes me."" If this isn't a direct reference to Nixon's famous 1952 ""Checkers"" speech, then it is some kind of cosmic coincidence. At the end, the Ferrer character gives the other side of the story when he notes that it would have been only human to accept such a humble plea for help - which is exactly how the public responded to Nixon's speech.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is classic, though it implies certain things about what actually resulted from the trial that the book makes clear were not quite so clear-cut. But the film stands on its own, and Keith's fate after the trial - which does, by the way, match the book - is about as perfect an ending as you will ever see.<br/><br/>Fantastic performance by Bogart, MacMurray, Ferrer and Van Johnson. Read the book if you get the chance. But be sure to take a cruise on the U.S.S. Caine, you'll be glad you did."

","Its a shame the Navy wouldn't allow a film to be made showing mutiny on a US ship, because thus is exactly what occurred on this film. Not only that, but tge Navy required the studio to put a statement on the screen just as ut begins: (Paraphrasing) ""There has never been a mutiny aboard any US Navy ship"", etc. It's way over the top in which the studio was limited as to what the Navy would ir wouldn't allow to be shown, it takes the ""heart"" right out if the film. This is truly traguc, simply because it was made during the ""McCarthy Era"" (the 1950s) when the fear of ""Communism"" was set ablaze by Senator Joe McCarthy, the he ""fanned the flames"". He had a committee which succeeded in blackballing a dozen great screen writers and numerous other movie Hollywood people: some of the very best. Consequently, a brilliantly cast film had it's ""claws removed"" and was ""de-fanged"" (to use ""feline"" euphemisms). Besides Humphrey Bogart, you have Fred McMurray, Van Johnson, Jose Ferrer, and even a young Lee Marvin. Overall, it is the opposite of a brilliant film made 38 years later: ""A Few Good Men"" (1992), which the US Navy did not like, and threw their weight around on it, too. However, they didn't really succeed at stopping anything. Amazingly, ""The Caine Mutiny"" received 7 Academy Award nominations, Including Best Picture and Best Actor. Overall, I don't like it. All because of the Nacy censorship was so powerful at the time. It ruoned the entire plot. I still rated it at 5 stars; simply for the cast and what tgey did manage to show."

","THE CAINE MUTINY is an extremely tense war drama based on several personal drama elements, conflict of male temperament, courage, duty and cowardice. A completely irrelevant romance pervaded the story. It does not cause a lot of damage, but it complicates the scenario. The plot is located on the Pacific battleground of World War II and describes the mutiny of the crew of the US destroyer-minesweeper USS Caine provoked by new and mentally unbalanced captain.<br/><br/>This is an intriguing film, which in some parts causes anxiety. Characterization is good and relations between the protagonists are quite complex. Set design is quite expensive, considering that it does not help the credibility of the story. The music is pretty powerful trump card. The picture and staff were at times impressive. Theatricality at the end of the film is quite a surprise, the existence of a sort of anticlimax also.<br/><br/>Van Johnson as Lieutenant Steve Maryk is the prime suspect and savior at the same time. He is alarmed officer who attempted to solve a complex problem. Fred MacMurray as Lieutenant Tom Keefer is fascinating as dwelt type of villain and an epitome of cowardice. Humphrey Bogart as Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg is the most complex character in the film. Quite a mysterious protagonist, who is lost in his own paranoia and hysteria. Robert Francis as Ensign Willis Seward ""Willie"" Keith is a romantic ensign who has a problem with his superiors. Very bad characterization, especially considering how much attention was given to the relationship between the mother and the son, who were eventually left undefined. José Ferrer as Lieutenant Barney Greenwald is quite interesting in the role of lawyer. I have impression that he was a lawyer to everyone in this film.

The movie needs to relax with the music. The tone needs to be darker and more threatening. The side story away from the ship is a waste of time. The love story is weak melodrama. The tension should be much higher. The acting is generally good although the movie is resting on the cast's least experienced shoulders of Robert Francis. At first, Keefer is overplaying it because Queeg is more incompetent than actually crazy. The movie needs to let Queeg lead the way or else the crew could be seen as over-reacting.

"SimonJack","10","0","1","30 July 2014"," Great book, screenplay, acting and film
","Although it's fiction, ""The Caine Mutiny"" is a highly realistic portrayal of the U.S. Navy, its men, and the stress of command during World War II. It's based on a book of the same name by Herman Wouk. He served on minesweepers in the Pacific theater during WW II. The role of Fred MacMurray somewhat resembles Wouk and his service. MacMurray is a writer working on a novel in his spare time on ship. How much else the character resembles Wouk is anyone's guess. Navy veterans have praised Wouk's work for his honest and accurate portrayal of life at sea during WW II, and for his variety of characters. <br/><br/>Wouk wrote a number of popular novels in later years, several of which were made into movies. Among them were ""Marjorie Morningstar"" in 1955, ""Slattery's Hurricane"" in 1956, and ""Youngblood Hawke"" in 1961. His two greatest works were historical fictions that were made into mini-series films for TV. ""Winds of War,"" and ""War and Remembrance"" won multiple awards and recognition worldwide in the 1980s. <br/><br/>""The Caine Mutiny"" is an excellent study of characters. The only other film of 1954 that has such depth of character development and study is the one that took the biggest honors for the year – ""On the Waterfront."" But, ""The Caine Mutiny"" is a classic film that should be in all war movie collections and all other serious film collections. It is one of half a dozen films that show Humphrey Bogart's great talent as an actor. <br/><br/>Bogart gave an Oscar-worthy performance in the lead role as Philip Francis Queeg, captain of the Caine. The screenplay, direction and supporting cast for this film all were outstanding. Indeed, the cast of this film was near perfect for so many prominent roles. Only that of Ensign Willie Keith, was weak. Newcomer Robert Francis was stiff and seemed to have stage fright in his part. One could image a young Paul Newman (27 or 28 then) giving a more genuine portrayal in that role. <br/><br/>But the Mutiny cast doesn't end there. Veteran stars José Ferrer and E.G. Marshall have noteworthy roles. Other veterans have very good parts – Steve Brodie as Chief Budge and Warner Anderson as Capt. Blakely. And some up-and-comers have sizable parts and play them very well – Lee Marvin as Meatball, Claude Akins as Lugatch, May Wynn as May, and Jerry Paris as Ensign Barney Harding. <br/><br/>As with all the years in the decade of the 50s, 1954 had many very good to excellent movies. But two films and their associated roles stood out. ""Mutiny"" with Bogart and others was one, and ""On the Waterfront"" starring Marlon Brando with others is the second. ""Waterfront"" was best picture and Brando won the Oscar for best actor. ""Mutiny"" and Bogart were nominated. ""Waterfront"" won 8 of its 12 nominations, but ""Mutiny"" didn't capture a single Oscar in its 7 nominations. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that Brando gave an Oscar performance in ""Waterfront."" But was his performance better than Bogart's in ""Mutiny?"" I don't dwell on speculation about the Academy Awards. No doubt, there are sentimental favorites at times. And other things may affect the academy voting as well. History has recorded some years when studios spent lavishly to influence the academy voters. And, perhaps chicanery has been at play in some years. <br/><br/>I wonder if that wasn't the case in 1954. I'll grant the Brando-Bogart nominations a toss-up. But the nominations of supporting actors must raise the eyebrows of serious movie buffs. ""Waterfront"" received three nominations for best supporting actor – Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden and Rod Steiger. All gave deserving performances. ""Mutiny"" received one nomination – Tom Tully. While his role was very good, it was a lesser role than two other exceptional performances who were not nominated. Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray were outstanding in their roles as Lt. Steve Maryk and Lt. Tom Keefer, respectively. They were at least as good as the performances by the three ""Waterfront"" nominations. So, might there have been some chicanery afoot in the Academy echelon that chose the nominees to be voted upon? How could two such exceptional roles be overlooked, where they chose to nominate a somewhat lesser role from the same film?<br/><br/>Whatever skullduggery may have been at work, one wonders if the Academy voters didn't see through it or decide enough is enough. Not to take anything away from Edmond O'Brien for his very good role in ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" but the voters may have picked him best supporting actor to snub the Academy for its choice of nominees – or lack of some obviously deserving nominees in this category. <br/><br/>Bur for ""On the Waterfront,"" Paramount's ""The Caine Mutiny"" likely would have garnered three Oscars of its seven nominations in 1954. Bogart also starred in two other films that year – ""The Barefoot Contessa"" and ""Sabrina,"" both of which did very well at the box office. <br/><br/>Incidentally, while ""Waterfront"" topped the Oscar honors, ""Mutiny"" beat it soundly at the box office. ""Waterfront"" tied for 14th at the box office in 1954. It had $4.5 million in ticket sales, with a budget just under $1 million. But ""Mutiny"" was a respectable fifth in gross box office for the year. It earned $21.8 million in the U.S. alone on an estimated $2 million budget. The top film for the year was ""White Christmas,"" with a box office of $30 million. The others of the top five were ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" with $28.2 million; ""Rear Window"" at $27.6 million; and ""Demetrius and the Gladiator,"" at $26 million. Only one other film topped $10 million that year – ""Vera Cruz,"" an MGM Western that grossed $11 million."

","From the moment Captain Philip Francis Queeg gives the original version of Richard Milhous Nixon's infamous ""Checkers Speech"" (as in, ""I'm really not that bad of a guy--even my little dog likes me""), it's clear that the fictional paranoid Naval Captain Queeg is the template for the all-too-real paranoid President Nixon. (President Reagan famously kept jars of jelly beans in the Oval Office; after watching THE CAINE MUTINY you'll swear that ""Tricky Dick"" must have had bowls of ball bearings there to finger whenever he felt a ""Saturday Night Massacre"" coming on). Queeg's irrational behavior threatens to scuttle a fictional Navy ""rust bucket."" Nixon's psychotic ""Reign of Terror"" nearly destroyed America a decade after this movie came out. As THE CAINE MUTINY illustrates, historically male hierarchy systems are prone to the sort of blind ""Groupthink"" which can march a ship's crew off the figurative gang plank, or an entire nation off the cliff into history's dust bin (where is the Third Reich today?). Words such as ""military discipline"" and ""chain of command"" often are code for De Facto suicide pacts. Unfortunately, such infectious thinking has seeped into our civilian sector today (who's the Queeg\Nixon in YOUR work place?). THE CAINE MUTINY would have been immortalized as the ""Best Picture"" of 1954, except for a ""Yellowstain"" performance, involving a craven recantation, in real life blotting the reputation of the man Oscar-nominated for playing Queeg, Humphrey Bogart. Ironically, ""Bogie"" aped ""Caine"" crew member ""Tom Keefer's"" cowardly retreat from Admiral Halsey and subsequent lying during ""Steve Maryk's"" court martial by wimping out in front of the Blacklist Witch Trials in Washington, DC, when he could have asked Joe McCarthy, ""Have you no decency; no sense of shame; not an ounce of respect for America?"" Bogart had only himself to blame for the rest of Academy voters following his example by caving in to runaway fascism, and presenting an undeserved ""politically correct"" Best Picture award in 1954 instead to a far inferior film Helmed by a back-stabbing snitch: ON THE WATERFRONT."
"tomsview","9","0","1","12 February 2014"," Capsizing a captain
","I saw ""The Caine Mutiny"" recently after many years – now I can appreciate more fully why it had left such a lasting impression, it is an intense drama, brilliantly acted by a dream cast, with characters of surprising depth for a glossy, studio war film of the early 1950's. <br/><br/>Based on the book by Herman Wouk, the story follows Ensign ""Willie"" Keith, played by Robert Francis, as he joins the USS Caine as a junior officer. He meets the executive officer, Lieutenant Steve Maryk, played by Van Johnson, and Lieutenant Tom Keefer, played by Fred MacMurray – both actors delivering close to career best performances.<br/><br/>Ensign Keith also meets the captain, Commander DeVriess, played by Tom Tully. Thinking the ship sloppy, Keith is much happier when DeVriess is replaced by Lieutenant Commander Queeg, played in a show-stopping performance by Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>However it soon becomes evident that Queeg has issues, and it doesn't take long for the officers to realise that he is on the verge of a breakdown. At the urging of Keefer, Maryk, who is more sympathetic to Queeg, starts to take note of the captain's erratic behaviour, Things come to a head during a typhoon when Maryk takes command to save the ship after Queeg seems incapable of making decisions.<br/><br/>The films ends with the court martial of Maryk for mutiny where he is defended by Barney Greenwald, played by Jose Ferrer in another of the film's powerhouse performances.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is mesmerising as Queeg. Although the trial scene is the one everyone remembers, the one in the boardroom where he asks the other officers for help shows how complete a portrayal it is.<br/><br/>Surely Van Johnson as Steve Maryk never gave a better performance. Maryk has similarities to Doug Roberts from Thomas Heggen's ""Mister Roberts"". Both Heggen and Wouk served in the US navy in WW2 and drew their characters from men they knew. Steve Maryk is brave and efficient, he is as Keefer says when introducing him to Keith, ""Steve's our fireball, the guy who gets things done; there's one on every ship"".<br/><br/>Of all the characters, it is possibly Fred MacMurray as Keefer who is the most intriguing. Big, cynical and articulate, he has a negative slant on just about everything, especially the navy, but his bluster masks weakness, which Maryk and Keith discover to their cost. His last scene standing alone in the elegant hotel room is one of MacMurrays finest – after work like that, no wonder he became bored playing the father on ""My Three Sons"".<br/><br/>The film stands up well today, despite the studio tank effects during the typhoon, which don't capture the weight of the real ocean. However real ships, were used extensively, and the film has considerable scope and size.<br/><br/>In the end though, it is the vivid, very human characters that make this film so compelling even after 60 years."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","1 October 2013"," An entertaining and powerful drama about leadership, discipline ... and strawberries ...
","If there ever was one lesson to learn from ""The Caine Mutiny"" is not to take any judgment for granted. Quite simple, isn't it? But this is more thought-provoking than anything you might learn from any war drama of the same period.<br/><br/>Indeed, although the film is dedicated to the US Navy, there is no patriotic stuff, no heroic soldiers brandishing the spangled banner and no heart-pounding fight scenes, just a movie using the war as back-story for a more insightful journey featuring flawed men on a flawed minesweeper and, much more, under the commandment of a flawed person, and I use this epithet as an explicit synonym of 'realistic'.<br/><br/>Of course, the credit mostly goes to Herbert Wouk, the original novel's author, who won the Pulitzer Price in 1952. Still, Edward Dmytryck, the director, did a good job in his portrayal of the leadership and human interactions' complexities during critical situations, allowing veteran actor Humphrey Bogart to deliver one of his finest performances, rightfully Oscar-nominated, as Captain Queeg, a living incarnation of paranoia, a 'Fred C. Dobbs on the water' if I may say.<br/><br/>And Bogart has a fine class of actors to work with, including Fred MacMurray, Van Johnson and Jose Ferrer. I should also mention Robert Francis as Junior Ensign Willie Keith. But Francis departed so early from our world that we'd never know where his brief career would have lead. Surely he was too clean-cut and so unlike James Dean to reach the same iconic status but within the role he was supposed to play, he was convincing as an idealistic newcomer who believes in rules, authority and discipline.<br/><br/>Yet, what Keith forgot was that these ideals mostly rely on personality and situations, otherwise, they are just inspirational but empty words. The questions raised by the film are: what to do when under a bad leadership? And mostly, how much of our own responsibility is involved before we indulge to put all the criticism on one person's side? The film works like a naval ""12 Angry Men"", but manages to display some unsuspected hints of subversive intelligence in the way it misleads our own opinions.<br/><br/>It's all about correcting preconceived ideas, starting with the opening anticlimax, when Keith's Ivy-league enthusiasm is undermined by the discovering of the floating mess named ""Caine"", where nonchalant sailors work under the commandment of easygoing Captain DeVriess, played by Tom Tully. DeVriess benefits from a huge popularity, an asset that will severely lack after his replacement by Captain Queeg, the man who works by the book, expecting every detail to be exemplary.<br/><br/>Queeg sets the tones and ignites optimistic sparkles in Keith's eyes, but they will quickly extinguish as Queeg's personality is progressively unveiled, showing more obvious signs of paranoia, betrayed by his strange habit to play with steel ball bearings. And their clicking noises are like a ticking bomb foreshadowing a devastating explosion. And the series of incidents going on the ""Caine"" provide many entertaining moments, whose most defining involving the disappearance of strawberries, a benign case blown out of proportions that will convince the crew of Queeg's inability for leadership. But beware whom you may take side with! <br/><br/>Van Johnson as Lieutenant Maryck slowly adopts the position of his friend, the cynical and novelist Tom Keefer, magnificently portrayed by Fred MacMurray, and ultimately, young Keith sides with them. The point is that we start looking at Queeg through their eyes, but it's only a matter of time before the movie provides us a newer mindset, from their lawyer (a scene-stealing Jose Ferrer). There is no word to describe Queeg's speech with the unforgettable ""Aaah, but the strawberries! That's, that's where I had them"" followed by a priceless expression on the eyes of the prosecutor (E.G. Marshall) and Ferrer's final toast, except mind-blowing.<br/><br/>Still, the film isn't beyond criticism and it has nothing to do with its faithfulness to the book, quite the opposite in fact. In my opinion, ""The Caine Mutiny"" suffers from what I call the ""Red River"" syndrome. Both are men's movies with rich and multi-layered interactions, yet for some reason, the writers felt the need to inject some romantic subplot, totally random within the film's context. I understand that ""The Caine Mutiny"" is an adaptation and the romance played a significant part of the in the process, I guess it's supposed to highlight Keith's maturation BUT that's why we say 'adapted screenplay'.<br/><br/>And that's why ""The Godfather"" was a masterpiece, because Coppola removed the novel's sleazy details, this is why ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a masterpiece, because Forman focused on McMurphy instead of telling the story from the Chief's perspective. Keith might have been the central character of the film, but the story inside the Caine was so thrilling that anything happening outside was useless. I can't believe such a wonderful screenplay with so many three-dimensional and ambiguous characters could indulge to such artificial clichés. Especially since 'Keith' isn't really a flamboyant character, not with a cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Jose Ferrer or Fred McMurray.<br/><br/>Robert Francis is not to blame though, his performance is all right given the character he plays, he's supposed to be the passive observer whom we can identify with. Keith embodied our viewer's position, like the journalist in ""Das Boot"", a neutral character whose judgment can only be based on what happens during the film (since it was his first mission) therefore (mis)leading our judgments. I'm not saying I disliked the romance because it was bad but because without it, ""The Caine Mutiny"" would've been a true masterpiece, not just one of the greatest dramas of the 50's, which it is, thanks to Ferrer, Bogart and MacMurray, notably during the last ten minutes.<br/><br/>And also because I can't resist to a serious film, where no-nonsense grown-ups argue a whole night long about goddamn strawberries!"

","Powerhouse acting makes this sea drama a gripping tale of mutiny aboard ship. The interaction between the chief officers—MacMurray, Johnson, and Bogart is especially compelling, as Queeg (Bogart) descends slowly into madness. The underlying question is whether Queeg would have cracked had his staff officers given him better support. MacMurray (Keefer) gets the unenviable role as the slippery schemer, which he is. But he's also the one who most perceptively spots Queeg's unstable judgment.<br/><br/>This is one of Bogart's signature roles; at the same time, Queeg's obsession with the missing strawberries was widely parodied by comics of the time. Watching him slowly unravel on the witness stand amounts to one of Hollywood's acting high points. Then too, someone in authority had the good sense to keep the sometimes distractive romantic subplot—Keith and Wynn— from interfering with the main story. Too bad the boyish Francis' life was cut so short. Here he performs admirably as the idealistic young shavetail. My only gripe is Ferrer's smugly overweening portrayal of lawyer Greenwald. His pompous diatribe at movie's end is less an indictment of the staff officers than a showboat for an Oscar-winning actor who doesn't appear until the movie's almost over and is making up for it.<br/><br/>All in all, the drama's human element—plus the really well done typhoon—remains compelling despite the years. I guess, that audiences of that day were right in making the movie the box office hit it was."

","I recognised the title, and I particularly remembered that it starred the actor from Casablanca and The African Queen, I assumed though it was some kind of gangster or film noir film, I was still going to watch whatever, from director Edward Dmytryk (Farewell My Lovely). Basically, set in World War II, Ens. Willie Keith (Robert Francis) is assigned to the decrepit twenty year old USS Caine, after graduating from Midshipman's school, the converted ship is equipped with mine sweepers. On the ship are fellow crew members Lt. Barney Greenwald (BAFTA nominated José Ferrer), Lt. Tom Keefer (Double Indemnity's Fred MacMurray) and Lt. Steve Maryk (Van Johnson), as well as original captain Comdr. DeVriess (Oscar nominated Tom Tully). The captain is eventually replaced by no-nonsense veteran Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg (Oscar nominated Humphrey Bogart), but as time goes by and his commanding skills are put to the test, Keith suspects there is something the matter with him. Keefer does not like the new captain, and spreads word that he may be mentally troubled, and Maryk starts to believe it may be true, with evidence and behaviour from him, e.g. requesting to find out who ate a certain amount of ice cream. It all comes to a head and the crew really believe there is something odd about Queeg during a typhoon storm and the ship is in trouble, but he does not seem to give them good orders. This ends up with his name on the sick list, and crew members of in trouble for mutiny, and they all go to court to answer questions about the accusations of Queeg's madness, in the end the slate is eventually made clean. Also starring Lee Marvin as Meatball, 12 Angry Men's E.G. Marshall as Lt. Comdr. Challee and Battle for the Planet of the Apes' Claude Akins as Horrible. Bogart I can agree is ageing but is relatively good in this, it is a rather all over the place story with not enough boost to keep you that interested, only the ice cream enquiry, storm and court case scenes really standing out, but it is certainly an alright drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Worth watching!"

","While many despise Captain Queeg as an egocentric crackpot, the more you learn about the man himself, the more you might see things his way. After all, the Caine was a disgrace of a ship, the sailors were a bunch of slobs, and so was their previous captain. Any incoming CO would have been horrified at the ship he inherited.<br/><br/>Of course, Queeg cracks up during the trial, as we all knew he would, but it's not until Jose Ferrar's post trial speech to the men does Queeg become a sympathetic character. He explains that while others on the ship were writing books or scoring touchdowns in college, poor old Queeg was in the front lines of Naval warfare during WWII for over six years. If he seemed a little crazy, it's because maybe he had a right to be. Plus, when he recognized his mental problems after a while, and reached out to his officers for help, they wouldn't lift a finger for the poor guy. Very sad.<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw this movie about ten times, and it wasn't until I watched it last night that I learned that the new Captain of the Caine at the end of the flick, was, in fact, the OLD Captain!

","It's not ""Mutiny On The Bounty."" When a movie has ""mutiny"" in the title there's probably an automatic tendency to think of it in terms of that 1935 classic. And Humphrey Bogart as Captain Queeg is not Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh. True enough. But once you set aside the expectation that any mutiny movie will be somewhat like ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" and that any captain who drives his crew to mutiny will be a little bit like Captain Bligh you can start to enjoy this movie on its own merits - and it is a very good movie highlighted by some superb performances.<br/><br/>Bogart was the real highlight. He did a marvellous job of portraying Queeg on the edge. Queeg wasn't a sadistic monster. He was paranoid and unsure of himself but not sadistic, and the mutiny didn't come about because he abused the crew (he merely insisted on discipline) but because the crew felt endangered by what they perceived as his incompetence. Queeg was an interesting character - the one who inspired the mutiny but one also that you feel some sympathy for. Bogart's performance reaches its climax - as does the movie as a whole - in its portrayal of the court martial, where Queeg comes unglued. This was a brilliant performance, maybe not Bogie's best, but one that shouldn't be missed. The rest of the cast also rose to the occasion and did a wonderful job. I give special mention to Fred MacMurray. I've never been a particular fan of MacMurray. Generally speaking in anything I've seen him in he comes across as lacking both passion and energy - a technically competent actor but one who just doesn't grab me. He was, however, very good here as Lt. Keefer - the first crew member to question Queeg's mental competence, who then lacks the courage to acknowledge that fact at the court martial and leaves Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson) holding the bag.<br/><br/>The story itself is interesting, although not especially exciting. There are some decent portrayals of shipboard life, especially the danger facing the Caine when the typhoon hits - which is the incident that causes the mutiny. There's far too much attention paid to Lt. Keith's personal life. Robert Francis handled that role well, but the relationships Keith had with his sweetheart and his mother were sidebars that didn't add anything of real significance to the story. There was a worthwhile (if brief) reflection on the issue of social class, the point being that one of Queeg's problems was that he was looked down upon by his own officers. He came from a humble background and was in the navy making lousy money for years, while with the outbreak of World War II he found himself surrounded by subordinates who had been busy making money while he was serving his country. So there's a lot of good material here, although I don't think there's quite enough to qualify this as a classic."

","NOTE: The later part of this review reveals certain spoilers and twists of the later part of the film. It is best read by those who have seen the film and are interested in how others view the film's message.<br/><br/>While this is not the usual type of film I would choose to review (as it is one of the all time classics of American cinema), I chose to make my feelings of it known based on one interesting fact I picked up in observing several characters-particularly Humphrey Bogart's Queeg and Fred MacMurray's Keefer. It is apparent at the very beginning of the film that the embittered Keefer would like to get out of the Navy as soon as he can, but his underhanded manipulations of his fellow officers and own cowardess himself makes him one of the more interesting villains in film history. MacMurray compares the new arrival Bogart on the U.S.S. Caine to Captain Bligh, an interesting choice both considering the subject matter and the leading actors between this 1954 masterpiece and the 1935 hit ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh is as far removed from Bogart's Queeg as Billie Hayes' Witchipoo in ""H.R. Pufnstuff"" is to Margaret Hamilton's Witch of the West in ""The Wizard of Oz"". They are completely different types of people.<br/><br/>Bogart's Queeg is a man of some charm and sensitivities, but when his nerves hit, paranoia strikes and he becomes quite irrational. There are moments when Queeg actually appears to be what today is called bi-polar. In fact, his paranoia is a symptom of a greater mental illness. In the scene where Bogart pleads with his fellow officers to understand him and give him a chance without paying with his pride, he reveals another dimension to this character that hadn't earlier been seen. The scene where he yells at Robert Francis's ensign for not fulfilling his duties to make sure the sailors keep their shirts tucked in is topped by another scene where Bogart then calmly tells Francis to forget about what happened. The switch from violent anger to gentleness is not a sign of insanity, but of something more treatable yet equally as dangerous if it isn't discovered.<br/><br/>But it's the revelation of MacMurray's villainy which is the highpoint of the drama. How he manipulates fellow officers Van Johnson and Robert Francis into considering mutiny, then betrays them on the witness stand after Johnson has reluctantly gone through with it, is the most surprising twist in this psychological drama. And when Jose Ferrer, as Johnson's reluctant attorney, drunkenly tells MacMurray off, that is the crowning moment to this drama. The only disappointing thing for me (other than the unnecessary plot line of Francis's overbearing mother and love for May Wynn) is that it would have been nice to see the treatment that Bogart's Queeg would get after the trial was over. Also, the fact that Johnson and Francis's feelings about Queeg went from hatred to pity could be explored a bit more. In many ways, this story is a bit ahead of its time in its tale of a form of mental illness that would not be given an actual name for many years."

Philip Francis Queeg, Humphrey Bogart, that things started to drastically change for it's more or less motley and disheveled crew. Queeg took absolutely no BS from the sailors and made them shape up or had them ship out if they didn't follow his orders to the letter. This seems to bother his communications officer Lt. Keefer Fred MacMurray, who in studying the human condition,in being a part time mystery writer, felt that Queeg was a bit off center in his mental stability.<br/><br/>It was after a while when Queeg started showing signs of being off his rocker in how he not only treated his men but the ship USS Cain as well that Keefer came to the conclusion that he's unfit to run the ship. It's then that Keefer tried to convince Queeg's 1st. Mate Lt.Steve Maryk,Van Johnson, to relive him of command before his bizarre actions end up sinking the ship together with its crew. The straw that finally broke the camel's back was the strawberry incident where Queeg became obsessed in finding out who broke into the ship's ice box and ate a number of portions of the frozen fruit without authorization!<br/><br/>This almost had Keefer together with 1st Mate Maryk and Ens. Willie Keith, Robert Francis, go so far as to report Queeg's actions to his commanding officer with Keefer then chickening out at the very last moment and aborting the entire idea. The dam finally broke during a violent Pacific typhoon when Queeg was about to let the USS. Cain go under the waves, by freezing in the sight of danger, that a reluctant 1st. Mate Haryk took command of the ship against Queeg's strong objections. This all set up the navel court marshal trail of both 1st.

","I'd seen this DVD on offer at a knock-down price for a few weeks and tended to ignore it feeling it was very probably dated. I was so wrong. Finally I bought it, watched it, and was blown away. Bogie is terrific, fully at ease playing against type, time and again allowing the insecure little kid to creep out from the bluster and temper the tyrant. Van Johnson, usually no better than insipid, also raises his game a notch or two as Maryk who allows himself to be manipulated by Fred MacMurray's text-book heel. In the last couple of reels Jose Ferrer might have walked away with acting honors had he not been sharing the screen with Bogie. Tom Tully is fine in support, topping-and-tailing things as both outgoing and incoming captain. Eddie Dymtryk has a good track record with morality movies (Crossfire) and his sure touch is evident here. Together with Mr. Roberts - also featuring a tyrannical captain - The Caine Mutiny is one of the finest naval-based second world war movies in existence."
"ilpohirvonen","7","0","2","19 April 2010"," A romantic navy-war film or a suspenseful courtroom drama?
","Probably both. The first half of The Caine Mutiny seemed like a simple navy-war film, slow-paced and it followed a basic dramaturgical model. After the first half the film started to look more like a courtroom drama, quite a good one actually. The dialog in the court was very well written, I can only recall one better courtroom drama from that era, To Kill A Mockingbird (1964).<br/><br/>A young officer, Keith (Robert Francis) joins a crew of an old ship, Caine. Everything seems to be going well until the Caine gets a new captain, Philis Francis Queeq (Humphrey Bogart). Queeq is acting strange in the eyes of the crew and they start to think that he might be paranoid. When Queeq starts to lose his nerve the crew rises in revolt.<br/><br/>The point where the naval captain starts to show signs of mental illness is the first turning point of the story. Unfortunately it is the moment when the movie actually starts going on. On the first half it wasn't getting anywhere. Of course slow-paced narration was usual in the 50's, but this isn't just that. I would have put a few more twists in the beginning to keep the audience interested. Even that I found the film successful, I wouldn't be surprised if the people of today found it dull.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart always played cynical, but sympathetic roles. He always achieved to get the sympathy of the audience. Best examples of those roles are probably, Philip Marlowe from The Big Sleep (1946) and Rick from Casablanca (1942). So if you've seen either one of those, get ready for a different kind of role. The Caine Mutiny was the second last film Humphrey Bogart made and I can use the word ""make"", because he always was the carrying force of a film. It's kind of sad to see him in his last roles, but also interesting.<br/><br/>There has never been a strike on a U.S naval ship, so why would they make a movie about it? You shouldn't forget the fact that the States just got out of the Korean war (1950-53). It's not a description of the U.S navy, but it is a very realistic survey of human mind. How does it work in a crisis. That is actually announced in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>This was a good movie, I didn't find the beginning boring or anything like that, but it just seemed a bit dull after the second half. So I will probably remember The Caine Mutiny for Humphrey Bogart's unusual role and for its impressive courtroom scenes."

Slowly but surely, with the reassignment of Comdr. DeVriess (Tom Tully) and the introduction of Lt. Cmdr.Philip Francis Queeg (Bogart) who became ""obsessed"" over the shabbiness of the Caine,intensity steadily rose and finally ended in a court scene crescendo. Paranoia at its best.I say it is Bogart's best acting in any of his movies,metal balls in one's hand or not.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is wonderful. The only reason why Bogart didn't win Best Actor was because everyone became enthralled in ""On the Waterfront.""

","""The Caine Mutiny"" is a fascinating and entertaining film that you're bound to find memorable. The crew of the a Navy ship known as the Caine receive a new Captain (Humphrey Bogart), who proves to be difficult to deal with in that he restricts the freedoms and liberties of his crew. The men of the crew begin to suspect he may be mentally ill once he begins making bad decisions in the midst of battles and storms, and they attempt to get him removed from the Caine. The film has strong parallels to ""Mister Roberts,"" in that both have a difficult Captain, both involve the Captain waking up his crew for petty reasons, and both involve the crew trying to remove the Captain. This film, however, takes a slightly more serious approach, and I actually like this film better. What makes this film interesting, and even funny, is the methods used to show the Captain's perceived insanity. For example, to demonstrate strawberries he feels are missing from the ship, he uses sand, which makes the crew feel awkward and gets some laughs from the audience. I'd have to say that this film is significantly less than perfect, however, because too much is spent on telling the predictable difficult love story of one crew member, which sets up an unnecessary second plot which does not enhance or have anything to do with the first. With better overall focus, the film could have been a true masterpiece. Still a very good, well-made movie worthy of the title of classic.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

The romance between tours of duty make a real foundation for the other action. I think that this was Humphrey Bogart's best dramatic performance, as he played an unstable man in command of a sub-standard ship, which might drive someone insane. I also liked the enforcement of discipline upon the ship, although Qweeg cracks up and becomes OVERLY disciplinary. You see a really disciplined ship when Commander De Vries takes over again at the end. I also liked Barney Greenwald's scolding of Maryk, Keith and Keefer during the party. They deserved the scolding, because Qweeg needed help and they didn't help him. And Yosemite National Park was nice, too.

It has been parodied many times, but the scene itself is intense. This almost certainly influenced the courtroom scene in ""A Few Good Men"" in both screenplay and the emotional charge. <br/><br/>Performances by Bogart, Ferrer and MacMurray are outstanding in this movie. MacMurray is brilliant as the officer who stirs the pot but is unwilling to shoulder the responsibility of his trash-talk, a low level junior grade officer who talks but refuses to walk. Bogart's character (Quieg) is unsympathetic; but he becomes an object of more serious contemplation and respect with Ferrer's commentary on the responsibility of subordinates to support the commander. <br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant and the movie a must-see for anyone who thinks that orders must always be followed or that-- especially in time of war-- a military chain of command is nothing but institutionalized megalomania. It is always more complicated."

Veteran Fred MacMurray was excellent and Jose Ferrer superb. Add to this the also good acting of Van Johnson.<br/><br/>The value of the film is that it shows the ethics of the people, how they behave, how some persons change according to the circumstances, mostly looking at their personal interests, instead others look for improvement. Navy and army have their rules and sometimes these are imposed following the instructions of the commander, mistakes here may cost lives and defeats. Those opposing wrong orders have no other choice than to follow them because mutiny is not an acceptable act and may bring severe punishment to those implied in it. The labyrinth of situations and behaviors is what you will admire from this film.<br/><br/>However, reading carefully the life of the director, Edward Dmytryk, one may assert that with this film he wanted to justify his behavior during the period of the process for the so-called antiamerican activities.

The movie is actually a pretty decent adaptation, considering the screenwriters had to reduce an 800-page novel to a two-hour film. They picked the right parts to jettison, deciding wisely to stick closely with the events involving Queeg and the Caine, and eliminating much of the narrative surrounding Willie Keith, our guide through the story. There's still too much of him, though, and not enough of Humphrey Bogart, who stepped out of character to play a possibly crazy and possibly dangerous naval captain. Van Johnson and Jose Ferrer should be singled out for their performances, Johnson playing the Caine's executive officer who instigates the mutiny and Ferrer playing the naval lawyer hired to defend the mutineers. The film trips along speedily enough, and it hits all of the high points, but it never really comes alive as a movie and instead feels like what it is -- a fairly faithful but rather uninspired adaptation.<br/><br/>And the less said about Max Steiner's blaring and woefully inappropriate score, the better.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

First, the acting. Humphrey Bogart was the tough guy of the movies, Yet here, he breaks down, he gets confused, he shows some forms of cowardice depending upon your point of view. Would De Niro take such a role today? He would rewrite the script to make the captain an ogre, but never a coward or confused. And I pick De Niro because he has proved an ability to act. He can do it, but doesn't. The characters make this movie, and they're all believable characters. And the movie makes some points. The viewer can choose if the points are valid, but the film makes an obvious stand. The film was also obviously a commercial for the Strawberry Farmers of that time. They undoubtedly had a hand in the production. There is no way that every single officer on board a ship would like strawberries. Very few people can stand them. A hundred years earlier, when Vitamin C was scarce on long voyages, there would obviously be a deficiency in the body which would prompt someone to eat these sour, horrible tasting things, but not in the U.S. military of the post World War Two era. This isn't an action packed movie. It is more of a drama, and it is well written, and well acted."

","Herman Wouk's novel of naval warfare won a Pulitzer Prize. The movie of the same name, ""The Caine Mutiny"" followed the book up to a point. The movie ends with Willie Keith returning to a ship under the command of his first skipper, Captain DeVriess. The book goes on for a long time after the court-martial. In fact it ends with Willie in command of the old Caine after the war ends.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this should not detract from what a truly great movie ""The Caine Mutiny"" is. It can stand on its own, and bear comparisons with the book, as inevitably happens in situations of this kind. Bogart, as Queeg is almost frightening in his portrayal of the paranoid skipper. His fear of combat and mistrust of his crew comes right off the screen. The fact is, we are uncomfortable and squeamish because we all secretly fear that there is a bit of Queeg in all of us.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is solid. Van Johnson as the stolid and at first, loyal executive office, Fred MacMurray as Keefer (in another great performance), Jerry Paris as Ensign Harding, and all the rest give the crew and wide and varied viewpoint. Very typical of real life naval vessels and the men who sail in them.<br/><br/>The typhoon scene and the way Queeg and the rest of the crew appear is in stark contrast as to how Queeg appears, at first, in the court-martial. Dapper, well-rested, in his best dress blues, one wonders how Barney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer) is going to convince the court that this is the same man who froze during the typhoon, screamed at Stillwell the helmsman (another great subplot in the book, but left out of the movie), refused to alter course, and forgot basic seamanship. Only Maryk could save the ship. Greenwald's tactics, rather than defending Maryk, were in going after Queeg. His best line in the court was ""It is not the defense's contention that Commander Queeg is a coward. Quite the contrary. The defense assumes that any man who rises to command a United States naval ship cannot possibly be a coward and that if he commits questionable acts, the reasons must lie elsewhere."" Greenwald proved this brilliantly.<br/><br/>The Caine Mutiny stands up as great drama, great writing, great acting, and great cinematography. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a great sea story. I would also strongly suggest that anyone interested in the movie take the time to read the book. You will enjoy both tremendously."

","Sometimes you can like a movie ""in spite"" of various performances and characters, rather ""because"" of them. Humphrey Bogart is sensational, as usual, as the paranoiac Queeg. However... Maryk (Van Johnson) is dense beyond belief, and so much so that only such a person would fall for the weak machinations of Keefer (Fred MacMurray), a short-timer whose performance as an inept officer was matched by MacMurray's one-dimensional portrayal, despite his depiction as some sort of genius novelist in civilian life. <br/><br/>And... can you say insipid, colorless, and annoying?? -- both Wynn and Francis conform to all of these, both in terms of their characters and performances, and their romance, which was thoroughly uninteresting, unnecessary, and even detracted from the film's main story. Queeg may have been crazy, but NOT in his depiction of Francis as inept officer. Ferrer's performance as the lawyer can be termed as ""whelming."" One presumes his injured arm was real, and simply written in in the flick. However, Jose must have been in some danger of further injury, if the scenery had collapsed while he was chewing on it. <br/><br/>Finally, there is no way - based upon his seniority, performance (as an officer) and experience to that point - that the Caine's predecessor captain (Tom Tully), now in command of a large combatant vessel (to which Francis' Willie character is assigned at the end) would direct this junior officer to ""take her out"" when the ship was leaving the dock. For one thing, professional pilots, specialized in guiding ships at the particular port involved, and often performed this task. If one of the ship's company did so, it would only have been either the captain, executive officer, or another of the more senior officers. Were the captain in actuality to allow Willie to perform this task, Queeg's court martial would not be the only one. But as someone who performed a 3-year period as a naval officer, many, many years after the Caine's tenure - I still enjoyed - in addition to Bogart - the overall setting. I loved Bogart's performance and the shipboard settings, the portions at-sea, etc., so much, I still would rate it at the maximum."

","i love this movie. it's one of my favorite movies. Fred McMurray's Keefer is a downright sleaze, who by todays standards would be considered as a study in passive aggressiveness. Whereas Bogie's Queeg is worn out by his duty. Bogie is masterful in his performance, but it's also clear the centerpiece of this film is Fred MacMurray, as Keefer who isn't someone you want to be in a foxhole with. Robert Francis is clearly playing someone who knows the book but needs real life experience. Francis wasn't as bad as he's portrayed in this movie. I've seen his other two movies They Rode West, and The Long Gray Line, which he was in before dying in a plane crash at the age of 25. Given the chance he probably would've became a solid actor. The supporting cast of well known and soon to be well known character actors is top notch."

","""The Caine Mutiny"" is one of Bogart's many great performances. As the new commander of the mine sweeping ship called the U.S.S. Caine, Queeg seems to be tough as nails. But we soon realize that the cheese is slipping off Queeg's cracker. As Lt Maryk (Van Johnson), Lt. Keefer (Fred MacMurray) and newbie Ensign Keith (Robert Francis)watch, Queeg seems to be riding the paranoia bus, tearing the ship up for a nonexistent key that he believes has been used to steal some frozen strawberries, causing a slight accident with a tow target while dressing down Keith for allowing a guy to have his shirt hanging out and playing around with a pair of metallic balls. Maryk is wary enough by Queeg's actions that he ends up reliving Queeg during a typhoon (Queeg's cowardly behavior causes the ship to nearly founder).<br/><br/>Maryk and Keith is brought on trial for mutiny, with Lt. Greenwald (Jose Ferrer)defending them. The scene in which Queeg takes the stand is absolutely stunning, in which we watch Queeg's madness brought to the surface. However, it is Greenwald's speech to the officer's of The Caine that brings the most shock: That it was Keefer that stirred the pot that brought the mutiny to a full boil.<br/><br/>All of the performances in the film are first class, even though some of the scenes with Francis and May Winn should have been left on the cutting room floor. Despite this, it is Bogart, Johnson and MacMurray that makes ""The Caine Mutiny"" the classic that it has become."
"nospam-66","Null","0","1","23 April 2004"," Superb (Spoilers)
","The Good This is a superb film which, unlike many other movies, has aged well.   It features, almost without exception, superb acting performances.   The two best actors are Bogart, in what to my mind is his greatest performance, and Fred McMurray (yes... that Fred McMurray) and the spoiler is when you realize what his role ends in the resolution of the case.  Tom Tully and Jose Ferrer are also superb in secondary roles.<br/><br/>The Bad. Very little Bad.   The only thing resembling bad acting is with Robert Francis, the ""romantic lead"".  A few times during the film, particularly the scene after the post trial party, he comes across a little bit wooden.<br/><br/>The Ugly. For its time the storm special effects were incredible.  Compared to modern CGI they are not great.  Not bad, but not great.<br/><br/>
A great Film"
"chuck-120","10","0","2","15 March 1999"," Great though not as good as it could have been.
","Let's get one thing straight;this movie is in NO way superior to Wouk's novel.  However, from a movie standpoint, it is very underrated in terms of ""best of all time"".  Bogart stands tall as always, MacMurray is brilliant. The only real flaw is the minimizing of Ensign Keith's role from the main character of the book to only a minor role here.  Other than that, the movie is brilliant."
"rollo_tomaso","10","0","1","20 February 2001"," My third favorite movie of all time
","I watch this movie every time I get a chance.  The acting, top to bottom is superb, especially Robert Francis as Willy Keith, and Van Johnson as Steve Maryk, and of course Bogey as Capt. Queeg, but perhaps the best is Fred McMurray as Tom Keefer.  He is riveting from start to finish.  The entire supporting cast is excellent.  Watch for Jerry Paris in a small but pivotal role as Ensign Harding, and E. G. Marshall as the prosecuting attorney. The photography and direction are absolutely top-notch.  and, the world it creates is every bit as real as the one around us.  Don't miss this truly great film!"
"VHelsing","10","0","2","29 December 1998"," Triumph against Type
","Humphrey Bogart turns in one of the greatest performances of his career as Lt. Cmdr. Queeg, a by-the-book naval officer whose shattered nerves render him tyrannical, indecisive, and cowardly by turns.  In other words, he is the polar opposite of virtually every character Bogie ever played in a long career of tough guys, good and bad.  Complementing Bogart are Fred MacMurray as manipulative communications officer Lt. Tom Keefer, Van Johnson as beleaguered executive officer Lt. Steve Maryk, and Jose Ferrer as Lt. Barney Greenwald, defense attorney for the mutineers.  Were it not for the release of ""On the Waterfront"" that same year, ""Caine"" would have swept the Academy Awards."
"MarkB-11","Null","0","1","21 February 2000"," This is subversive
","Though I am approximately as old as this film, I had not ever seen it, for one reason or another, in all that time. I had seen the later version, the TV performance of the stage play, but, though I am a devoted fan of Bogart's, I had not seen this film.<br/><br/>I now wish I could still make that claim. Not because Bogart's performance disappoints, it surely does not. Nor for the courtroom interplay, for at least a hint of it remains. Rather, I was left with a very uncomfortable feeling of having had my opinion manipulated and having honor besmirched, in the interest of justifying an action in which none of the participants can emerge unsullied. I suppose there had to be heroes, even if manufactured.<br/><br/>Viewers will find the foreground filled with the young couple, the purpose of which appears to rig the emotional response to the climactic situation, but which were entirely invented for the film. I found this distracting and textually unfair. That neither actor was particularly convincing in role will not help, though the girl sings nicely and looks only for decency, thus lending a wholesomeness that appeals. <br/><br/>Still, the overall tension and ambiguity of the situation, as originally framed, is muted and distorted in this film. Using Ensign Keith as the point of view distances us from the antagonists, but this is a foggy substitute for putting the audience in the position of sitting on the Court Martial, hearing their words paint the picture of what happened on the USS Caine. We could have had a variation on Rashomon. We don't get it here and we also get a very distorted view of Navy discipline. The ending particularly disappoints, suggesting that what is knavish behavior will be endorsed as being courage.<br/><br/>Watch for Jose Ferrer and Van Johnson, in addition to Bogie, but don't expect sense to be made of what you see. It is not there."
"dgmyers","10","0","1","4 November 1998"," The unheroic courage of duty
","Edward Dmytryk's film is far superior to Herman Wouk's 1951 novel. The _Caine_'s foundering in the storm remains as exciting as anything created by special effects studios. Except for an embarrassingly stiff performance by Robert Francis--the ""drop-dead gorgeous"" love interest--the acting is brilliant: Bogart in his most surprising role as a creepy and infective neurotic; Fred MacMurray as Keefer, unerringly catching the sophisticated condescension of the intellectual toward ""the uniforms that guard us while we sleep""; the under-appreciated Van Johnson as the First Mate of the _Caine_, who accepts responsibility for the mutiny; and Jos* Ferrer as Greenwald. The speech in which he exposes Keefer is unforgettable, redefining cowardice for all time. The film's theme is that it takes enormous personal courage to carry out one's duty, although this duty is not always clear-cut nor particularly heroic. Since Herman Wouk is an Orthodox Jew, a philosophy of the _mitzvot_, God's commandments, may be hinted at here."
