","I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands."

","Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.<br/><br/>It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently. <br/><br/>If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.<br/><br/>It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection. <br/><br/>I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.<br/><br/>Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.<br/><br/>I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie. <br/><br/>It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.<br/><br/>And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.<br/><br/>Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.<br/><br/>Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.<br/><br/>David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.<br/><br/>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.<br/><br/>And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now."
"jotix100","10","253","318","22 February 2005"," Georgia on my mind
","This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.<br/><br/>The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.<br/><br/>""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.<br/><br/>One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.<br/><br/>The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.<br/><br/>The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.<br/><br/>Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor."
"murtaza_mma","10","84","105","8 July 2011"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema
","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.<br/><br/>Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.<br/><br/>Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.<br/><br/>Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.<br/><br/>The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite. <br/><br/>The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.<br/><br/>PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"Alexis_Ray","10","164","224","15 November 2003"," Astounding Film - GWTW is the Definition of a Classic!
","The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?<br/><br/>GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).<br/><br/>
GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.<br/><br/>
The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. . ""After all, tomorrow is another day."" 10/10"
"dhable","10","192","269","27 September 2006"," The Greatest Film of its Time, and All Time
","I believe that when one views a film, one should consider the context in which it was made.<br/><br/>Barely 10 years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first full-length color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced, and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest pot-boiler blockbuster novel into a movie.<br/><br/>And what a movie. Stunning color, the most popular mail actor of his time, perfect music score, incredible action scenes, story line only 70 years removed from when it happened, and on, and on. Can you imagine what a store-clerk or a farmer, or a teacher experienced in that world, seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with? 1939 was a watershed year for great movies, and this one was the greatest produced. Try watching this movie as if there were no TV, no DVD's, only a few radio stations, spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned, never having seen such a movie before, and you get what I mean. Masterful for its time, and still timeless today."

That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come."

Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone.

"mallaverack","8","12","14","29 September 2017"," The brilliant Vivien Leigh made me so angry!!
","Just yesterday, I watched the entire GWTW for the first time (excellent quality DVD)and even though in comfort of my own home, I found this film way too long. I would not, could not, sit for almost four hours in a cinema to watch any movie. As a great number of reviewers have pointed out here, this is a movie of two parts, the second bordered on soap opera and partly for that reason, I am unable to give a 10 star, gushing endorsement to GWTW.<br/><br/>The characterisation also bothered me. Of the four principal parts, Leslie Howard's (Ashley Wilkes)was the least credible performance.Here we have someone ready and eager to go off to war but someone unable or unwilling to express his genuine love for his wife Melanie when taunted by the scheming, jealous Scarlett O'Hara. And it seems so odd that Selznick would cast an Englishman as a southern gentleman, particularly when Howard's 'Englishness' was so apparent for his entire performance?! Surely there were better-looking US actors (who sounded like southerners) to play the part of a so-called dashing lead character!<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it was apparent that everybody regarded Melanie(Olivia De Havilland) as a saintly figure who never spoke ill of anybody, it was almost beyond credibility that she appeared so blithely unaware of Scarlett's manipulative, brattish intentions and behaviour. And on learning of the possible romantic link between Ashley and Scarlett, Melanie reacts in an even more incredible fashion.<br/><br/>It was the portrayal, the brilliant portrayal by Vivien Leigh of the story's heroine, that unnerved me more than anything else. Despite the many reasonable defences of Scarlett's character and behaviour - she shows stoicism in hardship, displays admirable strength in returning the fortunes of Tara etc etc - I found Scarlett O'Hara such a most unlikeable, indeed, almost detestable character, that I longed for the scene in which she would get her comeuppance! She was selfish (selfless when material gain beckoned), simpering, headstrong, jealous, vindictive, childish, scheming, stubborn, cruel and seemingly incapable of genuine affection for anybody save her father - most noticeably not for any of her three husbands nor for the presumed object of her unrequited love, Ashley Wilkes. She even steals her younger sister's fiancé Frank Kennedy whom she marries for financial gain. Scarlett also shows no qualms in engaging in dubious business practices and exploiting convict labour in her lumber business.<br/><br/>How typical that shortly after marriage, Rhett insists he'll spend as much as necessary on a new mansion in Atlanta and Scarlett responds with: ""Oh Rhett, I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.""<br/><br/>On three occasions, Scarlett uses physical force to show her anger and pride when she slaps somebody across the face - if only Ashley or Rhett or even Mammy had the gumption to give this hoyden a similar whack!<br/><br/>From my perspective, never has there been a more apt closing line in a movie because regarding the fate of Scarlett O'Hara, I couldn't give a damn."
"ElMaruecan82","10","19","24","19 March 2012"," A universal masterpiece and one of the few privileged films where every scene is a classic on its own ...
","For some nostalgic dreamers, ""Gone With the Wind"" is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War, and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order, a Civilization forever ""gone with the wind"". It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.<br/><br/>But for some idealistic spirits, ""Gone With the Wind"" resonates as one of the most heart-breaking pages of American History, when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty, Freedom and Justice, and when History, written by the victorious side, ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. ""Gone With the Wind"" chronicles what the South used to be, a world where coexisted two cultures, the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simple-minded Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) who knew nothing about ""birthin' babies"" and the wisdom and authority of Mammy, Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning role: two figures, two extremes, so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them, despite the obvious stereotypes.<br/><br/>For literate minds, History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling, inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life, where the passing of time can be felt, when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic, sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), married to the gentle and extremely good-hearted cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable anti-heroine: selfish, greedy, jealous, but so brave, courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity, a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic ""As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again"".<br/><br/>The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters: she doesn't care for etiquette, for traditions, her spirit is free, her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past, Scarlett thinks of the future, as she says: ""after all, tomorrow is another day"". Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler, Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston', is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era, they think of money, greed, prosperity, and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for, transcending the old-fashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War, the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.<br/><br/>For many passionate hearts, this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen, a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strong-minded egos, two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley, the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude, probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War, too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth, a lost but so endearing cause, a fire that burnt inside, and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky, during Atlanta's big fire. <br/><br/>Love has never been as passionate as a love-and-hate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause, mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett, lost in her love for Ashley, will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does, Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable come-uppance ever: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life, and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This ""I don't give a damn"" voted #1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge, and he sure deserved it... and many wannabe-Scarlett would admit that too.<br/><br/>But while ""Gone With the Wind"" deals with lost causes, it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best- seller, it's one of the greatest films of all time, the greatest casting ever, the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's super-production that would become a landmark in film-making, with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors, forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree, during a beautiful sunset. Along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Gone With the Wind"" is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 ."

","One of the greatest achievements in film history. This is not only an eye-popping cinematic treat, but one of the greatest stories ever put on celluloid. The movie lasts nearly four hours--- it's longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made. But the time goes by so quickly that you'll miss it when it's over.<br/><br/>Of course, we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the 1860s. It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a plantation owner's daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times. She's willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it. When the movie opens, the country is on the verge of civil war--- North against South--- but Scarlett barely notices, and doesn't care in the least. Her biggest obsession is that she's in love with dreamy/poetic Ashley Wilkes, and she stays in love with him throughout 98 percent of the movie. <br/><br/>The only problem is....Ashley doesn't have any particular interest in her at all. In fact, he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton--- a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end. Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtain.<br/><br/>She would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler, a much more solid, rather dangerous man with a reputation as a no-good scoundrel. He is openly attracted to Scarlett, grows to love her (although he dare not let her know, or she'll use it against him), and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie, he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then, ironically--- and they never really are happy together.<br/><br/>The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one, the colorful supporting roles for another. <br/><br/>A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish, one-dimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex, multi-dimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes, she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless: the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family, and Melanie (keeping in mind that, other than her father, she doesn't even particularly like any of them) are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done, and she's fiercely courageous. <br/><br/>Despite her hardness, she does also grow as a person. To her great credit, she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie, she does finally realize how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there.<br/><br/>Some quick high points, and a few flaws: the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard, and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular--- wise, funny, respected Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and wistful, decent-at-heart prostitute Belle Watling (Ona Munson) are standouts.<br/><br/>The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droppingly beautiful.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-lifes as ""poor white trash"", and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.<br/><br/>A few minor flaws, and I do mean minor: 1) Most of the acting looks pretty modern, but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little old-style. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's ""method"" acting in the 1930s. 2) Some of the ""raw"" scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks, she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It *was* big-time Hollywood after all. 3) The second half of the movie is more ""talky"" and less action-oriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring, just less movement. I don't find it draggy, but some people do. <br/><br/>Still a heck of a good story, and a great film, so enjoy the ride!"
"alex_rickert","10","21","28","9 August 2007"," My absolute favorite movie. Nothing can hold a candle to this masterpiece.
","Gone With the Wind is without a doubt, one of the most magnificent romances ever. A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves it's viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel. A book was written in the 90s that continued the story but trust me, it sucked. Scarlett was such a complex character, selfish, spirited, passionate about everything she wants. But in the end you see that Scarlett changes, she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did. Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isn't a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you won't SEE the complexity. Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star, I pity you. You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didn't see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history. Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes. It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration (plus the effort it took) when you give this movie a one/ten. It deserves so much more."

"HowToCarrieOn","10","20","27","7 July 2007"," GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, it's terrific!
","There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than ""Gone with the wind"". It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.<br/><br/>I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it. <br/><br/>It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!<br/><br/>I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book: so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for ""Stagecoach"" that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.<br/><br/>Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.<br/><br/>Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for ""To each his own"" and ""The Heiress""). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.<br/><br/>If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it."

"rbverhoef","10","102","173","7 January 2004"," A great American classic
","'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.<br/><br/>Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie."

","If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece, you'll be swayed by the 65th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 4-disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day (after watching the film, of course). The two-hour making-of documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer (David O. Selznick) of the film affected the cast, director(s) and writer(s) -- and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett. The feature of Olivia De Havilland (in 2004) discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat. The picture and sound are great on the 65th Anniversary DVD, and the special features are a true treasure. Accept no substitutes, seek out the 65th Anniversary DVD and bring it home."

","I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old. I enjoyed it immensely. I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed, so when my mother recommended it to me, it was a yes from the start. The opening scenes show the young Scarlett O'Hara as she awaits her father's arrival. Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, ""After all, tomorrow is another day."""
"JohnHowardReid","10","8","10","29 July 2017"," Victor Fleming and Other Directors of The Wind!
","""Gone With The Wind"" won numerous awards, including the Photoplay Gold Medal and the Film Daily Best Picture of the Year (selected by polling over 450 U.S. film critics), but missed out on The New Film Critics (though Vivien Leigh's was voted Best Feminine Performance) which went to Wuthering Heights. The National Board of Review placed Gone With The Wind only 9th (even The Biscuit Eater preceded it).<br/><br/>The uncredited writers listed by IMDb all made a fair contribution to the finished script. Other writers who worked on the scenario at various stages include Jo Swerling, John Balderston, Michael Foster, Winston Miller, Charles MacArthur and Edwin Justus Mayer. Director George Cukor also took a hand.<br/><br/>The story of the filming of ""Gone With The Wind"" has been told in many books, most notably ""Scarlet, Rhett, and a Cast of Thousands"" by Roland Flamini (Macmillan, New York, 1975).<br/><br/>The director: Considering the continued popularity of at least three of his films, Victor Fleming has never been a household name. Yet more people have seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in a cinema than any other movie in history. In 1982, gross film rental to that date from the U.S.- Canada market alone was $76,700,000. (Negative cost: $3,957,000). As some movie prices have increased a staggering 5,000% since 1939, the figure needs to be multiplied by at least ten — perhaps as much as twenty or thirty — to give a just comparison with movies such as Star Wars ($193,500,000) and E.T. ($187,000,000). ""Gone With The Wind"" was voted the best film of all time in a poll conducted by the American Film Institute. But not only did Fleming direct this outright winner, he had another film among the nine runners-up: ""The Wizard of Oz"". Fleming was the only director with two films on the list.<br/><br/>Some critics have pointed out that Fleming did not direct all of either of these films. He had to leave ""Wizard"" for ""Wind"" when the former picture was almost completed. King Vidor finished up. However, Fleming returned after his stint on GWTW to supervise the cutting of Oz and it would be churlish indeed to cavil at his sole director credit. GWTW is a bit different. Cukor had already directed about 5% of the finished movie when Fleming took over. When Victor himself walked out after a particularly acrimonious clash with Vivien Leigh, Sam Wood was called in and then retained to direct a second unit, even after Fleming was prevailed upon to return. Wood directed 33 minutes (14%) of the released footage, particularly in the Reconstruction sequences. <br/><br/>William Cameron Menzies directed about 15% of the picture, including the Atlanta fire (the first scene shot) and the memorable silhouette of Leigh and Mitchell at Tara. However, Fleming directed all Gable's scenes (except Rhett's visit to Scarlett with the Paris hat, which was directed by Cukor; and Gable's final exit, which was actually directed by Selznick himself — in Fleming's presence). Fleming also shot the opening sequence of the picture at Tara, Ashley's furlough, Leigh and Howard's love scene in the woodshed, Melanie's death, some of Scarlett's return to Tara, some of the scenes in the cotton fields, and perhaps the film's most memorable shot of all — the enormous crane shot of wounded Confederate soldiers at the railroad depot. (Selznick himself directed some of these takes, and in the end, neither man could say who shot the take actually used in the movie).<br/><br/>The film's most memorable scene — Scarlett shooting Paul Hurst's deserter — was directed by Cukor.<br/><br/>It might justly be claimed that as Fleming directed the main story- line, he deserved the main credit. All the same he was unhappy at being shut out of the film's editing by Selznick. He boycotted the Awards dinner at the Ambassador at which he would have received his first — and only — honor from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. (He'd never been nominated before and was never nominated again.)"
"mmallon4","10","6","7","31 October 2019"," The Great American Movie
","So it's about time I finally got around to reviewing the big cheese itself, the towering achievement of American cinema, those four glorious syllables - Gone With The Wind.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind testament to how much filmmaking had changed in just 10 years from the beginning to the talkie period. From the astounding cinematic shots such as the long take of the bodies of fallen soldiers lying in the streets of Atlanta to those red Technicolor skies which I could stare at all day and huge matte paintings which are hard to distinguish from real sets - it's a world to get lost in (I can even ignore the very clear continuity error at the beginning of the film when it goes from dusk back to early evening to dusk again). Even those opening titles themselves are breathtaking, let alone for a time when opening titles where a basic on-screen title card.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind is a film with a fascinating history as it's backdrop. The pink elephant in the room however for many modern viewers is the troublesome historical image of the American South both pre and post-antebellum, whether just or unjust. The emphasis on the Wilkes family marrying their cousins doesn't help things but the real but the real point of contention is the dreaded ""R"" word, racism. To dismiss Gone With the Wind as a racist film is such a reductive argument, especially when certain commentators liken it to The Birth of a Nation, a film which shows black members of the House of Representatives eating fried chicken. To actually watch Gone With the Wind and study it closely, the way the film examines the racial issues is more 3 dimensional than popular critique contends.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind is told from the point of view of slave owners who don't see anything wrong with owning slaves (nor is it ever made clear if the plantation owners start paying their former slaves following the end of the war). The slave owners are a product of their time which the movie doesn't pass judgment on. Only one line of dialogue in the film deals with the question of morality when it comes to slavery in which Ashley responds to Scarlett's use of prisoners for labour which implies Ashley sees nothing wrong with slavery providing the slaves are treated well;
""Scarlett, I will not make money out of the enforced labour and misery of others""
""You won't so particular about owning slaves""
""That was different; we didn't treat them that way""<br/><br/>I find by far the most interesting aspect the portrayal of race in Gone With The Wind is the stark contrast between the black carpetbaggers (northerners who came to the south following the war who were perceived to be exploiting the local populace) and the recently freed slaves who are still childlike, dim-witted and happy to help out their masters of whom they are dependent on. The first black carpetbagger seen in the film features a sharply dressed, liberated northern black man traveling with a white accomplish but more significantly, in a scene not long after this Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) sneers at a pair of African-American carpetbaggers who are wearing fancy suits, smoking cigars and laughing. Mammy, who just had to beg for money along with Scarlett, sneers at this black men having the time of their lives. While the phrase is not used in the movie, these individuals would be referred to in many quarters as ""Uncle Toms"", perceived sellouts to their black brethren. The appearance of independent, well to do black men from the North goes against the narrative of Gone With The Wind being a racist film. I'm not qualified to comment on the historical accuracy of Gone With the Wind or how well it portrayed the time and place it depicts but there's too much nuance within the film's depiction to simply shout ""wasis!"" rather than having a more productive conversation or what the film did or did not do right. To quote the late, great Roger Ebert, ""A politically correct ""GWTW"" would not be worth making, and might largely be a lie.""<br/><br/>The film's opening prologue and the scenic shots of Tara could be seen as Confederate propaganda with its Utopian presentation of a world alongside the opening prologue which reads;
""There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind.""<br/><br/>Yet if there's any authorial or filmmaking intent to propagate Confederate lost cause mythology (historical revisionism that the Confederacy's cause during the civil war was a just and heroic one) is countered by much of the film's content. There's no explicit condemnation of slavery or the confederacy but does the movie have to do this? The biggest Uncle Tom in Gone With The Wind in Scarlet O'Hara herself for doing business with the northern carpetbaggers in order to save Tara and rise above poverty. What makes Scarlett O'Hara a character I can empathize with? By many accounts, I shouldn't as she's bratty, entitled and manipulative, yet you can't help but admire her desire to survive and make better of herself despite what onlookers might say (her gumption as Margret Mitchell describes it). Scarlet is shown to have little interest in the southern cause (as does Rhett Butler). This is memorably symbolized in the shot in which war has just been announced as everyone runs frantically through the foyer of Twelve Oaks and Scarlett angrily walks by them as if they aren't even there. Really the one cause Scarlett is dedicated to is that set of her family of Irish immigrants who came to America and accomplished the American Dream of owning land (""Land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for"").<br/><br/>Gone With The Wind is one of few films in which every character, no matter how minor is significant in their own way, with Star Wars or The Ten Commandments being one of few other films which achieve this. Now if only I could do without Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), one of the most cowardly, unlikeable characters ever - and that nails on chalkboard voice! Thankfully Scarlett gives her a good slap.<br/><br/>Then there's my boy, Rhett Butler; the cinematic embodiment alongside Han Solo and Indiana Jones of masculinity and individualism (and what an introductory shot!). Men want to be him and women want to be with him. A man out for himself and a realist doesn't really believe in the Confederate cause and is by far the most self-aware character in the film. In a defining scene Rhett points out how the south isn't equipped for war while the other southern gentlemen are blinded by illusions of grandeur and he's not afraid to call them out on it, while remaining a gentleman the whole time and removes himself from the meeting after the other gentlemen feel insulted by his comments. Even when Rhett joins the Confederate Army near the end of the war as he describes himself as having a weakness for lost causes, he's still self-aware of how foolish his actions are. Just before Rhett leaves Scarlet at the carriage after escaping from Atlanta, the film treats us to what I consider the greatest kiss in film history with its layers on intensity; melodramatic dialogue, sweeping music, and the blood-red sky.<br/><br/>Rhett's actions do however lead to one scene which gets many viewers in a tussle; Rhett's drunken marital rape of Scarlett after she refuses to have sex with him. Not to mention Scarlett is seen the following the morning have enjoyed the experience! I don't believe however the film at all rewards or gratifies Rhett for his actions and subtlety condemns it. Not only does Rhett show remorse for his actions the following morning, but the rape is also the final act which leads to the destruction of a marriage which was already on shaky ground.<br/><br/>Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes who is in many ways the counterpoint of Rhett Butler as the tender, effeminate, proud southerner (with a transatlantic accent, go figure). Ashley is a romantic who is crippled by his nostalgia for the old south. Ashley spends most of the film listlessly adrift through the harsher realities of the reconstruction era. Unlike Scarlett, he has no goals or ambitions for the future. All he can do is remember the elegance of his life as it once was and wish that he could return to those old days.<br/><br/>Rounding out the film's four main cast members is Olivia de Havilland in her undersung performance as Melanie Wilkes, crossing the line of being saintly without ever being sickly. Did she know about Scarlett and Ashley or not? Was she really a saint, or just naive, or perhaps exceptionally wise? Scarlet is the sister Melanie always wanted with each of them possessing qualities the other lacked, especially during their bond over joint survival during and after the war. Scarlett saved Melanie's life and Melanie kept her cool under fire in a way that earned Scarlett's private (though reluctant) admiration. She also did not hesitate to do hard work she never would have had to touch before the war. She was, therefore, more valuable to the family's survival than Scarlett's two sisters. The speculative question of whether Melanie knew about Scarlett's obsession with Ashley. Perhaps Melanie knew she could trust Ashley while seeing that Rhett was the right man for Scarlett by trying to promote their relationship."

","Gone with the Wind is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a classic story of romance and the struggle of loving and being loved. My mom, sister, and I have watched this countless times together and it never gets old. The movie wouldn't have been successful without its stars. The main characters, Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, make the movie. They fell into the roles as naturally as breathing. The chemistry between the two makes their love story real to the audience. The struggle in the love relationship between Scarlett and Rhett begins when Scarlett is spurned by Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, the man she set her sights on to marry. She finds out that he is to marry his cousin Melanie, played by Olivia de Havilland, and Scarlett does not respond well to his rejection. Scarlett is a spoiled belle used to getting her way and she doesn't realize that she and Ashley are not alone in the scene where he rejects her. Rhett is asleep on the couch and awakens when she throws a vase at the wall in anger. From here on, Rhett and Scarlett engage in a game of cat and mouse throughout the movie. There are not many other movies to compare this one to. The only one that I can say even compares would be North and South. It is set during the Civil War, just as Gone with the Wind is. North and South showcases a well-known actor, Patrick Swayze, who plays Orry Main, the main character in the movie. It is a love story that also shows the struggles in life and relationships that people faced during the Civil War, much like Gone with the Wind. I feel that Gone with the Wind is definitely the better movie. Although it came out in 1939, it was way ahead of its time. The way that Tara was portrayed as a mansion, with its expansive lands and cotton fields made me want to live there. The lighting that was used in scenes helped to convey the feeling of the characters. For example, when Scarlett and her sisters had to work the fields, the lighting was dark and dreary. It effectively conveyed the feeling of despair and helplessness that they were all feeling. Another thing I noticed was the camera angles. One particular scene which stuck in my mind was when Scarlett was in Atlanta. You can see the destruction across the city. There are bodies lined up in the streets. The camera pans out and in the corner you see the rebel flag flying. I think that seeing that the flag was still flying after such destruction and loss was amazing. Gone with the Wind is a timeless classic that reassures me that in the worst of times, people still find a way to fight for something they love."
"EThompsonUMD","9","13","19","1 January 2010"," Now playing in glorious Blu-ray!
","I first saw ""Gone with the Wind"" in its initial commercial TV broadcast in 1976. I have since seen the film numerous times via a succession of home video media: videotape, laserdisc, and DVD. Yet seeing the film once more on blu-ray and a large widescreen high def monitor is like seeing it completely anew. The sweeping cinematography of this classic epic film has never before been delivered to home audiences in such stunning power and detail. The achingly romantic score has never sounded better, whether heard in original mono or reconstructed stereo. Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) has never looked more rakishly handsome nor Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) more alluringly sensual. In short, for anyone not having seen ""Gone with the Wind"" in glorious big-screen Technicolor (almost all film viewers under the age of 70), the recent blu-ray release is a must-see revelation.<br/><br/>Beyond the compelling audio-visual experience, ""Gone with the Wind"" thankfully retains its fascination as a central piece of American popular culture - a work of art complex and rich enough not only to bear up under multiple viewings but to reveal, like great literature, different aspects of its meaning depending on the cultural and personal variables that a viewer brings to the experience. There were certainly a great number of impressions in my recent viewing that I don't remember having in quite the same way 30, 20, or even 10 years ago.<br/><br/>For one thing, characters and character relationships impacted me much differently than in the past. Scarlett's multiple marriages and affairs – even the protracted love/hate odyssey with Rhett – seemed less interesting now than the strength of character that enables her physical survival and success as a business woman. In many ways, Scarlett is clearly not an ante- and post-bellum Southern belle, but a woman of the 1930s, newly emerging from a patriarchal culture and acquiring a social role and status equivalent to a male's.<br/><br/>As with other '30s films that touch upon the redefinition of female roles, Scarlett's acquisition of masculine power is greeted with ambivalence or downright hostility. Even Rhett, who is generally bemused by and attracted to Scarlett's unbridled ""self-interested"" power grabs, eventually tries to ""tame"" and dominate Scarlett via marriage. On one occasion he tries to persuade her to give up the lumber mill and become a more devoted mother to Bonnie Blue. On another, he compares the ""heartless"" Scarlett unfavorably to Belle Watling, another hardheaded businesswoman but one whose ancient profession is considerably less threatening. Ultimately, Rhett attempts to assert his masculine power by an act of sexual aggression for which he would today be subject to domestic rape charges. Amazingly, given the era in which the film was made, nothing works for long. Scarlett is indomitable and irrepressible. Unlike other '30s heroines, Scarlett is NEVER reduced to a subordinate role. In the end, Tara and the screen are hers and hers alone.<br/><br/>Another thing that struck me in my latest viewing of ""Gone with the Wind"" was how much its creators (particularly David O. Selznick) strove to temper the racist content of the story materials. Of course, they were unsuccessful from today's perspective, but when the film is compared to ""Birth of a Nation,"" the original film epic of the South's secession and destruction, one can clearly see its progressive designs. First of all, glorification of the South's rebellion is tempered from the outset by the dissenting voices of such otherwise dissimilar characters as Rhett and Ashley, both of whom foresee that the South has written its own ticket to destruction by entering into a war it cannot possibly win and for an historically dubious cause. Notably, the two central male characters view slavery askance. Rhett is never a slave-holding ""gentleman."" And Ashley, who is the scion of slaveholders, reveals plans to free the Wilkes slaves upon the death of his father. Moreover, the slaves on the Tara plantation, while still subject to stereotypical treatment, are far more prominent and rounded as characters than in any previous American film intended principally for white audiences. This is particularly true of sage-like Mammy, of course, but not only of her.<br/><br/>The stark differences between the Mitchell/Selznick version of Civil War history and D.W. Griffith's can be seen most clearly in the post-war Reconstruction period. In ""Gone with the Wind"" the really ugly stereotypes of empowered blacks are absent, with the negative focus centering instead on white carpetbaggers. Even the threats to Scarlett's Southern Womanhood come not from renegade blacks, but first from a white Northern deserter and later from white scalawags in Shantytown, a locale that Scarlett intrepidly, if foolishly, ventures through. From this latter threat she is pointedly rescued not by chivalrous whites, but by her former slave, Sam, who beats off the would-be rapists and drives Scarlett safely home. What a far cry this is from ""Birth of a Nation,"" where Little Sister throws herself from a cliff rather than be raped by a former slave who has stalked her through perilous woods.<br/><br/>Above all, ""Gone with the Wind"" deliberately avoids all mention of the Ku Klux Klan, the terminally embarrassing heroes of ""Birth of a Nation."" The only scene that comes close to a Klan allusion occurs following the attempted assault on Scarlett when Ashley, Dr. Meade, and then-husband Mr. Kennedy, set about clandestinely to ""clean out"" the scalawags. Yet even then their targets are not primarily black, nor do the avengers don robes. The audience is not even permitted to witness the attack – only Ashley's wounds from it.<br/><br/>If Americans in the 21st century can still respond to ""Gone With the Wind"" - and clearly they can - it is not only because of its grand pictorial displays and epic action but because in terms of gender and race, this classic of Hollywood's 1939 peak year looks forward to a modern ""tomorrow"" as much as, if not more than, it laments a tragically flawed American past."
"vitaleralphlouis","10","24","39","21 July 2006"," All Time Best Movie Heads South
","For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera."
"Robert_duder","10","18","28","8 July 2007"," Everything you think it would be and more!! Gone With The Wind lives up to it's powerful reputation
","I waited 28 year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind. Four plus hours long? 1939? It was as old as my Dad. But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch it...since then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times. Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking. It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on. Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and it's pretty easy to see why. Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the 'special effects' the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone 65 years ago. The raging war, the fields being worked, the attacks being carried out, the people evacuating, and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war. Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and you've got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existed.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara. One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie history...probably top 3. Leigh's Scarlett will remain in your memory forever. Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise her...she's whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero. She's a strong female lead and her performance is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the greatest characters in movie history. Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler. At first I thought Gable's performance lacked depth. I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about. Rhett Butler had this air of over-confidence, a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties. His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine. Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years. Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which we've never known. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role. The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them. They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as 'Mammy' their beloved house servant. Leslie Howard as Scarlett's love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes. Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes (who marries Ashley away from Scarlett.) She was terrific in her role, one of the best characters in the film. Harry Davenport, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Butterfly McQueen...so so so many other terrific performances in this film. Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves (Superman), and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables.) <br/><br/>For years I haven't been a fan of old classics. Just now am I getting around to watching them but if you're the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind. It's LONG, there is no doubt about it but it's utter brilliance, story, action, romance, and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted. I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest. I don't know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end. One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again. 10/10"
"Natybug97","10","10","14","6 May 2014"," Two Stubborn Fools
","I love this film, I have seen it a handful of times, and even though I am always a little frustrated by the stubborn pride of the two main characters, I can never dislike it. True Scarlet O'Hara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone else's husband, but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all. Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down, and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and it's timelessness. We all love that great, timeless love story despite it's tragic ending, and Scarlet's tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive, even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part. Despite all this, the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed. That is the true power of this film. Aside from being able to enchant it's audiences, Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema. It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly well-done color, not only that, but the photography was phenomenal also. Much more can be said about this film, but for now, all I will say is this: Fantastic film, worth the 4 hours."
"natalie_the","10","7","9","9 November 2004"," I will not be putting this film down!
","I am disgusted by the comments of some of the users on this site who claimed Gone With the Wind is racist, who claimed that Scarlett is nothing but an arrogant b****, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>First of all, of COURSE this movie is racist. It was taken from a SOUTHERNERS point of view during the Civil War. The movie was not being racist on it's own saying that slavery should still exist, it was simply FOLLOWING the book. It is ridiculous to claim otherwise.<br/><br/>Second of all, Scarlett was portrayed as a conniving, ""vile"" woman. However, she DID love Rhett...and of course she didn't love Ashley- that was pointed out in the movie and the book that it was an infatuation, she simply wanted what she ""couldn't have."" Perhaps the author wanted to display how Scarlett blooms. One must remember that in the beginning of the book Scarlett is only 16. She is not an adult, she is a spoiled girl used to being a Southern belle. She may be sassy and audacious but she has grit. By the end of the movie/book for those who MISSED THIS WHOLE POINT. Scarlett realizes she loves Rhett and she realizes her wrong doing. If you read the book and watched the movie ""Scarlett"" you would watch her progress even further into womanhood. Scarlett was proving feminism (taking matters into her own hands) long before the idea ever broke out. <br/><br/>It seems to me that those who disliked the book would make a point that proved they just didn't get it. I'm not sure if they are used to cut and dry movies and books...but for crying out loud...expand your minds. The movie may not be the best acted/directed/whatever, but remember how early on this movie was made...it's not going to be today's Hollywood. But the story is timeless and incredible and BRAVE. It takes on the viewpoint which no one wanted to admit was out there. <br/><br/>Bravo!"
"jfarms1956","10","11","16","6 April 2013"," Shines brightly through the ages
","Gone with the Wind is appropriate for those 12 and up. If I could have given the movie a 20 out of 10, I would. 1939 was a golden year for movies with both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Color scenes in Gone with the Wind were hand painted movie frames. The era of royalty and nobility in America gave way after the Civil War to democracy and freedom. Yet, dreams still exist. The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie. It was a great day for movie lovers when Margeret Mitchell was on the train and met a book publisher. Gone With The Wind is a story which will shine brightly through the ages."

","After seeing the film Gone with Wind I felt into deep thought. The image of the main actress Scarlett haunted me all the time. In my eyes, she is the most successful shaped image in the film. Even though she undeniably has some shortcoming, I still admire her. It is those flaws in her personality that add to the perfection completeness and vividness character.<br/><br/>She, Scarlett, had something strong and special on her, such as great determination, strong willpower, etc. once she decided to do something, she never gave it up and stuck to it until she reached her goals. She was strong-minded, brave, and could adapt to a new situation acutely. She, not like Ishley, faced the cruel reality undauntedly, instead of trying to avoid it. (We can't escape from it, when it comes, what we should do is face the music.) Let¡¯s see a example here. After the arrival of home, Scarlett fond nothing left on the homeyard---no food, no clothes, no mother since Negroes were set free, to survive, she yielded herself to work hard on the farm as a farmer. Her sisters were so loyal to the previous life and hated Scarlett for her forcing them to work in the fields. Anyhow, the homeyard had a good turnover. At the moment she was informed that she would lose her farm and house unless she paid 300 gold coins for the tax. All she had amounted to less than 10 gold coins in total. What could she do? To give in? No, not a chance. She ran around those old acquaintances to collect the money. She hated to borrow money Relter, who was her last hope. However, she decided to meet him in the disguise of the new dress made of curtain. All she had done was a complete waste. Relter was so playful and refused her. Bu chance she met Flank, her sister's financee and tricked him into marrying her, which added to hate of her sister for her and to criticism of the people on her. This seemingly revealed that Scarlett was a bad person. But just let us think about it. Do you believe that her sister would give the money to the family to get rid of the tax after her marriage? Scarlett knew sister better than us. She was wise to do that. All she did was for the good of the tara, her family. That Scarlett did something people at that time thought bad didn't mean she was bad. On the opposite side, she was a person with the completeness of personality. She could do something different and something that the people had never done or had dared to do before. At that time, woman wasn't considered as graceful to be a businesswoman and was criticized. By those who were conservative and loyal to their opinion about women. Scaelett had no notion of that. She knew if she had the ability, she could do that as well as men, so she took business as her career and indeed had done a good job. People's unfriendly reactions never stopped her. She was so strong headed a person that she was hardly shaky. Scarlett was so special and different, and set a good example to me. I¡¯ve learned a great deal both from Scarlett and the film, which is excellent one and is worth seeing."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","Null","3","3","25 July 2011"," In my view, the greatest film of all time
","I know that many do not agree that GWTW is the greatest film of all time, but I think they don't put the film in the perspective of time. Think of the production values, the risks in making the film, the richness of color, and the brilliant performances that have stood the test of time -- all from 1939!!!!!!!!!! I have watched this film many times, but tonight for the first time I watched the Blu-Ray edition. I am nearly stunned at the picture clarity of a film that is 72 years old! The screenplay is brilliant, particularly when you consider how much was packed into 3:40. Although they are episodic, for example in the second half of the movie you watch a marriage disintegrate, and see how often both Scarlett and Rhett could have made things better by simply modifying some simple word or phrase or body language. And, in the first half of the film, the horror of the Civil War is portrayed beautifully by the suffering of the soldiers in the hospital scenes or the pullback scene of the bodies at the railroad depot.<br/><br/>And then there are the performances. Clark Gable had long been ""The King"", but this was his role of a lifetime. It eclipsed anything he had done before, and never again did he reach the dramatic heights he displayed in this film. It was much the same for Vivien Leigh, although she had not had such a long and successful film career previous to GWTW, and due to her mental illness had a limited career afterward. I've read that some people are not impressed with Leslie Howard's performance as Ashley Wilkes. But, I think it's it's the role that causes that, because the Wilkes character was such a wimp...but I think Howard (with whom I'm not generally impressed) played this role so well. Olivia deHavilland was superb here, as well, although she had many fine roles in her career. Thomas Mitchell is excellent as ""Pa"", even more so after he lost his mind...the best role of his career. And then there are the supporting actors who lend something special to this film -- Aunt Pittypat (Laura Hope Crews in a classic role), Hattie McDaniels, Butterfly McQueen, and a long time favorite -- Harry Davenport.<br/><br/>""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Ben-Hur"" are ""9s"", but GWTH is still the gold standard!"

","When I first got this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge fan of war based movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting. The romance element of the movie helps keep it interesting, and the movie perfectly balances romance and the Civil War aspects of the film. All in all, this movie was amazing and I can see how it is one of the greats."

","The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.<br/><br/>It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade. <br/><br/>But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance. <br/><br/>It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.<br/><br/>However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.<br/><br/>Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that..."

","Any number of minor aspects of this 1939 release may seem ""dated"" by today's standards. But not Selznick's terrific sense of drama and certainly not Vivien Leigh's performance. Which seems eternally fresh, surprising, rich and compelling. One of the best times I ever had watching this movie was several years back when it was given a wide re-release and playing at a neighborhood theater on New York's west side. It was a midweek afternoon and a number of African-American schoolgirls had elected to play hooky and see it. They were completely enthralled, and the reason why was Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara. They were impulsive teenagers, and so was she. In fact Scarlet might best be described as the most formidable impulsive teenager of all time. Can't really be sure how much of the rest of the film got through to these girls, but they cheered Leigh on for whatever it was she wanted to do. And who can blame them?"

","It is complex write anything about ""Gone With the Wind"" because I have the impression that everything or almost everything has been said about this work that remains current and exciting after 76 years. ""Gone With the Wind"" is far from being an art film, but this fact does not diminish its greatness. ""Gone With the Wind"" is a prime example of that commercial films can be very good and well made. Commercial films do not necessarily need to be based on cliché's and conventional or happy endings. It can be said that the film was bold by the standards of the time, to invest in a young, brave and stubborn girl, however, full of flaws like any real person. Scarlett drinks, flirts a married man, eat too much in public, negotiates with enemies, collects the debts of friends, accepted dance despite being in mourning, finally defies all moral severely respected by the society to which it belongs. But it does not get to indulge with the transgression. Quite the opposite. Deep down, she is a moralist who lived intensely admires the straight and values ​​taught by her mother. She transgresses to survive and to enforce their will. She transgresses to keep the land left by parents who for her, symbolically, it was the parents themselves. To Scarlett, violate or transgress not is not the issue. The question is to survive. Scarlett is a survivor of war, hunger, poverty, the tragic loss of their parents, a never materialized love. Although, it is seen as a great heroine for his tireless ability to fight, Scarlett in a way, it is a loser. As the character of Clark Gable said, she throws out happiness with both hands. ""Gone With the Wind"" is much more than an epic; It is much more than a movie about the war and its consequences; is a film about determination and survival figures incarnated on earth image. Another factor that deserves special attention is the character Melanie. We are not sure to what extent she knows the real feelings and personality of Scarlett, which is a very interesting open issue. A memorable soundtrack! A 5 stars classic.

One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. <br/><br/>The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.<br/><br/>This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film."
"graphicstyle7","10","9","13","28 August 2017"," It is a controversial movie, true...
","Here is how I feel about Gone With the Wind. My mom's side of the family is Southern. They lived mostly around where Scarlett and her gang hung out. Some had plantations and owned slaves. My grandparents were ""old fashioned"" in the clueless way Margaret Mitchell was. I've heard their side lots of times, and I found it to be wrong. If I were Black, I wouldn't like to pass by statues erected to past oppressors either, nor would I want to have flags in my face constantly reminding me of a sorrowful past.<br/><br/>However, please consider this.<br/><br/>1. If you're going to get upset at GWTW and ban showing it, then you would also want to eliminate the rest of the movies from back then which show stereotypes as well, correct? Unfortunately, ALMOST ALL, probably about 98% of Black roles for the stage and screen pre-1960's were just as racist as in GWTW, many were worse.<br/><br/>The problem is, if you get rid of these movies, you erase the work of any Black actors back then as well. You won't see why Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for a performance in a land so bigoted, she could not sit in the audience during the premiere. You won't see lots of superb singing, dancing, and acting by any African-American during this time. They will be completely ignored because of the context.<br/><br/>You wind up punishing all these people who wanted to work in entertainment and had little influence over the roles they played as well as those whites who made those movies.<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>2. Hollywood whitewashes and pretties up EVERYTHING. It always has. Don't get upset because they did it for the millionth time in GWTW.<br/><br/>Consider the movie ""300"", about ancient Sparta. There was no mention of slaves they owned, or the organized pedophilia that went into the training of boys (Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>And yet, there were no mass protests at the rose colored vision in the movie. No one came to picket the film because it omitted a horrendous flaw in Spartan society.<br/><br/>Why? Well, for one thing, that was well over 2000 years ago. What happened in Sparta is no longer directly relevant to anyone. No normal, modern army expects raping young boys as part of their training.<br/><br/>It's no longer relevant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, GWTW IS STILL RELEVANT. Many of the problems portrayed in this film and any film from back then with Black actors are still haunting the U.S.. Denying that there is anything wrong and everything is just fine and has been fixed is simply denying reality.<br/><br/>Why do I care? Unfortunately, GWTW is one of my favorite books and films. It has a strong, still unique story of feminism I can relate to. That is what is relevant to me in the film. I have tended in the past to brush aside the slave part because it seems surreal to me to own people. I'm certainly not sitting there, hoping the ""good ol' days"" can come back. I like the modern world with its aim of acceptance and tolerance. I get the feeling the vast majority of viewers feel the same way.<br/><br/>How do we solve this problem? When Blacks are truly integrated, and that day will come, then GWTW will no longer be that relevant. It won't strike any raw nerves. The protests will die down, just as they have for every other hot button issue who's time has come and gone.<br/><br/>True classics never die. GWTW has many redeeming features which have made it endlessly entertaining to me and thousands of other people. Keep talking about it, show the movie now and then with perhaps a short lecture on history and context before, and know that in time, the pain will fade.<br/><br/>ALSO, KEEP IN MIND, when you criticize Scarlett for her actions, there was NO OTHER WAY to survive in the Victorian world if you were a woman other than SEDUCING A MAN. It's not like she could go off to college and get a degree. Women were NOT allowed to own land, have a bank account,vote, hold a job (besides perhaps a hat maker or, much more commonly, a prostitute) etc. If she seems strange for marrying men she didn't love,keep in mind it was that, or be totally broke and homeless.<br/><br/>Much of the criticism of her character comes from total lack of knowledge about this context.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself. I first saw it when I was thirteen. It made quite an impression. Forty years or so later, it still moves me. Some people criticize the main character, Scarlett, because she's ""not nice"". She's not ""typical"" of a main female character.<br/><br/>Scarlett behaves in an uncomfortably realistic way. She's not a nice lady, she is a super-rare female anti-hero. She's not comfortingly evil, but she's never going to be a goody two shoes. Some people don't know how to handle that.<br/><br/>Melanie, on the other hand, is criticized for being ""unrealistic"". I would ask anyone who thinks that to understand the context of the times she lived in. There was no mass media, save for the local newspaper, and that was hardly an international trove of information as they are now. No TV, no radio, no internet. A person could grow up to be innocent in a way we simply don't experience in modern society.<br/><br/>It's a movie about survival. And it's a war movie without battle scenes. I would urge you to watch it."
"frankwiener","8","9","13","8 July 2016"," A Film of War Produced During Anxious Times
","Since I initially wrote this review on July 8, 2016, there have been no less than 135 additional user reviews of this film in only three years and six months. Some of these reviews are good and some are terribly written with no actual explanation of the writer's rating or opinion. On the ""helpful"" list, this review appears as ""number 60"", at least at the moment, so I have no idea how any IMDb reader will ever find this addendum. At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself. As I state below, my one criticism of the film is its unnecessarily long duration, especially the disappointing second half which fails to sustain the drama and spectacle of the first half.<br/><br/>In my view, this movie is primarily about a catastrophic war, specifically the American Civil War, and it illustrates how this war so seriously impacted not only two extended families but an entire region, the American South. It is particularly significant to me that this movie, about the horrors of a major war, was made in 1939, a time when much of the world had already been thrust into another major war, World War II, and when many Americans must have been considering the consequences of our country's potential involvement in that war upon their own lives, upon their own personal situations. The world had become a very frightening place in 1939, and, although the United States had not yet entered the war, many informed, educated Americans must have been very concerned and even anxious about the very real possibility that the raging conflict overseas might one day arrive on their doorstep, including all of the uncertainty, disruption, and physical danger that would inevitably follow.<br/><br/>Some viewers may appreciate the love scenes and the soap opera aspects of this cinematic epic, but what I find far more compelling is the dramatic circumstance of the characters who are suddenly immersed, some willingly and others involuntarily, in the middle of the bloodiest and most traumatic war ever to occur on American soil. I agree with other reviewers who wrote that the movie is too long. I believe that at least one hour could have been cut from it without destroying any meaningful continuity. After the explosive action of the first half, the second half appears somewhat anti-climactic and even boring for me.<br/><br/>This movie is dominated by the central character of Scarlett O'Hara, so powerfully played by a stunningly beautiful Vivian Leigh. All of the other characters, especially the males, seem to pale in comparison to her with the exception of two of her slaves, played marvelously by Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who both manage to upstage Scarlett herself, which was not an easy feat. I realize that these were indeed tough times for the State of Georgia, and one had to be strong and determined in order to survive in such difficult circumstances, but did Scarlett have to be ruthless to the extent that she would steal her own sister's beau, a man she did not even love but decided to marry only on account of the economic potential of his hardware store, including its promising lumber business? Some may say that she only did this so that Tara could survive. Would that alone justify her callous, almost inhuman, behavior?<br/><br/>The scenes of beaten, war ravaged Atlanta are very impressive, especially for their time, and must have been a daunting task for the director, Victor Fleming. Although the music and frequent scenes of blazing sunsets behind dead trees have become clichés in time, I think that they were much more effective before ""Gone With the Wind"" became such a widely familiar cinematic classic to us. In many regards, ""Gone With the Wind"" has become a victim of its own huge success in the way that its most famous scenes, music, and characters have become too familiar to us and the object of constant spoofing, satire, and even derision. What a shame.<br/><br/>To me, this is a ""must see film"", not only for Ms. Leigh's remarkable performance but for the historical drama that is so effectively portrayed as the South becomes tragically victimized by the very war that many had initially glorified so unrealistically. The reality of war's horror, conveyed so convincingly in this film, is its most important message. A world in a state of peace and prosperity must never be taken for granted. No one would agree with this more than Scarlett O'Hara herself, a casualty of a major conflict that she never wanted in the first place. Of course, Ms. O'Hara would never allow herself to be victimized by anything or anyone for very long. In any case, ""she's not going to worry about that today. She'll worry about that tomorrow."""

","You have to acknowledge the grandeur and technical and logistical achievements of Gone with the wind. Even by today's standards the filmmaking is superb, let alone if you compare it to other films of the late 1930s.
Which leads to my question: can you watch this film today and rate it with a contemporary view on cinema? Or is it unfair to apply 21st century standards to this epic?<br/><br/>If you take a look at it with a modern approach, it's not hard to see flaws:
<ul><li>it's very long and inconsistently paced.</li><li>the views on slavery and the 'happy big black mamas' is dated and hard to bear.</li><li>the (over-) acting looks fake.</li><li>a spoiled brat is our heroine.</li></ul><br/><br/>Having said that, I still love this film. Seeing it is like coming home. Nostalgia is a powerful sensation and I feel it every time I watch it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think Gone with the wind isn't a perfect film. But it is perfectly realized and can still warm your heart if you can switch off your 21st century views and ignore what you're used to seeing nowadays. Only then can you truly appreciate the film for what it is: a highly influential masterpiece."

","This is perhaps the most classic movie ever made!! ""Gone with the Wind"" is always on every major critic's list of top ten movies in the history of American movie making!! So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it. The cast, the costuming, and the classic lines to this film are all first rate!! If you are interested in seeing one of the all time flicks in movie history, than, it is an absolutely must for you to see this film!!"
"Nitestik","1","117","256","30 November 2007"," The Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time
","The film claims in the opening credits to have a historian as a consultant, Wilbur G. Kurtz. And, at the time of its making, what he did sufficed as history.<br/><br/>The Old South was claimed to be a ""pretty world,"" ""a dream remembered,"" and full of gallantry. There are innumerable problems with the film the greatest of which is racist sentiment.<br/><br/>The portrayal of ""Mammy"" is particularly racist. Manny has no name and her entire life is invested in Scarlett's. She says the happiest day of her life is when Scarlett has her child. She is always worried about the family's reputation and lives vicariously through them. She becomes terribly upset and emotional when Rhett and Scarlett fight. Most outrageously, Mammy is seen pushing USCT soldiers aside to allow Scarlett through as if Mammy and other former slaves have no interest in their own freedom.<br/><br/>If the portrayal of Mammy is bad, the portrayal of Prissy is even worse. Mammy is at least portrayed has having some sense whereas Prissy plays ""the simple-minded darkie"" with no courage at all. Her high pitched voice serves to emphasize her inanity.<br/><br/>Mammy and Prissy's characters are part of a larger lie that the movie attempts to tell: the myth of the ""loyal darkies."" In the scene where Atlanta is under attack by Sherman, some black men say, ""Don't worry! We'll stop them Yankees!"" When one slave is given a watch he refuses to accept it and insists that Scarlett should keep it as if to say, ""Look! These white people were so great to us we want nothing from them!"" The film also advances the myth of benign slavery. Scarlett's father tells her to treat slaves gently, as if the only problem is a few bad masters who commit excesses. When Ashley complains of misgivings about white prison labor, he says that he kept all of his slaves well-fed and would have freed them when his father died if the war had not done so first.<br/><br/>Finally, the film advances the myth of the evil carpetbagger. ""Carpetbaggers"" are shown to be terrible and vicious people who kick injured Confederates off the road and ride with nicely dressed black men sitting in a position of equality. One night, the white southerners ""clean out the woods to protect their women,"" which is just code for organizing the KKK and committing murder.<br/><br/>The film is rife with faux sentiment, posturing, and social strategizing. Scarlett O'Hara is simply a terrible character. She is screaming, crying and whining. She's weak, flirtatious, boy-crazy, and hopelessly in love. She slaps Prissy and tells her she will sell her south. Scarlett is manipulative, lying, deceptive, lovesick, and obsessed with looks. And all her tribulations are emphasized by melodramatic music and foreboding weather.<br/><br/>Even scenes which would otherwise be wonderful must be condemned because of the vicious intent behind them. The contrast of the tree, Scarlett, and her father against the setting sun is simply perfect. But, it intends to advance the myth of the idyllic Old South. After the attack on Atlanta, the camera shows the land covered with soldiers and pans back up to the Confederate flag. While expertly shot, the scene is used to evoke sympathy for the Lost Cause.<br/><br/>This film competes with Birth of a Nation for the title of ""Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time."" Gone with the Wind is less racist, but much more celebrated than Birth of a Nation. Given the two criteria, it is difficult to say which is worse. Birth of a Nation has been kicked off AFI's Top 100 Films while Gone with the Wind still sits perched at #4. Whereas films like Christmas with the Kranks are unequivocally awful, Gone with the Wind is worse. The reason being that it is much worse to be shitty and pernicious than it is to be shitty and harmless.<br/><br/>To paraphrase a quote from Scarlett, ""As God is my witness, I will never watch this film again!"""

Now I can say that it really is good. It's simply a masterpiece and probably one of the greatest movie of all time. It's hard to explain why it's so good... It just is. Everything is just perfect from Vivien Leigh's excellent performance to Clark Gable's. The bravery and toughness showed by Scarlett O'Hara is what we need to see more often on screen: strong female characters."

","So, I've been calling myself a movie buff for ages, but it took me to get to the tender age of 23 to see one of the greatest classics in the history of cinema. I must say I was pretty impressed. The film has some outdated touches of the theatrical and romantic, but much less so than I expected. It's also interesting how the main character of Scarlett O'Hara- nicely portrayed by Leigh- is so very unsympathetic, almost an anti-hero. Still, Scarlet is a strong and interesting character who gains depth throughout the film. She goes from being a detestable manifestation of a privileged, unproductive lifestyle to an independent, even cruel persona full of determination and courage.<br/><br/>This one was at its best when depicting the cruelty of the American civil war, when the focus of the story was less on relationships and more on the agelessly political."

","GONE WITH THE WIND, MGM, 1939 IMG_1251.JPG IMG_1251.JPG GONE With The Wind"" is so famous, probably the most famous motion picture of all time, that the initials alone GWTW are enough to identify it, yet, how many people alive today have ever seen it, not chopped up on the boob tube, but uncxut on a full size screen — undoubtedly very few. One of the most rewarding side bars of this years 65th Berlin Film Festival was the restored Technicolor Section in cooperation with MoMA of New York City, and the Eastman Kodak Archive in Rochester, N.Y. Among the many choice offerings a totally restored print, fifteen minute musical preamble and all, with 15 minute intermission at the halfway mark, of ""Gone With The Wind"", the magnificent silver screen wonder of 1939 ~1940. I had seen it so long ago that I needed a refresher on the plot — Scarlett such a scheming bitch and Gable such a cool cad, Both negative characters you can't help being charmed by and rooting for both even through they are pitted against each other in a towering knock-down drag-out love-hate relationship. I had forgotten that Gable actually marries Leigh and they have a child together who gets killed in a horse jumping accident before their horrified eyes. Of course everyone remembers Gable's famous last line: ""Frankly Scarlet — I don't givva Damn! """" – but how many can recall the context? ~ It was in reply to Scarlett pleading with him not to leave her, after giving him nothing but heartache and two-timings all along — claiming that now at Long Last with the death of their child she realizes that she really loves Him — (Not wimpy high-minded Ashley Wilkes) — and exclaims pitifully as he is about to walk off: ""What will I do with out you!!"" — to which GABLE's memorable last line finally puts her in her place. It is well worth noting that in 1939 ""Damn"" was regarded as a such a strong expletive that It barely got past the damn Puritannical censors of the time! ~~ Today he could say: I don't give a flying f**k"" – and in our oversaturated four letter word world it wouldn't be half as shocking.<br/><br/>A marvelous experience to see Gone With The Wind in all its blazing glory here in Berlin. But, what struck me Most about It in retrospect was how similar the central love triangle between Gable, Vivian Leigh (The all time most beautiful and alluring silver screen bitch!)– and Leslie Howard, was — nearly a perfect parallel to: Bogart, Bergman, and Paul Henreid, in CASABLANCA — So similar, in fact, that one can't help thinking that the writers of Casablanca were simply reapplying a tried and true box-office formula just three years later, updated, of course, from the Civil War to World War II then raging in North Africa. With uncanny serendipity, only weeks after the premiere of Casablanca the big three allied leaders, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin met at Casablanca to decide the postwar fate of Europe.<br/><br/>Come to think of It Gable as Bogart, Vivian Leigh As Bergman, and Howard as wimpy high Minded Hero Victor Laszlo, would have been almost as good a cast for the B/W Curtiz pop Masterpiece. Curiously enough actor Leslie Howard was Shot down by the Nazis on a flight from Gibraltar not far from Casablanca which was thought to be carrying Winston Churchill in June 1943 — just as the film Casablanca was becoming the box office sensation of the year back in the states."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","8","12","7 February 2013"," Fact, Fiction, Feminism, and The Elephant in the Room
","""Gone With the Wind"" represents a vision of The Old South through the romanticism from which great stories are born. Nearly 75 years after its initial release, the movie is still loved and beloved, offering a portrait of a stubborn woman's sexual adventures backed up by a war whose sad legacy remains with us even today.<br/><br/>From the outset, it might seem to just a simple romantic adventure about a stubborn woman's attempts to find her own measure of sexual freedom, but there is something deeper. The backdrop of ""Gone With the Wind"" is a war that completely restructured the American landscape and created social legacies that we, in the 21st century are still dealing with. At its center is a character who reveals the nature of being able adapt to the enormous changes that would follow.<br/><br/>Scarlett O'Hara represents the future. When the war ended, the rigid tradition of The Old South would die away as the southern economy and traditions were essentially destroyed. Scarlett won't be pinned down by that tradition. She is stubborn, independent, man-hungry and pursues a man, Ashley Wilkes, for no other reason than that he is promised to someone else. She marries to keep from being an old maid, and then pursues one man while resisting another. She sees what she wants and takes it; she is keen but not perceptive. If she were then she might have seen that Rhett Butler is almost her exact equal. He is no gentlemen, visiting Miss Whattling's house of ill-repute and openly admitting that he runs blockade for profit. They are perfect for one another and we know that their attitudes will become the social norm, set in place in the years after the Civil War.<br/><br/>What is unexpected is the way Scarlett casts off the role of southern lady and begins toiling in the dirt to save the family plantation. Her sisters complain about callused hands and sore backs but compare Scarlett with the other women in the movie, you will see the she will survive once the war has ended because she has learned how to face it head on. She has learned how to scheme and manipulate. She grows When we first meet her, she's sitting on the porch at Tara, her face bright and cheery in the Georgia sun surrounded by a flock of potential suitors. This would be the position she would seek to find again in life, the option of having her pick of the man she wants even when he belongs to someone else. Scarlett provides the narrative and the entire business of the war is seen through her eyes. There are no battles. The reality arrives when wounded soldiers are flooded into town in such vast numbers that the streets are lined with wounded and the dead.<br/><br/>That point of view allows us to see Scarlett grow from winsome southern belle, to frustrated widow, to a woman who rises from the ashes of the war, determined to never be hungry again. After that lies her transformation to revolutionary as she determines to return Tara to its former glory. By the time she arrives back to Tara to find it plundered by Yankees, we know that Scarlett won't give up.<br/><br/>That ""Gone With the Wind"" allows such a feminist story is impressive. Yet, the movie avoids the elephant in the room. It deals with slavery simply by not dealing with slavery. The struggle to free the slaves remains at the edges of the film. In that, the movie is a product of its time. The book had been part of a long series of literary works known as ""Anti-Tom Literature"", books that came after ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" that attempted to downplay the reality of slavery by focusing on the good-hearted white slave owners while portraying slaves as docile and apparently happy. In Mitchell's book Scarlett regards the slaves in internal monologue, ""There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy."" The issue of slavery has always been so touchy. Note that most films about The Civil War take place from the point of view of The Union. ""Gone With the Wind"" follows the Anti-Tom ideal by dealing with the slaves only very briefly. Male slaves are seen briefly while two female house servants, Mammy and Prissy, supply key supporting roles – again holding up the film's feminist slant. Mammy is a mother figure; always the conscience over Scarlett's shoulder as she propels herself forward into wreckless sexual adventures. Prissy, the younger house servant, portrays a somewhat comic role.<br/><br/>The movie avoids controversy. Margaret Mitchell's book had a subplot involving the KKK, but in adapting the film, producer David O. Selznick omitted that element. He wanted to avoid the same controversy that unpinned ""The Birth of a Nation"" 24 years earlier.<br/><br/>Perhaps dealing with the issue in the cold light of day might have unpinned the story's romantic fire. This is a story about a Southern woman's full-force sexual adventures. Slavery doesn't seem to be a part of this story, only the provocation of the war that surrounds it. We are asked to admire ""Gone With the Wind"" for how it portrays women while at the same time forgiving it for how it avoids the larger issue of slavery as a means of still providing escapist entertainment. That's a lot of weight to carry, especially in our politically correct culture. ""Gone With the Wind"" focuses on ideas and attitudes that were prevalent in the 1930s. It is a time stamp, a window into the attitudes of a time gone by. The Civil War is not presented here, only an interpretation of the way we all heard about it, so maybe we can look on this movie as a manner of how the devastation of this war came to be so romanticized. In that way, the movie is invaluable."
"leonardfranks","2","29","56","14 August 2010"," Most overrated film I have ever seen...
","Okay. That's a pretty bold statement, so I'm going to try to defend it as completely as I can. I am willing to acknowledge that the film is very nicely presented. The acting is excellent, the sets are good, and of course the color is magnificent. I'm sure it was even more magnificent at the time. But that's not enough to make a good movie, and pretty much everything else about this movie is completely off.<br/><br/>First of all, this whole film is based on the idealization of the south and the demonization of the north, and I find that highly objectionable. I could deal with it if it were a question of showing the perspective of the people living back in that time and their values. That would be a genuinely interesting thing to do, and it's the sort of thing Goodfellas does. But that's not what this is. It's a complete fantasy-denial that anything bad ever happened in the South and that there were any redeeming virtues to the North. I need not delve into the actual historical picture of the South, or the actual ugliness of slavery, or the actual behaviors of the soldiers and carpetbaggers. Look it up if you don't know. Oh, and don't get me started on the racism in this movie. It was practically intolerable.<br/><br/>But even besides that, the plot is wrong. This did not need to be four hours long. Worse yet, after sitting through those four hours, you don't get anything. It feels like Wagner's The Ring. A lot of people are dead, but other than that, everything is precisely where it was at the beginning for our characters. Rhett is wandering, and Scarlett is at Tara. Great. And there were problems along the way too. At no point was there any remotely sympathetic character. This can be handled well, but really wasn't here. A lot of the people kept changing character, like Rhett caring for no one one second and then fighting for the Lost Cause the next, or Scarlett continually swinging between having courage and whining helplessly all the time. And I won't bother to try and summarize the plot. I doubt you can either without naming every event because it meanders around pointlessly. At one point it's a romance, then it's about a lumber yard, then who-knows-what. It comes out to four hours of rambling, Confederate nothing.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think if this had worse actors and was in black and white, no one would have heard of it. There's nothing much going on. Catch Lawrence of Arabia if you want a good old epic film."

","I didn't really think Gone with the Wind was as great as everyone says it is. Granted, I am a teenager and I do tend to enjoy modern movies a bit more than older ones, but I love movies of all kinds. I did enjoy Gone with the Wind, but it was entirely too long, and it left me bored at times.<br/><br/>The acting was OK. I don't think it was anything to get in a big fuss about, but it wasn't so bad. The scenery was pretty cool, especially the mansion. I found the characters to be, for the most part, annoying. Scarlett was a first-class sl*t if you as me. She would marry man after man just to serve her own purposes, often involving revenge or money. She struck me as a leech in this way, and her screeching voice tended to get on my nerves. Brett seemed like a jerk, but at least he was a first-class jerk. I found it very funny when he would try so hard to get Scarlet to admit that she loved him, and when she finally let her feelings out, he'd call her stupid. The black-stereotype servants also were a little annoying, though funny for the most part.<br/><br/>I did like the movie, even though I speak bad of it. The storyline was good and it was interesting to watch Scarlett go change from the hopeful romantic that she started as to a very different woman. I just don't think this movie is as great as everyone says it is."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","9","14","24 September 2015"," A True Classic
","A movie should not be judged purely on its level of writing skill and overall deftness. For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.<br/><br/>That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.<br/><br/>Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.<br/><br/>But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go. <br/><br/>There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).<br/><br/>Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, ""Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" <br/><br/>The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man. <br/><br/>Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it. <br/><br/>But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.<br/><br/>Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.<br/><br/>So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day."
"magical-kingdom","10","9","14","28 June 2015"," Best Movie Ever Made
","I'm a movie buff,so there are several favorites on my list but if a number one choice must be made then hands down it would be ""Gone With The Wind"" was, is, and will always be the best movie ever made. Ever since its premiere in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" was ahead of it's time and set the bar for all motion pictures after it. There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement. Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this film,and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.<br/><br/>Footnote: I really enjoyed the sequel called ""Scarlett"" especially the climax. My sister encouraged me to watch but silly as it may seem I felt a sequel to this masterpiece was sacrilegious."
"telegonus","10","27","52","14 May 2002"," Worth a Peek
","A long romantic-historical extravaganza, and the crowning glory of 1930's movie-making, the David Selznick Gone With the Wind is worth watching if only for the color and production design. The story is on the soapy side and concerns a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara, her obsessions, tribulations, her flaws and her (few) good points. I've never much cared for her character and have never been able to understand why anyone would. She starts out bitchy and ambitious and ends up the same way, only she's been through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most characters in serious fiction there's no real growth in Scarlett, no understanding, no self-knowledge. Everything's external with her. She learns about life mostly by watching other people fail.<br/><br/>Her lover and then husband, Rhett Butler, is a dashing adventurer who understands Scarlett intuitively, and for all his erring ways really cares for her. Why is anyone's guess. They're soul-mates, in a manner of speaking, something he ""gets"" and rather enjoys, and which she never gets, and suffers for. The man she really wants is the one she can't have, the sensitive planter (plant?) aristocrat Ashley Wilkes, who represents the ""best"" of the South. But Ashley is taken with another. I find Scarlett's infatuation with Ashley the most interesting aspect of the film emotionally. It's so complete, so absolute, so crazy and so human, it's wholly believable, and is the one facet of Scarlett's personality that makes her at times touching. Were it not for her passion for Ashley Scarlett would be no more than a garden variety bitch, but on account of him she is an heroic bitch, a larger than life figure, almost awesome in her ferocious appetite for what is basically a fantasy.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind is definitely worth watching. Its Technicolor is remarkable even by today's standards, or maybe I should say especially by today's standards. Color is the one technical aspect of film that hasn't improved over the years. If anything, it's declined. Another glory of this movie is its production values, and for this a tip of the hat to Mr. William Cameron Menzies is in order. Menzies was many things, but is best remembered as a pioneer of motion picture art direction and set design, and Gone With the Wind is a superb example of this, and his crowning achievement. One has to pay close attention to fully appreciate the Menzies touch. Though he did not formally direct the film he essentially storyboarded it, which is half the battle, and one can see his work in the way characters are framed by, among other things, windows, doorways and fences. There's a completeness to this production, down to the smallest detail, that is astonishing. Menzies was also fond of forced perspective, which is the art of making things look longer or larger than they really are.<br/><br/>The film is by no means perfect. It's too long, for one thing, and the second half drags. Much of the book and film's success had to do with its appeal to women. This is after all a woman's story, and it's largely told from a woman's perspective. But they might have thrown in something for the boys. There are no real battle scenes. Aside from the burning of Atlanta there's not a lot of action. While there's a good deal of movement in the film,--people do get around from place to place, usually on horseback or by carriage--it would have been nice to have seen them, once they arrive at their destination, do more than talk, argue, scheme and throw themselves down on sofas or across beds. At least the interiors are lush and pleasing to the eye. Another problem with the film is Max Steiner's overused, emphatic theme music. The more modest incidental music Steiner wrote, including some jolly little mood pieces, are quite nice and used far more judiciously. Still and all, there are some striking images in the film: the first glimpse of Tara, the entire barbecue sequence, the burning of Atlanta, the ball where Rhett ""buys"" Scarlett for a dance. Producer Selznick was very careful to stick as close to the novel as possible as much as he could, as he was afraid of alienating the book's millions of readers. Yet this fidelity gives the film an at times episodic quality, and one yearns for it to break free from its shackles and take on more of a life of its own. Even with these shortcomings, there's more than enough life in this movie to go around."
"nanturn","6","23","44","2 August 2009"," Not all that in my opinion ...
","I'm sorry, I generally don't like this film. Expansive, epic, picturesque, an achievement for its time ... OK. A compelling story about the devastation, hardship, suffering and brutality of the Civil War, and the courage and resilience of its survivors ... OK, but credit the novel for all that.<br/><br/>A key problem is the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara, who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie. Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot. Another problem is that the film drags in many places. Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley. Gosh, move on with it! <br/><br/>Even for its time, I can't see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur."
"reid-hawk","10","4","5","8 March 2019"," The definition of a classic
","Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its 80th anniversary. It's kind of embarrassing to me that I, a self-professed lover (and at this point addict) of cinema, hadn't yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of, if not THE best American movie ever made. Part of me had always been turned off by its 4 hour runtime, as I am in college and don't often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single 4-hour sitting. But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of. I had wasted my time watching D.W. Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext. So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited. And yes, Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist, but it is also so much more, and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic.
The first thing that struck me about the movie was just how gorgeous it was. The painted backgrounds, the costumes, the set designs, all of it was just so intricate and colorful. Even now thinking back on it Gone might be one of the top 10 or so best looking movies I have ever seen. I especially love the mind boggling scale of the sets of Atlanta, especially that long sweeping shot that moves back to seemingly show endless miles of soldiers laying wounded on the ground. The juxtaposition of the bloodied soldiers mixed with our main character wearing a beautiful dress is poignant, and it is definitely one of the greatest images in any movie ever made. From a technical standpoint, the only thing I really dislike about this film is two or three scenes with really bad looking rear screen projection, which is honestly more a of a nitpick seeing as just about every movie back in the day used rear screen projection or something of the sort. I guess those few moments just stick out worse when everything else is such an unblemished visual delight.
What really blew me away though, and what makes this movie a true classic that will remain ""ageless"" is the strength of the writing. This movie was so dark that I could not believe it was made in 1939. How it managed to sneak in things like rape and on-screen child death through the censors of the time shocked me, and I'm sure was even more shocking for the audiences at the time. Besides dark moments, the story as a whole hinges on a very psychologically unhealthy romance between two characters that are just plain bad people, and are never really painted or made out to be anything else. Our main character, Scarlett O'Hara, is surprisingly deep and nuanced. Being a woman in a ""man's world"" she uses all the tools at her disposal to get what she wants. She seduces men she has no feelings for and uses them and their wealth to get what she wants. She is cruel and uncaring; she doesn't shed a tear for her two husbands that die and uses unwilling prisoners that she allows to be abused as essential slave labor to run her business (though the movie makes sure to point out that they, of course, treated slaves so much better than these men and their slaves just loved being slaves so much). Through all of this though, she remains likeable and I found myself time and time again routing for her. Her vow at the end of the first half of the movie to ""never be hungry again"" is one of my favorite movie monologues. She starts out as a bratty and selfish little girl, and ends the movie is a strong and unbreakable woman. Her love interest and eventual husband, Rhett Butler, is an equally complex and flawed character who grows throughout the film. He's a womanizer who routinely is found at a brothel, and overall is just sort of an a-hole, although he's quite the charismatic a-hole. At his lowest point, he accidentally pushes pregnant Scarlett down a set of stairs and inadvertently kills their unborn child. After this he becomes a bitter man who, fueled by jealousy and depression, turns into an alcoholic before finally leaving Scarlett. Throughout all this he time and time again shows himself to be a redeemable and somewhat chivalrous character, as hypocritical as that may seem. He goes to fight a battle for the South just because he sees it as his duty and nothing more. He saves the man who Scarlett loves more than him just because it is the right thing to do. Overall the interactions and broken romance between him and Scarlett makes up the crux of the story, and these interactions are about as complex as the characters themselves are. They are both also played wonderfully by actress Vivien Leigh and actor Clark Gable who, while not reinventing acting like Brando, are both amazing in their own rights, especially for the time.
However, like I said this film is undoubtedly racist. The ""maid"" in the film, who is simply a house slave in the vein of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Django Unchained, is essentially a racial stereotype (like every black character in this film) who speaks in ""jive"" and is played for comic relief. Still, her character is legitimately funny and her actress Hattie McDaniel truly plays her well and gives her a deep emotional range that makes her a better character than she seems to have any right to be (McDaniel ended up being the first African American to win an Oscar for acting for her role in this film). Other scenes allude to some of the major characters being part of the KKK and going on raids to ""clean up"" areas of lawless criminals AKA poor black people. The second half of the film is even a tirade against Northerners and Democrats o as Gone sees them as: carpetbaggers. Throughout the film every aspect of the Deep South is romanticized to the extreme. Yet, none of this could detract from the overall film too much to me. Just like McDaniel's character ""Mammy"" is likeable even though she's inherently flawed in the way she is written, so is this film. I can't ignore this film's ignorance, but I also won't let it damper this masterpiece for me.
Some of my other flaws in this film that don't really have to do with racism are as follows: Prissy is the most obnoxious character I have ever seen. Besides a few comical moments that somehow work, she's beyond annoying and her loud voice constantly sounds like nails on a chalkboard for the few scenes she's in. Sometimes the pacing also isn't great, and a couple of times before the intermission I found myself a little board. That's honestly about it. Sure the acting isn't great from lots of characters, but that's just a product of the way acting was done at the time. Now, what else do I love that I haven't mentioned? I love the score. It's just simply fantastic and bombastic. I love the poster and want my sugar daddies out there to buy it for me. I love the complexity and ambiguity of the ending. Heck I even love this movie's love triangle. I love really everything about this movie. My gut reaction was to give it a 9 out of 10, but in the process of writing this I'm probably going to move it to a 10/10. There's nothing I can say about Gone With The Wind that has not been said millions of times before by people much more qualified than I, but I don't think it hurts for people to keep writing about this movie. Classics like this deserve to be written about and gushed over."
"markrichardson1999","1","61","139","22 November 2004"," pro-Confederate travesty of history
","This move travesties the history of the war and especially of the Reconstruction, which was not at all the disaster that pro-Southern historians and their sympathizers would have us believe. This film is awash, as one would expect, in nostalgia for the ancien regime, and not even the charm of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable can make me forget that fact. Such scenes as the one in which the director has an African-American character riding along in a carriage singing Marching Through Georgia are obviously meant to inspire bitterness and resentment in the viewer, and the Federal troops are uniformly portrayed as brutes. This is nothing but polite version of Birth of a Nation--at least so far as its politics go."

","""Gone with the wind"" is the best story - the best book adaptation - the best classic film ever. I first saw it when I was just a kid, and I immediately fell in love with it. I re- watched it millions of times. And I still can't get enough. Scarlet O'Hara is one of the best film/book characters of history as she represents the spoiled flirty Southern Belle that - when in need - can react to destiny and war and fight like a tiger to survive. She is my idol. Strength combined with beauty, passion with a tantrum, shrewdness with sweetness. The only thing I hate about this heroine (apart from basically killing the poor horse when she finally reaches the ruins of Tara) is her blindness: she just cannot recognise Real Love and a Real Man. The book isn't altered too much, but something is different compared to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece. However, the war and the slavery are well pictured, the intensity of the story and every single character is strong; the setting is just perfect, in particular if we note that this movie was made in 1939! I think ""Gone with the wind"" is the most genuine mix of love story, war narrative, great acting (the charming Rhett Butler played by the superb Clark Gable, the weak Melania played by Olivia de Havilland - the only living actor from this movie) and amazing music scores. It is definitely a must- see and the 220 minutes time just flies."

","GONE WITH THE WIND is an epic melodrama which is very difficult to describe. Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is a love story at the time of the Civil War, in which each in its own way serves some human punishment. <br/><br/>Although I am aware of racist moment that really exists in the film, I would not have acted rudely. Although the ""slaves"" happy and complex, their characterization is not at all realistic. This is best seen when they become part of the romance or love affairs of their ""masters"". The film is quite delicate and subtle. Some erotic themes are, to the extent permissible content, quite convincing.<br/><br/>Set design, costume design, framing, story, theme and music are top notch. From the first sequence can be seen magic and suggest that this movie is very expensive.<br/><br/>Gable (Rhett Butler) and Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) are excellent. Scarlett is the central figure, and Rhett's character who meets her. Both characters are outlaws, unaccepted and stubborn. Perfect for each other, or just doomed?<br/><br/>Howard (Ashley Wilkes) and de Havilland (Melanie Hamilton) are boring. However, when acting individually their good acting comes into play. They look great in a pair with the main two characters. It is interesting that even they do not fit into the concept of people from the South. <br/><br/>Novel. So many tragic figure, none of which is happy. One persistent striving toward the one she can not have, and when it gets it is no longer interesting.<br/><br/>I always watch this movie with relish, while I do not feel numb ass."
"Vartiainen","Null","6","9","24 June 2018"," An epic movie in every meaning of the word
","One of the most well-known films even today. Still the highest-grossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.<br/><br/>Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation, and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.<br/><br/>I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person, not at all. She's scheming, manipulative, almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude, where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered, is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable, on the other hand, oh so very much.<br/><br/>And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others, she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.<br/><br/>She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's (Olivia de Havilland) straight up sainthood.<br/><br/>The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South, and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people, who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film, but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable, to tell the truth.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted, masterfully scripted, masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted."
"Hotwok2013","Null","6","9","27 June 2015"," Gone With Vivien Leigh.
","When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. ""Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee"", they said. Without a shadow of doubt, ""Gone With The Wind"" based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a ""woman's picture"" & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was ""no effing good"" & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her ""As God Is My Witness"" speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie."

","""Gone with the Wind"" is definitely one of those films that have time as their best judge. The highest-grossing film of all time, accounts its achievement through its outstanding quality. It is a film that was not made in a rush, one which benefited from the work of one of the best people in their field at the time: Selznick, Fleming, Cukor, Gable, Leigh, Havilland, Steiner - all proving that a masterpiece needs both time and talent to achieve completion.<br/><br/>The first thing, which astonishes the viewer, is its sheer vastness. The large landscapes that seem to stretch to eternity are juxtaposed to some telling close-ups, allowing the audience to be absorbed in that era that was gone with the wind.<br/><br/>In a period, in which Europe was preparing for war, Selznick was producing a lavish film, which tackled so many sensitive issues at the time, and yet without imposing any particular view. The best way to understand the impartiality is probably by quoting a Yankee woman, from the novel, who after receiving an answer from Scarlett about where to find a good nanny for her children, ends up saying: `I would never allow a black person to take care of my children'. Scarlett has nothing else but conclude that these Yankee's are just ignorant, remembering the soft bosom of Mammy. The main characters are nothing but great supporters of the humanity that lives in the heart of their slaves, as opposed to the liberators who would not bother a lot about the fate of a nation after it's sudden fall.<br/><br/>Regardless, of its political difficulties, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a landmark in the history of film. The great performances are probably the main reason why people continue to adore the love story between the dashing Rhett Butler and the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. Clark Gable has all the charisma and all the charms of Mitchell's character, raging from sheer passion to absolute destruction of the ego. As for Vivien Leigh, there is nothing to be reproached, apart from the fact that she is too beautiful for the characteristics given in the novel. She delivers a truly memorable performance, portraying so clearly the psychological struggle behind her choices. The supporting cast is applaudable: Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil give some of their most memorable appearances.<br/><br/>And then there is the soundtrack. The main theme is a haunting piece, possibly Steiner's best achievement.

","I am 24 years of age and I can say that, for the first time in my life, last night, I saw GWTW. Thats right, I had never, ever seen the movie before, not even bits and pieces of it. Oh sure I saw Rhet sweep Scarlett off her feet and up the stairs, but that was about it. I had never seen one of the greatest American classics ever produced, not even a part of it.<br/><br/>And would you believe I saw it alone? I have been asked by noit so few a girfriend to watch this movie, romantic and sweepingly epic as it is, but have always declined. Why? Well because I find, in my own point of view, that older romantic movies, just as older horror movies, are just not as effective on me today as they most undoubtedly were on people of that era. So I stayed away from this movie, believing that the hype and over-zelous love for this film would find me far too expectant of it and, thus, far more dissappointed then I should be. I was, however, very much wrong.<br/><br/>I don't believe I will give, in any way, a general review of this film. Anyone reading this now knows of the story or has worshipped at its cinematic feet for years. Besides, a text book review, a dateline chronicle of this splendid film would not do it justice. As with great pieces of literature, the beauty lies not in the details but in the emotions garnered from the experience, and GWTW evokes such earth shattering emotions.<br/><br/>You may scoff at my assertion that a movie could render upon me such strong emotions, but I feel that anytime an event takes place which alters the types of things that please you, that motivate you, that entertain or touch you in some way, well to me that is and shall always be earth shattering. I remember watching, as a child, JAWS and realizing that I could watch this story for years and years without ever tiring of it. It started a life long fascination with the sea and sharks which has never subsided. I remember being in 7th grade and reading for the first time a book that was a joy to read, a book that was an event at night rather then a burden. After reading, for my class, Lord of the Flies, I continued on, reading Lord of the Rings, and on and on and on after that to the point I find myself now where no night of mine is truly complete until I read a bit. I remember all of these things, and many more that have meant so much to me, and I can easily say that GWTW was one of those watershed moments for me.<br/><br/>I want to visit Tara, I want become kismit friends with Rhet Butler, I want to find people in this world who loath Ashley as much as I do, who love and respect Melanie as much as I do, and who lust after, for some reason and not just physically, Scarlett as I find myself doing now. I want to see the old South as it was, with all of its splendor and horror, in slavery, put out upon the curb everyday for all to see. I want to see what the Civil War really looked like and I want to stand, jaw dropped and with a sense of dread, as men from both sides talk of short wars and little bloodshed.<br/><br/>Mostly however I want to live the life that Gone with the Wind lays out. I want that life to be my life, if only for a moment, if only as a whisper in the ear of time. This movie made me believe in love, in that unquenchable love that passes all understanding, and made me afraid of it's trappings. I feel, even now, for Rhet Butler, so many years of wasting his love on someone incapable of returning it. I pity now Scarlett, left sobbing on the bottom steps of her gigantic home, loving the man she had just driven away with every pore of her being. I feel for them all as if I had known them myself, greavied with them in moments of lose, and celebrated in moments of triumph.<br/><br/>This movie made me feel good, fullfilled, and satisfied completely at the end, so much so that I went to bed as writer, director, and actor, finishing a story I had just watch unfold. Sending Scarlett off to fight for Rhet, leaving Ashely behind to wallow in his own well deserved misery. I watched in my mind as Mammie grew older and more gentle as the years went on and Tara became smaller, yet more open and loving in its old age.<br/><br/>I saw all this in my miond only because, as a great novel does, a great poem does, a great prose does, this movie left us all wanting more. Wanting it so much that we would stay awake at night, creating a larger, even grander world then the one we had been allowed to peer into. We needed to create more because 4 hours and 20 some odd years was not enough for us. It was but a taste, one so good we needed to raid the rest.<br/><br/>And so will it go. New movies will evoke new emotions and new characters will make me laugh and cry and groan from disapproval, but GWTW will live on in my memory. With other films, they will pass in the halls of my thoughts only when I see them on TV or hear of them from friends, but GWTW will visit those halls from time to time without any pre-announced engagement. It will come in to brighten my day, to promise of something better, and to focus me on the beauties of life and all it has to offer. It is why we stare at the Mona Lisa, listen to Beethoven and Mozart, read Dickens and Shakespeare, and in the end, why we watch GWTW. For it gives us a sense of relief or purpose the likes of whcih nothing else does. For that, for last night, I am grateful for that story."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Layers of institutions are referenced and simultaneously demolished.<br/><br/>The film is ostensibly about the South: its empty untenable institutions collapsing, but then reinventing themselves into a new prosperity. This is a pessimistic world where damaged goods never go away, they just keep coming back in new forms. Easy to see in the arrogant South (where everyone is portrayed as a nitwit to boot). Easy to see in Scarlet herself.<br/><br/>Only a little harder to see in the other target of the book: Catholicism. Melanie as Madonna. The Klan was anti Jew and Black, but moreso anti Catholic. And especially Irish Catholic as a remnant of English bigotry. That's glossed over more here than in the book but the institution of the Church is metaphorically overlain on that of the South: A huge, arrogant institution, highly socialized, economically strong, conservative, arrogant, subjects millions and so on. Such institutions always collapse locally but have the remarkable ability to reinvent themselves.<br/><br/>So we have Scarlet, the South, the Church and an addition, unintentional layer: Hollywood. This film redefined Hollywood by borrowing the same qualities noted in the film: if you reach critical mass, you can invent your own reality -- if you get that reality wrong (a certainty) then you'll have the collaborative mechanisms required to make it right. In other words, if you have a good hook, and grand enough scope, you will succeed in creating a world. The South, The Church, Hollywood.<br/><br/>And one can see this here. This project is not good, and by no stretch can it be judged -- on its merits -- the most successful movie of all time in terms of both dollars and viewings. Selznick was a genius: he realized that if you make a big enough fuss and made no huge errors, a film becomes an event. That event redefines film. So, for example people will flock to see `Spiderman' because several hundred million dollars was spent on promotion. They will `use' this film and reinvent their memory to recall it as `good.' Same as the Church.<br/><br/>And the same, incidentally, as Microsoft. Their products follow the same world-creation event model. Take no changes with the product, just avoid known errors. Tout it loudly enough (Microsoft's promotion to development ratio is precisely that of Hollywood's and uses the same firms), and people will adjust their reality to one you create. Or recreate because you got it wrong the first time.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is actually not about going, but sticking around. Which brings us to the second interesting element: Leigh. She's a sleight actress here -- projects like this don't work if the actor is truly gifted. But then she went on to be in the landmark `Streetcar.' These two projects are essentially the whole of her life. But by Streetcar, she had taken the jumble of damaged components that compose her and learned to wear them outside, so we can see. It is a remarkable transformation that Brando exploits. It makes her life worth living (pain and all) and Hollywood worth tolerating (event films and all)."

","I've never been that interested in seeing this movie, but I finally decided to watch it, to see what the deal was. In the opening scroll, as it described the glories of the Old South, it spoke of 'Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave...' My mouth hung open. I couldn't believe it was so overt about slavery. I expected it to circumvent the issue, much like The Patriot and Cold Mountain today. Instead Gone with the Wind glorified slavery, right in the opening act a character decries the North for telling them they can't have slaves.<br/><br/>We see Black children fanning napping White women, an abhorrent image. Blacks working in the cotton fields seem to be having the time of their lives. In the post-Civil War years, the character of Ashley talks of how well-treated he treated slaves, never mind that they were human beings treated as property. Ashley saying he would have freed them is a nice way to evade what he was.<br/><br/>As days went by and I couldn't get Scarlett always saying 'fiddle-dee-dee' out of my head, I realized I also hated this movie as a movie. As so many old movies, it was completely overacted. The colors were too good for their own good, bright to the point of being fake. The more realistic colors of today are a vast improvement over the gaudy colors of old.<br/><br/>I will admit Scarlett's escape with woman and child as Atlanta burns was well done. There is room for moral complexity in this movie. People fighting on the wrong side still have romantic entanglements, and still are devastated by the effects of war. Rhett and Scarlett could be seen as flawed characters not just because of personality but because of racism. But there is not much room for moral complexity in Gone with the Wind, it takes a clear stand.<br/><br/>Unlike DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind does not have the KKK riding in as heroes in the last act, instead its last act was tedious and overly weepy. However its portrayal of Reconstruction South was not much different than Birth of a Nation, with Blacks as either newly wealthy bullies or animalistic rapists of White women.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind does have important technical and artistic innovations, but so did Birth of a Nation. The difference is that with Birth of a Nation there is no separation. You cannot talk about Griffith's innovations without talking about his abhorrent politics. Gone with the Wind seems to get a free pass. The majority of IMDb reviews do not talk much about the racism. I found the usual digs at CGI in today's movies to carry an irony. The CGI alien character of Jar-Jar Binks is reviled as a racial stereotype, where as the flesh-and-blood racial stereotypes of Gone with the Wind are mostly ignored.<br/><br/>What is most shocking is that to this day liberal Hollywood, and liberal critics, celebrate Gone with the Wind as a masterpiece, while ignoring and apologizing for its overt racism, which went beyond the usual stereotypes of the time, but in fact idealized the slave-owning South. How can this be?"

","This is without doubt the greatest film of all time and is a testament to the golden age of cinema. There is a lot of Ibsen in Scarlett O'Hara,you start off hating her but by the end you admire her for her strength,determination and grit. Clark Gable-what can I say,he just IS Rhett Butler.I am a bit confused as to why the film is ""racist"",Mammy is excellent,she is one of the only people who can control Scarlett, the reason the blacks' all seem very happy is that if the film had gone in to what they were feeling the film would have been a good 3 hours longer,it isn't a story about them so they had to be one dimensional. In fact the most racist thing in it is that all Irish people are not drunks,[the book is a worse offender of this]and Gerald is a main part of the story.<br/><br/>My favourite bits are the tableaux of the red sky and THAT music, it makes the audience wish they were back in Tara and certainly aids the understanding is Scarlett's affinity with the land, I get goose pimples every time i see it.<br/><br/>This is a film with a strong female lead and helped push for more films with a female lead. I would just love to see the 6 hour long version as I feel many important points of the book were missed out and would help the audience to sympathies with scarlett more,e.g. Will,the yankies burning the cotton or the two extra children needed to be supported.<br/><br/>Overall excellent [even though I start crying 15minutes in and can't stop until 10 minutes after it has finished!]"

What is her turning to Rhett for money to restore her Tara but a kind of walking the panel? If that's a heroine what are the nation's morals? Unfortunately it is Vivien Leigh that saved the film. If it were not for her nobody would have noticed this run-of-the -mill production. It has no cultural or intellectual worth. At least it has no story to tell the world. I am sure that American history could have furnished a film crew with a better plot or a more breathtaking love story. Only incurable pragmatics can learn something from this film and this is how to kill a human being in oneself to earn money.

"ais_film_reviews","10","10","18","13 October 2006"," THE American Classic !
","Gone with the wind-the most magnificent movie ever!<br/><br/>As probably the greatest fan of this movie, and a Film Studies student with a clear conscious I can assert that Gone With the Wind is a cinematographic masterpiece. It is the legend amongst motion pictures based on Margaret Mitchell's novel produced from the impulsive outbreak of emotions. It's a romanticized depiction of the Civil War from the point of view of a southerner. It is a romance pictured on the war background. It is the story of a Southern belle who changes from a flirtatious, spoiled girl with not a care in the world less then what dress to wear to a hard-working and experienced widow determined to achieve everything she desires. The movie is diary of Scarlett O'Hara's troubles and skirmishes with her friends and lovers. Gone With the wind was Hollywood's most lavish and splendor movie in the 30s. With an excellent crew of stars, such as Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, it won Oscars and many hearts. If Gone With the Wind was shot in the 21st century it would be the type of movie starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Oscar for Best Actress proves that Vivian Leigh did a great job at playing the gorgeous and spectacular character of Scarlett, and while Clark Gable was not singled out with any awards he faithfully represented the rude and gallant Rhett Butler. The movie shocked with it's rich and showy cinematography, 19th century costumes and breath taking details ranging from Scarlett's hairbrushes, through Rhett's shoes covered with Georgia's red dirt to the architecture and design of the plantations. It is no doubt that 67 years a go Victor Fleming directed an American stunning success, which watched every time evokes different emotions and comes back to redeem the good name of melodrama. Therefore, if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?"

","The facts speak for themselves: a (to date) 62-year-old film; one of the all-time best box office grossers; enjoyed five major theatrical releases, including wide-screen versions; VHS, laser disc, and now DVD transfers--and three major restorations.  <br/><br/>Folks are still talking about it: debating its value-- agreeing, disagreeing, agreeing in part but taking exceptions... It's quite a work that David O. Selznick and his superb production company fashioned. <br/><br/>
On the purely technical achievement side, there's almost unanimous consent that the film is a historical milestone. After that, opinions are beginning to vary.<br/><br/>There's evidence that some folks today aren't quite as smitten by it as in the 40's through, say, the 60's.  They're beginning to take note of some of the sociological implications, as the narrative is told from the perspective of the land-owner/slave-owner/ruling/upper  class.  The narrative begs the audience to identify and empathize with this aristocratic echelon, and to see the beauty and grace of this society through the land owner's eyes.<br/><br/>Well, some folks aren't completely buying that perspective any more. They're starting to think about the sweat, tears, and broken lives upon which this aristocracy has built its so-called genteel world.  They're also beginning to embrace characters and situations untold here -- while applauding such efforts as Alice Randall's 2001 spinoff/parody (""The Wind Done Gone"") to at least help set records straight.  <br/><br/>Of course, there are many tales told from the perspective of the ruling class, whose power has come from the enslavement and domination of others. So it really depends upon how the viewer tends to see things.  One has a feeling, though, that GWTW will continue to be viewed with an increasingly suspicious eye, as years pass.  <br/><br/>There's also a feeling that it will remain a ""classic,"" being a genuine marking point in cinematic history as to how films were made.  It's technical influence is still felt today, and many audience members are still captivated by the total sweep and power of its superb production values.<br/><br/>So, the Wind's still heartily blowing, and there's every indication it will continue to do so for some time to come."

","It's rare for a movie to earn a 10 in these quarters, but the scope and breadth of Gone With the Wind earn it top marks in virtually every category.<br/><br/>Vivian Leigh shines as the selfish, spoiled Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable is her perfect foil as the suave and dangerous Rhett Butler. Our story begins in 1861 on the O'Hara farm, where Scarlett pines for Ashley, who is about to marry her cousin Melanie. She loves Ashley and is indifferent to her cousin. Wanting to be the centre of attention, Vivian heads to the Twelve Oaks barbecue where she throws men away as so many kerchiefs. She eventually confronts Ashley in the library and he rebuffs her, to her anger and to Rhett Butler's unending amusement. Rhett had been hiding behind a couch and starts his dance of seduction with Scarlett.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we see Georgia embroiled in the progressing Civil War. Atlanta burns (impressively!) and the homestead of Tara is razed and barely able to produce the food necessary for its subsistence. The carpetbaggers take over, Scarlett is forced to sell the mill and to seek Rhett for money to pay the usurious taxes. Meanwhile, Melanie has a child, Ashley dodges more advances from Scarlett and Scarlett's emotionless marriage to a suitor prior ends as he is killed in action. <br/><br/>It all leads to a climax where Scarlett and Rhett wed, their wills clash and he kidnaps their daughter, their poor daughter who dies riding a horse sidesaddle, and their next child is stillborn after Rhett and Scarlett argue on the stairs of Tara. Rhett's famous line: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!"" resonates his frustration and we see a broken but ultimately self-delusional and hopeful Scarlett looking forward to tomorrow.<br/><br/>All that said, the treatment of African American slaves is polished to a grotesque degree and at least merits some consideration. They are all shown as happy and servile and Ashley and others referencing them as ""Darkies"" does the movie a disservice, even if it may have been more accurate than the other portrayals.<br/><br/>All said though, this is an epic romance and one that stands the test of time."

One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky!

","Being an American who grew up in the south, I have a little extra knowledge of what the movie Gone With the Wind is about. When you talk to people in the southeastern states, sooner or later you're going to hear about the Civil War, because that subject is still under serious debate there, and there are a great number of people who are experts. Margaret Mitchell herself said that when she was a child she heard very many personal remembrances of that time, and in fact she was steeped in the living memory of the Civil War period.<br/><br/>The book that she wrote is a recreation of that period, and the movie is a sort of living portrait drawn from the book. Even though the very strong characters of the story occupy the center of the stage, still the background is just as important, being the result of Margaret Mitchell's need to give expression to all she knew about the agony of the Civil War, still living so vividly in the minds of so many people in America."
"patroklosmech","9","8","14","12 February 2017"," A well standing aged-ageless film!
","Having watched it multiple times, I have always admired its colorfulness and its technical excellence. <br/><br/>One of the first colored films and certainly in the top color films of the black and white era, that is until the early sixties,it exploits all means to convey the traits of characters most effectively through color. Eye colors, hair colors and clothes are used for that purpose.<br/><br/>Its extended use of matte paintings is effectively counterbalanced by their absorption and adjustment with live action footage. Certainly well deserving its Production Design and Cinematography Oscars.<br/><br/>An equally well distributed and chosen although not flawless cast choice adds to the result. Gable and Leigh are the only, literally speaking, actors of the era that could convincingly incarnate Scarlett and Rhet Butler, and near their top throne also rests Olivia De Havilland. The main cast suffers mostly from Leslie Howard as Ashley. Though he is convincing as for the mental and intellectual traits of the novel character he lacks physical resemblance and his under- toned and flat performance is somewhat distant from the presence of Ashley in the novel who has a few emotional outbursts. The rest of the cast is magnificently positioned, to mention a few: Thomas Mitchell as Gerald is very suited to the emotional spectrum of his character and I would have wanted him in more scenes which were present in the novel but edited out of the film unfortunately, including one that involves Gerald in Atlanta after the bazaar to reproach his daughter, Barbara O'Neill is physically perfect though limited in stage presence and of course Hattie McDaniel shines as Mammy with the strong character and the tough heart. She is something of an accomplice more to Scarlett than a servant or executor. Also, Laura Hope Crews is satisfactorily presented as Pittypat and not deprived of quantity and quality of scenes. Unfortunately, many other characters omitted, edited out or merged with others from the novel are just a little more than extras, including the terrific Jane Darwell and Leona Roberts whose characters are much more significant in the book.<br/><br/>Apart from any above mentioned flaws I credit the production with its departure from Mitchell's descriptions of mansions etc, like Tara or the Twelve Oaks, and the quite limited running time of the film. I think it should be presented as a two 5 hour movies sequence to adequately be faithful to the book. I know this is impossible to have happened back then as neither Cleopatra of 1963 managed to be something that innovative, but I lament because only this specific cast could master the whole novel to perfection with all its nuances, so today the latter is not possible anymore. Nowadays it is feasible to make a TV series of better technical standards but such actors are almost impossible to find today!!!!<br/><br/>I refrain from criticizing the racial and sociopolitical stance of the film's depiction of slaves, Reconstruction an such things as it was 1939 back then and the novel remained faithful to the depiction of the characters in the book. It is important to understand that the film wasn't supposed to depict 1861-1871 faithfully and objectively but to adapt for the screen a very specific piece of fiction."

","Gone With The Wind still remains one of the leading classics in American cinematography. The movie is a wonderful adaptation of a remarkable novel that revolves around Civil War era America. This makes for a unique development of characters in a time where the country was divided in biases. <br/><br/>The screen version fits the book nearly perfectly. The actors and actresses casted are great representations of Margaret Mitchell's famous southern character and the setting really feels like the old south. Even several decades after the movie's publication, it still stands as a great depiction of the events that may have taken place for a rich plantation owning family during the Civil War. <br/><br/>From the set to the costuming, the era is matched quite well. The movie makes it easy to imagine a period of time that took place well over a century ago. There are historical inaccuracies, of course, regarding the type of language used. Although the main focus of the movie is a romance budding between Scarlett and Rhett, I do feel as though some major issues of the time are still glossed over. Such as the inequality of races and social classes. It is briefly discussed, but there is not much to say about the mistreatment of slaves. <br/><br/>Overall, GWTW will always remain an amazing film that captures the spirit of the south during the Civil War. By showing a take on the casualties sustained after the Battle of Atlanta, it gave viewers a look into how the war was detrimental to both sides. Gone With The Wind has the just the tone it should, standing as an interesting way for people to look at this point in time through the eyes of fictional characters."

","This may just be one of the best movies ever put to film. An over four hour movie that actually kept my attention the entire time. I like that it makes it well known that neither Scarlett nor Rhett are great people. When they make mistakes, the movie never condones it or excuses it. That is why when Rhett forces himself on Scarlett, it never really bothered me like it did so many others. And as for the so-called racist undertones, I feel that the harsh criticisms are slightly unfair, because not only does the movie accurately represent the sentiments that whites had towards blacks during the Civil War era, but it also led to the first Oscar given to an African American (Hattie McDaniel) and shows how far we have come as a society. I also enjoy the war aspect of the film. The conflict sets the tone for the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett, which is just as turbulent as the one between the Union and the Confederates. And lastly, the cinematography is some of the most beautiful that I have ever seen. The scene where they are escaping from Atlanta has some of the brightest colors in any movie, They even managed to make a burning city hauntingly beautiful. That's really the best way to describe this movie: hauntingly beautiful. Well, except when Scarlett fell down the stairs. That was downright hilarious."

Gone with the Wind is based in the South. The movie is very persistent in allowing the viewer(s) to know that the Yankees in the war,are the bad people.

","Watching this movie in 2016, it's still easy to see how great of a film Gone with the Wind is. This film winning a total of eight Academy Awards and two honorable awards, is truly a classic. The use of Technicolor along with sound in this film is quite amazing. Being able to see the effect that the American Civil War had on not only living during that time but also the way the films were being done. This war had a huge effect on the film as you watch it you get to see the way that the war has changed the lives of these Southerners. The film shows how life was before during and after the war for them. This amazing adaptation of the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell tells the love story of Scarlett O'Hara. Living at her parents' plantation in Georgia, Scarlett learns about the engagement of Ashley and Melanie Hamilton. The next day at the Twelve Oaks party, despite warnings from her parents Scarlett reveals her feelings for Ashely, he refuses because of his love for his cousin Melanie Hamilton. Although she's not in love with him, Scarlett accepts the engagement from Charles, which is Melanie younger brother. They go on to marry, and Scarlett is left widowed when Charles suddenly passed away.<br/><br/>After the auction, Rhett buys Scarlett a green hat which she loves. Surprisingly, Scarlett still seems to be thinking about Ashley and wants to be with him. She says that she has never loved anyone besides him. The acting in this film is outstanding. The chemistry between Scarlett O' Hara played by Viven Leigh, Rhett Butler by Clark Gable is undeniably alluring. It's no wonder how both actors won Academy Awards for best actor and actress. War and poverty propels Scarlett into adulthood, giving her no time to mature. Even though she has matured throughout the film, she still has some characteristics of a spoiled young girl. Clark Gable's character is the supremely confident male, and he portrays that very well. These acting techniques definitely were different than the current techniques. It turned out to be a great thing because of the fact that this film has won plenty of awards for the acting, also that even all of these years later it is still looked at as one of the greatest films in cinema history. Viven Leigh (Scarlett) was an English actress and did an amazing job with the southern accent used in the film. Scarlett sees Ashley and gives him a scarf that she made for him. She says that there is nothing that she won't do for him. Ashley then breaks the news to her that he has to leave to fight in the war. He says his goodbyes and shortly after, the two share a passionate kiss and Scarlett reveals that she's never loved anyone but him. Something that's also noteworthy is the camera shots. In the scene when Scarlett leaves out of her house after delivering Melanie's baby, she walks past a bunch of wounded men from the war. This is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. She's walking and the camera zooms out to show the men on the ground and captures an amazing shot from the distance creating one of the most iconic crane shots. Contrast can be found between characters, lighting, and the way the color is presented providing a soft silky look. The brilliance of its camera-work extends from its beautiful moving shots to the effects of lighting and camera placement. This film could easily be looked at as an asset to the history of film. Watching this, you can see the change in films that enhanced the film industry. Things such as the Technicolor, films have progressed so much going from no sound and just black and white shots in the beginning of the film making. Technicolor expanded and was most frequently used in Hollywood from 1922 to 1952. This played a huge part in the growth of the film industry. At the time of this film, Technicolor wasn't widely used. This film was amazingly shot in 3-strip Technicolor. As Scarlett is working as a nurse for the wounded men that was fighting in the war, she decides to leave because she can't see deal with seeing people in pain that way. As she leaves out, she walks into Rhett where he tells her about Melanie Hamilton's pregnancy and that she is expected to have her baby in the next month. Once Scarlett returns home she tries to run away and is stopped because they needed her to help Melanie deliver her baby, as she went into labor. Melanie becomes ill after she delivers the baby and needs to be taken care of. The life after the war for these Southerners was much different from the life prior to war. When Scarlett returns home, she finds out that her mother has passed away. Through the roughest period of the Reconstruction, Scarlett struggles to maintain ownership of her estate while resisting and eventually succumbing to her most ardent suitor. Rhett and Scarlett later marry and have a baby named Bonnie Blue, Scarlett still being very much in love with Ashley. Gone with the Wind is truly a classic film. With its use of amazing Technicolor, you get to see how this film exemplifies the growth of the film industry. This classic lets you see the affect of the Civil War, and life before the war. This is one of the greatest films of all time."

","Gone With the Wind is a classic antebellum masterpiece, addressing the turmoil of the conflict of the Civil War through the eyes of a manipulative southern belle. Despite the destruction wrought by the Yankee invasion into Georgia, Scarlett O'Hara is resilient in her determination to restore the Tara plantation to its former glory. ""Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts."" Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara instills in her the southern ideal of property and station. Throughout the movie, Scarlett draws on Tara and ""home"" for strength. Despite some historical inaccuracies, the feel of the Old South is clearly present in this timeless classic of love and war."
"joshuadrake-91275","9","6","10","16 September 2015"," A classic!
","GONE WITH THE WIND is a classic film. The plot is set against the backdrop of white Southerners and against the 19th-century American South, it tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>Because the film is 4 hours and 18 minutes long, it is split into two parts. My mother has seen it and I have not seen this film at all, but this is the longest film ever made to win Best Picture, but was also the first movie in color.<br/><br/>This film was nominated for 13 Academy Award nominations including: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Editing and it won eight in the process. This film is just iconic and memorable.<br/><br/>Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and the rest of the cast in this film are incredible and their performances are good and the screenwriters stay true to the book, but a lot of people complained about the very long run time, but I don't have a problem with the film.<br/><br/>This film is remembered in today's popular culture and it's production has also been remembered today as well. It has been referenced, satirized, analyzed and dramatized and this film is just amazing and the poster of the film depicting Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's characters embracing in a scene from the film is one of the greatest movie posters I ever seen in my life and I like the poster.<br/><br/>Overall, GONE WITH THE WIND is simply a classic. There is no other way to describe this film and it is an absolute smash hit. 10/10."
"mark.waltz","10","6","10","13 May 2015"," Fact or fiction about a fictional family in the old south? You must research, then decide!
","Happy darkies singing in the fields, a black mammy whose white master's children are just like her own, a slave who lies about being experienced and birthin' babies (and getting violently slapped for lying), brutal Northern soldiers invading the dilapidated Southern plantation, and a spoiled heroine determined that she will make it through no matter if she has to lie, kill, cheat or steal make up the story for this all-time classic epic that nearly 40 years after its release still hadn't been on television, and when it did, it was an event to equal the legendary T.V. mini-series ""Roots"".<br/><br/>Much has been made about the casting for the film, from the smaller parts way up to the leads, and that itself has enough plot for a movie of its own. One part of the T.V. mini-series ""Moviola"" dealt with the search for Scarlet, and a sequel novel, ""Scarlet"", was a much awaited for mini-series. Even two musicals (which never hit Broadway) attempted to tell the long, drawn-out story. But it is the original film, following the best selling book by Margaret Mitchell, that remains the most famous of the variations of the story, often imitated but never surpassed.<br/><br/>No movie audience by 1939 had ever seen anything like this on screen, and even if there had been color movies, none were as exciting or detailed as this. The opening credits are fascinating, only mentioning the leading players, and it even appears that David O. Selznick's office building is indeed the model for Tara, the Southern plantation where the O'Hara family has built up its roots from Irish immigrants to powerful landowners with dozens of slaves. Spoiled Scarlet (Vivien Leigh) is being entranced by two beaus as the film opens, but it is next door neighbor Ashley (Leslie Howard) whom she really loves. He is flattered by her attentions (after all, she is gorgeous and charming in spite of her spoiled nature) but it is the noble and quiet Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) he really loves. This, however, is the eve of the beginning of the Civil War, and if the South is to survive, the men must go off to fight and the women must persevere mostly alone.<br/><br/>Scarlet's own nature keeps getting her into all sorts of trouble, even stealing the beaus away from her own sisters (Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes) in order to keep the attention on her. Father Thomas Mitchell and mother Barbara O'Neill must persevere on alone, and a twice-widowed Scarlet soon finds herself being squired around by the dashing rascal, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) whom she met on the eve of the beginning of the war (which threatened to ruin all the best parties Scarlet hoped to attend) and whom she dances with in widow's wear much to the shock of Atlanta society.<br/><br/>Then, there's the goings-on at the country plantation Tara where Scarlet is spoiled not only by her parents but by no-nonsense slave Hattie McDaniel who tries to bring Scarlet to some sort of reality but can't. Scarlet finds that she does have a best girlfriend in Melanie whom she must help out of a burning Atlanta while Melanie is in labor, and back at the now desolate Tara, she has to deal with so much more. Will Scarlet make it through the war with ruined crops, dead parents and lecherous Northerners? Most certainly, and when she sees a chance to get some financial help from Rhett, she's not even beyond wearing an old curtain (minus the rod), leading into the next stage of her life as she must now deal with what the new South calls the re-construction. If adding a third husband means security, she's willing to tie the knot with Rhett (for what he refers to as a marriage of fun), even if in one controversial scene, she is obviously forced into sexual relations with him, waking up the next morning as a new happy woman.<br/><br/>But can someone like Scarlet be truly happy? The writer shows her transformation from spoiled young lady to a more layered maturing woman, still willful yet not as selfish as before. More tragedies follow, and ultimately the story must, after more than 3 hours wrap up to show that Scarlet has changed and that she has learned that her life doesn't simply wrap around her always receiving male attention while the women around her are secondary. She begins to appreciate everybody, from the devoted Mamie to even Melanie, and isn't even judgmental anymore against the obvious madame Belle Watling (Ona Munson) who once obviously ""entertained"" husband Rhett.<br/><br/>Clark Gable's mere presence in this means that supporting character Rhett Butler becomes a leading one, even if he has much less footage than Leigh. She dominates the screen every time she is on, a soap opera heroine from long before soap operas even existed. McDaniel stands out as the wise Mamie who can bark at other slaves and her white owners, yet be flattered by Rhett's attentions to her and cry when tragedy strikes her beloved Scarlet. In different hands, Melanie Wilkes could have been a very bland character, but there's something in Olivia de Havilland's eyes that shows the soul and spirit, even if not outlandish like Scarlet's, she is still as long-suffering yet quietly strong.<br/><br/>Butterfly McQueen adds some humor and patheticness as kitchen slave Prissy, with Jane Darwell and Laura Hope Crews bringing wisdom and humor as members of Atlanta's society. The cast is huge, featuring some long-forgotten faces in smaller roles. The photography, art direction and musical score are all exceptional, and even if the depiction of slavery and the aftermath of slavery have been more realistically depicted, what is shown here can be made to seem believable, for as Mamie herself might have said, ""Where would we go?"". Not quite flawless, although considering the time and situation, it certainly could not have been made to be any better."
"MattBrady099","10","6","10","3 March 2015"," Frankly, I do give a damn
","Rhett Butler: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". I love that line.<br/><br/>The story is about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.<br/><br/>Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.<br/><br/>This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.<br/><br/>Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.<br/><br/>The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.<br/><br/>Now for problems: ................I don't have any.<br/><br/>Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic."

","Flicking through some old movies on IMDb I came across Gone with the Wind a couple of times but took no notice. I cannot believe I skipped such a beautiful movie and I can't believe I hadn't seen it sooner.<br/><br/>However, I was greatly disappointed by the ending at first. It annoyed me, but now I see that it's not about the tragedy of losing her love. It's about having hope, dreams and ambitions. This is one of those very rare movies that I can watch over and over again without feeling tired of it.<br/><br/>It's a very long movie, 3+ hours but it's so worth watching you wouldn't notice."
"secondtake","10","6","10","27 January 2013"," Amazing in nearly every way--with an insidiously racist undertone...
","Gone with the Wind (1939)<br/><br/>What to say after thousands of other reviews?<br/><br/>First, see it. See it big. It has so many different kinds of scenes, such terrific color and photography, and is dripping with so much history come alive it is a thrill and a joy. It's just a really really well made movie.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. You might not think about this since it's such an ""old"" film and it might automatically be old-fashioned. But it is not, not with the two leads above all. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are justifiably revered for what they did here. Leigh in particular works her butt off making scene after scene come alive, with horror and frivolousness and charm and passion. <br/><br/>The story is great by itself (based on the book which was the best selling novel two years in a row). It's not about the Civil War and its aftermath, even though that's prominent (and vividly, memorably). It's about a woman who is so self-absorbed in her infatuation for another man she misses out on true love. <br/><br/>Some of the side characters are amazing.<br/><br/>So yes, a great movie--but one that bothered me all the way through for its handling of African Americans. I may have noticed this years ago but I don't remember being so disturbed by the constant stereotyping. The slaves are naturally uneducated, so I try to overlook that as simple truth. And the black actors who play the three or four main parts are astonishing, all of them. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress.<br/><br/>The problem comes more from what all the white people say, or don't say, and what they don't do, over and over. There is no sense of shame, or apology, or perspective on their position as land owners and slave owners. Not before and not after the war. All of them, except Gable most of the time (he's a worldly and modern Southerner), mourn the loss of a great civilization, one built on slavery. They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.<br/><br/>The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, ""un-civilized"" sorts.)<br/><br/>I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.<br/><br/>I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed. Taken in perspective it's still a fabulous fabulous film."

","Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die. This Civil War epic romance/drama centers around a rather spoiled and selfish young Southern belle named Scarlett. The story follows her through the blissful paradises of plantation dances and pretty dresses to the bitter, cold realities of war and scraping up the pieces afterward. During these trials and tribulations, many very complex relationships and people are examined, all the while using Scarlett as the catalyst. Victor Fleming's visual interpretation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel is nearly flawless and represents, in my opinion, exactly how a story like this should be told. The lavish sets and costumes burst from the screen in an explosion of color. The cinematography and visual effects evoke a certain dream-like fantasy at certain times and offer stunning realism at others. It's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago and it's easy to see why this movie was considered so far ahead of its time upon its release. However, as great as these elements are, the aspect that makes Gone With The Wind a timeless classic is the great performance by the cast. Most have heard of Vivien Leigh's career-defining performance as Scarlett and the way she makes the viewer both love her and hate her with equally burning passions, or of Clark Gable's equally good role as Rhett Bulter, the self-reliant, and some might say, self-centered man who comes to understand the value of integrity and character. But sometimes these two giants overshadow very underrated performances by Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia de Havilland. Leslie Howard does a tremendous job of relating to the viewer the inner torment of love versus lust that his character deals with everyday. McDaniel offers a lovable toughness, wisdom, and discipline as the house servant. De Havilland's performance is the most pleasantly surprising, however. In every scene, her character emits purity and goodness in abundance. She truly demonstrates an unconditional love to all those around her despite the difficult circumstances she often finds herself in and is the perfect example of the model that other humans should aspire to become. Through and through, Gone With The Wind is a story that will probably never grow irrelevant, and this 4-hour movie is an astonishing masterpiece that is able to bring deep-buried emotions out of even the most hardened of hearts."
"KatieScarlettButler","10","6","10","10 March 2006"," Film Perfection
","Firstly, the most unbelievable thing about this film is that it was created 67 years ago, and since then, nothing (despite ""modern method acting"" - not entirely sure about that comment - and various technical effects available)has beaten it. Officially. It still constantly tops ""greatest film"" polls internationally, and it's easy to see why.<br/><br/>The performances in GWTW are stunning. This eternal success of this film basically rides on the acting, because the modern breathtaking stunts and special effects were impossible at the time - the most visually impressive scene is the burning of Atlanta, which is very basic by today's standards. Vivien Leigh is perfect as Scarlett, capturing every emotion and personality aspect of her character (by the way, it's fantastic to see a strong heroine who has obvious personality flaws and only uses a gun once!!!), and the way she develops the character of Scarlett is a strong sign of a truly magnificent actress.<br/><br/>Clark Gable's supporting role as Rhett is again mesmerising, and I could only envy Scarlett as he carried her up the stairs and jealously imagine what had made her so happy the next morning!!! Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was flawless, and her best supporting actress Oscar was thoroughly deserved. She's the only character in the film to make me laugh and cry at the same time and is wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>The other actors supported brilliantly, and although I understand there were many grumbles about parts (even from Clark Gable), the tiniest characters were played to precision, a sign, in my opinion, of the tragedy that modern cinema focuses on who can do the cleverest tricks, and the characters are now forgotten.<br/><br/>There is very little else I can think of to say about GWTW. The reasons for it's commercial and critical success are it's writing, directing, and acting, all of which come across perfectly. That's probably why it's the greatest film in history."
"rlmyers","Null","6","10","18 February 2006"," Scarlett's Character Overview
","First off, I'm 28 years old and have never seen this movie before. Growing up, you cant help but to know the impact this movie has on Hollywood and the rest of the world. Only after seeing this movie have I realized how timeless it is. Even after more than 65 years from its original release, people from all walks of life can still in someway relate to this movie.<br/><br/>Here are my views on Scarlett.<br/><br/>The thing that impresses me most about this movie is Scarlett's (Vivien Leigh)character. Some say that she is spoiled and self centered. But I see her as a strong willed person whom true courages often emerge in time of desperation. She is anything but selfish. Throughout the movie her only concerns was of her family, Tara, Ashley and everything else. Her actions speaks for themselves.<br/><br/>A women who donated her time to nurse fallen soldiers, welcome a newborn into the world, risk her neck to keep her promise, pick cotton to feed numerous others, gave her Pa's watch away rather then to sell it, sacrafices herself in order to pay taxes for Tara and numerous other contributions.<br/><br/>I can understand how some people are quick to judge her character. A strong willed person who is determined and ambitious can often intimidate others. When you endured the hardship of war and famine and refuse to be a statistic, you should be respected. You can be certain that many lives would of been lost during the war if it wasn't for Scarlett.<br/><br/>Her only flaws are that she is outspoken and have a weak heart when it involves romance. A women driven by love, a love that is unreachable or forbidden. Only in the end does she realized that what she is seeking has been in front of her all along. And yes, tomorrow will be another day."
"Incalculacable","9","6","10","11 February 2006"," The mother of all movies!
","You can easily Gone with the Wind is the Mother of all movies. Glorious Technicolor, magnificent cast who make their characters their own, wonderful landscapes, excellent, beautiful costumes, rich and warm music, true and believable acting. And the beauty of this movie that it could have been made yesterday - it truly looks like it. Sometimes I just watch it and not pay attention to the characters, just look at the landscapes, decor and dresses, however that is hard to do because the characters are so darn interesting. I find Rhett and Scarlett hard to hate. Rhett because obviously he is very attractive and kind, despite going to prostitutes. Scarlett has been through so much and can be very kind sometimes, but on the other hand she is a manipulative, difficult so-and-so. After you see this movie, you cannot imagine anyone else in these roles. Thanks to the Four Disk Special Edition, you can see who came very close to claiming the roles (the special edition DVD is a must for any devoted Gone With The Wind fan - the special features are wonderful!! The only thing that I was disappointed with is that there are no outtakes! Outtakes are the best! But it is a very valuable, informative DVD.) I love Gone With The Wind. It is one of the most memorable, tragic, hopeful, glorious, extravagant, wonderful, explosive, sultry, sad, bittersweet movies I have ever seen, and I shall carry the experience along with me for the rest of my life."
"schumybv","10","6","10","16 May 2005"," With no doubt the best movie ever made.
","It is extremely hard to make a movie after a book that will be as good as the book. I can think of many cases where this was the case. But with ""Gone with the wind"", they did it. I first read the book and then watched the movie and I was stunned. Everything in the movie, from the settings to the characters was exactly how I pictured it. This was truly a perfect movie.<br/><br/>I cannot think of one thing about the movie that I didn't like, not one. It's hard to believe that a movie made over 60 years ago, is the best movie ever made especially with all the technology we have today. But this is to prove that a good movie is not about special effects and computer animated beings, it's about a wonderful story and great characters. This movie proves that film is truly an art and it's a shame that not many movies nowadays show that.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the characters for a bit. They are all unique in their own way and you gotta love them all. Scarlett is just gorgeous. You hate her and you love her. She is mean and nice. She is a very complex character and the movie sure shows that. Rhett Buttler is the handsome man who is never afraid to speak his mind even at the cost of his reputation and he is the perfect match for Scarlett. I could go on about all the characters and how well they are portrayed. But the bottom line is everything in this movie just fits perfectly. <br/><br/>This movie is very long, but you can hardly notice it because there is so much going on and you always wanna see what's gonna happen next. The ending is just great because the viewer probably thought that in the end Scarlett will end up with Rhett, but there's some room for imagination since the movie ends with the famous line: ""Tomorrow is another day."" I don't think there are many people who didn't see this movie, but if you haven't you definitely have to."

Feeling of that era

"gab-14712","10","5","8","22 May 2018"," The Best Film of All Time?
","Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939, it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado, lets delve right into this masterpiece!
This movie is broken into two sections; pre-Civil War and post-Civil War. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a strong-willed woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing, she is put through a lot. However, she has feelings for Ashley (Leslie Howard). But Ashley is set to marry her cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new, mysterious man at the party, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. 
The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny; both economically (planting cotton and owning a lumber business) and sexually (going after the men she chooses). Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters, but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" comes from. 
 Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism, but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time, at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines, and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award. 
 It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately, both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the sky-high expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his party-boy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh, the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable, mesmerizing Scarlett. 
 One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them, but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also, the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner, we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores. 
 Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind is a majestic, sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face, will make you laugh, will make you shudder up with tension, and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long, this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story, and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz, 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"elizabetbowencc","9","5","8","2 January 2018"," I didn't like it at first, but then it grew on me, and now I love it!
","I'm going to be completely honest, I really hated the movie at first. Scarlett Just seemed to whine so much and it drove me crazy. I've always grown up believing that you make the most of what you have, and she just wasn't fitting the bill of the perfect heroine. She just seemed to lack so much in her character, she had no depth. <br/><br/>Then the war started and things began to look more interesting... Until she went and married Charles all because she wanted to make Ashley jealous. When she did this, it felt like my distaste for her would never end. I would have never believed I would be loving her character by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>When her first husband died and she was forced to wear mourning clothes at the party, I couldn't help but be astonished at her behavior. Some poor man had just died, her husband no less. Even if she did not love him, she should have at least felt some remorse. Then Rhett Butler entered the ball. This was the turninig point for my view on the movie. I wasn't able to stop myself from thinking ""This is it, Scarlett. This is your chance for happiness."" And for a moment, when she went to dance with the man, I thought she had. But then she just ran right back to Ashley, even though the man was already married.<br/><br/>Jumping ahead to when she was a nurse in Atlanta, it is my belief that this is where her character development truly started to progress. I may sound like a total monster, but the scene when she is running through the streets surrounded by wounded and dying soldiers may very well be my favorite. She was driven to run through such a horrible scene to help Melanie, the wife of the man she loved, to get a doctor as the woman was about to give birth. Scarlett had a huge grudge against Melanie, but because of the promise she made to Ashley, she protected her to the best of her abilities.<br/><br/>Much later in the movie, after she had married Rhett Butler and after her daughter had died, the most inspiring moment of the movie came. The death of Melanie seemed to fuel the final change in Scarlett's character. Though it helped puth the final crack in Rhett and Scarlett's relationship as she hugged Ashley in front of her then husband for comfort, it led to many important revelations. First, that Ashley never really loved Scarlett. This in turn caused Scarlett to realise she was not upset by this, for she thought she loved him but she did not. In reality, she had loved Rhett for quite some time.<br/><br/>When Scarlett returns home and he leaves her, speaking the famous phrase ""frankly my dear, I don't give a damn,"" she is heartbroken. But she then remembers Tara, and swears that she will return to her home and find a way to get him back.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I must say that Scarlett really surprised me. She seemed so annoyingly shallow in the beginning, but as the story progressed and the plot got deeper, so did she. Her character development was truly remarkable. And without Vivien Leigh as the actress, this may not have been possible, her skill at being able to completely become another person is one of the key factors in this films success.<br/><br/>Of course who could forget the incredible casting, cinematography, and directing. For a movie from the 1930's, it seemed well ahead of its time. The fact that the movie is still so loved to this very day is proof of that."

","Georgia, early-1860s. Scarlett O'Hara's life is one of parties and romantic machinations. She lives on her family's plantation Tara and the love of her life, Ashley Wilkes, has just announced his engagement to Melanie Hamilton. However, she soon is married to Charles, Melanie's younger brother, though she doesn't love him. Then the Civil War intervenes, and once the South starts losing, survival becomes the priority. All this time, one man keeps popping back into Scarlett's life, the dashing Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>Every bit the classic and epic it is made out to be.

"singureanu_andrei","Null","5","8","4 November 2016"," ""A civilization gone with the wind...""
","In my opinion this is a movie that has them all, a movie that will remain without an equal, even if a lot of time passed since its release.<br/><br/>This happened because of the period when the movie was made and shown to the public, an era in which a conservative society was yet far from the atrocities of WW2 and all the new ideas that spread before its end.<br/><br/>Is a movie with great pictures, great images, color-full, pictorial while portraying an almost Utopia world, yet an idyllic one, where all the things were settled, time was passing by so slowly and so calm with all the people living and breathing their lives in a breeze of peace.<br/><br/>Is a story like no other about the Old South, a story about a certain vision about the world, a vision we may applaud or condemn but nevertheless we should see and understand and we must be glad that we can observe from a distance another vision about living, about society, about human relationships, about master, servants and what can become of them."
"lucilletomincc","9","5","8","19 December 2015"," Great movie!
","This movie showed the many hardships of the Civil War. For example how much people struggled, and not just the soldiers, but the women who either stayed at home taking care of others or who were working in hospitals at the battlefields. The war was overwhelming for everyone and not just physically but mentally as well. Even though it seemed for them like everything was falling apart, the characters in the movie still found a way to get hope, and manage themselves through these rough times. They show the perfect attitude for the hard and good periods of life. Everyone should take ideas of this great movie. I think this movie is the best classic American history movie ever."
"SnoopyStyle","10","5","8","27 November 2013"," Golden age of Hollywood (even with the whitewashing)
","I can't add much more to the reviews that handbooks on filmmaking haven't already. It epitomizes the golden age of Hollywood. It's grand. It's a technical marvel. It has the most iconic romance since Romeo and Juliet. Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh has more quotable lines than anybody else. Is there a better line than Rhett Butler's ""No, I don't think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.""? It is bigger than a simple movie.<br/><br/>However, the more modern critiques have centered on the treatment of the slavery issue, and the general whitewashing of that 'civilization'. It's a fair criticism, but it misses the times and the subject matter. The movie isn't about slavery. It's a fable of its times. I won't be subtracting any points. I don't want to add retroactive morality to my review.<br/><br/>Most of the black characters are noble subservients in the movie. It's understandable to object to the portrayal. However, Sam is one of the more heroic persona. Other than Priss and the carpetbagger, they weren't stupid or mean spirited. I think the best description is whitewashing. They covered up the brutality, and gave it a nice gleaming coat. For its times, I don't think we can expect more. Slavery in The Patriot (2000) was marginally more realistic than this. To me, that seems much more egregious."
"mjneu59","10","5","8","23 November 2010"," Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith
","What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame."
"seandoylemu","10","5","8","16 January 2007"," A Masterpiece
","Having just viewed the 4 Disc set DVD release, I have to say it is without the best restoration of a movie I have ever seen. As time passes by, I cannot see any movie equaling its beauty and charm. Again one must consider cinema was still in its infancy in 1939. I remember the 50th anniversary release in 1989 having to queue for over 3 hours to see it. Was it worth it ? You bet it was. There has been too much negative reviews over the years regarding the wooden acting, soppy story line, but does ""Titanic"" fare any better ?. Would Di Caprio and Winslett have made a better Rhett and Scarlett ?. Hardly bares thinking of. Best movie ever? Yep!"
"Chaves7777","10","5","8","16 December 2006"," Scarlett. The spoiled girl of the movies.
","For me to see ""Gone with the wind"" was very difficult. Because, years later, i pass TV channels and suddenly, i see the end. I say, ""well, i mean... maybe, the movie was not so good as they say""... Wrong!!! ""Gone with the wind"" is maybe, the best movie about a civil war. The cast is great. Clark Gable is the arrogant Rhett and Vivien Leigh as the famous Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled girl of the movies. With the charming Olivia De Havilland, ""Gone with the wind"" is a good tale of war, love and tears. <br/><br/>This classic film was maybe one of the most difficult projects to carry out. David O'Selznick, the produce of this masterpiece, thought that the Margaret Mithcell's book it could not be. With insistence David O'Selznick decides to accept. For the cast, was put Gable in the act. But, Scarlett!!!. A quantity of actresses go for the character. For example, Diana Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball and Loretta Young. At the end, was Vivien, who was presented to Selznick by his brother, Myron Selznick. Vivien was daughter of a french man and a Irish woman as Scarlett, her character, was daughter of an Irish man and a french woman. Selznick with Gable, Leigh, a wonderful cast like Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hatie Mc Daniel, Thomas Mitchell and various directors as Victor Fleming , George Cukor, Sam Wood, William Cameron Menzies and Sidney Franklin made one of the best historical films of all history of cinema. A true masterpiece.<br/><br/>And now i think that ""Gone with the wind"" and her little character is inspiring. A life of battle, a life of war, a life of love. ""Gone with the wind"" is one of those masterpieces that are unforgettable.<br/><br/>* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any"

"wiggle999","10","5","8","8 February 2006"," The most beautiful love-story ever written
","Gone With the Wind is by far the best all-round movie ever made (and especially of its time). The cast is fantastic, with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable portraying one of the most passionate and complex love story of all time. Head-strong, spoilt, beautiful Scarlett O'Hara is the belle of the county. With more beaux than anyone she is envied by all girls, admired by all men. But the only young man of her friends who is not her beau is the one she wants. Ashley Wilkes is to marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and Scarlett is determined that this should not occur. Meanwhile, Rhett Butler, the rich, debonair Scallawag, is determined to have Scarlett, by any means possible. His suave mockery at firsts irritates Scarlett, but his charm slowly wins her over. The American civil war throws Scarlett's world into disarray, dramatically changing her life, and everything she ever knew is now challenged. Gone With the Wind tells Scarlett's story, of her three marriages, her struggles for money, food and security, her love for Ashley and her dislike for his wife, the kind-hearted, gentle Melanie. But most of all it tells the story of Scarlett and Rhett, a story of friendship, mockery, pain, sorrow, happiness and, ultimately, of love."

","Everyone has, of course, heard of ""Gone With the Wind"". I had as well. I knew that it was a classic, not only the book, but the movie as well. So I expected a lot from the movie ""Gone With the Wind"".<br/><br/>I saw it for rent at a video store and I decided to rent it. My first thought was ""well this movie looks really long"". But I wasn't surprised because I had already seen the book, which was the size of a dictionary. But then I watched the movie. Not only was I impressed with the movie, but I fell in love with it. After I saw it, I read the book and am now reading the sequel, ""Scarlett"".<br/><br/>The plot is so very original, and I think that Margaret Mitchell is amazing to come up with this whole thing in her head.<br/><br/>But you don't really remember the plot after seeing the movie and reading the book. You remember the characters. The charming Rhett Butler, the selfish Scarlett O'Hara, the dreaming Ashley Wilkes, the sweet Melanie Wilkes.<br/><br/>I love this movie, it is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen."
"sohkb","10","5","8","24 March 2005"," A glorious cinematic achievement setting the standard for epic movie making
","I may be biased, as Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie ever!! I can't count how many times I have seen it, and I still cry every time. What originally touched me when I first saw the film was Scarlett's strength and fearlessness. Rarely has there been a heroine equal to Scarlett O'Hara, and certainly not prior to 1939. She is selfish, ruthless, determined, manipulative and vain, but also courageous, protective, naive, loyal and at times compassionate. Rhett Butler is also selfish, vain and determined, and yet sophisticated with a wit to match and a tongue like a whip, he is Scarlett's perfect verbal sparing partner. To watch their relationship evolve is what has made this film an enduring love story. <br/><br/>Gone With The Wind is an incredible achievement showing us a broad spectrum of human emotions. Confronting war and adjusting to peace, love and hatred, adultery and loyalty are all explored in this vivid masterpiece of Hollywood's golden age <br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, Vivian Leigh brought Scarlett to life just as Margaret Mitchell had written her. Vivian's amazing debut performance won her an Oscar. Not to mention that no one could have played a better Rhett Butler than Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel was captivating as Mammy, winning best supporting actress for her role (the first for an African American actress).<br/><br/>For those of you who watched the movie and fell in love with it as I did, I strongly encourage you to read the book. Although the film is relatively accurate to the novel, (if they had made the film true to the book, it would have been 8 hours long) the book is magnificent and a milestone in American literature. There are more fascinating characters to discover, great action and humor and a better insight into what's going on between Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. There is so much that happens in the novel that isn't even hinted at in the movie. For an example, in the novel Scarlett has 3 children.<br/><br/>The film is timeless; deserving of it's 10 Oscars, and its place in film history. Don't let the length of the movie or the size of the book turn you off, once you get into the story, you'll be hooked."
"simba-18","10","5","8","22 February 2005"," A Cinematic Feast
","Set in the Civil War ""Gone WIth The WInd"" tells the story of beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. She's manipulative but you feel sympathetic for her which speaks for Vivien Leigh's outstanding performance. Scarlett marries three times. One time for revenge to hurt her one true love, Ashley. Who never loves her, but kind of keeps her hanging, always talking to Scarlett about ""honor"" being the reason why he cannot give himself to her. So he was not totally innocent in the romantic debacle between the two.<br/><br/>Her second marriage is for money and convenience. Third time to Rhett Butler. Clark Gable is another one of Scarlett's ""victims"", the one man who truly loved Scarlett, but Scarletts scheming to win Ashley finally kills the love he had for Scarlett.<br/><br/>The final quarter of the movie is one awful tragedy after another for Scarlett.<br/><br/>With each viewing, I grow to love this movie more. The most unforgettable scene is where Scarlett is walking through town where the wounded/dead soldiers are laying and the camera pans out further and further until you see the rebel flag waving and to me it is the defining scene of this film. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects can rival the effects we have today. A cinematic feast. Do not miss this."
"kystilla","10","5","8","3 January 2005"," A classic story of love
","Gone With the Wind is a story of a love triangle, or more likely a quadrilateral. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a young woman who is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). The only problem is, that Ashley marries another woman, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Then there is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is in love with Scarlett and eventually marries her, becoming her third husband. A love quadrilateral begins to develop throughout years.<br/><br/>The story itself seems pretty easy and without good actors it would be a lame story. But it sure ain't. Clark Gable is a true 'mysterious man', sort of a macho who is always there when you need him and even if you don't. Vivien Leigh plays very well the development from nice and sweet Scarlett O'Hara to harsh and cold-hearted Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler. Olivia de Havilland is then again the soft and loving Melanie who cares for Scarlett and doesn't abandon her. Leslie Howard is a man struggling between Melanie, whom he loves and Scarlett, whom he (probably) desires.<br/><br/>The story was simple but played brilliantly. I think that it deserves to be called the top of film history and even the best movie of all times. When watching it you get emotional and want to feel sorry for Scarlett, who is really nothing to be sorry of. I could recommend it for everyone to watch, especially film directors and producers of today. Maybe then we'll have something like it but it is sure that no one will ever make another ""Gone With the Wind""."
"slayerbecca","10","5","8","8 November 2004"," Timeless
","Gone With The Wind is and probably always will be my favorite movie. And of course it's not hard to see why.<br/><br/>For any romantic, the story is a true testimony to love. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best characters in modern literature. She portrays the desires we all have, and her ruthless behavior shows how far she will go to get what she wants. From loveless marriage to loveless marriage, poverty, hunger, and jealousy, Scarlett struggles with the effects the Civil War has on her life. <br/><br/>This is one of the first films done in color and for the time, some of the scenes are absolutely breath taking. One can make note of the scene where Scarlett is in Atlanta and stretched out as far as the eye can see are hundreds of wounded men. <br/><br/>I really recommend this movie. It's a classic, it's romantic, it's heart breaking, and it's truthful. Gone With The Wind is a story that can speak to us on every single emotional level. The movie shows you a world where nothing is one sided, and what we have mistaken for truth may not be true at all."

","This movie is an epic romance set against the colourful backdrop of the Civil War. However, I do feel that in order to get a full idea of the story you must read the book (composed by Margaret Mitchell).<br/><br/>The movie, for me personally, served as a companion for the book. I saw the movie a year ago and thought 'this is just long and boring'. However now that I've read 'Gone With The Wind', I love the movie and have seen it six times, which may not sound like much but considering it runs for 3h40 is quote impressive. <br/><br/>Even if you haven't read it, 'Gone With The Wind' is worth a look, at least then you'll be able to form your own opinion of it instead of reading mine ;)"

","This, by far, is the one of the best movies ever made. I love it. However, the book is even better. I love the story of Rhett and Scarlett. It is so interesting. Scarlett is one of those characters most people love to hate. She never realized how great things were until she lost them. Melanie Wilkes is a perfect example. Rhett is another example. Boy, she did that man wrong at times. I don't even understand how a man could love a woman with her antics and motives. She was un-conventional, snotty, and cold-hearted. In a way, I think that is what attracted Rhett to her. Rhett was the type that was a rebel. He did not follow the rules of society. He went his way, as did Scarlett. That is probably the key thing they had in common. Scarlett was quite stupid at times. What was so great about Ashley Wilkes?! He was such a wimp. Rhett was a catch! One might think that Scarlett would move on after he married Melanie and take a hint that he was unavailable. Oh well. I guess these things kept the movie interesting. Scarlett did have some good things about her. It just blew me away how stupid and hard headed she was. She was strong and went after what she wanted. She helped keep things together during a time of crisis. Many, from what I noticed, did not have her strength. They followed the crowd and were so afraid of what people would think or say, it was awful. But then again, people were and still are very judging. Scarlett did what she had to do. She had a lot of courage. I admired her for that. Oh yeah, Mammy was another character I liked a lot. She was pretty funny at times. Too bad Scarlett never listened to Mammy's advice. She was a very wise woman. Like I said, this is one of the best movies ever made. I enjoyed it a lot. 10 stars out of 10."

","I know ""Gone with the Wind"" has been teased to death, and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama. But the thing that impresses me about ""Gone with the Wind"" after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie. The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match. Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.<br/><br/>The success of any adaptation of ""Wind"" is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett, and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance. I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role, so perfectly does Ms. Leigh embody it. She's in virtually every scene, but even after four hours of her, I'm not tired of her, and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is Clark Gable, perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh, but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work.<br/><br/>I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland. In her own way, she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's. Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh. But she holds her own nonetheless. And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together. The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red, braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence, and Melanie walks slowly forward, determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally, is a tour de force for both actresses.<br/><br/>I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt, but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Don't be fooled by the AFI ranking (#4 please ask everyone else this is #1) this is the best movie Hollywood has ever made period. Yes this is close to 4 hours long but't it is never boring!

In case you don't know the story that is even better! However I recommend this on a rainy afternoon when you can sit by the fireplace and enjoy! Once you see this movie you will want to run out and visit the south! Yes the movie has its critics but every movie does. In my opinion this movie is perfect. If I had one complaint about is that Clark Gable didn't win the Academy Award for this movie. However that year was 1939 and almost all movies that year that were released were way above average. If you enjoy movies about old Hollywood you should see ""The Making a Legend: The Making of Gone With The Wind""."

My new number 1 Greatest American Movie (followed by The Godfather, Ben-Hur , Casablanca, Taxi Driver, Star Wars , Citizen Kane , Rebecca).<br/><br/>""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy; as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. The tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 81th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara. In Gone with the Wind, She is always after something. She is fiery, stubborn, beautiful, and selfish, and won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal. When Scarlett O'Hara raises her fist to the sky and vows never to be hungry again, not only do we believe her, we understand her. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett , is one of greatest , most moving and varied , performance I've ever seen on the screen. A touchstone of great melodramatic acting. Rhett Butler is played by Clark Gable, a mustached, cocky, manly actor. Although Scarlett is the center of the film, Gable's intensity matches Leigh's. His ego seems to be competing with hers, physically wrestling hers on the screen. Their energy and passion rise up to meet the gigantic film. The supporting characters are lovely, too, especially Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's Mammy. She steals every scene she's in with her explosive line readings, and her compassion.
five-time Oscar nominee Olivia de Havilland's performance as the moral fiber of society, was absolutely compelling and as beautiful as see is.<br/><br/>Tremendously impressive cinematic experience. From the amazing performances to Fleming's incredible direction and awe-inspiring images and music. This is a film that deserves to be experienced. A time-tested favorite,""Gone With the Wind"" 10/10<br/><br/>Trivia about Gone With the Wind:<br/><br/>The four principal stars were billed in this order: Clark Gable, followed by Leslie Howard (as Scarlett's obsessive love, the glum Ashley Wilkes) and Olivia de Havilland (as sweet Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's cousin), and then Vivien Leigh last with ""...and presenting"" -- that is, until she won the Oscar and it was changed to ""starring.""<br/><br/>The film (originally rough-cut at 6 hours in length) was challenging in its making, due to its controversial subject matter (including rape, drunkenness, moral dissipation and adultery) and its epic qualities, with more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras.<br/><br/>Adjusted for inflation, no movie can match the $3.7 billion haul that Gone with the Wind's $390 million box-office receipts since its 1939 release would be worth in today's dollars. The film currently remains the box-office (Champ). Yes More Than #2. 1. Avengers: Endgame (2019). Box office: $2.796 billion.<br/><br/>A nationwide casting search for an actress to play the Southern belle Scarlett resulted in the hiring of young British actress Vivien Leigh, although over 30 other well-known actresses had been tested or considered including: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Lana Turner, Joan Bennett, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Jean Arthur, and Lucille Ball. In all, 1,400 actresses were interviewed for the part of Scarlett O'Hara, and 400 performed audition-readings. Although MGM star Clark Gable was expected to play the role of the dashing Charlestonian war profiteer Rhett Butler, Errol Flynn, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper were also considered for the part.<br/><br/>The landmark film received tremendous accolades, more than any previous films to date: thirteen nominations and eight (competitive) Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Victor Fleming - the only credited director), Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), a posthumous Best Screenplay (Sidney Howard, along with collaborative assistance from Edwin Justin Mayer, John Van Druten, Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jo Swerling) - the first post-humous winner of its kind, Best Color Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel - the first time an African-American had been nominated and honored) and two honorary plaques, one for production designer William Cameron Menzies for the ""use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood,"" and the other a technical production award for Don Musgrave for ""pioneering in the use of coordinated equipment.""<br/><br/>Many of the five nominations that lost were unexpected: Best Actor (Clark Gable who lost to Robert Donat for Goodbye, Mr. Chips), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia de Havilland who was competing against co-star Hattie McDaniel), Best Sound Recording, Best Original Score (Max Steiner), and Best Special Effects. Its record of a total of ten Academy Awards wins held firm until 1959, when Ben-Hur (1959) won eleven Oscars. It was phenomenal that Gone With the Wind did so well, given that 1939 boasted some of the greatest American films ever made, including Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and Stagecoach."

","Margaret (b.Atlanta) found a porcelain pin amongst the post-War rubble, cleaned it, set it on the mantel, began to dreaming, put it to words and called it Gone-With-The-Wind.<br/><br/>What do you write about a 4-hr epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable), charming characters (Melanie & Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.<br/><br/>If you are of the politically-correct persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the Classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you have a warm heart, like it tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and a movie, you'll find the time needed to drink-in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent.<br/><br/>It's clearly Scarlett's movie but it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d.43) had balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee: Learned men clinging to a corrupt code of honor who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) versus passion (Scarlett).<br/><br/>Those today with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that Producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming & Cukor, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which the pharmacology industry holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.<br/><br/>And if you've a boycott bee in your bonnet, consider, when Rhett and Mams mix n' mingle over bourbons (2 hours in), the makers are firing one of the early shots for Civil-Rights. Does Gone-With-The-Wind romanticize events? Of course it does (""Cavaliers""), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4) (2.24.20)."

"Calysta","9","3","4","3 January 2000"," A Beautiful Epic
","Margaret Mitchell's civil war classic in the immortal film of 1939 has been for a long time now, a firm favourite of mine. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest adaptions from a novel. One of the greater strengths from the film was the overshadowing of the racist tone of the blacks in the book. Both film and book have painted what seems to be an apparent and truthful portrait of the emerging 1860s America.<br/><br/>Scarlett and Rhett are truly two of the best characters have created. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have forever left their mark on these literary legends. It would be hard to imagine anyone but these people in the roles. Despite the legendary Katharine Hepburn's similarity to Scarlett and Bette Davis' uncanny ability to play spoilt belles of a similar nature (""The Cabin in the Cotton"", ""Jezebel""), the heights of excellence, fierceness and determination reached by Leigh would not be able to be matched. The same could be said for either Errol Flynn or Laurence Olivier in the other role.<br/><br/>Although they almost don't need it, ""Gone With the Wind"" has one of the best supporting casts a movie will ever have. With Olivia de Havilland as Melanie, Leslie Howard as Ashley, Hattie McDaniel as Mammy and Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, they all contribute highly to making it a better story.<br/><br/>David O. Selznick was responsible for the massive undertaking, bringing life and realism with vivid and splendid technicolour. The restored version is truly a sensation to look at. On the grand scale it was produced, it is sort of difficult to see it barely equaled in his later films of the 40s.<br/><br/>George Cukor was to be the original director of the film, but was fired for supposedly devoting more time to Leigh and de Havilland. Despite my fondness for his works, Victor Fleming made this film eternally, and in its own day, stand out from the other period pieces and creating the unbroken legacy which has not died, unlike some of the other hits of the time.<br/><br/>
Max Steiner's score was haunting, which gave a real flavour to the movie. Who can forget the unforgettable last strains of ""Tara's Theme""?<br/><br/>Set decoration, costumes and the rest have an eye for detail. The beauty of it all, and its grandeur, is just stunning. <br/><br/>This movie, I found, has just one flaw. Epic length. But it wouldn't be right without it. And I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>Must see movie for everyone. I highly recommend it. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

I think the main four could not have been cast better and were probably giving their best performances (certainly it is on a par with Vivian Leigh's role in Streetcar and DeHavilland's role in Snake Pit).  Wonderful colour, music, atmosphere ... a four hour wallow I'd highly recommend!"

Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Hattie McDaniel and Olivia De Havilland are all perfectly cast and the supporting players shine also, especially Ona Munson, who played  Belle Watling, the hooker Rhett was friends with. I have to agree that Leslie Howard showed no charisma whatsoever  as Ashley Wilkes.

","I seen it once when I was much younger and did not understand it. Having seen it last year when I got the chance and again recently, all I can think is how superb this movie really is even today.
David O Selznick is definitely the Ridley Scott or James Cameron of his era! So detailed and so natural yet so delicate when it needs to be as if we are really there with the characters feeling the same. The story line adaption is truly superb as the cast members carefully chosen from thousands who auditioned.
Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were perfect in their roles as Olivia De Havilland as Melanie.

The powerful expression of visual language makes many of the slightly rough plots in the original work more convincing, so every time the story is about to become cliché, there will be an appropriate reversal.
Therefore, the cunning of being a craftsman and the sincerity of being a poet seem to have reached a near perfect resonance in this film."

"TheGoforth","8","4","6","27 January 2016"," The Epic and The Soap Opera...
","I have a theory that the whole American daytime soap aesthetic was inspired by the second half of Gone with the Wind, in terms of the staging, lighting and dialogue. It becomes a story about interpersonal relationships, whereas the first half of the movie relates to the characters more in the context of their time and history. For these reasons, I can see why the film has mass appeal, because it tells its story through two sensibilities. Had George Cukor remained as director, I am sure the whole film would have been more in line with the soap opera approach, but the Victor Fleming touch gave it the epic grandeur and vitality that makes the first half of the movie breathtaking. In my opinion, you have to really invest in the characters in order for the second half of the movie to keep you captivated. As far as GWTW is concerned, the only disadvantage of changing its approach is that by the end of the film, several events happen in such rapid succession of each other that something feels unnatural and forced. This is because the very power of the soap opera approach lies in its ability to draw narrative out in a way that is driven by character and not plot: slowly, meticulously and over a long period of time... and this is why film was never the soap opera's favoured medium, because most mainstream movies are contained narratives and need to be plot driven to meet their criteria. And that is the very reason why women tend to be secondary in modern Hollywood, because most men are traditionally yearning for action and adventure and women reflect on their feelings and motivations: you can make a box office hit that meets the former criteria quite easily, but the latter is something that is so incredibly complex, you had best turn to literature and television soap opera/serial drama for it to be fully realised. Gone with the Wind and Titanic managed to bring the epic and soap opera together, which is why they resonated profoundly with the culture. <br/><br/>When James Cameron cast the esteemed soap opera actor Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor in Titanic, he knew exactly what he was doing. Braeden has been compared to Clark Gable frequently, and like Gable, was referred to as the 'King' of his medium... watch any scene between Victor and Nikki sparring in their mansion in classic episodes of The Young and the Restless, and it will immediately recall Rhett and Scarlett in the second half of Gone with the Wind..."

","Some of the best moments in GWTW are small ones, some with no dialogue at all. I love the scene where Mammy is trying to get Scarlett to eat her breakfast before the barbecue, and gives her a dig about Ashley not proposing to her. The sideways look of death that Scarlett gives her, and her own smug expression when she knows she's won the exchange...brilliant. Also the scene at the barbecue just after she's overheard the other girls criticizing her, and she slowly climbs up the stairs, completely oblivious to everyone else running down the stairs around her whooping and hollering. And the scene at Aunt Pity's house on Christmas night where Scarlett stands alone at the bottom of the stairs watching Ashley take Melanie to bed was one of the few that made me feel sorry for her."
"mariacorderolovesu","10","4","6","3 January 2015"," Entertaining Movie.
","Gone With The Wind is truly a brilliant movie. It tells a wonderful story, and it does a great job on representing important aspects of the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War. Throughout the movie, it shows the emotions and struggles people in the South went through during and after the war. In addition, Vivien Leigh did an amazing job at playing the role of Scarlett, a girl who clearly enjoys being the one in control and would do anything to achieve what she wants. And although the kind of woman Scarlett represents is very similar to the flappers during the Depression, she plays an important role in the story and creates a feeling of suspense since the viewers never know what else is she going to come up with next. On the other side, Olivia De Havilland played the role of Melanie perfectly well. Scarlett and Melanie are complete opposites and it is so great seeing them both together; Scarlett being her typical self, while Melanie is always there to support her no matter how arrogant Scarlett can get. They create great balance when it comes to the characters in the movie. <br/><br/>To be honest, I am not the kind of person who enjoys dramatic movies, but this movie was so perfectly made that I didn't want to stop watching it. This is one of those movies that leaves us wanting more of it. I truly recommend this movie. I mean, who wouldn't want to be entertained while also learning some history? It has just the perfect amount of everything many people look for in a movie."
"gcappadona","9","4","6","16 November 2014"," Gone With the Wind Review
","Gone with the Wind is an amazzzzzzzzzzzzzzingly long yet a wonderful classic film! The cinematography by Ernest Haller is truly gorgeous and add beautifully to the story as a whole. The story duration of this film is spanned over many years which seemed to drag the plot on for quite some time, especially since the screen duration is 238 minutes. But, for the most part the plot moved relatively at a fast pace. The plot was very complex. It had many love affairs going on at one time (love triangles), had the men at war and the women at home, and the multiple deaths of loved ones. I personally think that Scarlett should have given up on Ashley for Rhett Butler wayyyy before she did. This would have made the story line way more interesting. I also wished that they showed a little bit more of the men actually fighting in the war to get a gist of what that would have been like. I loved the scene when all the hundreds of bodies of the men were laying out on the ground and here comes Scarlett with her pink dress on looking for the Doc to deliver Melanie's baby. That was also a great use of cinematography. The above camera angle was perfect for that scene. Overall, even though the film was ridiculously long I did happen to thoroughly enjoy it!"
"shadabpro","8","4","6","21 July 2014"," Frankly dear, I don't give a damn? No, actually we all do.
","""Do not squander time. This is the stuff life is made of."" This inscription is seen early on in the movie and Victor Fleming surely adheres to that. Though the four hour movie length would be a deterrent to some, the movie was almost perfectly paced (except maybe the last hour) with impeccable character development. This is what most modern Hollywood movies lack. The characters have no depth. By the end of the movie, whether you like the actions of the characters or not, you at least care for each one of them. Frankly dear, I don't give a damn? No, actually we all do.<br/><br/>The movie is an adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel of the same name who never told anyone about her book until she had completed it. is about the effect of civil war on south. Though it deals about the civil war, no real combat is seen. Rather the movie focuses on the life of the spoiled daughter of a Irish plantation owner, Scarlett, played by Vivian Leigh. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who marries his cousin Melaine. Melaine is the only ill sketched person in the movie who is unassuming on the intentions of Scarlett and so kind at times it borders on stupidity. As time passes by and the war rages on, Scarlett tries to make the best of the times, while courted by a playboy Rhett Butler (Clarke Gable). He finds her meanness, contempt for society and devil may care attitude very similar to his own. After the war, having previously married twice (once to make Ashley jealous and the next time for monetary reasons) and widowed both times, she marries Rhett Butler. Still she feels her heart still belongs to Ashley. The complex love story gets resolved in the last half an hour, which is to be seen for its impact.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is Vivian Leigh. She is fabulous as Scarlett, among the most well conceived characters ever made. She got the role from 1400 applicants and we can see why. She is the heart of the movie. While another movie would have kept upright characters like Ashley and Melaine as the protagonists, this movie instead chooses Scarlett and Rhett Butler. Scarlett is not a hero. Most of the times her actions are more akin to villains. As the movie progresses, she slowly transforms from a harmless spoiled girl to a calculated, greedy and vicious woman who only cares about herself and her father's land. The war turns her so cold that even though she still believes she loves Ashley, her words sound shallow. Her heart has stopped feeling love for someone for a long time. Even with her daughter, she seems distant. Would she be happy with Ashley? Probably not. If she even would have married him, he was way too common to make her happy forever. The only person she can be happy with is Rhett Butler. He understands her complexity and her desires. Just like her, he wants to live the life on his own terms. The only trouble is that the concept of ""love"" has gripped her so much that she does not realize it.<br/><br/>The direction of Victor Fleming is highly unconventional for its time. A lot of time has been given to character development which did not go down too well with the critics of its time, but watching it today the impact would not had been the same otherwise. The cinematography is so breathtaking at times, you cannot take your eyes off the screen. It gives the movie a place of mythical proportions. <br/><br/>On the more troubling issues, there is no doubt that the movie is overly generous to the cause of south. The Union (Yankee) army is shown as a bunch of rogues disturbing the peace of the land. The arrogance of confederate army makes them go to war with the better equipped union army. Eventually they get beaten and the old southern life has ended. The film glorifies slavery to a large extent. All the blacks are happy being slaves. All of them seem to be simpletons not ready for emancipation. A trouble scene takes place when Scarlett is walking with Mammy in town and she sees two African Americans walking in free man's clothes and she gives them a look of disgust as if it is something abnormal. Later on, in the same scene the free slaves are lured by politicians with monetary benefits. Apart from slavery, there is another troubling scene in the movie that could have been dealt with differently. After being drunk, Rhett forcefully takes Scarlett into her arm saying she belongs to him for the night. Such an instance of marital rape is a shame to be kept in a movie that is otherwise very feminist in nature.<br/><br/>Though this movie is not perfect, still in its imperfections, it remains a very remarkable movie to watch for any movie lover. There is hardly any moment of dullness even in its 4-hour length. It is more about the lives of people with faults in an imperfect and unjust world, trying to find any semblance of happiness. Seeing the desolation around them, it is heartening to see that they even try"

"Lynjamin04","9","4","6","17 November 2007"," Great Classic Movie
","I first want to begin by saying this was a fantastic movie that everyone should see. It is filled with such passion that everyone should experience. Classic movies are not usually good as this one, nor are they as long. Gone with the Wind is basically a four hour movie but it was well worth the sit to finally watch. <br/><br/>So I do not know what I enjoyed most about this movie. Was it the character Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, their relationship, or the way that this movie was filmed?? These people and things all as one make this move. Scarlett you could first picture her as a spoiled little rich brat. She always got her way and if you didn't like the way she was she could care less. Scarlett was comfortable with herself and when she made up her mind that was the end. She used what she had to get what she needed. Whether it was a good or bad thing, sometimes you would even go so far as to call her actions evil or hateful, she would do it and would not think twice. For example, in the movie she needed to pay the taxes on her family estate, Tara, and had no way to find the money. But while she was out on the prowl trying to find this money she ran into a man who was working to save money to marry her sister, and she intentionally broke his heart telling him that her sister moved on to be with another man because she was tired of waiting on him and then Scarlett married him herself. Her sister hated her for this but Scarlett didn't care, it was all for Tara. She was one tough gal. Scarlett never changed very much but she did change some and you could do nothing more than to love her. <br/><br/>Now we have Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a very handsome man who just like Scarlett knew what he wanted and did what he must to get it. Only in Rhett's case, he would for the most part use money. He was a very rich man and he knew money was a very powerful source. But Rhett Butler was also a smooth talker and he could convince you very easily. I could also tell, though it wasn't shown much in the movie that women swooned after this man. But Rhett only focused on the woman he loved. The woman he would do anything for. He would kill for this woman without even thinking twice but the downside is that she never showed her love for him. Scarlett could never give her heart to him because she thought she wanted someone else. Even after she married Rhett and had his child she still couldn't admit it to herself that she loved him. She married him for his money and at first Rhett was fine with that. He thought that eventually he could make her love him. But when she finally realized she loved him it was too late and Rhett decided to leave her. I loved their relationship so much and the way they acted towards one another. Calling each other names just how kids do when they like someone, teasing them as a way to show them attention. But Scarlett never could break her bratty side of always wanting and getting everything she thought should be hers so their relationship never grew. It could have been something very beautiful if it weren't for that part of her.<br/><br/>Lastly, this film is beautifully shot. The lighting is always perfect with what is going on in the movie. If it were a very happy day or well a very happy Scarlett, the light was very bright and she would glow and even the music was a bit snappier. And when there was a fight or just someone angry or something the lighting was a bit red. The connection of the color red with anger or hate was there very clearly and I like that the film was shot this way, using color to display feeling and emotions. The film also uses great camera movement and good angles. If it were a crazy time in the movie and a lot was going on, the camera was sure to be moving fast, jumping from here to there to display all the turmoil going on. There were also a lot of head shots that were used at good moments throughout the movie to show the characters reactions.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully made with a lot of abstract things you could notice if you really try to analyze it. I love it, I always enjoy watching it, and it always leaves me wishing it didn't go off when it ends."

","I was in middle school when I first saw this great movie. Our history teacher had us watch it for American History class. This movie has it all! From drama to romance to war to death, it's great! I think we all appreciated the movie at an early age because of how Scarlett was young and spoiled she had everything going for her and at a blink of an eye everything turned upside down. She had to go through her mother's death, to taking care of her sickly ""rival"" Mrs. Wilkes, to losing all material things. But despite of all her loss, she came back and no matter what she had to do to make it happen, she did.<br/><br/>I personally fell in love with the love story. Scarlett fell in love with Ashley Wilkes but he didn't want to be with her and Rhett Butler wanted her, but she didn't want him and when she finally realized he was the one, he was gone with the wind!! So if a history teacher ever reads this comment, you may consider showing this movie to your American History students."

","This movie is my absolutely favorite. It is the only film I have seen from the studio era that makes me forget it was filmed half a century ago. The acting is superb (although I hated Vivien Leigh's acting in the scene with Mammie while she is getting dressed for the TwelveOaks Ball) and the casting is perfect.<br/><br/>Every film goer should see this film not only because of its quality, but also because of its place in history. GWTW was filmed during Hitler's reign in Germany, and it is reported that after watching this film Hitler dramatically increased funding to the German studios (which were at the time the only studios able to compete with Hollywood).<br/><br/>If possible, try and find a copy of the new DVD version. It has a special ""Making Of"" segment that is absolutely fascinating."

An amazing creation I would say. I regret that I could have watched this movie around a year back (when I got taste in Hollywood movie) by renting it out, but I waited for library DVD. There is a dialog in this movie 'Don't squnder time, this is the stuff life is made of !!' I loved it. I would say don't squander time, watch this long saga about a girl how she survived the long period of troubles and lack of love in her life. Acting, dialog, script, music, screenplay, costume, choreography, story, scenic beauty in the background etc. everything is so marvlously chosen/created/directed and the whole movie turns out to be a master peace in the movie making history. It is impressive to see that back in 1939 people could make movie like this, when there were no computers/sophisticated cameras and technology. Real stuff. Watch it."

","So much has been written about this film, that was made so many years ago, and that in itself should show just how great it was. Brilliantly cast and photographed, it still stands very high among the best films ever made. Sure there was a huge amount of publicity for it when first released, but it was well merited. Just look at the cast - Vivien Leigh was the ideal choice and if you care to think about today's actresses, who could play the role better? Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high. The story was very well done, and the settings of the old South were brilliantly captured. See it for what it was, in its day, and glory in the result."

","I was watching ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" in the video lab at my school the other day, and ""Gone With the Wind"" was playing across from me, where a girl was listening on headphones. Even muted, and watching an already good movie, I ended up paying so much more attention to ""Gone With the Wind.""<br/><br/>The offensive politics, the pompousness, the bloated plot- none of it really detracts from the movie's undeniable power, which could rest (but doesn't) alone on the crisp, HUGE Technicolor vistas. Never have sunsets seemed so beautiful! If you can stay awake through one prolonged sitting, it is actually a very involving and emotionally tense experience.

This movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever and considering the year it was made, who can say to what extent this movie pulls you in the awesome story it unfolds. All the characters are so complexly created and so believably shaped. What this movie has is everything from brilliant actors and actresses, a magnificent original score, astounding cinematography, a deeply woven screenplay, vibrant costumes and sets and beautiful scenery combined with an amazing vision of the director.

"filipemanuelneto","10","7","13","25 June 2016"," Probably the best film ever
","This film is probably one of the most remarkable in the history of cinema. A film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. It won eight Oscars (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography Color, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Leading Actress, Best Supporting Actress - for the first time given to a black actress - and even two special statuettes for RD Musgrave and William Cameron Menzies, for technical achievements) and was nominated for five more. Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.<br/><br/>The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins ​​to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley. <br/><br/>Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever. For me, its also the best movie ever, despite the many other great films that followed, through the decades."
"carlianschwartz-03460","10","7","13","19 June 2016"," THE American Screen Masterpiece
","""Gone With the Wind"" is THE American screen masterpiece, even though nearly 77 years have elapsed since its premiere in December 1939. The script, casting, plot, and music are superb.<br/><br/>What stands out as something ahead of its time is that the moral center of the story is African- American--""Mammy"" played by Hattie McDaniel. From her initial admonishments to Miss Scarlett not to eat ""like a field hand"" and not to ""show her bosom"" before 5:00 p.m. and throughout the story, she is the voice of common sense and authority on what's ""fittin'"" for any and all occasions. It's little wonder she was the first African-American person to win Best Supporting Actress for this role, and her acceptance speech at the Awards ceremony on February 29, 1940, is a model of tearful modesty.<br/><br/>The film was exhaustively researched before production even started. After seeing the latest 2K digital restoration on TCM, I noted that the paisley cotton dress that Scarlett wore when she fled Atlanta with Melanie (Olivia de Havilland), her newborn, and Priss (Butterfly McQueen) was mauve rather than brown. I thought at first that it was an anachronism--mauve was the first totally synthetic dye. However, it was discovered in England in the 1850s and could very well have found itself on a bolt of British cloth that was marketed in the Old Confederacy."
"tieman64","Null","13","29","9 June 2013"," Much Ado About Nothing
","Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, ""Gone With The Wind"" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. ""As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!"" she proclaims. ""I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!"" <br/><br/>You go girl.<br/><br/>Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself ""gone with the wind"", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere ""political group"" in the film – is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film ""takes the wrong side"" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South – but that the film is just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Officially ""Gone With the Wind"" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto.<br/><br/>Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash ""Gone With the Wind"", stating that Selznick was a ""fool to mistake the picture for art"". Robert Altman would call the film ""total ****"". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like ""crying and crawling under a rug"". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was ""too classy"". But you know how communists are. They hate class.<br/><br/>Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing ""Wind's"" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to ""ensure that it's not racist"". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that ""the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture"" such that it is demonstrated ""that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause."" Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that ""we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry"", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself ""a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight"" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which ""undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks"".<br/><br/>Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, ""Birth of a Nation's"" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and ""Wind's"" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which ""Wind"" was briefly re-released in 2009; ""The Blind Side"" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, ""Wind's"" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, ""Wind"" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release (""The Color Purple"", ""Titanic"", ""Cold Mountain"", ""Australia"", ""Far Away"", ""Heaven and Earth"" etc) <br/><br/>3/10 – Worth one viewing"
"BusGrat","1","34","91","4 January 2008"," Gone with the Wind was a bad movie!
","Wow. This was a bad movie. I can't believe this is one of the ""best"" movies of all time. I always had my reservations about David O. Selznick and now that I have seen his epic ""masterpiece,"" I can see his fingerprints all over Rebecca. I am a huge fan of Hitchcock and always wondered how much he was overruled in the making of that film. I will wonder no more. I can't imagine why anyone would like this melodrama. I laughed more than I have at some comedies. I could not keep a straight face as the movie Scarlett argued with Mammy to make her green velvet dress. I was taken back to Carol Burnett's fantastic portrayal of Scarlett walking down the stairs with a curtain rod stuck in her dress. I can't say much for the acting, Leigh and Gable left much to be desired. Hattie McDaniel was great, besides the other African Americans that made up the cast, that was it. The only good thing about this movie was that it gave African Americans speaking parts and was one of the only post code films in the late 30's the 40's and much of the 50's that was shown in the South that gave African Americans speaking parts and showed them in the movie. Many films of this time did not. I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE!"

"starrynights-64117","8","6","11","2 January 2017"," Definitely deserves the title of a ""classic""
","After spending 4 hours watching ""Gone With The Wind"", I can see why it has been so critically acclaimed since its release in 1939. This motion picture combined many themes and ideas, and consisted of complex and dynamic characters who developed and grew as the story line played itself out. In particular, the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly feisty and passionate person who endures countless struggles in order to find happiness and stability once again after the Civil War demolishes her sense of reality. Even though she married 3 times and had more money than she knew what to do with, she always wanted more, more, more. When Rhett left her, the realization of her deep love for and the desire to return to her homeland, Tara, was an excellent way to wrap up the movie and bring the story full circle, as the story begins with dear Scarlett listening to her father tell her about the importance and continuity of land. However, the majority of the film was not as historically committed as it could have been. About halfway through, the focus shifts from the events of the Civil War, to the relationships between the characters. While this may not be a complaint for some viewers, others like myself hoped for a more focused and consistent view on the history of such an important time period throughout the movie. Also, the amount of racism was minimal, which is not true to the sentiments of the Deep South during this era. In summation, though there is some lack of historical accuracy, this film is definitely a must see, even 78 years later."

After I watched the movie, I read the book in sixth grade and that was really when Margaret Mitchell's work became even more beautiful than ever.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Scarlett O'Hara is a brat, plain and simple.

The events of the Civil War are all carried out and Scarlett is forced to help a pregnant Melanie from Atlanta as Sherman begins his march to the sea.

She cares nothing about the important things in life, and revolves entirely on her whimsical desires and crushes. A complete and utter flirt, Scarlett literally throws herself upon the man that she believes herself to be in love with - Ashley Wilkes. Ashley isn't man enough to tell her that he doesn't love her, and her wild passion for him carries on as the South plunges into war against the Yankees. To spite Ashley marrying Melanie Hamilton, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother who dies at war. Her next marriage is also unsuccessful, and finally she ends up with the lovable rogue that is Rhett Butler. But it is only at the end when Scarlett's lifelong nightmare of running through a dark mist becomes reality, that she realizes that Ashley does not love her, and that it doesn't matter to her that he doesn't. The realization that she does indeed love her husband, Rhett, comes too late, as he has come to the decision to leave her. She asks him what she will do without him, to which he famously replies: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" Eventually she realizes that until Rhett returns to her, the only thing she has left is her home - the plantation Tara. As she looks out over the land, she finds a reason to hope - passing that hope onto the viewers that Scarlett's life might finally have some real happiness in it. The hope is verbalized in her well known saying, ""Tomorrow is another day!"""

The characters in this film are unforgettable and very compelling.Though this movie may not be historical accurate (which I will be researching about) the plot is still very intriguing.

","Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel ¨Gone with the Wind¨, tells of the Southern view on Civil War from the life of southern belle Katie Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). The movie adaptation which stars Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, and Leslie Howard, follows Scarlett's hardships as she fights for love and life during the War and Reconstruction of the South. The 3h 58min film which follows Mitchell's novel almost exactly, is considered an American classic with its film quality, plot line, and historical take on one of the most significant events in American history.<br/><br/>However historical the film and book may be,¨Gone with the Wind¨ is intended to entertain more than to teach. With the love triangles and the strong female leads, the novel was clearly aimed to inspire young women during the Great Depression.But, there were some historical inaccuracies, such as the lack of racism and the unrealistic representation of slavery. <br/><br/>Overall, Mitchell's southern epic is an American classic which proved itself with eight of the 1940 Academy Awards.

"lasttimeisaw","8","5","9","8 June 2015"," GONE WITH THE WIND hasn't gone with time
","Some movies you always know you will watch and you must watch, simply because it is a must-see and GONE WITH THE WIND is definitely one of them, hailed as ""the greatest film of all time"", how can I hold it up until now? Personally I can never find a right time to watch it not just because of its nearly 4-hour running time, also subjectively I am not a fan of Clark Gable, as he perpetually reeks of bad breath (thanks to the IMDb trivia section to ruin his silver-screen charisma for me), and feel daunted by the melodramatic nature of its source novel from Margaret Mitchell, but the moment has finally arrived and I have watched it for the very first time, and it is as good as I could ever anticipated, although with an epithet like ""the greatest of all time"", how can any film hold out on that supreme crown unscathed? <br/><br/>The movie is an American civil war saga entirely enters on Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), a crafty Southern belle whose comfortable life has been ravaged by the war, oscillates between the man of her dream Ashley Wilkes (Howard), who marries Melanie (de Havilland), a girl with all the virtues of that bygone era, and her similar kind, the rich pursuer Rhett Butler (Gable), it takes her three marriages, two dead husbands, one miscarriage, a devastating loss of her young child to finally realise her deepest love for Rhett, only in the end, she is unable to mend her fence with the overdue repentance, she has been a fool to chase her ideal yet unrealistic passion for Ashley, which is merely an illusion for her to grasp in troubled times. So she is the only one to blame for all the misfortunes? Almost eighty years later, my take is that Ashley and Rhett are equally accountable for the love triangle tug-of-war, it is the battle of sexes, Ashley is too weak-minded to disclose the wrong facade of his true feelings towards Scarlett, or, even worse, he gloats in the admiration of a woman who adores him as the specimen of a perfect man, either ways, he cannot be exonerated for acquiescing Scarlett's unrequited ardour. As for Rhett, his frivolous manner firstly establishes a wrong impression that he is a philanderer, charming but never the marry kind, and when he realises his feelings for her, his devotion is markedly undermined by jealousy, which only pushes Scarlett farther away, so why on earth he can act as all the justice is on his side and desert her when she eventually wakes up from her protracted mirage? On the other hand, it is all their imperfections make them a perfect match for each other, for sure their life together will not be perfect, but they cannot stand one without each other, that's the essence of monogamy.<br/><br/>One sure thing is that the film's epic production scope and grandiose settings signal the hallmark of Hollywood's cutting-edge creativity and capability at then, its vividly expressive cinematography alone can captivate the utter veneration from even the fiercest dissenter. It is so incredible, how come Victor Fleming can master two cinematic juggernauts (this and THE WIZARD OF OZ, George Cukor is the poor guy uncredited with both pictures) in one calendar year, 1939 is really the high tide of the world cinema, symbols the celluloid industry enters its full-grown era. <br/><br/>An iconic performance from Vivien Leigh, her Scarlett is never a damsel-in-distress, she is a spoilt and wilful brat at first, life is too easy for her to get what she wants, but her iron- willed personality has been mould after the baptism of the civil war, nothing can pull her back into poverty, she has a cunning mind of manipulation, mostly towards men who are too upright to run away from her smug calculations, only Rhett is her match to fence back, but she saves her most precious and vulnerable part for Ashley, and involuntarily grows close with Melanie too. As a Briton, Ms. Leigh brilliantly nails the southern accent, wholeheartedly teases out Scarlett's rite-of-passage and culminates a timeless performance allows generations to idolise. The same cannot be said to Clark Garble and Leslie Howard, male characters are uniformly given less range to leave the same impression as Scarlett, or even Olivia de Havilland's Melanie, who undertakes the burden of being an immaculate saint, fully embodies all the good virtues of humanity, but must face the cruelty of destiny, it is a tremendous blessing Ms. de Havilland is still with us today, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish she will safely pass her centenary 1st July next year. <br/><br/>One cannot review this film without mentioning Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win as the faithful servant Mammy, in retrospect it is exactly what one would expect from under that social current, sans the horror one might trigger from 12 YEARS OF SLAVE (2013). Despite that her view towards the war has never been explored on the screen, anyhow it is a war under the name of abolishing slavery, yet she never leave O'Hara family even in the worst times, maybe her side of story can more accurately point out the sinister nitty-gritty of war, any kind of war, no matter under what name men are fighting their lives for, it is always a go-to manoeuvre to openly sacrifice innocent lives in exchange of benefits for the few ones, and it is a crime at any rate. <br/><br/>Sorry for the digression, all in all, the film is a worthy classic, a bit too mushy in its second half for my taste, but one cannot hold too much grudge against it for all the genius involved and the first-rate end-product it hatches, an 8 out of 10 is my verdict."

","This movie, in my opinion, is one of the all time classics, and quite rightly so. The characters are extremely engaging, obviously the storyline also. What I think makes the film even better is the fact that it was adapted from a classic novel, and I think that it does the novel justice. Perhaps even better?? Am sure that has been discussed before. <br/><br/>However, I know that nowadays there are many people who are not interested in the subject of the film, or just don't get it. I accept this. I really don't think it is anything to do with ""the wave of anti-patriotism"" across the US, as the above has stated.<br/><br/>Each to their own and no sweeping accusations."

","I have always appreciated Gone With The Wind, most well-known by its acronym, ""GWTW,"" (which ""the"" wasn't originally capitalized), for all of the background work that was completed to create a beautiful film. Not only was the cinematography wonderful (who will ever forget Scarlett walking through the railroad field among the wounded in her bright dress?), but the characters chosen were definitely accurate to play the roles. Take for example Clark Gable playing the rake Rhett Butler - who else could have fit that role? I will always love ""GWTW,"" and suggest all of those ""GWTW"" lovers to see it at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in the Summer when it is shown on the true big screen."
"Snow Leopard","Null","5","9","16 May 2002"," Top Quality Story-Telling Helps Make Up For Its Weaknesses
","Story-telling technique doesn't get much better than this, so it's no surprise that the movie is still so well-known despite its age and length. From the detailed, lavish settings to the carefully filmed action scenes to the well-timed, steady pace, many things are done masterfully.  These and other strengths make it an entertaining and sometimes exciting classic despite some weaknesses in its characters and its historical perspective.<br/><br/>In one sense, you have to wonder whether it would have been a better story if the main characters were more worth caring about.  Nothing against Gable or Leigh, who both give fine performances that bring out exactly what their characters are about, but despite Rhett's resourcefulness and Scarlett's strength, they really are not very admirable persons, and it's just hard to care very much whether they are happy or not.  It makes the whole movie rather less affecting; it's always interesting yet only occasionally is it really compelling.  Yet at the same time, the characters in themselves are convincing, and perhaps their less-than-admirable nature makes for a more believable balance to the historical backdrop, which is a highly idealized, not to say sanitized, portrait of the Old South.<br/><br/>All that aside, whether you like the characters and settings or not, it's filled with good examples of how to tell a story on film.  The escape from Atlanta sequence deserves its place as one of the finest set pieces in movie history, and although nothing in the rest of the film has the same intensity level, there are many other good scenes that make it a picture well worth watching."
"concorde008","2","17","44","27 February 2006"," generally hopeless
","Not sure where to start. To save my reputation, I have to say I read the book only because I was ill, and there was nothing else in the house I hadn't read. The lead character Scarlett is thoroughly offputting - bitchy spoiled, without real intelligence (beyond a good business sense, I suppose that's a nicer name for greed). Melanie is so very good you can't possibly believe or like her, most of the other characters not worth much attention either. The only half likable person was Rhett Butler; no, not for his masculinity (heroic males are bad enough, but needy useless females flocking around them are worse). No it's because he essentially respects nothing and doesn't take part in the pretentiousness of the time.<br/><br/>As for the film, the acting was on the whole so ludicrously poor that the participants of a school play would be hard put to be less convincing. Again Rhett Butler's character is the only one you can believe and enjoy watching (the scene where they have to leave Atlanta, and he turns up saying ""I hear you want to take a trip"" just ideally portrays his laid back coolness). Other than that characters from the book which help you understand the setting are missing. For example the gossipping spying busybodies in Atlanta. Not that that sort deserves any airtime, but those small-minded essentially unoccupied women just set the general tone and illustrate the mentality. On the other hand I'm tempted to speculate if the seeming falseness of the film actors is in fact a faithful portrayal of those times. Even in the book nobody is ever straight forward, so maybe the lack of believability in the film quite accurately represents the general hypocrisy of that society.<br/><br/>Either way, it is beyond me to understand why everyone is so moved by this story. Or are they? Or is it just generally accepted that this is ""a masterpiece"", and all follow this established truth like sheep? (Like religious doctrine really, yours not to question.) Anyway, sorry I simply can't oblige the public by agreeing."

","Addictive as well as engaging, this is the perfect soap opera: a romance film that is not only thoroughly entertaining but also enjoyably educational. The insight into Southern life is wonderful, and the film manages to capture excellently the experience of the Civil War and how it changed people. It is long, but as a result involving because the characters are constructed excellently and played by the cast dynamically. Olivia De Hallivand is especially good, and Vivien Leigh is the perfect lead. The Technicolor sets are delightful: an example of art direction with the focus truly on art. The film is so well done that even the special effects are remarkable for the time! This is one of the greatest epics ever produced, and an example (which has hardly ever been equaled) of how to make a flawless one."

","Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a ""model of feminism"". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of ""Southern Belle"" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who ""just want the best for the white folk."" Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful ""For tomorrow's a new day!"" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist."

Vivien Leigh is perfect to bring out the stubbornness, strong-will, shrewdness and, needless to mention, gorgeous beauty of Scarlett. Her performance really lights up the whole movie. It's not just about romance in danger, but it's more about facing up to realities, never looking back and doing whatever it takes to carry on, which is the spirit I admire most. <br/><br/>I am surprised to see Gone With The Wind with only a rating of 8.2 on IMDb.

She seeks marriage with Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, but he is announcing his engagement to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, played by Olivia de Havilland. O'Hara catches the eye of a sly playboy Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, whom she detests, but he aims to marry her. Director Victor Fleming was blessed this year having also made The Wizard of Oz. Great moments include an exhilarating fire of |Atlantic and the getaway by horse and wagon.

Leigh plays O'Hara, widowed after two marriages, yet her pining for Ashley determines her downfall. As Rhett, Gable is charming until he is unable to sustain the love of this woman even when their daughter dies after being thrown from a horse. Howard plays the frustrated and worn Ashley, and de Havilland plays the ill yet gentle spirit of Melanie. Hattie McDaniel comically steals scenes as Mammy the maid.

The Technicolor look of 'Gone with the wind' is pretty amazing, for instance in the aforementioned scene, and otherwise mostly in similar grand scenes and images. During the film I had guessed the film was from the fifties, so discovering that it was made in 1939 rather blew my mind.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, but only up until just after the ending of the Civil War. Then it became much more like a soap opera (though still better than your average soap series), focusing mostly on Scarlet and Rhett Butler and their turbulent 'romantic' times. I can't say I got bored with it, nor was it really bad, but their characters went all over the place without really convincing me of their sincerity. Still, it's not hard to see how this is a classic, and I'm very likely to give it another chance some other time.

It's an epic reconstruction of a by-gone era, a pre-Civil War American South in which man and slave lived side by side. It's a war story featuring some hugely impressive pyrotechnic effects which must have blown cinema-goers away on first release.

I especially liked Clark Gable, who exudes charisma from every pore.<br/><br/>The production values are immaculate, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong, and the ultra-lengthy running time flies past thanks to the viewer's involvement in the events that unfold.

","My 10/10 rating really is because ""Gone with the Wind"" is basically the ultimate classic, so you'd have to be a fool not to see it. Now, the other part. We have to understand that this movie glorifies the Confederacy, making it look like that society's undoing was something to be mourned. This was of course the era when the South had rewritten American history so as to deify the slave-owning class and make it look like the North raped the South. It seems like it has only been in the past fifty years when we've taken a serious look at the Civil War and everything associated therewith.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Civil War, there's something about that. Last summer, when I was taking a sailing class, my teacher said that the worst thing that ever happened was that the North won the Civil War. When you think about it, that makes sense. If the South had won (which they really couldn't have - no industry), then the South would have never influenced our national policy. The Union would not only have remembered the brutal oppression inflicted on black people and done everything possible to atone for it, but would have also moved forward socially and scientifically, while the Confederacy would have effectively gotten stuck in the Dark Ages. With the North becoming very pro-labor, most corporations would have moved down South (maybe even the Bush family would have moved down there). The Confederacy would have joined up with the Axis Powers in WWII and gotten defeated by an international contingent. This would mean that the corporations would have gotten prosecuted, and George H.W. Bush would have gotten put in jail (and that G.W. would have never come into existence), and also that the US would have been afraid to have McCarthyism, the Vietnam War, or anything else that has stained our history; certainly, we wouldn't be in Iraq.<br/><br/>So that's my take on ""GWTW"". It does a good job showing how Scarlett is forced to change from a carefree, spoiled girl into a strong woman. There's also the scene where the women have to take a nap while the men discuss almost certain loss in the Civil War. Good in that sense."

The film is about Scarlett O'Hara's (Vivien Leigh, in an Oscar-winning role) experiences, in the South, during our country's Civil War.  We see the triumphs and tribulations of this amazing character through some of our nation's darkest years.  The screenplay, based on the popular novel, is super.  Victor Fleming received an Oscar for his direction, but there were rumored to be as many as 12 directors who collaborated on the final product.  Clark Gable (Oscar-nominated) gives the performance of a lifetime and the fact that he failed to win the Oscar is one of life's true mysteries.  Hattie McDaniel did win in the supporting actress category (she was the first African-American to win an Oscar).  Her win cost Olivia de Havilland, who also received a nomination in that group.  In all the film won eight competitive Oscars and two special achievement awards.  It was nominated for 13 overall, an unheard of number for Oscar in 1939.

Apart from the 20 minute ""Overture"" sequence involving a painting of a sky, the words ""Overture"" and the canned music of a symphony orchestra playing random notes, which really annoyed me ><, the movie really was a load of crap that just looked good and colorful.<br/><br/>The story was a long and winding tale about a girl Scarlett O'Hara complaining and whining about her pampered, sheltered little life while men are off dying in the Civil War fighting for the Confederacy, and she falls in love with a scoundrel blockade runner (sounds like something out of Star Wars) named Brett Butler or something.<br/><br/>The movie goes on fairly well, impressing me with its simplicity and its strict sticking to the plot of Scarlett and Brett trying to stick together while their society crumbles as the Union starts to win and invade the South.<br/><br/>Then comes the climax, when Brett is finally reunited with Scarlett, and the most disastrous turn in movie history happens... in the midst of their crumbling society, with the Confederacy pushed down to the brink, the Union swarming over their town, and fires blazing in the background... Brett decides to join the Confederacy. After YEARS of avoiding service. Scarlett asks him what we're all asking the screen: ""WHY?!"" ""WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!"" And do you know what his response is?!?!: ""I've always been a sucker for lost causes"" That killed the movie right there. I stopped watching after that. I know there was another 30 minute interlude scene of a painting of a dusk sky and a symphony warming up. Then it goes on with Scarlett living in the burnt out shell of her house, growing food, killing Union soldiers come to rape her or some cliché thing like that, and helping one of her slaves give birth, while waiting for Brett to come home.<br/><br/>Worst movie ever."
"tinydr47","4","12","30","4 June 2006"," Beautifully Shot, Utter Trash
","Before I eviscerate this film, a word in its favor. This is, in many ways, a wonderfully shot movie. It is certainly a masterpiece of Technicolor, with lovely painted backdrops, etc. Much of the acting is, in my opinion, wonderful. Personally I think Scarlett as a character falls a bit flat, but beyond that I have few complaints. Except, perhaps, for the nearly 4 hour running time... but hey, people like an event, I won't knock them for it.<br/><br/>That being said, here are a few problems I have with the film: note that some of these objections could easily be answered by turning to the censorship of the period, but I don't see that as much of a response.<br/><br/>1. It ""whitewashes"" slavery. From the very beginning the film takes cheap-outs to avoid difficult and real subjects. In the beginning, the overseer's impregnation of the ""white-trash woman"" is clearly a poor substitute for what they're really getting at, the rape of black women. The slaves/servants are portrayed throughout as stupid and or slow, or liars (Prissy for example). Without coming right out and saying it, a later reminiscence on the ""glorious past"" casts slavery in a similar light as Joel Chandler Harris, essentially as ""the laughing times.""<br/><br/>2. Misogyny. Scarlett (letter anybody?) seems to make the key mistake of sexual agency, and of not knowing her place. Again and again it is drummed into our heads how ""evil"" she is for conniving to steal other women's men. Again and again it is driven in that women should know their place (Belle for instance, while noble, is clearly a ""fallen woman"" or a ""low woman"" who realizes her position and respects it). Ultimately Scarlett ""must"" pay the price.<br/><br/>Sexual violence is also simply passed-over. The build-up to the ""rape"" scene (I'll call it what is so clearly is, non-consensual sex, aka rape) alludes again-and-again to what will come... what with Rhett and his ""if I want to come in, no door will keep me out"" tirade and demonstration. Bam! Kicks down the door. And what is Scarlett's apparent reaction to the morning-after Rhett has drunkenly raped her? Happiness?<br/><br/>Again, I laud the film for its technical achievements. However, if you were born post-lib or raised by a feminist in the post Women's Lib years, or perhaps are a History major and not someone simply nostalgically wishing for a past that never existed as portrayed, I would urge a critical eye. I am reminded of a quote from Vincent Canby of the NYT regarding Liliana Cavani's ""The Night Porter"" and I hope my direct reference of the source will suffice for copyright purposes. To butcher his comment somewhat, I have just reviewed ""a piece of junk."""

"gbill-74877","7","5","10","2 October 2018"," Compelling story, iconic moments, and fantastic production value - but in a toxic context
","A movie that's certainly worth watching, but it's hard not to be conflicted, and it's a tough one to rate.<br/><br/>Positives:
<ul><li>Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding in their roles of these two selfish people, who, while difficult to like, spiral around each other and deliver iconic Hollywood moments. He recognizes they're cut from the same cloth and loves her for it, she sees the same thing and hates him. A sexual current runs through their relationship from the first time he undresses her with his eyes, and she remarks ""He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy."" Later he'll tell her ""You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how,"" and it's clear without saying it when he helps her what he wants in return (after all, he's ""not a marrying man""). Gable's character is perceptive throughout the movie, and he's an interesting mix of rogue, gallant, bemused observer, and doting father.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The filmmaking is extraordinary, particularly for 1939. There are exquisite scenes in glorious color, and the soundtrack is fantastic. War-time shots in the first half, like the horse and carriage escaping a massive fire, the one of all the wounded laid out, and the operation are memorable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hattie McDaniel is a delight to watch in the role of Mammy, the tough-minded servant who tries to keep a proper sense of decorum and the willful Scarlett in line. While some criticized her for taking a stereotypical role (similar to the criticism Anna May Wong suffered), this was the part available, and it was a step forward for her to take it, own it, and win an Oscar. Special favors had to be called in just to allow her to get her in to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub for the Oscars, and even then she had to sit in the back at a small table. I recently visited her simple grave in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, where she was buried instead of Hollywood Cemetery because she wasn't allowed in to the latter. She was discriminated against even in death, and it's important to remember that racism and segregation weren't just occurring in the past, or only in the Jim Crow South.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is a feminist message in the strength of the two main female characters. Scarlett is manipulative and shallow, but she's also tough and a survivor. She makes it through bleak times, shoots a ravaging Union soldier in the face, and at one point while trying to run a business ""Great balls of fire! Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!"" Similarly, while Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) can be almost maddeningly pure, seeing the good in everyone despite their obvious evil, she acts as an almost Christ-like role model.</li></ul><br/><br/>Negatives:
<ul><li>There is no point sugar-coating this: the movie, and the book it's based on, is racist. It perpetuates the horrifying myth of the loyal, docile, and simple slave. These smiling African-Americans have no interest in freedom, and in the few scenes they're in, they look simply like employees of Plantation, Inc. The character of Prissy is feeble-minded and helpless. The film tried to avoid controversy and be as neutral as possible, but what we see for the most part are essentially cartoons.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>From its opening credits, the movie perpetuates a myth about an entire way of life, that the South was noble and filled with honorable people, and now sadly all of that is gone. Historically this is inaccurate, and morally it's outrageous. And yet, 70+ years after the war, this was the narrative, with a message diametrically opposed to that of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'. The slaveholders are shown to be kind and thoughtful aristocrats, and it's instead the Yankee carpetbaggers who are portrayed as cruel and vicious. Deviations from the book are apparently rather modest, but one major one is Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) and another character no longer being members of the KKK; instead they go off to a 'political meeting'. Before the war, Ashley says that ""Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars, and when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about,"" as if this particular war fit that case - being fought over for some vague reason. After the war, he says without a hint of irony ""I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others."" Even Scarlett points out the hypocrisy, but it's as if this male voice, this Major in the Confederate Army can't bring himself to mention slavery or race issues. This is consistent with the shameful Southern apologia that has never truly been dissipated, recent statue removal notwithstanding.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In addition to my problems with his role, Leslie Howard does not fit here. He does not seem like a Southern gentleman from the period at all, and does not bring nearly the authenticity that Gable brings in his scenes of passion. In an otherwise fine cast, he is quite weak.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The second half of the movie is far too melodramatic, and practically a soap opera. To some this is faithful to the book, entertaining, and helpful to create an epic feel to it all, but to me it's overdone, and artistically sloppy. It also leads to a bloated four hour run time, and I think it would have been more powerful condensed. </li></ul><br/><br/>Summary:
The film is insidious because the story, its characters, and its production value are all so compelling, and yet the background context is so toxic. Can we mentally set aside those gigantic elephants in the room, and forgive it? Is this like a romantic Southern version of 'War and Peace', where we note that in his epic, Tolstoy didn't write of the ownership and oppression to serfs? Can we see it as the viewpoint of a defeated secessionist country, and understand what de Havilland would say in an interview years later - that ""All countries have experienced war and defeat. And survival. They can identify with that film for, I think, that reason."" It's tough. Very tough. I can neither love not despise this film."
"ACitizenCalledKane","8","5","10","12 January 2005"," The film that set the standard for grandeur...
","David O. Selznick set out to make the biggest, and best, film that money could buy. The result is one of the biggest, most-successful, most critically acclaimed American films of all time - Gone With the Wind. Based on Margaret Mitchell's tale of long-lost southern gallantry, and a way of life that would never return, Gone With the Wind is a work of fiction, set in a glorified Technicolor rendition of the old south. Now, to say that this is all historically accurate would be like saying that this is a short film. Clocking in at just under four hours long, this story can be a little hard to sit through. You really have to get caught up in the soap opera. Once you do, however, it is not hard to see why this film is as highly regarded as it is. I can't help but feel that it is a little over-rated, but considering when it was made, it is spectacular. Vivien Leigh is extraordinary as the beautiful and manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. The intensity of each emotion she expresses throughout the film is outstanding! Clark Gable is the foil to Ms. Leigh's southern belle, the dashing, devil-may-care Rhett Butler. He is often very cool, allowing room for his bottled-up emotion to erupt. He spars with Scarlett, her intensity versus his calm resolve, but both characters are quite similar in many other ways...Leslie Howard is Ashley Wilkes, the physical embodiment of a southern gentleman. His wife, Melanie Hamilton, is played with a quiet grace all her own by Olivia de Havilland. Hattie McDaniel's Academy Award winning performance as Mammy, the voice of reason amongst all of the drama, is just as astounding as any of the other performances in this epic picture. While not a perfect film, Gone With the Wind is still an extremely important one, and should not be missed by anyone interested in classic American cinema."

","I'll freely admit my girlfriend and I have quite different tastes, but we usually both recognise really great films when we see them. This meeting of minds, alas, has not happened for the much-vaunted classic 'Gone with the Wind' - she loves the costumes and Vivien Leigh; I loathe the slave-era nostalgia, weak script, hammy acting, overlong show-time (and I'm a Peter Jackson fan) and above all, Vivien Leigh. Only Clark Gable gives a creditable performance as the charming rogue, Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>On the first viewing, the film lost me early on with the depiction of cheerful, singing slaves returning from a day in the fields; it continued to elude me as Scarlett O'Hara, initially portrayed vividly as a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich girl, proceeded through the film to become...well...a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich woman. If I ever hear her breathily begin a sentence with ""Oh, Rhett!"" one more time, I think I may scream.<br/><br/>For sure the most overrated film in the IMDb top #250 I have seen, more so than Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove, both of which have at least some merit beyond the production values."

"JLRMovieReviews","10","3","5","17 December 2014"," Margaret Mitchell's Legacy - Tomorrow is Another Day
","Young Scarlett is infatuated with Ashley Wilkes, but is disappointed to say the least when she hears of his engagement to Melanie Wilkes, who's a goody-two-shoes and Scarlett cares nothing for. Such begins the life, loves and whims of young Scarlett O'Hara in this Civil War-era story. Why is there another review to add to the already many reviews of this granddaddy of all movies? As I saw this for the umpteenth time recently, it crossed my mind that I hadn't reviewed it and to give a heads up for all those young enough to have never seen it or been introduced to it by their parents and are interested in seeing this long movie. What's so great about this movie, anyway? To begin with, author Margaret Mitchell was not your average girl growing up at the beginning of the 20th century. She was an independent creature who possessed a determined mind and a different outlook on the way things are supposed to be. To say she was a tomboy was to put in mildly. She was nicknamed ""Jimmy,"" by those who knew her tomboyish ways and she loved the nickname. She was also called ""Peggy"" by her mother, which was a nickname for Margaret. She loved writing even as a young girl and would be writing constantly in her diary. Years later, the idea came to her for a novel when she recalled from her youth the time her mother took her to all the plantations and lands that once were prosperous during the pre-Civil War days and how the people lived and how they lost all they had when the war came, and it intrigued her how the families and generations must have endured that terrible inevitable war. Her mother's point in telling all this to young Peggy was to instill in Margaret a survival instinct. Drawing on her own husbands and beaus, Margaret conceived of the leads of Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. And even the young girl's name was not Scarlett in the beginning, but Patsy. Taking three years, she wrote laboriously until she got her draft the way she wanted it, somewhat. She began her story with the end and wrote backwards. So she knew what her vision and her message was, even from the first word. Given the fact Margaret Mitchell was an independent person, the book's ending is not totaling surprising. It was really all about survival, no matter what. But what plagued her throughout writing was her first chapter. Not feeling completely satisfied, she shelved it, despite her insistence of her second husband and a publisher. When girlfriends heard of this novel, one of them made a remark that would change not only film history, but book history: ""Margaret, you wrote a book! You? I didn't know you had it in you."" With this anger and almost uncontrollable rage of being put in her place, Margaret got her draft and gave it to her publisher friend. Although he said it needed work, he was in awe of what he read. Despite the fact Americans were in the midst of the depression, ""Gone with the Wind"" took them by storm. Due to its bulkiness, it cost $3, and Margaret was impressed that anyone would spend $3 for it, given the hard times. ""Gone with the Wind"" broke all book records and still today sells hundreds of thousands of copies each year. With the name change to Scarlett encouraged by the publishers, ""Gone with the Wind"" was an extravaganza that debuted on December 15, 1939 in Atlanta, Georgia with most of the cast there, except for the black supporting players. Winning 10 Oscars for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, Best Picture and Best Director, this has been the definitive example of story-telling splashed on film. Director George Cukor started production but was replaced by Victor Fleming who was credited and who received the award. Ben-Hur would later break the record for the most Oscars, but it's ""Gone with the Wind""'s characters and their real flaws and dreams that have kept this film alive and in the hearts and imaginations of generations ever since. Upon seeing again, it occurred to me that once you have seen a movie over and over, sometimes it feel like you're just seeing it automatically, having it all memorized. But the magic of ""Gone with the Wind"" is that you are transported to another time that is made so real and so vivid that you never feel bored or unaffected with what you're watching. There are too many good actors in this to go into that, but suffice it to say that neither Clark Gable nor Leslie Howard wanted to be in this film, Clark for fear he could not live up to the young ladies' expectations of a Rhett Butler and because it was essentially a woman's film and Leslie Howard felt that Ashley was weak and Leslie Howard had a reputation as a ladies' man. And, the role of Scarlett O'Hara was the role of a lifetime, and that's another story of how they were filming the burning of Atlanta when in walks Vivien Leigh. End of discussion. Why should anyone today, new generations and you watch this film – because it shows you how to write films, how to develop strong characters, because it is part of our culture that shows what we came from and where we may be going in the future. That's just a few reasons. For sheer entertainment, nothing can really top this – no words are big enough or opulent enough – to describe the experience of watching ""Gone with the Wind,"" especially for the first time. It's cinematically beautiful, majestic, stirring, and stupendous. Well, less is more, so suffice it to say, I would recommend ""Gone with the Wind"" to anyone serious about watching good films and interested seriously about making movies. Margaret Mitchell left quite a legacy – the dreams, the hopes, the drive of a young woman who influenced the world."

"evancyl","9","3","5","6 August 2014"," An epic tale of a selfish heroine set during the American Civil War
","Any director who can turn a selfish and spoiled character (who fundamentally remains that way) into a heroine deserves high praise. Scarlett O' Hara is the eldest daughter of a rich landowner in the 1860s American South. Surrounded by beaux, she is interested only in Ashley Wilkes, and is crushed to find that he will be marrying his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. She pleads and makes a scene at his house during a party, and later discovers that Rhett Butler, a wealthy young man with a shady reputation, has overheard everything. To get back at Ashley, she marries his soon-to-be brother-in-law, Charles Hamilton, just before the men go off for war. Set during the American Civil War, the movie a good number of years, during which we see the Southern states devastated, Scarlett's family home stripped bare and previously rich landowners bankrupted. Scarlett's strong sense of self- preservation makes her to determined to do whatever it takes, marriage included to keep her land and live comfortably. Throughout, she clings stubbornly to her love for Ashley, realising too late that he had long ceased loving her and that her happiness lay with another.<br/><br/>I loved this movie for its epic tale and its rich characters. Also, the acting was splendid and the sets marvelous for that era! I can't help but like and sympathise with Scarlett; while she is so obviously selfish, I respect her for being strong and determined and resourceful. (The ending was fully understandable, but I wanted to cry all the same.) With Ashley and Rhett, I started out liking one and hating the other, but the positions were reversed by the end. Melanie was such an angel throughout, and an inspiration to people who are trying to be good. Although the film was criticised for its fairly benign portrayal of slavery, with Mammie being a wise and supporting presence, I don't think it's always necessary to paint the harshest reality. My only gripe is that the movie is too long, though many parts of Margaret Mitchell's book were already excluded. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Gone with the Wind tremendously and would recommend it to everyone!"
"RichardSRussell-1","10","3","5","24 September 2012"," At the Center of the Critical Triangle
","As a science-fiction fan, I often have to defend my favorite genre from the disdain of mainstream and academic literary and film critics, who complain that it shortchanges plot and characterization.<br/><br/>If I'm pressed for time, I shortcut my response by citing Sturgeon's Law. Master of the SF short story, Theodore Sturgeon was once being interviewed on the radio, and the host provocatively asked him why 90% of SF was crap. Sturgeon's snappy reply: ""90% of EVERYTHING is crap!"" And this is tritely true. The only reason anyone thinks of the early 19th Century as the golden age of music is because the only stuff that's survived from then till now is the 10% that's NOT crap. But there was plenty of bad classical music being written then, too, and not even all of Beethoven's stuff is top drawer.<br/><br/>But that's the facile reply. With more time (such as what I have here), I expand the limited horizons of the critics by expanding their favorite spectrum into the 3rd dimension. They are accustomed to drawing a straight line, labelling one end ""plot"" and the other end ""character"", and assigning each book or movie to a point somewhere along that spectrum, depending on what they perceive to be the balance between the 2 elements.<br/><br/>But I insert a 3rd point, off the line, forming the vertex of an equilateral triangle, and label it ""setting"". I show my own disdain for mainstream mimetic fiction by saying ""Sure, ANY old hack writer can start a novel with 'It was raining as the battered gray Chevy pulled up to the Empire State Building, battered gray Harvey Bluedorn emerged, and his battered gray flannel suit immediately started showing big dark blotches.', because your readers immediately understand the setting and circumstances; they're familiar with New York, Chevies, and suits, even if they've never been there, driven one, or worn one.<br/><br/>SF and fantasy writers have the added burdens of not only inventing whole new worlds where their stories take place, they must also describe them clearly enuf to form a useful mental picture without dropping a huge expository lump into the early going. (This is somewhat easier for movie-makers, who can show without having to tell, but it's still more challenging than an establishing shot of, say, Antarctica.)<br/><br/>So, to me, the ideal balance is not midway between plot and characterization, ignoring the duty of setting altogether, but rather at the center of the equilateral triangle.<br/><br/>By that measure, the platinum standard of accomplishment — the apotheosis of balancing plot, character, and setting, in the full richness of each — is Gone with the Wind, not merely ONE of the best movies of all time but the VERY best.<br/><br/>I speak as a science-fiction and fantasy fan who recognizes that there's not a speck of either in GWTW and still rates it higher than Avatar or Lord of the Rings (but they're also smack-dab in the middle of the Critical Triangle if you take the time to look)."

","The history of the cinema is full of monumental achievements coming from directors such as F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and Sergio Leone and many of their successes became known as all-time classics. And even among these fabulous titles, there are those so monumental that they tower above even the others in their rank. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of those pictures. In a way, it's the most important Hollywood movie ever made. Not only is it the most successful movie of all time (in adjusted dollars), but it revolutionized and inspired the world anew with its breathtaking, sweeping power and iconic portrait of the Old South and the Reconstruction, all seen through the eyes of not a man, but a woman, Margaret Mitchell's unforgettable character of Scarlett O'Hara, played unforgettably by Vivien Leigh.<br/><br/>""Gone with the Wind"" is a movie about a great many things, but it is really the story of Scarlett. The movie starts in the dawn of the Civil War, when Scarlett was a high-strung sixteen-year-old and follows her experiences through the war, watching people die before her very eyes, and her undying effort to not only survive but to prosper through the Reconstruction of the Old South, a world she shall never see again. The movie is also about her relationship to the charismatic Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) and what evolves into a turbulent love affair.<br/><br/>Clark Gable had received top-billing due to his fame, but the movie is about and really works because of the Vivien Leigh character. Vivien Leigh and her enthusiasm and her never-say-die attitude throughout her performance is the cement foundation that keeps this near-four-hour epic fresh and powerful viewing after viewing. I have debated and debated and still not decided who gave the best performance by an actor in a film, but after looking at ""Gone with the Wind"" just once, I knew which *actress* had given the best performance. And that is Vivien Leigh. Leigh simply *is* Scarlett O'Hara, never striking a false note in her performance. At the beginning of the picture, she's only supposed to be sixteen. Leigh was much older than that, but she carries the performance through and convinces us that not only is she sixteen, but that she's maturing throughout the picture. Despite her character's personality and how Victor Fleming wanted her portray Scarlett, Leigh makes us feel for and take side with this spitfire for a role. Because of Vivien Leigh and her energetic, impeccable performance, Scarlett O'Hara became not a snobbish anti-hero of a protagonist, but one of the screen's greatest and most admirable heroines.<br/><br/>But I cannot – shall not – leave out Clark Gable. I still don't know which actor gave the best cinematic performance, but Gable's portrait of Rhett Butler in ""Gone with the Wind"" is an undeniable candidate. According to Hollywood lore, Gable did not want to make ""Gone with the Wind"" and did not care for the picture even though it immortalized him. Rumor has it he only did the picture for the paycheck, but he was entirely professional in his work nonetheless. Because of his strong charismatic acting, the Rhett Butler character not only stands out strongly in his early scenes, but by the last third of the picture, the movie is equally about him as well as Scarlett.<br/><br/>Powered by the immortalizing performances by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, ""Gone with the Wind"" is still a landmark is many other regards. Even though the movie does, in a way, glorify or at least take a sympathetic approach on the Old South, it does it with nobility. It does not make the Old South look like a heaven, but a once peaceful, if corrupt world gone forever. For example, although the O'Hara family owns slaves, they do not treat them as slaves, more as hired servants. Even after the war is over, their slaves return of them. And as for the African Americans in the picture, they have been treated in screenplay and acting honorably. They have to be shown as servants, because unfortunately that's how they were treated back then. But we can see by the Hattie McDaniel performance that the movie knows that despite their treatment, African Americans are human beings themselves and are as infinitely different and equal to everybody else. Apart from this, ""Gone with the Wind"" also stands out because McDaniel became the first African American to not only be nominated for, but win an Academy Award and it was a well-deserved gesture.<br/><br/>Although filming ""Gone with the Wind"" may have been as turbulent as Scarlett and Rhett's relationship became, the final product was truly marvelous. Director Fleming and producer David O. Selznick (who naturally watched over the production like a guardian) made ""Gone with the Wind"" one of the most professional-looking and feeling pictures of all time. The scenes of the Civil War through Scarlett's eyes are some of the most powerful, gritty, and moving moments in cinema history including the burning of Atlanta scene in which many Hollywood props of the past were wiped out of existence. And the screenplay is as perfect as they come. The movie runs nearly four hours in length and there's not one scene – not one bit of fat – that feels like it needs to come off. The numerous characters all serve their purpose. And it's just wonderful to look at this picture and pick out familiar supporting role faces such as Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mithcell, Ward Bond, and Butterfly McQueen.<br/><br/>Just about every moment of ""Gone with the Wind"" is an iconic, revolutionary scene. I have seen the picture three times within the past six months and it hasn't shed a bit of power or sweeping authority yet. From its high-spirited opening to its tear-jerking but optimistic end, it is an enthralling cinematic experience. Movies don't get much better than this."

","The movie, Gone with the Wind, deserves all the awards it has received. It lasts for 4 hours, but it never makes one feel bored. Instead, it seems that it has a magic to attract audiences to go on watching. The braveness of Scarlett O'Hara, the wit and consideration of Rhett Butler and the unperceived yet strong love between them can be tasted between scenes. It really makes me cry when comes the scene that Rhett finds out that Scarlett still loves Ashley and admires his photo secretly after she has married him and after all the things he has done for her. Even through after finding out the fact, Rhett only makes one movement, throwing the glass on the wall, the pain in his soul can be clearly sensed. For me, it's a great pity that Scarlett and Rhett can't have a happy ending at last."

","'Gone With the Wind' is a much beloved epic that still impresses. It's only drawback is over length and a tendency towards excessive melodrama, specially in the last hour. Otherwise, the performances are generally very good with Vivien Leigh and Rhett Butler having great chemistry together. Leigh's character is selfish but she captures our attention from start to end. The film's views on racial harmony are obviously dated. Yet it has an amazing scale and the production values are very good. The sacking of Atlanta is specially well depicted.

"PudgyPandaMan","10","3","5","4 January 2009"," A review by a Southern-belle...
","Being from the south, I have always been fascinated with Southern history and heritage. While I'm ashamed of the slavery issue, we cant deny its existence. I grew up near several old southern plantations. I was even an ""Azalea Belle"" in a local festival in my teen years - complete with hoop skirt and spiral curls in my hair.<br/><br/>There is a certain nostalgia and charm to the old south that no doubt has captured the imagination of many that find this film so unforgettable. The old oaks trees covered in moss, the huge plantation houses with giant columns,etc.<br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects of the film is just to focus on the beautiful Technicolor cinematography that truly was an astounding achievement for 1939. I would have loved to see the faces of the first audiences to experience this marvel firsthand. I also love to study the amazingly beautiful and lavish sets. The furniture and costumes enthrall me every time I watch.<br/><br/>And who can surpass Vivien Leigh at the height of her beauty and charm. Her facial expressions and use of her eyes are entrancing. You can't help but fall under her spell, like all the poor boys who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with her.<br/><br/>And I don't know that I have ever encountered a more sympathetic character than Melanie, portrayed so unforgettably by Olivia de Havilland. Has there ever been a longer suffering, unselfish person ever portrayed in cinema? Clark Gable is at his usual cad-like best. Not too much of a stretch for him to portray, but you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Truly, Scarlett met her match in Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>My only slight criticism would be for Asley Wilkes character, played by Howard. I always found it hard to see what Scarlett saw in him - other than he was the one man she couldn't have. I never considered him much of a prize. He was a little annoying and cowardly to me. Poor excuse for a man if you ask me.<br/><br/>Margaret Mitchell's novel truly came to life to millions of fans of her book. I'm not sure there has even been, before or since, a better adaptation from novel to film. And of course there was the legendary search for the perfect Scarlett - who could have asked for better PR going into a film.<br/><br/>The story has so many memorable aspects to it. There are the suspense filled scenes - like when all the women are gathered together, while the ""menfolk"" are cleaning out Shantytown of the undesirables who attacked Scarlett. There are the heartbreaking scenes that will have you in tears - like Bonnie Blue's event ( I wont give it away), Mr. O'Hara's accident or Melanie's final fate. You will be moved to outrage at some of Scarlett's antics, while at the same time rooting for her as well. So the whole movie quietly wages an inner conflict as you want Scarlett to get what she deserves, but yet has you feeling sorry for her at the same time.<br/><br/>The Civil War ultimately was won by survivors - regardless what side of the Mason-Dixon line you were born. And I think that is what Scarlett represents to the audience. She is a Survivor with a capital S - even if we don't agree with her methods!"

","This movie is one of the best movies of all time. It may lasts four hours, but the story is so engrossing that you actually lose track. Vivian Leigh is quite stunning as Scarlett. I would list her in the top 5 of the most beautiful sirens ever to grace the silver screen. It was the performance of a lifetime, and definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actress. This movie may have been made in the late 30's, but it never gets old. It actually makes you feel bad for people of the South right after the Civil War. The desolation, the destitution. But you fall in love in Scarlett, not only because of her spunkiness and beauty, but her resolve, to carry on even when all seems lost. This is truly an epic in every sense of the word. It doesn't get much better than this. I would recommend this movie to history buffs, people who like love stories, and people who just like great movies. That is why I gave it a '10'."
"hypostylin","10","3","5","7 January 2008"," A passionate and intense journey through the ante and postbellum American South.
","For a film with such a long running time, Gone With the Wind has a relatively straightforward story. Certainly, it is presented in an epic fashion, complete with intermezzos and sublime landscape shots, but this film is all about intimate interpersonal relationships amidst the tumultuous sociopolitical fallout in the American South in the immediate wake of the Civil War. The film would probably be about three hours shorter if the characters realized that their cultural values were actually restraints on their lives. However, these people's obsession with contemporary mores is all part of the intrigue. The occasionally meandering pace complements these anxieties.<br/><br/>Vivian Leigh aptly carries the film in an Oscar-winning performance as the feisty, brazen, and conniving Scarlett -- such a strong, independent leading lady, who is certainly more representative of the 1930s than the 1860s. If she were played by another actress with less zeal, Scarlett would simply come across as despicably spoiled and shallow. However, Leigh playfully skirts that line, while also providing enough fragility to convey Scarlett's rise and fall. Clark Gable is another remarkable player as the sly, suave, and frequently hilarious Rhett Butler, the one man who ultimately tempers the spitfire Scarlett. Olivia de Havilland delivers a heartwarming (albeit one-dimensional) portrayal of Melanie, who, because of her genuine charity and benevolence, Scarlett has a difficult time loathing for ""stealing"" her first beloved. Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel -- as talented as she is pioneering -- is a revelation here as the pragmatic yet caring Mammy. And Butterfly McQueen (one of my personal heroes) is an oxymoronic combination of adorable and annoying as the screechy young servant Prissy -- I wonder if Rae Dawn Chong modeled her performance as Squeak in The Color Purple after McQueen here.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of Gone With the Wind are, perhaps, more remarkable than anything else. The film's art direction, lighting, color, sound, and cinematography are on par with, and even exceed, some of the work you find in productions today. There are many memorable images in this film. A few of note: the swooping, surrealistic landscape of Tara and her grounds; Scarlett dancing and merrymaking in her black garb of mourning; the young band member playing the piccolo while tears stream down his face; and the parade of fieldworkers bellowing their haunting Negro spiritual through the streets of crumbling Atlanta.<br/><br/>A landmark cinematic achievement in every sense of the word, Gone With the Wind, as its title and textual narrative allude to, beautifully captures and preserves an era that is gone but not forgotten."
"carlwilcox","8","3","5","16 November 2006"," The wind done gone
","What a film - watched the digitally remastered version recently, after years of avoiding the film out of a misplaced preconception of it as being one of the first chick-flicks, full of saccharin sentimentality and for those who like their handkerchief wet all the way through. It really isn't like that, although have to admit my feminine side was stirred by the rich colours of the sumptuous ball-gowns in the early dancing scenes. Scarlett O'Hara is a total bitch - what a character. You want to see her fall flat on her face from early in the film onwards, but you keep watching and can't help admiring when she somehow survives and even thrives while most of those around her are suffering terribly. Clark Gable is a dude who would grace the modern film, or films of any era. Olivia De Havilland is quietly, radiantly beautiful, and even the usually boring Leslie Howard makes the rather dull role of Ashley Wilkes come to life. The digital remastering makes this 67-year-old film look like it was made in the 90s - the burning of Atlanta is vivid and impressive. The camera-work / cinematography throughout is tremendous. This film definitely deserves its reputation as a major event in the history of cinema."

","I got this movie from someone else. There would be no way that ""I"" would buy Gone with the Wind. There was no way that I was going to watch literally four hours of a full blown romance movie. But when I decided to try it out I was very surprised that I was eager to pop in the second part. I was surprised that I was engulfed in a romance story but then I though its not like that at all. This movie is commonly referred to as romance and that is how I viewed it when I started it but I quickly realized that its not a romance movie its a war story. I'm not saying that it is not a romance movie. There is a fair share of romance in the movie but thats not the whole movie. Vivian Leigh is great as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable is great as Rhett Butler. The movie takes place during the civil war and there are a lot of exciting parts. The whole movie is a triumph and it gets a lot of crap from the younger generation. Everyone should at least give this movie a try. I went in thinking that I was going to hate it but came out surprisingly satisfied. 10 out of 10"

She doesn't understand nor care what he is talking about while it is going on but the memory of that conversation carries her through many times throughout the movie. You watch Scarlett go from a will-full (albet beautiful) child to a mature woman at the very end (who is still beautiful, will-full, and self-centered mind you, but you do see her grow). Rhett is absolutely wonderful! He baits her at times, fathers her at times, and is always in love with her."

Selznick exacted the maximum interest in the movie. It had better be good; it had better be epic, and it was. <br/><br/>A great success story.<br/><br/>It was perfectly cast, and wonderfully directed. One might not think so, since two directors were involved, with a change to Victor Fleming from George Cukor early on. Usually this doesn't work, but this time it did. It also worked for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938 with Errol Flynn) -- although in that case two directors were credited."
"dirtydanthejacketman","10","3","5","4 September 2004"," One of the greatest films of all time
","Gone With the Wind is a magnificent Civil War picture that deserved all the Academy Awards it got and it deserved more (Clark Gable should've won Best Actor, why he didn't is one of the greatest mysteries in the history of cinema). The film starts off with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, a selfish, hot-tempered Southern lady, who becomes exceedingly depressed when Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), the man she loves, is getting married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett then meets a man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable, in a superlative performance) who falls in love with her. Scarlett feels vague love for him, but she can't take her mind off of Ashley. Scarlett feels her life it tearing apart, when the Yankees come to attack and Ashley is fighting in the war, and what happens at the end is a lesson Scarlett should've learned from the advice that people taught her. It is a powerful, heart-breaking story that will leave you weeping. I believe it deserves to be much higher on the top 250 list. This film is among the greatest films I have seen in my life, and it is the greatest love film I have seen in my life. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see excellent cinema with a non-outdated story."

","The people who have made negative comments about this movie have probably not read the book. I don't think I've seen a movie that so closely follows a book. Yes, there are some minor differences but Margaret Mitchell wrote a book with some wonderful characters and they are definitely brought to life in this movie. I don't think the casting could have been any better. Yes, Scarlett is annoying and spoiled but that is exactly how she is in the book. Clark Gable is Rhett Butler. Perfect. He is exactly as he is described in the book also. The supporting character/actors are also excellent. I've watched other older movies and find it hard to get into them, but I don't have that problem with this movie. That could be because I love the book and watching this is just like reading the book. The look of the movie doesn't seem that old fashioned.

","There is no possible and reasonable way of electing the greatest movie ever made. There are too many subjectives variables which are based on personal opinions. Nevertheless, I think GWTW is easily defenceable as the most symbolic american movie of all times. Firstly it is the greatest hollywood box office. Outside USA borders, after 65 years, GWTW is still remembered and watched by old and new moviegoers. The plot has everything needed to a great movie; romance, war, tension, charismatic characters. Despite all the racism problems, the plot is focused on the central characters and mainly on Scarlett O'Hara played by the oustanding Vivien Leigh. The movie has, no doubt, a prejudicy view of black people. The american history shown in GWTW is also a fake. On the other hand, the main goal of the film is to show the amazing life of Scarlett. The soberb performance of Vivien Leigh will never be forgotten. This movie is not remembered by the racism message but for being a beloved history of a extraordinary woman and that was the Margaret Mitchell's purpose, at least I believe."

She was never strong in times of crises, and only survived because she found someone new to feel sorry for her. Her character portrayed the worst parts of our humanity, and I had to endure it being allowed for over 3 hours.

It is full of wonderful actors, and the way Selznick filmed it, it's beyond amazing. Hattie McDaniel definitely earned her academy award, and was my favorite character!"

"tarwaterthomas","10","2","3","27 August 2019"," Scarlett O'Hara should be kissed often and by somebody who knows how, like Rhett Butler
","Unless you've been on Mars, you know about he romance between high-spirited heiress Scarlett O'Hara and the dynamic gun-runner Rhett Butler who sides with the Confederates for the money (of course). I dare anybody not to enjoy the super saga of that ding-dong daddy and a Southern belle. If Clark Gable had not accepted the role of Rhett Butler, this expensive production probably would not have been made. There are plenty of scenes to be had, but my favorite is Rhett's rescue of Scarlett while she's trying to maintain control of a wagon while a high-strung horsie tries to get away, and that's while Atlanta is burning to cinders (having been set on fire by Union troops under orders by General William Tecumseh Sherman). The relationship of Scarlett and Rhett lasts in the aftermath of the Civil War, including their tempestuous marriage and breakup. Rhett Butler loves Scarlett O'Hara, but she still has it bad for Ashley Wilkes, but he's in love with Melanie Hamilton (and they get married, by the way). It reminds this viewer of the rock hit by the J. Geils Band, ""Love Stinks"", where part of the lyrics go ""you love her, she loves him, he loves somebody else, you just can't win"". GONE WITH THE WIND is certainly the greatest example of storytelling ever conceived. Sidney Howard wrote the screenplay, based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell; she never wrote another one before her untimely death in 1949; it fell to Alexandra Ripley to gin up the sequel novel SCARLETT: THE OFFICIAL SEQUEL TO GONE WITH THE WIND, which itself was made as a miniseries. This movie is so beloved that for many years it escaped the ""late late show"" and the pay movie channels; it has since been shown on TNT and TCM. Did you know that a battlefield sequence had been filmed? That lovable producer David Selznick had the footage excised, because it was a love story, after all. Sidney Howard had uncredited assistance from the likes of Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Oliver H.P. Garrett, John van Druten, Jo Swerlilng, and David Selznick himself. Did you also know that GONE WITH THE WIND was re-issued in 1967 in a 70mm widescreen presentation that lopped off the top and bottom of the film. One of the many Academy Award nominations was in the Special Effects category, for the spectacular visual effects accomplished by Jack Cosgrove and Lee Zavitz.If David Selznick never made another movie after GONE WITH THE WIND, this still would rank as his greatest achievement. He produced quite a few more until his last feature, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, was made in 1957. He was a terrific movie maker. Enough said."

","Aug-2019... Time for a late-breaking review from the kid who took a pretty cheerleader to see the first restored GWTW in 1970. I bought the LP Soundtrak with all new simulated stereo sound (wish I still had it-worth a fortune to a collector). Yes, maybe GWTW is the greatest film ever made, esp. now that a wonderful digitally restored version is available on DVD (there is a bluray also, but the DVD is superb).<br/><br/>Surprise! I bought the DVD Scarlett at the same time & watched it first. Pretty good story. The 'back' story of the casting & production of GWTW is the stuff of legends & documentaries. Here's my belated summary:<br/><br/>1) Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable performed magnificently. It was a crime that Gable was overlooked for an Oscar. Both actors were also very attractive in their roles.<br/><br/>2) The photography is stunning-'spared no expense', indeed.<br/><br/>3) I love the first half, but the sequence of tragedies that steadily unfolds in Part 2 always turned me off a bit. We are watching a tragedy rushing to it's conclusion. As my wise older brother once explained it to me: At the end, after Melanie passes away, Scarlett comes sobbing out of that room, and 2 men are waiting-Rhett and Ashley. If she runs to Rhett (which she should), we have a happy ending, and a melodrama. But if she runs to Ashley for comfort, Rhett is done with her-forever. A Greek tragedy. Rhett will survive. Scarlett is a tough cookie, who always believes she can get to tomorrow, and 'tomorrow is another day'. Sadly for Scarlett, her tomorrow, as far as a future with Rhett, had passed. Like the hapless Great Gatsby chasing Daisy, 'it was already past him'.. past HER, in this case.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the falling action that gets you to the finale, you will really love this new presentation in digital format."

","This is one of my favorite movies. I can watch it several times. It perfectly demonstrates the whole idea of the book. Of course, there are some parts, which are not shown in the movie, however, it doesn't impact negatively on the plot of the story. For example, in the book, we see that Scarlett had children after her two marriages, but in the movie, it is not shown. Nevertheless, it doesn't change the main idea of the story. Also, I want to state that the actors of this movie perfectly show the characters of the heroes. I really saw the characteristic of Scarlett in Vivien Leigh's play and of course the same thing I can say about Rett's actor. Thus, overall I think that this movie is one of the greatest movies in the world."
"joemccoy-72932","Null","2","3","6 February 2019"," One of the greatest movies ever made
","Almost always included in the list of greatest films of all time Gone With the wind's reputation precedes it. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. The first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, beginning shortly after the election of Abraham Lincoln, and ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, while still retaining a degree of appeal and narrative interest, spins its wheels frequently. One of the tests of the lasting impact of any film is determining whether it's still effective decades after its initial release. Gone with the Wind looks so good that it is surprising to consider its actual age. It's hard to believe that many of the people involved with this film have long since died. A masterpiece."

","Like everyone else, I'd seen GWTW on TV several times over the years. I never counted it among my favorite films. However, when the opportunity came up to go to a screening at a theater last weekend I thought, ""That's a film that should be seen on the big screen!""<br/><br/>WOW, was I right!<br/><br/>The cinematography, the technicolor, the production design, the performances, the music, the imagery, the scope, the sizzling dialogue between Rhett and Scarlett...<br/><br/>Most of the time going to a movie is just going to a movie but this was an EXPERIENCE!<br/><br/>It was the first time that I'd ever seen GWTW 100% from start to finish, uninterrupted and with no distractions. Roger Ebert once said, ""A good movie is never too long,"" and I concur. Not once in 248 minutes was I tempted to look at my watch. I was riveted to the screen. The entire theater was sold-out and the audience applauded a couple of times (including at the end) so a few hundred people seemed to agree with me.<br/><br/>I have to say that the character of Scarlet is a lot more complex than she's usually given credit for being. Yes, she's vain, selfish, manipulative, and opportunistic but she's also strong (both physically and mentally), resourceful, determined, and courageous. She nurses wounded soldiers, gets an ailing Melanie and newborn baby through miles of a war-zone to safety, takes over running the family's plantation, kills an enemy soldier who tries to rob and possibly rape and/or kill her, provides for her whole family and starts and runs a successful lumber business. Not bad for a girl in her teens and 20s in the 1860s! You'd think that she'd be a feminist icon.<br/><br/>I have just one thing to say to the idiots who think that a film that accurately depicts the way life was in the 1860s is somehow ""racist"" and that is...SHUT UP! Go watch some dumb, SJW message-laden, super-hero movie and leave commenting on classic films to the adults! I was going to rate it a 9 but I'm giving it a 10 to offset the 1 ratings from numbskulls who get offended by history.<br/><br/>If you really love movies then you need to see this one the way it was meant to be seen; uncut, uninterrupted, in stereo, and on the BIG screen!"

She does all for an affluent life but finds herself alone at the end in the midst of prosperity. Her love, Ashley never loved him nor did her husband. 
The misplaced emotions and quest for prosperity are well expressed but garnishing of finest acting and direction."

"jul-kinnear","10","2","3","6 November 2014"," This movie's grandeur is incomparable and its message is one we can all still relate to seventy-five years later: home is where the heart is.
","David O. Selznick's 1939 production of GONE WITH THE WIND[1] has earned itself many titles over the years: the greatest film ever made, the first film to receive a staggering thirteen Academy Award nominations of which it eventually won eight awards, and the highest grossing film of all time (adjusted for inflation). Its grandeur is incomparable and its message is one we can all still relate to seventy-five years later: home is where the heart is.<br/><br/>GONE WITH THE WIND is based upon Margaret Mitchell's American civil war epic of the same name which was published in June 1936, a few years before the film was released. Mitchell and her book became an overnight sensation, selling one million copies by the end of December. Curiously, Mitchell's publishers hadn't forecasted high sales for the book based on the fact that it was priced at three dollars apiece (the average book price in 1936 was one dollar). This gives you some indication of the mania that swept America when Gone with the Wind was released in print. Also, it's important to keep in mind that during the summer of 1936, the Great Depression was at its height, and yet people still flocked to booksellers wanting to obtain their copy of Mitchell's bestseller. Once Hollywood studios caught wind of the novel's popularity, they each fumbled to secure the story's film rights in order to be able to adapt it for the screen. David O. Selznick eventually came out on top and immediately began casting the roles of what have now become legendary literary – and film - characters: Scarlett O'Hara, the novel's heroine; Rhett Butler, the exiled blockade runner; Mammy, Scarlett's indomitable maid; and Ashley Wilkes, the emotionally damaged civil war soldier. GONE WITH THE WIND tells the story of the American civil war through the eyes of the losing side: the south. The film begins by depicting the carefree, wealthy, and privileged lives of a group of prominent Southern plantation owners. In the days leading up to the Civil War, the south sincerely believed that they would emerge the victors against their foe in the north (the 'Yankees'). A war that everyone believed would be over in a month ended up lasting four years and brought the American south to its knees.<br/><br/>Through the strength and stamina of Tara, a once terribly spoiled Scarlett becomes the backbone of her family – and of the entire film, really – by persevering in the face of destruction and death. A woman who was once in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man promised to his cousin Melanie Wilkes (Olivia DeHavilland), has now realized that the only man she wants to spend her life with is daring blockade runner and philanderer Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). You see, Scarlett has now matured into a strong, unwavering woman and she has come to realize that her love for Ashley Wilkes was nothing but a schoolgirl infatuation. She needs someone who is equally as strong as she is now, and no one fits that bill better than Rhett Butler does.<br/><br/>Each character in GONE WITH THE WIND endures incredible hardships, from births to deaths, to famines and familial uproar and still each one – well, almost everyone – emerges at the end a stronger human being. Whether they're happy or not by the film's conclusion is another matter entirely but that perfectly illustrates how unpredictable life really is. No one is perfect and we each have our faults. A good chunk of credit for the film's endurance must be paid to the production's crew; people like director Victor Fleming, musical composer Max Steiner, costume designer Walter Plunkett, cinematographer Ernest Haller, and art director Lyle R. Wheeler all contributed to this movie's lasting appeal by creating a world in which dreams were made, crushed, and made again.<br/><br/>The film's cast is simply marvelous with each actor completely inhabiting his or her role: Vivien Leigh captures the steely determination of Scarlett with the lift of an eyebrow and the steadfast glare of a woman wronged, while Hattie McDaniel – the first black woman to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress – exudes love, devotion and warmth playing the pivotal role of the O'Hara maid, Mammy. Clark Gable, who was reluctant at first to accept the lead role of Rhett Butler, plays his part with gusto, determination and nonchalance. Beloved character actor Thomas Mitchell who plays O'Hara patriarch Gerald O'Hara is stalwart when he needs to be and heartbreakingly damaged when his character becomes emotionally shattered halfway through the film.<br/><br/>GONE WITH THE WIND is not the easiest film to watch. Its content, themes, and characterizations can be difficult to witness and hard to comprehend even for the most avid classic film fans among us, but it is certainly one worth seeing (again and again if you're up for it). Its epic tale and visual scenery will blow you away and you will be left breathless by the time the end credits roll. Trust us on this one: GONE WITH THE WIND is a film that will endure for many more lifetimes. It's magic, it's luxury on a grand scale, it's as majestic as any King or Queen yet it is at the same time revolting, disconcerting, and always emotionally draining. It's a film that has earned its title of the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/gone-with-the-wind"

","They don't make pictures like this anymore. There, I've said it. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. The artistic techniques to put a four hour seminal epic like ""Gone with the Wind"" on screen were quite different and limited back in the days, however the inventiveness to tell a great story and choose the right means was disproportionately higher - and it shows.<br/><br/>The brainchild of powerful producer David O. Selznick, the filmed version of Margaret Mitchell's best seller does nothing that hasn't been done before, but everything with utmost perfection and teems with high production values every way you look at it. The list of what ""Gone with the Wind"" lifts high above other films just goes on and on: There's of course that great story of the Old South dealing with a generation entangled in the throes of the American Civil War. This however is only the backdrop of one of the greatest romances of all time, which is not presented as sugar-coated, tear-jerking escapism, but as a wild clash of sexes through strong personalities, driven by egotism and vanity, mirroring the downfall of a whole civilization. The narration is shown in lush Technicolor cinematography, at key points composite storybook images are used with layers upon layers of painted images added to the shots in order to exude the required sense of drama and give it a fairy-tale, almost dreamlike quality. Hundreds of costumed extras fight and litter the street of dying men the heroine Scarlett walks through to give just one shining example, Max Steiner's score is grand and epic, and the cast headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is legendary as their sensual tension is deep and intensely felt by the viewer. In short: ""Gone with the Wind"" is a marvel of cinematic brilliance, and more. And to everyone who thinks otherwise: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

","Are you looking for a movie that's emotional and romantic yet still daring and exciting? Look no further than David O Selznick's ""Gone with the Wind"". Based on the novel of the same title by Margaret Mitchell, ""Gone with the Wind"" tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). Scarlett is furious when she finds out that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), the man she loves, is going to marry Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). The film follows Scarlett as she fights to win Ashley's love, ruining lives in the process. Another prominent character (and also my personal favourite!) is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), one of the many men in Scarlett's life.

"hall895","9","2","3","1 July 2011"," Beyond epic
","There are epic films...and then there's Gone with the Wind, the epic of all epics. This is a grand, monumental film. Its place in the history of motion pictures is secure. And so is its place in the hearts of so many millions who have enjoyed it all these years. Many movies are enjoyed. Few are truly cherished. This is one of those few. As new generations continue to discover the film Gone with the Wind just rolls on. It's a movie which will never die. After all, tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>Who, in 1939, could have imagined as immense an undertaking as what Gone with the Wind would prove to be was even possible? One man could, producer David O. Selznick. He had the audacity to believe he could pull something like this off and by sheer force of will he did it. He went through multiple directors, multiple writers, and a seemingly endless stream of potential Scarlett O'Haras. It was a production unlike anything Hollywood had ever seen, epic in every way. Somehow Selznick managed to pull it all together. Risk big, win big. Gone with the Wind was a monumental risk, it was either going to be an epic disaster or an epic triumph, there was no in between. What a triumph it would turn out to be.<br/><br/>The love affair between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is at the heart of Gone with the Wind but the film is so much more than that. It's a long, circuitous journey for Scarlett before she eventually finds herself in Rhett's arms. And what a fascinating journey it is. Scarlett O'Hara is quite simply one of the greatest characters in film history. From the film's opening moments, the sweetness of ""Fiddle-dee-dee"", all the way to the end Scarlett evolves, grows and changes right before our eyes. She discovers an inner strength, a bravery and resolve she didn't know she had. Along the way, she certainly has her missteps. Her drive and determination lead her to do some things which are unkind at best. And the undying affection she has for the man she truly loves, who is not Rhett Butler, will cause nothing but heartache for all involved. But for whatever foibles she may have you can't help but root for Scarlett O'Hara. Even if you don't mind seeing her get her comeuppance now and again. The ups and downs of Scarlett's life make for one of the most compelling stories ever seen.<br/><br/>Part of what makes Scarlett such a great, memorable character is of course the performance of Vivien Leigh. Perfect. Utterly perfect. One of the greatest performances in the history of film. Scarlett grows and evolves and Leigh traces the journey perfectly throughout. From Leigh's first moment on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Her stunning beauty is immediately obvious. Her immense talent would reveal itself as the story plays out. Of course Leigh is not the only great performer on display. If you can't imagine anyone but Leigh as Scarlett the same can be said for Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, a true Hollywood legend in a role which suits him absolutely perfectly. There's also the brilliant Olivia de Havilland playing the incredibly good-hearted Melanie, a character who serves as a wonderful counterbalance to the at-times self-centered Scarlett. She may not be as glamorous as Scarlett but it's easy to see why any man who came to know her would fall in love with the wonderfully devoted Melanie. Which brings us to Ashley Wilkes. He marries Melanie and he no doubt loves her. But he has feelings for Scarlett too, trying to deny that would be useless. And Scarlett has more than feelings for him, she has an obsession. Leslie Howard plays Ashley and one minor nitpick with the film is that Howard is probably too old for the role. His performance is fine, he just doesn't fit his part perfectly as Leigh, Gable and de Havilland do theirs. There are plenty of supporting players who add a great deal to the film. Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and Harry Davenport are just a few of the key performers in the generally excellent supporting cast which helps to bring this great story to life.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is a movie of two halves. The first half, set against the backdrop of the Civil War is probably more dramatic. There's not as much action in the second half but there is plenty to appreciate in this part of the film as well as Scarlett and Rhett finally come together. It's a movie which manages to hold you spellbound for nearly four hours. No small achievement that. The story is wonderfully compelling and it's performed beautifully by the stellar cast. The film looks utterly fabulous, a real Technicolor marvel. The sets and costumes do so much in helping to tell this story, transporting us back to the Old South. Max Steiner's music is another perfectly fitted piece in David O. Selznick's mammoth puzzle. Selznick brought it all together to create a brilliant film which in its day was a monumental achievement and which to this day is still absolutely beloved. A timeless classic which will live forever."

","THIS IS ONE of those films that everyone seems to have seen at least once. Afterall, it is very highly rated on everybody's lists of top 100 films. (It does seem to make it on most top 10 ratings also.) The reasons for this are really quite obvious and consequently, little thought, discussion or debate. This is a pity, for putting any work of art should never e exempted from debate, re-examination and, hence, potentially a revision in how we think of it in relationship to us and to Film History.<br/><br/>WITH RESPECT TO ""GWTW"" and its ranking in various categories, there would appear to be some fluctuation in its ranking.

The sum of all of these equal much more than those taken individually.<br/><br/>CATEGORY # 2. As SOAP OPERA, it again rates up there. We vote it the very undisputed all time winner in this slot. There is a Lion's share of extra curricular activity going on; although its depiction is more suppressed and implied, it's explicit, nonetheless.<br/><br/>CATEGORY # 3. Tops as an example of Character Driven drama it is superb. Tgis is no small feat when one considers that the backdrop of the story is The American Civil War and that period following it, known in American History as the Reconstruction.<br/><br/>CATEGORY # 4. As far as its rating as a HISTORICAL DRAMA, it would fall somewhere in the middle; not because it doesn't portray the horrors of war, but rather because for reasons of omission. In the book, there is extensive mention of the rise of and subsequent underground activities of the Ku Klux Klan. In the screen adaptation, the Klan is never mentioned, there are no hooded horsemen. That sequence where Captain Rhett Butler uses the ruse of returning a gun shot bearing Ashley Wilkes home under the pretense of their being all drunken disorderly and having been at a house of ill repute (also never mentioned by name) was the only incident mentioned. It was referred to as the raid on a shanty town near Atlanta.<br/><br/>ONCE SOMEONE ASKED Buster Keaton which was a better picture, GONE WITH THE WIND or Mr. Keaton's own THE GENERAL (Schenck/United Artists, 1927).

","The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.I've never seen such a kind of classic film. The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droopingly beautiful Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-life as ""poor white trash"", and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way."

","There's very little to say about ""Gone With the Wind,"" that hasn't already been said a million times before. Nevertheless, it is excellent, probably one of the best films of all time. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and how she deals with a long-time struggle trying to get the man she loves (Ashley, played by Leslie Howard) to fall in love with her, unaware that the whole time she is actually falling in love with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the tough-yet-romantic character who she thought would never appeal to her. Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast here, in an Oscar-winning role in this Best Picture of 1939. She makes the character of Scarlett believable and lovable, despite the over-controlling and selfish nature she often possesses. Gable was robbed of an Oscar here, as he plays one of the most engaging, tough, and fun characters ever seen on film, delivering one great line after another (down to his famous ""Frankly, my dear...""). The supporting cast, particularly Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, is perfect, and really makes the film. It's a long film, over four hours long, yet those four hours fly by as you get caught up in the drama and fascinating story of Scarlett. It's truly a classic and one film movie lovers cannot miss. Very close to perfection, composed of one great scene after another.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","This is one of the most beautiful films of all-time. Gone with the Wind is a classic and forever will be! Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, and she is the only actress that could play this part, she was one of the most gorgeous women of her time. Clark Gable is not too shabby himself, he is near perfect as Rhett Butler. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett is red hot, and when they get snippy with each other, they sizzle with hatred and smoldering intensity. This is one film everyone and I MEAN everyone must see in his or her lifetime. The score is dramatic and full of life, the acting is absolutely astounding, and the story is pure magic.

Maybe because it encompasses all the states of human soul: love and hate, happiness and pain, tenacity and weakness, enthusiasm and disappointment, compassion and indifference, honor and dishonor, sincerity and hypocrisy, wealth and poverty, ability and inability, courage and fear, desperation and hope. And the series could continue. A series as complex as human existence. A movie of success and fails. A movie from which everyone can choose their own way forward in life.

","Producer David O. Selznick must have known in advance that 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' would become the highest-grossing motion picture ever made. He purchased the rights to Margaret Mitchell's bestselling novel for an unprecedented $50,000, heaped a truckload of money into the project and exhausted the efforts of no less than three directors  Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood and possibly a few others, including William Cameron Menzies and B. Reeves Eason. Such was Selznick's passion for the project that he is typically credited as the prime architect of the film's success, a definitive exception to the auteur theory  unless, of course, one simply considers Selznick to be the auteur. The extravagance of the production is instantly recognised in the film's elaborate costume and set design, in addition to Ernest Haller's sweeping epic cinematography. If it weren't for such lavishness, the picture might easily have vanished into the background as a stuffy, overwrought melodrama; but film-making of this magnitude leaves a considerable imprint on one's memory, and audiences have come to epitomise 'Gone with the Wind' as the embodiment of Hollywood's Golden Age.<br/><br/>The most exciting acts of the story, which was adapted by Sidney Howard from Mitchell's novel, take place during the Civil War, when the triumphant Yankees are marching towards Atlanta, casting an ominous shadow over the ill-fated city. The grandiose scope of the photography  the seemingly-endless sprawl of wounded soldiers, the desperate last-minute dash past the blazing munitions factory  would go unrivalled until the late 1950s, when David Lean discovered the widescreen camera. Clarke Gable was the fans' only choice for the role of the roguish but noble Rhett Butler, but it's Scarlett O'Hara whom I find most interesting, even if I disliked her more and more as the film progressed. The 1930s was very much a decade of change in how women were portrayed in cinema, with actresses such as Mae West ('I'm No Angel (1933)') and Bette Davis ('Dark Victory (1939)') achieving success as smart, independent characters, shifting away from the notion of the ""damsel in distress."" Scarlett, a role eventually given to unknown Vivien Leigh, was the apex of the independent woman  so independent, in fact, that she could never be happy in love with a man.<br/><br/>The film has a fascinatingly-ambivalent relationship with its main protagonist, Scarlett O'Hara. She is obviously a very strong female character, and her resourcefulness and enterprise in difficult times is justly-celebrated however, at what price? In order to spite the Yankees for destroying her way of life, Scarlett essentially becomes those whom she holds in such contempt, surrendering any remaining traces of honour or integrity. There's no doubt that she commits damnable atrocities, often at the expense of those who love her, but the film can't quite bring itself to hate her  the audience is left suspended in midstream, presented with a wolf in sheep's clothing, but nonetheless expected to celebrate the clothing for its practicality and expediency. Conversely, Melanie Hamilton (the lovely Olivia de Havilland) embodies kindness and selflessness, but she is inevitably doomed to a premature death, perhaps a product of her inability to adapt to this new lifestyle. In the gritty aftermath of the American Civil War, the kind and decent are condemned to an uneasy demise, whereas the crass, opportunistic Scarlett lives to greet another day.<br/><br/>The film should have ended with Clarke Gable's immortal parting words, a fade to black as his figure disappears forever into the mist, with our selfish and unprincipled anti-heroine having finally received her comeuppance, three times filled and running over. After stopping at nothing to obtain what she wants, Scarlett ultimately finds that she has been chasing an illusion, and, in the meantime, she has pushed away all that she still holds dear in this world, the one man who potentially offered her a lifetime of happiness. But, alas, Selznick had a lot of money riding on this picture, and it certainly would not have done to disappoint the ladies in the audience. Instead, the film concludes with Scarlett's optimistic epitaph  ""after all, tomorrow is another day!""  implying that she may eventually win Rhett back, or, at least, that she'll never stop trying. Whether I want her to succeed is an entirely different matter. Scarlett is almost the female equivalent of Tim Holt's George Amberson-Minafer, arrogant and thoroughly deserving of a comeuppance, and neither deserved a happy ending, regardless of whether or not the studio provided one."
"HelloTexas11","7","2","3","15 April 2008"," the ultimate chick flick?
","So what can you say about 'Gone With The Wind' that hasn't blah blah blah... I don't know for certain, but I'll try. How about it's the grandmama (as opposed to granddaddy) of all chick flicks? I think it is. I watched it for the first time in years the other night and although it's still terribly familiar, I was able to pick up on some things with a fresh perspective. I've never understood why Scarlett O'Hara is considered in some circles to be an 'admirable' character. Maybe 'enviable' because of her gorgeous appearance, which is how most of the other females in the film seem to feel about her. But she's spoiled rotten, enjoys being spoiled rotten, and apparently her sole ambition in life is to go on being spoiled rotten. The admirable things she does at various points in the movie- shooting a marauding soldier, delivering a baby- she only does because she absolutely has to, and she hates having to do them. Or, to put it another way, Scarlett only does them because she can't be bothered with the alternative. Make no mistake, she is a fascinating character and Vivien Leigh is cast to perfection as her, but it's frightening to think a couple of generations of girls might have considered her a role model of sorts. There is an intrinsic dopiness to 'Gone With The Wind' that all the wonderful sets and beautiful costumes can't conceal. In fact, sometimes those costumes seem to be more what the film's about than the story itself. The film is a Selznick Production, but it has the look and feel of a top-shelf MGM flick. And as with every major MGM production of the time, there has to be an overriding theme, a heavy-handed moral to be taken from the film, and in this case, it is that Scarlett learns to love the land as her father did. Which she does. But nobody buys it, in fact her final words are barely remembered. Most people think, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" is the last line in the movie. Just like most people remember the green dress above everything else. There are some undeniably powerful scenes in 'Gone With The Wind' (at over three and a half hours, there had better be) and some funny ones, and Clark Gable is perfect too as Rhett Butler, rogue, reprobate, and all-around Southern Cavalier. To me, one frustrating aspect of his character, or I should say everyone's reaction to his character, is that he is forever speaking blunt truths and common sense and nobody seems to hear him. Certainly Scarlett doesn't. Likewise, his warnings early on about the South's chances in the upcoming Civil War go unheeded. One wonders why he hangs around with people who treat him like a cad, a liar, a man with no honor when he's actually the most honorable person in the movie, with the possible exception of Melanie Hamilton. Now there's a ingeniously thought out character- Melanie. She provides poetic justice for Scarlett. Nothing Scarlett says can rile her; in fact she takes every hateful, venomous uttering from Scarlett and turns it around into something wonderful. It is almost a running gag that the meaner Scarlett is to Melanie, the more forgiving and admiring Melanie becomes of Scarlett. The scenes of death and destruction in Atlanta are memorable, including the famous long shot of the dead and wounded soldiers lying in the main street. The torturous soap opera that makes up the second half of the film will see male viewers rapidly losing interest, as it begins to resemble a 1930's version of 'Dynasty.' Even Rhett Butler's character lacks purpose for a long stretch, and his increasingly pointless upbraiding of Scarlett and her shortcomings becomes tiresome. She will never change and he begins to look foolish in thinking anything he says will make a difference.<br/><br/>There obviously was no scrimping on any aspect of production for 'Gone With The Wind,' and the film succeeds in dazzling the eye throughout, whether it be a soiree at the plantation or Atlanta being set afire. Too many of the images have a 'glamor shot' feel to them, such as an early one where Scarlett's father runs after her in front of the mansion; it fairly screams ""look at her dress!"" There is a constant tug-of-war between such scenes and meatier aspects of the story. Again, given the film's great length, there is plenty of room for both, 'something for everyone' as the saying goes and it certainly is a classic of its kind. Still, it says something about both 'Gone With The Wind' and its loyal audience over the years that its most fondly recalled image is of Scarlett wearing a green gown made from the living room drapes."
"highwaytourist","10","2","3","1 January 2008"," Still pure gold after all these years
","After all this time, this is still (according to many) the greatest motion picture ever made. The making of the film proved that the success wasn't guaranteed. It's filled with memorable lines and images, and gives us flesh-and-blood, complex heroes who aren't perfect, yet keep us cheering them as they go on through hardships they never imagined they'd face. All of this is set against great spectacle and even some ingenious special effects, (the production looks more lavish than it is, due to clever trick photography in some scenes). The fact that people still talk and rave about this story shows that it still stands the test of time. Acting, music, production, photography, and script are all outstanding. It never ceases to be entertaining, and even the outdated attitudes about some aspects of race can be forgiven, as they were consistent with the novel and the time that the story takes place in. And, in spite of lasting four hours, it's never ceases to grip the audience. This film is always worth a look, even if you've seen it before."

","Most reviewers note that GWTW is the greatest film ever made. I heartily agree. Some feel that Scarlet is offensive, spoiled, etc. I must say ""Hold on there."" The story opens on a carefree TEENAGE girl flirting with the boys. She is 16. She is the pampered oldest daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. This 16 year old dreams of love just as any normal 16 year old does. She has no idea what ""love"" is really. She has a crush on Ashley because he is such a gentleman, kind and gracious. Who wouldn't? She is then thrust into the turmoil of war. Everything she does in the first half of the movie, until the war really comes to her in Atlanta, is the behavior of a teenager. Just sit back after she returns to Tara and watch her grow into a formidable responsible business woman. If you look at her from the point of view as an unfinished teenager at the start of the film you can't help but feel for her. You can't help but grow to LOVE her. GWTW is Scarlet. You can't hate Scarlet AND love the movie. It's impossible.<br/><br/>Favorite quotes: Pork: ""Askin' ain't getting'."" And Scarlet: ""Whenever I'm wearing a new bonnet, all the numbers I ever knew go smack outta my head."" I use these quotes frequently."

","The story that spawned the story would make a scathing parody of what goes behind the making of a movie that had, years before its inception as a blockbuster, gone hyped out of control. Margaret Mitchell could have never envisioned her attempt at writing would create one of the most memorable movies of the last century. After all, all she did was write on a dare while recovering from a broken ankle, mainly for her own amusement.<br/><br/>The explosion that followed would be on a similar not as to what has happened with books such as ""The Da Vinci Code"" (although the movie didn't fare too well, despite being a good adaptation of a convoluted tale of quasi-hermetic conspiracies for a darker purpose). Coming out in 1936, it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize which in turn caught Hollywood's eye, already an industry noted for recreating movie versions of books both of its time and classic novels.<br/><br/>And with this, the ""legendary search"" for who would play Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell's spitfire (pardon the cliché) heroine. The story is rife with intrigue itself -- everyone but ZaZu Pitts was on the roster, generating a whirlwind of publicity of gigantic proportions. (This, in itself, brought with it a new age in entertainment: that of the media frenzy circling on a specific event or celebrity.) Of course, little did they all know that the actress slated to play Scarlett was already hand-picked, and as much as Norma Shearer, married to the convenience of Irving Thalberg, was in negotiations, or as much as Bette Davis wanted the role (having to remain content with her own version in JEZEBEL, itself quite a formidable classic), or that Tallulah Bankhead and Miriam Hopkins were indeed from the South, or that Paulette Goddard came ""this close"" to bag the role in her pocket, the role was undoubtedly Vivien Leigh's. And this is the role for which Vivien has been remembered to this day in her all-too-brief career.<br/><br/>Repercussions of a less-reported, but culturally significant nature also can be seen throughout the finished product that is GONE WITH THE WIND. Blacks, up until 1939, had been seen only as in bit parts and the occasional supporting role such as in BABY FACE and IMITATION OF LIFE. (They would still be practically unseen until the Fifties when Sidney Poitier would come along, so it shows that changes didn't happen overnight.) The inclusion of black actors in larger roles that instead of being ornaments and lounge singers were part of the plot -- even if it was in what we today see as ""stereotypical"" roles -- was, for the times and posterior years, groundbreaking. It's ignited intense debates on how the character of Mammy (portrayed by Oscar-winner Hattie MacDaniel in her first and only landmark win over Olivia DeHaviland who while playing the much more understated role had years of a lucrative career ahead of her) was positive or negative, but for starters, at least she carried entire scenes with one or several of the leads, which meant baby steps. The same can be said for Butterfly McQueen who has equal amount of participation in GONE WITH THE WIND even as her character was underwritten and McQueen's own acting style did not allay any misconceptions of the dim-witted servant. I personally believe -- as a gay man living in a country that still has a ways to go in terms of full acceptance -- that it's best to have some form of representation rather than none at all.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? I'd say it is... it's too well-done for its time. It's gone into our public consciousness with Rhett Butler's final quote to Scarlett and Scarlett's own two famous lines, ""...as God as my witness I'll never be hungry again,"" and ...""tomorrow is another day."" Its score practically lives within our DNA. Scarlett's own character is, while a historical romance heroine, closer to the types of ladies which existed in Pre-Code Hollywood. Her behavior alone is at times unsympathetic, even flat-out selfish and deceitful, but proto-feminist in the way a woman with no means to survival would have to be. It's been one of the most-watched films of the last century and probably will be in the coming future. Even overriding its MGM gloss, it's a fascinating movie, ferocious entertainment, and simply put, one of the greatest."

","I saw a show about the writing of this film before I ever even saw it. Besides that, I naturally has heard of it, about it, and praise for it millions of times. It is considered a classic by all. The seeing of the show about the writing made my 'need-to-see' at highest.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. This film is beautiful. Not only is it amazing in it's beauty, but it's amazing in the fact that it really is a pointless film altogether- Yet it is definitely an undisputed classic in my mind forever now. I will probably buy the DVD.<br/><br/>It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled, selfish, and stuck-up girl in the South who finds herself caught in the middle of the Civil War. She spends her life yearning and doing whatever she has to in order to get whatever she wants. She lies, slaps, and acts like a promiscuous girl throughout- yet she never gives up. The one thing that may save her is Rhett Butler, a bad soul himself who loves her- and may be the best man for her.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh gives one of history's greatest performance as Scarlett. She captures the character completely and does something even more impressive: She makes us feel for her. Then there's the incredible Clark Gable as Rhett, the secretly tormented man. He's brilliant, as usual. Of other particular notice is Olivia de Havilland as Scarlett's one true friend, Melanie. She is easily the most lovable character in the film. Just beautiful, providing an exact image of everything Scarlett could be.<br/><br/>Yes, it's amazing that this film is as well-liked as it is. Perhaps, though, it's not so surprising after all. It's a beautiful story about two people who are absolutely horrible, and yet will steal your heart every time. The story goes on for almost four hours, and it seems hopeless at times for Scarlett. Yet she keeps moving on. She never gives up. That's really what the movie is about. To quote: ""Tomorrow is another day!"" A classic, indeed! 9/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

There's never been another like her. Clark Gable also proved perfect casting as Rhett Butler, Scarlett's equal, although she realizes this way too late. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar for her indelible turn as Mammy, a slave but one who really runs the household and keeps Scarlett in line.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not the greatest film ever made and maybe, in this age of digital technology, the special effects are starting to look a little creaky, but GWTW remains sweeping entertainment.

"robmeister","9","2","3","19 June 2006"," A 4-Hour Chick Flick for Any Movie Fan
","""Gone With the Wind"" is a film about which so much has been written, it made me think ""What could I say about this movie that hasn't been said before?"" Well, in a year that gave us ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Wuthering Heights"", ""Stagecoach"", and ""Ninotchka"", this is the movie that many say is the best film to come from the best year of film. All of the other movies I mentioned here (as well a couple more) were nominated for Best Picture of 1939, and I have seen each of them (except ""Ninotchka""). ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" told a heartfelt tale of an educator and the lives he touched during his tenure at a boys' school. ""Wuthering Heights"" was a sweeping romance with a memorable performance by Sir Laurence Olivier. ""Stagecoach"" had action and thrills under the deft direction of John Ford, while becoming a star-maker for a man known as The Duke. And ""The Wizard of Oz"" is quite possibly the most magical film of all time, immortalizing Judy Garland as the young Dorothy Gale and influencing nearly every fantasy film made ever since. And let us not forget some of the other memorable films released that year, like ""Gunga Din"", ""Beau Geste"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". <br/><br/>So, what is it about ""Gone With the Wind"" that makes it stand above the rest of the best? Was it because it was in color? No. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was also in color (well, mostly). Was it Clark Gable's signature performance as Rhett Butler? Interestingly, despite the fact he was practically the only (and obvious) choice for the role, no. He didn't win Best Actor this time around (it was his third nomination in five years); that honor went to Mr. Chips himself, Robert Donat. What about Victor Fleming's direction? Well, he did take home the Oscar, but he was also one of three men to helm this movie. Was it the script, the sets, the cinematography? Again, all very well done. And, though this may not the first film to that comes to mind, ""Gone With the Wind"" was a ground-breaker in visual effects, as it was one of the first movies to make extensive use of matte paintings for both interior and exterior sets, and to great effect. And let's not forget the ""Burning of Atlanta"" sequence. As many people know, this was done on the old RKO Studios backlot by burning down old sets (Did you know that the final structure shown in this scene was the gate to Kong's lair in ""King Kong""?). With clever editing and visual mixing, the result is frighteningly effective.<br/><br/>But enough about the big picture (so to speak). What is it about ""Gone With the Wind"" that makes it stand out? To be sure, it was everything I have mentioned to this point, with one more ingredient thrown in to ""kick it up a notch"". Enter Vivien Leigh. After an exhaustive world-wide search for the right actress to play Scarlett O'Hara, she was the one who won the part. And she was the one took home the Oscar, too. As the conniving, bitchy, manipulative, money-hungry, débutante who wears her heart on her sleeve for the wrong man, Vivien Leigh delivers a performance unlike any ever seen before and few have delivered since. And, as Rhett Butler, Clark Gable gives us a rogue, a scalawag, and a mercenary, while also a gentleman, a romantic, and a doting father. I seriously doubt that any other man could have pulled it off (though Timothy Dalton did try years later on TV -- But that's another story). The end result is a mixture of some of the best on-screen chemistry ever concocted.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a wonderful job here, too. From Olivia de Havilland to Leslie Howard to the first Black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel, many of the performances of ""Gone With the Wind"" are both memorable and well-cast, with one or two exceptions. For example, I thought Carroll Nye had the look and attitude of Frank Kennedy (Scarlett's second husband), but I didn't feel his performance was all that convincing. By the way, if you are a fan of the old ""Superman"" TV series, look for George Reeves as one of the Tarleton twins (he's Stuart) at the beginning of the movie. Sure, it's a chick flick. Yes, it's four hours long. But if you call yourself a movie fan, even in passing, then ""Gone With the Wind"" deserves a viewing!"

It doesn't feature any battle scenes just focuses on those who aren't fighting in the war.<br/><br/>The movie's all about Scralet who's a wealthy girl who'll go through a lot of hard situations through this movie.

Here are the reasons why I think it is THE perfect movie: Cast- The cast gives perfect performances that makes this movie memorable. Clark Gable is Rhett Butler, the role that seems made JUST for him. Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett O'Hara, deserved the Best Actress Oscar. Leslie Howard is excellent as Ashley Wilkes, the man that Scarlett loves. Olivia deHavilland plays Melanie, the kind-hearted woman who always thinks of others before herself, perfectly. Hattie McDaniel gives a awesome performance as Scarlett's strong-willed servant.<br/><br/>Direction- Victor Fleming (THE WIZARD OF OZ), along with uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood, directs his cast superbly, making you believe in the characters.<br/><br/>There are many more reasons to list,including Sidney Howard's script(based on Margaret Mitchell's novel), Max Steiner's wonderful music, and the awe-inspiring sets and costumes.

","The highest grossing movie of all time depicting a tortured love-affair in the midst of one of history's most tragic times. No, it is not Titanic! It is Gone with the Wind. The story begins in the Old South on the eve of the Civil War. Our indomitable heroine Scarlett O'Hara is a coquette belle living an idyllic life in her daddy's plantation called Tara. She professes her love to her man-of-desire Ashley Wilkes who already belongs to the wholesome Melanie. Scarlett schemes her way to win Ashley's love, but the more she does, the more it backfires. The film takes us on her journey of struggle against the consequences of the war which leads to her stormy love affair with dashing scallywag Rhett Butler. This turbulent romance is one for the books full of fiery sparks. Leigh gives one hell of a performance as one of cinema's most recognizable movie heroines. She is petulant, vain, and spiteful. But we love her, relate to her, and we care for her. Gable, de Havilland, and the rest of the cast deliver noteworthy performances but this is Leigh's show. With an unforgettable musical score, lavish sets, prodigious display of imagery, exquisite costumes, and most importantly, countless scenes offering maximum dramatic impact all combine to give ample entertainment for all. A true classic!"
"wright7700","10","2","3","27 November 2005"," Deserves its Legendary Status
","This film is a complicated tale of two intertwined families against the backdrop of the Civil War. Having recently read Margaret Mitchell's original novel, I believe that the film is a loyal attempt to cover her legendary work. While GWTW clocks in at about 4 hours in length, the movie necessarily leaves out many characters (Dilcie, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen, Wade & Ella-Scarlett's first two children) who were important in the book. It is understandable why David O Selznick et al had to pick and choose what to include. Wade and Ella in the novel made Scarlett seem like an unfit mother, and that would lessen sympathy and support for Vivien Leigh with the public. Commerical success could not be risked.<br/><br/>The Oscars for the movie proved interesting. According to my research, that awful (unattractive) Bette Davis almost beat our Vivien Leigh for the ""Best Actress"" trophy in 1939. Clark Gable apparently didn't want to be Rhett Butler and did not lobby for an Oscar enough, having one earlier in the 1930's. Gable came in at least third behind Robert Donat (winner-Mr Chips) and Jimmy Stewart. The Rhett Butler in the book was more severe, dangerous, jealous, and frankly more appealing.<br/><br/>It is interesting that little info survives about relations between Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland. Miss de Havilland, now retired to Paris, is apparently a class act and grants few interviews. She has outlived her other major costars by almost 40 years at this point.<br/><br/>Every American should study this film."

It's just amazing to see everything that goes on. It's hard for someone to really dislike Scarlet even though she does really stupid things throughout the whole movie. I am such a huge fan of the movie. I know everything there is to know about the movie. Granted the book is a lot better, but it's also over 1,000 pages. Which for some is too much reading, but it's well worth it. It goes into much more detail and explains a lot more. The movie is very true to the book so you aren't missing too much. But there is a lot to be learned in the book it's self, well worth the read. Needless to say this really is the greatest movie ever made. If you haven't seen it go see it. And if you don't want to because it's 3 hours and 55 minutes long, get over it, it's a beautiful movie. The slavery part really sucks you have to realize it's there, it's part of history that cannot be ignored. The the story line isn't all about slavery, it's a love story that can't be missed. So go see the movie everyone will love it."

Not to mention that it was the very first blockbuster. No movie before this one (or since) has played for so long and had so many come backs and revivals. Gone With The Wind was a pioneer in Film making and It will always be remembered when such films as Lord of The Rings(#12) and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind(#32) are long forgotten. It is a classic Tale and one the any person can relate to on some level or in some facet.

","It's the yardstick by which all other film epics are judged, and after 65 years ""Gone With The Wind"" still remains Hollywood's most fully realized super production, a brilliant one-of-a-kind meeting of perfect casting, great acting, superb direction (by a number of hands), magnificently photographed Technicolor tableau and possibly the most romantic music score ever composed for a movie. Sidney Howard's screen adaptation expertly distilled Margaret Mitchell's rambling, compulsively readable novel into a concise 3 hour, 40 minute running time that amazingly captured all of the novel's dramatic high points. ""Gone with The Wind"" is obviously the reel version of the American Civil War as opposed to the real thing but as entertainment it is an unparalleled achievement in cinematic storytelling. Since its release in 1939 very few films of its kind have matched it in sweep and spectacle.<br/><br/>""Gone with The Wind"" does show its age : its special effects look downright quaint to 21st century eyes but in its inexorable depiction of a particular American War and Peace it is unforgettable."
"paptwin","10","2","3","24 April 2004"," a movie made before it's time
","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Even the making of the movie was turned into a 2 hour documentry. The drama of this movie did not start on the screen nor with the finished picture. it started when they did a search for the perfect actress to play Scarlett. Though many auditioned there was only one scarlett and that was Vivien Leigh. Even the part of Rhett Butler could have been played by no one else than Clark Gable. Olivia De haviland as Melony, Leslie Howard as The weak Ashley only added more lustre to this superb movie. How these actors and actresses made a movie that had no official script, directors and producers that were changed regulary is a real credit to all the cast of this movie.<br/><br/>I say that this is the greatest movie of all time, for it has romance, drama, a battle of will between the sex's and so much more. Would we all have that fighting spirit that Scarlett had when her beloved south and way of life was destroyed? Could we all say those famous words "" Tomorrow is another day"" and survive. Some may say it is a bit corny and out dated, and that movies like Titanic and other blockbusters are far better with there elaborate sets, and special affects. <br/><br/>Gone With the Wind helped make movie making what it is today."

I didn't see this movie until I was in my 30's and cannot believe that it took me so long to get to it. One of the few movies that is even close to the same league as the book in which it was based. I can sit through the entire viewing without a break, and then watch it again.  Being immersed in Northern History, I was not familiar with the southern way of life or the southern war effort.

"mbginok","10","2","3","29 February 2004"," An American Classic
","I completely and totally disagree with the previous reviewers comments regarding ""Gone With The Wind.""  This is a film which beautifully portrays a time in our history of great selfishness and over-indulgence.  Isn't that what the Civil War was all about?  A war fought by Americans that sought to curb the abhorrent, but selfish nature of slavery. The screenplay is replete with scene after scene of clever and witty banter amongst characters which were written to be overblown, caricatures of the Southerners they represented.  But the actors soften their edges and bring them to a fully realized persona.  Mammy, as portrayed by Hattie McDaniel, is funny, clever, brave, and utterly believable.  Vivian Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara is absolutely delightful as she takes the character from her late teens through late 30's.  She is coy/sassy/brave/dependent/independent on demand, throughout the movie.  Olivia DeHaviland, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Butterfly McQueen, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, Ona Munson, and Laura Hope Crews as Aunt Pittypat are all completely enjoyable and believable in their characters. ""Gone With The Wind,"" directed by Victor Fleming, is an absolutely delightful movie that brings to life a long forgotten America.  It is an absolute ""10"" and will continue to 'play well' for decades and decades to follow."

Any movie over 3 hours can burn someone, but I found Gone With The Wind still keeping me on my couch. <br/><br/>
It's not a thriller, not an action though it has some action and violent scenes.  This movie is sad, nostalgic and enjoyable.  <br/><br/>I found this movie has many valid themes that are still important today in society, which makes this film also another one to watch."
"clydestuff","10","2","3","11 February 2004"," Despite the epic grandeur, Gone With The Wind is still a performance driven film
","When I was very young, my parents would often load her eight kids into the car to see a double feature at the drive-in.  Occasionally, we were able to go to the matinee at a walk-in theater, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  There was only one occasion that I recall my mother having ventured into a regular movie theater.  That time was during a re-release of Gone With The Wind.  I knew that for her to do something so out of the ordinary would take an extraordinary event.  Because it was her all time favorite film which she had often spoken of, there was no doubt that Gone With The Wind was an exceptional film in her eyes.  The question that remains is whether it would be such a prodigious event for me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed my first viewing of Gone With The Wind.  It didn't bore me.  Yet, I hardly remember it being unforgettable which is understandable when you're thirteen years old.  I tried reading Margaret Mitchell's novel once and believe I made it more than half way through.  It was not until years later after having viewed the film several more times that I began to appreciate the epic grandeur of Selznick's film.<br/><br/>Many have classified Gone With The Wind as a love story told against the backdrop of the Civil War.   I think that is an oversimplification.  Though, there is a love story involved, this is strictly a film about a woman, who happens to want a man she can't have, but ends up with those men who suit her purpose to further her needs.  <br/><br/>Scarlett O'Hara is on the surface, a spoiled rich Southern belle.  In the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, we find her conniving schemes to corral Ashley Wilkes almost humorous.   As the film progresses, and the brutality of the Civil War and its aftermath, envelop the South,   we see changes take place in Scarlett as well.  As she matures into womanhood, Scarlett remains the conniving schemer, but becomes an extremely complex character also.  Until the war, her conniving is strictly that of a lovesick teenager.  After the war her schemes are those of a woman hardened by the brutality of a vicious war, and her plans serve a distinct and powerful purpose.  We may not agree with what she does or how she does it, but we understand her motivations.<br/><br/>To bring Scarlett to life on the screen, Selznick chose Vivien Leigh. Whether it was pure luck or fate it doesn't matter.  I can think of no other actress who could have possibly fitted the role as well as Leigh does.   If I had to name the top ten performances by an actress in a film ever, Leigh would certainly be in the top ten if not at the top of the list.<br/><br/>Rhett Butler is the male version of Scarlett in many ways.  At one point in the film Rhett brings this fact up himself. `Because we're alike - bad lots both of us, selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names', he states.  He loves Scarlett, yet for most of the film she is out of his reach.  Only when it suits her purposes, does Scarlett give in to him.  She marries him not for love but for fun.  She may indeed love Rhett, because she is stubborn and self-centered, Scarlett can't acknowledge it.  Just as Vivien Leigh is the only actress I can picture as Scarlett, Clark Gable is the definitive Rhett.  There is no denying the chemistry between Rhett and Scarlett when these two great actors are on the screen together.  I have seen many of Gable's films, and have never seen him as good as he is in Gone With The Wind.<br/><br/>If the film has one flaw for me in the acting department, it's Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes.  Although Ashley is a noble character, he is weak and wishy washy.  He is unable to tell Scarlett his true feelings one way or the other, yet is able to fight nobly for the Confederacy.  Howard manages to convey the indecisiveness and the weaknesses of the character, yet he fails to do anything to have us believe there is a reason why someone as strong willed as Scarlett might find him remotely attractive.<br/><br/>Melanie Hamilton Wilkes epitomizes the example of pure goodness and greatness that one could only hope to achieve in life.  Yet, she sees in Scarlett a zest for living that seems to be unattainable to herself. Because of this and the fact that she finds it difficult to find the evil in anyone, Melanie is blinded to Scarlett's love for Ashley.  Olivia de Havilland gives us a Melanie every bit as real as Rhett and Scarlett.<br/><br/>Of all the characters in Gone With The Wind, Mammy is the one who is shrewd enough and smart enough to see everyone for what they really are.   It is a fact that continually infuriates Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel's  Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of  Mammy may be the most deserving of all.  When she is on the screen, her presence overshadows that of even Leigh.<br/><br/>For all of Selznick's attention to detail, for all the grandeur of the Southern Plantations, for the incredible scenes of the burning of Atlanta and the long back wards crane shot of the thousands of wounded soldier lying in the streets, without the complex characters, and the incredible performances by the actors to portray them, Gone With The Wind would quite possibly have never achieved the historical significance that it has.  It is this fact that makes it a great film. <br/><br/>My Grade A+"
"fhildebrand","Null","2","3","13 January 2004"," Great FILM WITH SOME FLAWS
","IMHO this is an great and exciting film! But surely not because of the political ideology of these movie. It is the character of Scarlett O'Hara, which is so intriguing! She in in the center of the storm from the beginning of the story! Raised as a spoiled , aristocrat girl of the planter oligarchy, she seem'd doomed to extinction like most of her classmates in the civil war and after. Only some men, like the opportunistic , if responsible, Rhett Buttler were to be expected to survive these turmoil in a mens world of war and destruction. But she made it. Her methods were sometimes arguable, but she survived, saving not only her life, but identity and sovereignity of her family and her property, when the people of the old South , especially the male dominated oligarchy, only felt, that their time was up, like Ashley Wilkes recognised it. This movie is not about racism or even defending of the so-called southern ""life-style"". Once it was broken down, everybody knew, it will never come back It i about female emancipation, one of the first movies, ever to mention this topic. Of course, the last third of the the movie seems sometimes to counteract this impression. The Scarlett O'Hara, who could do everything, to defend her family and their farm, appears to have fallen back in the unconscious, spoiled , behaviour of her youth, selfish, unable to personnal affection. But the very last scene of the movie is a revue of her accomplishments and failures.She will not bow down even to the man, he now too late recognised as the man, he loves. She will never, even in luxury, forget her task as a self-determinating, strong women and farmer, some distant echo of all the strong farmer wifes, which build the USA. She will not forget her Responsibility for Family, Farm and the whole society, even if someimes to be misguided. As for racism,I have to make some comments after viewing your discussion board. Iwill not go as far as to say, this movie is defending slavery and racism. Ashley Wilkes, a slaveholder has to say the line"" I wanted to free my slaves after the war. And as I mentioned before, once the CSA lost the war, there was no longer any discussion about slavery. Unexcusable, whatsoever , was indeed the stereotypical characterisation of most slaves in this movie as dumb, faithfull loyals to their masters and Owners. But you have to remember, that even this was partially true,because some, not the majority, of the slaves must have felt some affection to the slaveholders, even to be recruited as black volunteers for the confederate armies(Of course, they never engaged in battle, because they were summoned only on the eve of defeat.)In general, the slaves were happy,when seeing some blue soldiers, a point totally ignored in the movie. But saying this, everybody has to acknowledge the great acting performance of Hattie McDaniel as Scarletts black ""Mama"" As one commentator said, everything Scarlett was taught, was taught by Hattie Mc Daniel. But her influence goes even further. The black mama is ""the"" moral authority of the movie. One of the key scenes of the movie is the discovery by Rhett Buttler , that The MAMA is wearing the undertrousers, Rhett once had sent her as a gift. That is not a sign of vanity or shallowness of her or even corruption by gifts. It is a sign of approval to a man , his moralty and his way of life and is more important to him than the esteem of the old southern society. So we have an older women ex- slave, who is actually the highest moral authority of this movie!(Besides Ashley Wilkes wife, played by Olivia de Havilland, of course) This is the opposite of racism! So there is a great ambiguity in the movie, concerning the race issue. Today, this movie must accurately be called politically incorrect, but for the time of the production it was even somehow progressive. P:S: As is known for some years, Margaret Mitchell was a generous sponsor for black students in her lifetime and after. Who will criticise her, should in these respect try to follow her example. PPS: Sorry for my bad english!"

I recently created a post in the Best/Worst section of the message boards nameing the greatest characters of all time, I immediately placed Scarlett at #1.  Never has a character so nasty, so spoiled, be loved by so many viewers.  She makes this film, because she is such a strong character. The audience never know how to feel about her when she marrys for money or hurts those around her.  In the end, though, she always gets her just desserts.  Her first two husbands are killed and just as she really begins to love someone, he walks out on her.

So much has been said of this movie that accolades from me would just be piling on.  Suffice to say, the production values are beyond top notch.  You actually are viewing 1860's Carolina and Georgia.  The acting is so good, the actors were type cast for years after. Specifically, Vivian Leigh never ever got past the Scarlett O'hara character with the possible exception of Streetcar.  The film won 10 Oscars and rightly so.  This in what had to be the toughest competitive year ever -- 1939.  For those Widescreen buffs (me included), note the dvd is only in fullscreen simply because that is the original format.  This was before Panavision and Cinemascope.  Definitely a 10 out of 10."

","This was one of the best movies I have ever seem, the acting was super, it is one of those slow pace movies that you can not leave for a moment because you just have to see what is going to happen. Hattie Macdaniel in my opinion is a true credit to her race and profession. I will never forget the moments in the movie, with Rhett and Scarlett embracing, the last act when Rhett told Scarlett the  he don't give a damn,it is one of those acts that you will remember forever."

","The life and loves of a spoiled Southern rich girl living in fast changing times<br/><br/>Hard to know where to start with a film of this sort and this magnitude, other than to say most of the things written about it are true. And given that whole books have been written about it - that is a hell of a lot of things.<br/><br/>This David O Selznick produced movie not only became an event, but moved the whole art of cinema up to the level of great literature or painting. Even watching today you cannot help, but marvel at the casting, script or action. Despite what it has been boiled down to by its critics (an overheated civil war romance?), so much happens in this film that you could call it almost an action film.<br/><br/>Great work is more about perspiration than inspiration. Here nothing has been left to chance, the leads (Gable and Leigh) are absolutely perfect for their roles - no one could have been better cast. Equally every smaller part has a major talent playing them. This maybe the best cast film of all time. Casting costs would make it impossible today.<br/><br/>Yes - it is a woman's picture - and yes again - it has elements of soap opera about it. Watching three hours of anything can be hard work (some TV showings break it in to two parts), but it is well worth it.<br/><br/>Despite not being in my own top ten of all time favourite movies (others simply appeal to me more), ignoring what this represents in terms of technical achievement and entertaining the masses/generations would be folly. Like it or not, Gone with the Wind moved the movie making bar up not inches, but whole feet and the cinema industry would be poorer for it never having been made."

","The creators of WIND did not envision a 65-year life to their work.  Indeed, David O. Selznick sold his interest in the film within years; Margaret Mitchell remarked on publication that she hoped the book would sell a few thousand copies(!).  So it's a huge mistake to judge WIND on any terms but its own -- what it ""was"", and then, what it ""is"".  Today we see a colorful, vividly realized costume epic.  But in 1939, it seemed like the Sistine Chapel had come to life and was appearing at the downtown Rialto.  Forgive the silly metaphor, but you get what I'm after -- the size and scope of WIND on film had no precedent.  Released in the shadow of the Great Depression, WIND in hindsight is less about the Civil War than a nation's slow crawl out of recent poverty.  When Scarlett said `I'll never be hungry again,' the nation rose and said `Damn Right!'  The moment was set to fiery, defiant music, and the illusion of America, as she wanted to see herself, was set. History, right or wrong, was suddenly embodied by a sexy young girl who wants, not just to survive, but to prosper.  Powerful stuff.  But is that enough to hold our attention, year after year, decade after decade?  WIND is still visually persuasive and always will be.  Max Steiner's score beneath those images cannot be underestimated -- there had never been so much music outside the realm of grand opera.  Music completes the illusion.  The script however, full of momentum, has little substance.  It weakens as years go by. Mitchell was no Tolstoy, but her brilliant novel is condensed to a long, shallow, sentimental melodrama.  The writing is redeemed only by two key performances:  Hattie McDaniel, as Mammy, is the first African American allowed to create a real human being on screen (for that we thank David O. Selznick); and of course, Vivien Leigh's complex, amazingly sexual Scarlett. In a strange mix of glamour and guts, the vortex of her acting seems to create the film around her; she wills it to happen.  After 35 years of watching, I've come to regard her as, not merely the leading actress, but the real director of Gone With the Wind -- and the reason to keep watching."

","Ever since I first saw this film when I was 12 on the centennial of the Civil War, I have been enthralled with it.  My mother took me into Boston to see the film and as I remember, it was a really poor quality print. Rather yellowish and scratchy.  It didn't matter - that started me on my life-long love of the Civil War and history in general.  It has also made me visit just about every major Civil War battlefield in the United States, as well as plantation homes and other significant sites throughout the South.<br/><br/>What a fabulous film!  Really first-rate and amazingly so when you know the difficulties that Selznick went through to get it to the screen.  This ranged from casting challenges to director and script changes.<br/><br/>It does stand the test of time well.  I have noticed that there is another whole new generation of GWTW lovers coming up.  My friend and I took our two young daughters to see the newest digitally mastered print that recently was released. (It was great to see the film in a theater again with great sound...)<br/><br/>As always, (and wherever and whenever I have seen it), the first shot of Clark Gable produced gasps from the audience.  It is shot from the top of the staircase at the Wilkes mansion during the barbeque and we see Rhett Butler from Scarlett's viewpoint, when she first sees him.  The camera pans down to his face, as he is leaning on the bannister, looking up at her. I have never seen this film, when that shot of Gable failed to elict sighs from the audience.<br/><br/>Anyway, our daughters loved the film and we hope that they will continue to enjoy it and pass it on.  Its that type of film - one to be enjoyed over and over again.  Even with all the times that I have seen it, I rarely watch it without seeing one or two new things.  That's the mark of a great and timeless film - which ""Gone With the Wind"" is!"

Now it is painful to sit through these 2hr+ movies that they keep coming out with, but Gone With the Wind manages to be almost 4hrs. and be great every step of the way.<br/><br/>I must say that when I heard the line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn,"" my jaw dropped.  I could have watched the movie for even longer.<br/><br/>It is said that Vivien Leigh was born to be Scarlett.  It is true, she did an amazing job going from the spoiled young girl she was to the a woman working through tough times, to a spoiled woman. Casting for the part of Scarlett took a long time.  Many women were screened but none got the part.  Then they tested a beautiful young lady from England.  Her southern accent was perfect.  So Leigh took the part.<br/><br/>I shouldn't go on for ever, so just know that this is a great film that you should see."

Even though it lacks many key points of the book, for the time they had it is without a doubt a masterpiece to say the least.  How anyone could not love this film is beyond me.  Vivian Leigh is magnificent and truly deserving of her Best Actress Award.  Scarlett is the only main character of any book I have ever read that did not put her as the herione and everyones favorite character.  She is the character you love and hate.  Love because, well she is the main character and the pretty southern belle that does have her moments.  And yet she hated because, let's face it...she's not very nice.  She does some very terrible things and acts like a brat throughout her life, but it's hard to hold that against her.  If only she would have wised up sooner and realized that Ashley is a wimp and that Rhett is so perfect for her.  Oh well! That is the charm of the film.  This movie earned every award it won.

David O'Selnick made a great movie in which he redefined the sense of Hollywood spectacle and this is the most important thing about this movie.His glorious technicolor and performances in soap-opera style are definitely attractive to the public.The epic consists in made a spectacle of every gesture or every word.Is a movie to see a thousand of times because if it's the first spectacle movie in all the senses,is the best too. The first part of the movie(until the oath of Scarlett in Tara)is the best because we see the personal fight of Scarlett to conquest the love of Ashley and the fight against the Civil War.The dialogues are too much literary but in this consists the spectacle.The second part is worse because the marriage of Rhett and Scarlett is a stop in the narrative.The film contains unforgettable sentences like the famous ""Tomorrow is another day"" at the end. Many people is very sceptical with this movie today because its plot twists and its soap opera style  but this was the first and real blockbuster of Hollywood.I repeat,it's not a masterpiece but deserves a viewing.Without this film may that Star Wars,Ben Hur,Doctor Zhivago or Titanic(so compared to Gone with the wind)never were existed.A movie for all the ages,a movie bigger than life,the perfect example of the Golden Hollywood,when art and success were a good couple."

","My birthday present at 8 was to go to dinner with my parents and then go to see GWTW, which had been re-released on the big screen. As an 8 year old, I found the story a little hard to understand - I was bewildered by people laughing when I thought they should have been mad or sad, and really the only person I related to was Scarlett's child Bonnie. I thought it so sad when she died and also when Melanie died.<br/><br/>In my early teens I checked the book out 3 times or so from the library, I was fascinated by it. The beautiful and involving writing of Margaret Mitchell made me think it the best book ever. I still keep it on my bedside stand, I can pick it up and open to any page and read till I feel sleepy.<br/><br/>I think that the movie got the main points of the book - it would have actually made a good mini-series rather than a four hour movie, but I don't think they did mini-series in the 30s.<br/><br/>I think everyone knows that it is a historical movie about the Civil War involving a spoiled beauty, a plain, gracious woman, a man that is weak and indecisive, and a charming, masculine rogue.<br/><br/>The movie is very well-acted and lovely to look at. The costumes and sets are great.<br/><br/>My favorite person both in the book and the film is Melanie. What an impossibly unselfish, kind, sweet, good woman. Olivia de Havilland was so very good in her role as Melanie.  She is the essence of kindness, and the beautiful Scarlett is selfish, greedy and mean. Melanie acutally was more beautiful to me. Even Rhett says, after she died - ""She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.""<br/><br/>Great performances down to the smallest parts, you won't ever forget this movie."

","When I first settled down to watch this film I was determined not to pity the characters, and to come away from the television mocking the old fashioned acting and the sissy melodrama. however, after three hours of the stuff you kind of get used to it!<br/><br/>The basic story is a very simple one. Scarlett loves Ashley, Ashley doesn't want Scarlett but doesn't let on, so she is left chasing him. She settles for Rhett. Rhett realises he's  second best and so leaves Scarlett, just as she realises that Ashley doesn't want her, and it was actually Rhett that she loved all along! In a tear jerking moment we see Rhett slip away from Scarlett as she begs him to stay. And oh yeah, there's a civil war half way through the film in which half the country are killed off and the society of Scarlett and her little 'groupie' comes crashing to the ground. this may seem like a 'beafy' storyline, but for three hours it's a little short. The reason that it is stretched out so long is that the whole thing is seen through the eyes of the self centered, cold blooded, spoilt duaghter of a plantation owner; Scarlett O' Hara, and every single little detail, or misfortune that she encountered is made into a disaster on a global scale! Admittedly she does have some very trying times, but for the majority of the film you just want to slap her and say: 'for god's sake woman! stop being so sulky and childish!' At first the wooden acting is very obvious and make the film comparable to a panto, but by the time Scarlett goes to the twelve oaks barbeque, we forget about the acting. Until the very last speech in which Scarlett exclaims 'tomorrow is another day!' This line is so cheesy that you can't help but cringe at it. Admittedly though it is one of those scenes that sends a chill up your spine. over all I would say to anyone who is thinking of watching the film, to go for it. After all it is supposed to be 'the' film of all time. Its one of those lifetime experience things. you can spend the rest of your life saying; 'yes I have seen gone with the wind.'"

"krational66","9","1","1","13 May 2020"," Love in troubled times
","Sometimes love needs to be held on and beaten, but once love has bound the wings of the lover, please let it go as soon as possible.<br/><br/>
Scarlett, do you think it's worth hurting someone who loves you for someone who has hurt you before? Vanity is a part of all human beings, but it's important to get out of it and not wait for what you really need to lose before you can appreciate it. So always ask yourself: are you doing what you really need right now? You are successful, but do you consider yourself happy?
Rhett, I think you've done all you have to do. Including the dedication to the cause, the ""implicit"" loyalty to the south, the unswerving pursuit of lovers, the meticulous love of the daughter. Though you knew that the south had lost the battle before it was fought, and though you and most southerners could not appear to share in it, you fought for the south everywhere during the war. You fought with millions of southerners, and when the battle was won, you left your loved ones behind and joined the confederate army. For the love, for the daughter, changed a man, a father can change everything.<br/><br/>
You're a shrewd businessman, but you can't calculate your feelings. I think this you know, feelings sometimes need to be confused, so you rarely care about scarlett, everything for the sake of the girl. And once the daughter died, all the sustenance and hope also die. At this time you have nearly collapsed, is mei lanli, the woman you admire most, let you walk out of the bedroom again, to life. But when you know that the woman who gave everything for it has never loved you, but still loves ASHLEY, and married herself only for the poor three hundred dollars. You may be unbearable, so choose to leave, leave that only sad and tragic place, leave that will only make their own shame and pain scarlett.<br/><br/>
However, leaving will only let you get a temporary adjustment and comfort, not for a long time joy and happiness, because after all you still like, love scarlett, leaving her will only be painful, not happy. It is better to get back together and create happiness for both of us than to cause pain for both of us if one of us leaves. Scarlett has completely come to her senses, so give her another chance, and also give yourself another chance to be happy, and go back to tara and scarlett again! After all, tomorrow is another day. Mei lanli, ""exhaling such as LAN, xinfang such as hui"" so describe you again appropriate however. You have the noblest character in the human race -- kindness, the most appealing quality in a man -- tenderness. You are wise and virtuous, know how to write, gentle and kind... You possess almost all the good qualities of man, so that my clumsy pen cannot describe them. But ASHLEY doesn't really love you. But...<br/><br/>
ASHLEY, you may be a gentleman, your noble temperament attracted many obsessed with fantasy girls, including scarlett, I do not know what thing is your body captured scarlett's soul. Let's not say your marriage and mei lanli is happy, you and the feelings between mei lanli is not love. Perhaps you have only one kind of dependence and sustenance on mei LAN li. But as a man should never take life on others like you, especially on a woman (no matter how good she is), can't say you have no definite view, but you are weak, you are too too complacent, so that lose the power to change the status quo, the satisfaction of the abnormal gradually eroding your desire to do better. If you want to achieve anything, you must be independent, especially in spirit. If you want to make progress, you must have an endless stream of new goals, and work hard for them. You must be strong. Tragedy happens because of human nature.<br/><br/>
""Gone with the wind"" is the youth of scarlett's generation, the kind of picnic and dance life; It is the ""ideal"" of the southern plantation-style aristocracy, and the arrogant, blind and ignorant southerners. Is that unforgettable love, is all the unfortunate past.<br/><br/>The power of a classic is that it moves people."

","It's widely considered one of the grandest spectacles in cinematic history, on par with the likes of Ben Hur (1959) and The Ten Commandments (1956). After seeing it, I have to agree that it is quite something.<br/><br/>The movies of old were told their stories in a very different manner than the ones of today. The pacing was more languid, as if they were taken from a multi-part miniseries with the episodes stitched together. The acting was much more bombastic and expected to be slightly over the top.<br/><br/>I was easily able to watch it in 4 installments with very natural cut-off points around every hour. I found that each installment gave me different things to think about."

","Gone with the Wind is one of the many memorable films of Hollywood's Golden Age and illustrates the story written by Margaret Mitchell. The film has an outstanding cast and tells an entertaining story about the life of Scarlett O'Hara. The film was made in 1939 but gives a great insight into WW2 and views on african americans for the time period as well. The main actress Vivien Leigh was british and found the character Scarlett to be a real woman. Vivien wanted to portray the character as accurately as possible trying to learn southern gestures, cultures, and even asking advice from southern fans. At one point some southerners sent her locusts native to the south as she did not know what they were. Vivien's efforts paid off as she won her first Oscar for the leading role in this film. For an up and coming actress to land the lead role in one of the most historical epics is already a feat in itself but her accolades prove how she was able to really become the character and connect with the audience. The supporting actor playing Scarlette's lover Rhett is Clark Gable. Clark Gable had starred in a few other movies before this and played a very suave character in this film. He was nominated for an Oscar in a few different roles including the one in this movie however he did not receive an award for this film. However, as the audience watches the movie you never see Clark Gable but only the character Rhett Butler. Clark has the ability to engulf the audience in the story and draw people in because his acting seems almost too real to be fake. Together these two lead roles took the stage and portrayed the life of the stubborn and glamorous Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a fascinating character with faults and a sense of realism that was a bit strange for this time period. At the beginning of the movie she is in love with a man named Ashley but he loves someone else, she then meets Rhett and their romance blossoms. Their romance is a main part of the film but it focuses mainly on Scarlett and her mix of good and bad decisions with the civil War going on in the background. Throughout the book you find Scarlett in different phases and attitudes of life as she continues to lose many of those she loves. No matter what happens Scarlett famously always moves on and will always be alright. 'Her motto was not just for her though; as the film is set in the civil war WW2 was on the horizon in the real world and had brought many concerns and fears with it. Many small words of wisdom and brave actions by Scarlett during the film, such as helping soldiers and having to be strong at losing her loved ones, set examples for people to follow and made them feel better about what their future entitled. Audience members found comfort in the idea that if stubborn scarlett could persist through war times they could too. Sentiments towards war were not the only projectiles towards the real world. Throughout the film scarlett always has trusted slaves to be there for her and they are happy to serve her. Gone With the Wind portrays African Americans as happy serving white masters but as most have larned slavery was not a joyous event. Part of the outlook on African Americans expressed is due to the book and that it was written during the civil war but the film also reflects how some people viewed African Americans as lesser people. Segregation was a strong force in the US and there was no sign of a Civil Rights Act till much later with the rise of Martin Luther King Jr. and when it was passed in 1964. The film advocates for the idea of scientific racism and a world where African Americans should be proud to be second class citizens. It's interesting to see how timeless films can express so much about the era they were made in and how much more people tend to find when they rewatch movies. Gone With the Wind was an outstanding epic with amazing acting and a strong story to help reflect how people of the time period viewed WW2 and African American Rights."

","How sad that in 2019 as I write this, the voters of IMDB can only rank this 164.<br/><br/>Consider that just 12 years earlier, the American Film Institute ranked this movie 6th.<br/><br/>Tastes change and with short attention spans, the younger person can't sit through a four-hour epic.<br/><br/>It shows you how much the country has changed that this movie still remains the highest grossing film when adjusted for inflation. You can't get away with a 3-hour movie these days, let alone considering four.<br/><br/>I would give this a 10 but the only drawbacks are the generally weak storyline.<br/><br/>What makes this picture is Selznick's vision of telling a grand story about the South with the dropback of the Civil War and its aftermath and the impact on a southern family.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh gives one of the greatest performance ever for an actress even though she is dealing with a script that is often underwhelming and would be near impossible for most actresses to carry.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is great as well even though he is playing a jerk whose lines are often unbelievable particularly as this movie draws to a close.<br/><br/>The terrible ending almost made me give this an 8 but the technical achievements are just too amazing.<br/><br/>In these days of special effects, it is too easy to gloss over the incredible costumes and set designs in this film. Such great care, attention to detail and painful expense was poured into this picture to make it look as startling as it does.<br/><br/>The fire scene is groundbreaking in its use of special effects for its time.<br/><br/>There are a million great shots here.<br/><br/>The supporting cast led by Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard are all top-notch.<br/><br/>Also, this film directly influenced many great films which borrowed from it such as Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Jezebel, The Maltese Falcon just to name a few.<br/><br/>I also reject the view that this movie glorifies the South. It is a romantic movie about a Southern family during the Civil War but that doesn't mean it romanticizes the South or the Confederacy. By that logic, would southerners be incapable of being romantic? I actually think this movie does a good job of showing the folly of those eager to go to war early in the film and shows the painful realities of the death and destruction war causes. Those who made this movie in 1939 had lived through World War 1 and World War 2 was about to break out. The movie might not spend a lot of time dealing with slavery but this picture was not meant to be about the slaves.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind set a new standard for epic films and it is a sign of the times that I would feel as though I had to defend the picture's greatness where as 20 years ago it was just common wisdom that this was one of the greatest pictures made."

","This movie is absolutely favorite. <br/><br/>Watching Scarlett transition from a very pampered, very spoiled, very whiny, very self-centered plantation belle to a woman of great spirit and strength was remarkable. I love the fact that she will do whatever it takes to save her beloved plantation Tara. This characters personal growth of the heart takes some time and I wanted to shake her several times as she lets her beloved Rhett slip away. The character of Melanie makes me want to love her for her deep quiet strength and it is this character that is the one person in the film who truly understands Scarlett. The character of Mammie is just hilarious as the nanny who has raised many of the O'Haras. Her comments about Rhett as being a mule in a horse's harness is just reflective of the brilliant well constructed screenplay. All in all, a great classic movie."

This is everything a film is supposed to be - amusing, sad, shocking, thought-provoking and filled with pretty costumes! Sure, it's around 4 hours long. Sure, her obsession with Ashley seems slightly bizarre and is actually quite irritating. Sure, at times it makes slavery look like it wasn't ""that bad"". But you know what? Who gives a damn? I don't! And neither does Rhett Butler! Anyone who is rating this film poorly needs to take a long hard look in the mirror. I am assuming these are the same people who refuse to watch a film with subtitles (so, mostly Americans then) or think that ""American Pie"" is a cultural masterpiece.<br/><br/>Basically, this is the film equivalent of rolling around for hours in a pool of moist sponge cake."

","This classic movie is set in the Civil War era, looking from the South's point of view.More than the war it concentrates on the troubled relationship between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.Gone with the Wind (1939) is David O.

","This film is a true classic, all ages and all generations will love this cinematic masterpiece. Vivien Leigh really brought this film to life, portraying the complex character of Scarlett. You cannot define her character in one word. Her character can cause a lot of debate: Is she good or just plain selfish and cruel. Well, she's a bit of both but I would argue that at the end of the day she is a good person, who only knows a certain way of life which isn't exactly the right way but you see her growth in maturity and character throughout the film. There are moments when you realise that she has determination and strength to rise above situations and she really surprises you, in a good way, in certain ways which makes you grow respect for her character. You can't help but like her or be interested by her no matter what you think of her. Also, it would be wrong to not mention Clark Gables brilliant performance as Rhett Butler. He was so different from the ""gentlemen"" that in those days was of the norm, but the chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett was perfect, totally convincing and brilliant to watch. But the whole casting was spot on, every character was interesting and likable and all gave everything into their characters. Even in the 21st Centuray it is still considered a masterpiece and watching it, you don't feel such a huge gap in years. You can still watch it today and thoroughly enjoy it. You have to watch this film, it's a must see!"

","Irene Mayer Selznick wrote when the titles of this film appeared on the screen during the sneak preview of this great film she wept and could not stop crying. Deeply Mrs. Selznick knew that David Selznick bet all on this film, that he was obsessed with the film and that in a way He loved it more than David Selznick loved his wife. When one thinks of 1939 and the way this Film advanced film, that Selznick took a civil war story and made it the most famous and possibly one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the American screen has regressed since 1939. Nowadays all we get is too much Special Effects.<br/><br/>Casting Scarlett O Hara, Selznick built up a PR frenzy among the public as great stars such as Norma Shearer, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur were mentioned as well as then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner. Bette Davis went to her grave wishing she had been cast as Scarlett. Other stars tested were Lucille Ball, Joan Benneet and Paulette Goddard who looked like the likely selection until one night Vivien Leigh appeared on the Selznick back lot. From then on Vivien Leigh 'became' Scarlett O Hara and gave one of the screen's greatest performances and won the Academy Award.<br/><br/>Superbly produced by David Selznick at Selznick International and released thru then mighty MGM, and directed by Vincent Flemming, Gone With The Wind is one of the greatest films of all time and indexed for inflation, the biggest moneymaker of all time. George Cukor had been Director but Selznick fired Cukor. In retrospect a wise move as I do not think Cukor could have directed the action and Civil War battle scenes as Flemming did.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is a dashing and great Rhett Butler, and splendid support by Olivia De Havilland Leslie Howard with a peerless performance by Hattie McDaniel who infuses soul into her great performance and justly won the Oscar. Costumes, Set and Art Direction, Cinematography are all tops with a thrilling score. This movie advanced the picture making into a modern era. <br/><br/>David Selznick ever the gambler won his gamble, but would soon lose his wife due to his affair with Jennifer Jones. And ironically while creating the second greatest female star of her era (after the great Garbo), Vivien Leigh and David Selznick never made another movie together. Irene Selznick's powerful tears were momentous not only for the success of this film, the impending failure of her marriage and Selznick's eventual decline.<br/><br/>Film scholars should read ""Memo From David O Selznick"" -one of the most intensive books ever on the life of DOS and ""Showman"" by David Thomson for more info on Gone With The Wind"

","David O. Selznick's ""Gone With The Wind"" may be one of the best films that America has ever had to offer. With the dazzling direction, acting, and scenery it's no wonder every other film has paled in comparison since. The influence of Selznick practically bleeds through onto the character of Scarlett. Both were ambitious and enjoyed drinking alone..and cared for one thing--money.<br/><br/>The film takes place during the Civil War and specializes on the O'Hara family especially Scarlett. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a young stubborn woman who happens to fall in love with Ashley Wilkes(Leslie Howard) a man who is already married to his cousin Melanie(Olivia De Havilland). When Ashley refuses to leave his wife for Scarlett, Scarlett settles in for the men who can provide for her.<br/><br/>The film emphasizes on the marriage between Scarlett and her third husband Rhett (Clark Gable). Rhett realizes that his love has always been and always will be for Scarlett. As the course of the film continues Rhett goes to great lengths of showing this by giving Scarlett the world. With all his kindness and loyalty, he fails to give her the one thing she's been dying to have-- Ashley."

"AndersonWhitbeck","10","1","1","2 September 2007"," David Selznick's Masterpiece
","David Selznick a true genius in my opinion created one of the greatest movies ever made in ""Gone With The Wind"". Filmed at Selznick International studios ( now best known as Desilu Culver), the film reflects film making at its best. David Selznick drove himself and most people around him relentlessly until he got the correct cast. It would have been easy to get Errol Flynn and Bette Davis and indeed Warners offered Selznick a better deal financially but he remained steadfast in his efforts to get Clark Gable as Rhett Butler and due to that fact Selznick International had to release the film via MGM Gable's studio Legendary actresses such as Jean Arthur, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Norma Shearer, Lucille Ball and then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner all were considered. Paulette Goddard almost had the part. Selznick was up against a filming schedule that he had to go with the picture and lo and behold Scarlett O Hara in the vision of Vivien Leigh appeared. We can all thank Selznick for his steadfastness in wanting the picture cast correctly. The supporting players such as Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard and most definitely Hattie McDaniel give an added thrust to the emotions of the picture. The sets, the camera work, the costumes (Selznick wrote tons of memos about Clark Gable's outfits), all resulted in a movie masterpiece. The windup of the movie was all Selznick's doing especially Scarlett hearing the voices of her past before her legendary "" After All Tomorrow Is Another Day"".<br/><br/>David Selznick loved Women and he guided the career of the love of his Life Jennifer Jones but also Ingrid Bergman, Vivien Leigh,Joan Fontaine and made movies with Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich and Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert et al Yet his determination to get the right Rhett Butler and the right Vivien Leigh nearly 70 years has proved correct, and nearly 70 years after its premiere one wonders if Hollywood has regressed not progressed. The camera shots of the wounded, the music, are all so impressive today as they must have been revolutionary in l939.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece"

","I have seen this classic epic romance countless times-- and, though long, it still holds up to repeated viewings. First of all, there is the attention to detail in the sets, art direction, and costumes. Secondly, the story is truly memorable with characters that have become immortalized, and even a part of American popular culture, such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, and Prissy. Thirdly, the acting is truly excellent! In a wonderful cast, Vivien Leigh must be singled out for special praise. Scarlett O'Hara was probably the most sought after movie part in history-- and it went to an unknown British actress! The casting was a risk. Considering the chaos the was the actual filming of GWTW--changing directors three times-- the artistry of the picture must be credited to David O Selznick, the producer, and to Vivien Leigh for her determined, willful, charming ,manipulating,selfish, but decent Southern Belle who is the very definition of a survivor. What a marvelous performance!!"
"lauraeileen894","8","1","1","11 April 2007"," Masterful epic
","I didn't see ""Gone with the Wind"" until about 3 years ago, mainly because its four hour length was rather intimidating. However, I'm glad I did, because aside from its magnificent story and cinematography, ideal cast and fine direction, ""GwtW"" is one of the best paced films of all time, and the four hours really soar by. Of course, in order to enjoy ""GwtW"", you have to put aside your politically correct sensibilities. It's sexist in parts, historically biased (the North is the enemy, plain and simple) and terribly, terribly racist (the Georgia slaves seem perfectly content with their situation). Once you overlook these un-PC details, you'll fall in love with the ageless story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a bratty Southern belle who is shaken out of her complacency when the Civil War strikes. Leigh masterfully brings Scarlett to life, and you forgive the fact that she's much too pretty for the role (Margaret Mitchell bluntly described our heroine as ""not beautiful""). She seamlessly portrays Scarlett's imperfect charm and resourcefulness as well as her fiery temper and complete lack of scruples. We object to some of the things Scarlett does in her quest for survival (stealing her sister's fiancée, for instance), and yet, we'd secretly love to be that single-minded, determined, and unconcerned with basic social standards. Equally strong is the supporting cast: Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar (being the first black performer to do so) as fiercely devoted and no-nonsense Mammy, one of the few people who refuses to take any crap from Scarlett. Olivia de Havilland has the difficult task of playing the relentlessly noble and saintly Melanie, but fortunately she plays the character with genuine emotion and dignity, and never allows Melanie to become phony or saccharine. Leslie Howard, on the other hand, is extremely weak as everyone's least favorite character, the spineless and fatuous Ashley Wilkes, who, for some reason, Scarlett foolishly carries a torch for. The standout, however, is Clark Gable as sexy scoundrel Rhett Butler. A decidedly amoral iconoclast, Rhett proves himself to be Scarlett's soul mate, but, alas, she is too stubborn and blind to realize it. Gable plays the part with devil-may-care suaveness and barely contained passion, and was unfairly overlooked at Oscar time. The epic to end all epics, ""GwtW"" is a must for every film lover. You may love it, you may hate it... but you certainly won't forget it."

","Gone with the Wind is an excellent American classic. If i listed all the reasons why i loved it i'd be on this computer for days!

The movie is telling about a bratty teenager in the ""old south"" who learns and grows to be a courage's women through the experiences of her life through out the destruction of her world. Now, this goes towards the people who say that all it was about was racism. First of all that was the way it was back then in that point in time and David O. Selznick couldn't just lie to the audience. You need to accept the fact that African-Americans were not always free. And the movie is not stating that slavery was right, but simply the way it was back then. So F.Y.I. to the people who are either too young to understand or think that every thing from the southern perspective of things is always racist get a clue. And the people who say that this movie was portraying the Yankee troupes as brutes are wrong. Some of them really were brutes to the southern men and women but the movie never stated or portrayed that all of them were terrible. Also they were not trying to set bitterness into the audience towards the African-American carpet bagger but again they were portraying the way that most of the southern population thought about the bill collectors. They did not have enough money to pay the bills on their homes after the south was destroyed and the carpet bagger, in most eyes, was a nightmare because they had little finances. So with all this said and done believe me when I say THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!"

Let's get one thing straight, people - it was a best-selling book before it was a movie. In fact, it was a worldwide phenomenon. The reason being - IT WAS A HUGE, ESCAPIST SOAP OPERA! Published in 1937, it was a great escape for those in the midst of the Great Depression and about to enter another world war. As for historical accuracy, you have to know that it was written by a white southern woman, who likely grew up with family that lived through the Civil War. Of course she was biased. She wouldn't have been thinking PC - there was NO SUCH THING BACK THEN! No wonder the story has such stereotypical undertones, when it's author was likely a racist.

I didn't see it again or in it's entirety until the 1976 two night television presentation. I've seen it a couple times since but never again on the big screen and it needs to be seen on a big screen to fully appreciate it. At almost four hours it's still too long for my tastes but when it was made the book was widely popular and people would have been screaming if they cut a lot out of the 1000+ page novel to do a two hour movie. <br/><br/>Clark Gable was the immediate choice for Rhett Butler but speculation was rampant as to who would play Scarlett O'Hara. Leading contenders were Norma Shearer, Katherine Hepburn, Carol Lombard and Paulette Goddard. In June of 1938 it was learned that both Gable and Shearer who were under contract to Metro were going to MGM for the project. Also in the cast would be Walter Connolly as Gerald O'Hara, Maurice Murphy as Charlie Hamilton and Margaret Tallichet as Carreen O'Hara. In August of 1938 Shearer announced she was dropping out of the project. Out of 1400 candidates for the role 90 screen tests were made but it wasn't until filming of some scenes were underway that Vivien Leigh wandered on the set and got enough of producer David O. Selznick's attention that she was given a screen test the next day and ultimately the coveted role and eventually the Oscar as Best Actress. The script was in reality never completed until the film was. Playwright Sidney Howard wrote two drafts but unsatisfied with either Selznick brought on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who were doing Wuthering Heights to make changes. Also brought on were John Van Druten, Jo Swerling, Edwin Justin Mayer and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Dialog changes were being done as filming was going on with the additions of Oliver H.P. Garrett, Winston Miller, John Balderston and Michael Foster to the screenplay. Ultimately it's collaborated, changed, reworked and reworded screenplay got Sidney Howard the Oscar. George Cukor was the original director but Gable couldn't get along with him so he gave Selznik a list of four directors and said, pick one or I walk, so Selznik chose Victor Flemming and Cukor was out. Flemming had a breakdown while filming and Sam Wood completed the picture with help from William Cameron Menzies and Breeves Eason. Flemming got the Oscar for Best Director. Additional Academy Awards went to Selnick for Best Picture. Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan for Best Color Cinematography, Hal C. Kern and James E. Newcam of Best Film Editing, Lyle Wheeler for Best Art Direction and Hattie McDaniel for Best Supporting Actress beating out nominated co-star Olivia DeHavilland. McDaniel became not only the first African-American to win an Academy Award she was the first African-American to be invited to attend the Academy Awards. Two special awards from The Academy Awards were presented to production designer William Cameron Menzies and a technically production award to Don Musgrave.<br/><br/>Before GWTW was released or had it's premiere, a theater was filled by patrons in Riverside, California who were ready to watch a film they had came to see. It was announced that the film would not be shown and instead they were to see a sneak preview of an upcoming major release and they could have their tickets refunded and leave but once the film began the doors would be locked and they couldn't leave until it was over. When Gone With the Wind came on the screen they shrieked with excitement. 20 million movie tickets were sold for this film during it's initial theatrical run. By it's fourth theatrical release in 1947 100 million tickets had been sold. It's other major theatrical re-releases came in 1954, 1961, 1967 and 1998. More people have bought movie tickets to see this picture than any other film ever released. Among the large cast are also Leslie Howard, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, George Reeves and Victor Jory. It's an unlikely love story about a self-absorbed southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler who was kicked out of West Point and doesn't actually fight in the Civil War but uses it to his commercial advantage by being a blockade runner but then eventually does become a confederate. It's an adventurous romantic melodrama epic that span 12 years of the Civil War era. Although long and melodramatic, as a film Selnicks determination to have it made and made right paid off. I would give it a 10."

","This is the ultimate love story. <br/><br/>This is probably the best cast movie of all times. With the possible exception of Burton and Taylor, there never was a better on screen couple than Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh. Olivia de Havelland was absolutely lovely as the kind hearted Melodie. And who will ever forget Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes...I understand Scarlettes obsession with him!<br/><br/>But the person who made the movie for me was Hattie McDaniel as Mammie. She may play a slave/servant in the movie, but she NEVER considered herself less important or lower than anyone else in the movie. She was amazing in the roll.<br/><br/>Such care was taken in this movie to get everything just right, and it shows. It is full of lines that have been repeated and satirized over the years. <br/><br/>One of the things that stands out the most for me was the amazing cinematography. The colors are rich and beautiful. The other thing that stands out is the memorable characters...these are people we all know and recognize, put into situations they can't control.<br/><br/>I consider this mandatory viewing for anyone who is serious about movies.

"CrystalSparkles4","10","1","1","13 November 2005"," GWTW: My Film Class Xtra Credit
","Gone With The Wind Stemming from a novel published in 1936 that took approximately 10 years to write, the production of this film was also a difficult and time consuming event. Gone With The Wind remains to be a world renowned sensation not only in it's literary form which has been reproduced in nearly 30 different languages and is the best selling novel of all time, but has also remained one of the most treasured films, resulting in the groundbreaking success of winning ten Academy Awards. Many consider 1939 to be the greatest year for the classical Hollywood studios because of productions such as, The Wizard of Oz, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights and Stagecoach.<br/><br/>There are so many things about Gone With The Wind that make it such an amazing picture. It had an amazing budget at the time of production, though it seems fair now, $3.7 million was an outstanding amount, but it definitely, and clearly went to good use. I love looking over the wardrobe, the dresses and hats that Scarlett wears are beautifully designed, colorful and eye catching. There is so much detail not only in the wardrobe but with the sets. 90 sets were built, the re-creation of the city of Atlanta had over 50 buildings alone.<br/><br/>Most people that I encounter find Gone With The Wind boring, old fashioned, and most importantly to them, a total of 222 minutes too long (edited down from four hours), so I am often asked why it is my favorite movie. My grandmother seems to find this the most amusing, considering how racially subjective the novel is. When I go to answer this question I always have an awkward moment to myself, I have so many answers. The first thought that enters my mind is the Heroine. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of a strong-willed, independent woman, Scarlett O'Hara, is amazing. I love Vivien Leigh in many of her other roles (A Street Car Named Desire, That Hamilton Woman, Anna Karenina) but I believe this was her best film role ever. She not only captured the obvious selfish, indulgent, childish girl that Scarlett was but she also showed the hidden fears, the naiveté, the dreams of this young girl that was forced to grow up too quickly. At the end of the movie when everything seems to have completely fallen apart, Scarlett has nothing, her only child is dead, her best friend is dead, the one thing that she thought was a constant (her love for Ashley) has now vanished, and her husband- the only man she has ever truly respected, is leaving her. Yet she somehow picks herself up and swears to not let the bad things control her life.<br/><br/>My second answer is usually the one that others give, the love story. The tale of man and woman at cross-purposes always hits me hard. This film has the best example of that. Rhett is in love with Scarlett, but can not have her, and then once he has her is not satisfied, and once he leaves her, she wants him- but of course, can not have him. I think that is what make the story so realistic. Although the concept seems to confuse Scarlett (even when she takes part in the process herself) the intensity of love can fade over time, which happens with Rhett. He was once completely absorbed in her, all of his decisions somehow became dependent on this one woman. Maybe it's because I know the book so well, but when I watch the film I see Scarlett behaving differently than she actually does. Though there are scenes that do imply that Scarlett may have strong hidden feelings for Rhett, in the novel there are many more instances when she wonders to herself about her emotions toward him, which makes their story so much more plausible, which leads to my third answer.<br/><br/>""Because I love the book so much!"" And that's a shame. I admit that there are greater movies than Gone With The Wind, there are many things missing from the plot that are crucially important in the story, such as Scarlett having two other children from her previous marriages, the involvement of the Ku Klux Klan, and various other characters that were eliminated. There are many things missing from the film that were in the book, but this doesn't matter much to me, I love it today more than I loved it the first time I viewed it."
"anjuta_com","Null","1","1","19 April 2004"," A wonderful story of a girl morphing into a woman
","`Gone with the Wind' has always been my favorite movie of all time. It captured a universal theme that viewers all over the world can relate to, even after so many years have passed since the movie was released. It is a story of life of a woman, who is struggling to survive and find happiness in spite of the destruction of the Civil War. The events shown in the film are taking place in Georgia in the 1860's. The South lost the Civil War and the whole southern civilization was, just like the title says, gone with the wind. The script written by Sidney Howard was derived from Margaret Mitchell's first and only published, best-selling Civil War and Reconstruction Period novel of 1,037 pages. In the following sentences, I am not describing the plot or spoiling, I simply discuss the opening scenes with the credits and who the main heroine is. I also disclose who her parents are (nationality and what they're known for). The opening credits of the film are presented against carefully selected `before Civil War' nature scenes, with narrator telling the short story of the southern civilization and dramatic music playing in the background. The film was shot in three-strip Technicolor and is a classic tale of love-hate romance. The main heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, is born into a wealthy southern family and is sixteen at the beginning of the movie. Her parents are a truly American blend - her father is an Irish immigrant with the love for land and horses, and her mother is a daughter of a French general, known for her mild temper and excellent manners. They own a huge house, a farm and many servants - slaves. Scarlett is the oldest of the three daughters. The movie first shows the girl that Scarlett was `before the war'. This is to demonstrate how much she has changed throughout the War and the Reconstruction. General knowledge of the Civil War and the key southern battles would help understanding the movie even better, or vise versa - the movie will help understand the Civil War better. In me, it produced an interest in history of the main battles and how it affected people of the South. The movie is realistic and is full of bright, memorable characters. Scarlett has a lot to learn, like human virtues and the value of a true friendship, and does learn a lot throughout the film and gets confusing feelings every now and then, which shape her character and make her into a woman. I certainly enjoyed ""Gone with the Wind"" and highly recommend it!"
"phoebe816","Null","1","1","28 December 2002"," Movie doesn't have it all
","The movie was great, but it was nothing compared to the book. The movie was so long, but it left out large chunks from the book! Scarlett had children that were not in the movie, yet played a major role in the book with her character and how she reacted in situations. Before viewing the movie, the book needs to be read. The book is even more of a classic than the movie and that needs to be remembered. Movies don't amount to the same level than movies do!"
"thekettleblack","Null","1","1","26 June 2002"," Wonderfully magnificent, despite flaws
","Gone with the Wind, for me, is one of those films that, as soon as it's over, you can't wait to watch it again. I won't bore you with the story-line (as everyone knows it, surely). People complain that Scarlett's character isn't likeable, but that's not the point. In Scarlett, we see something that's rare in films - character development. I loathed her the first time I started watching it, she was flighty and spoiled and utterly obnoxious, but by the second half of the film, she has completely grown up. The hardships of the war turned her into a self-sufficient woman - she comes back to her plantation to find her family starving and takes charge, slowly rebuilding their ruined lives almost single-handedly. It's a magnificent film, although some parts were miscast. Ashley Wilkes comes across as a total drip. How are we to believe that beautiful, vivacious Scarlett is pining away for someone so utterly dull? Melanie Wilkes is equally as dull, but more likeable because she's so kind and forgiving. However, so many stellar performances are given that the boring Mr. and Mrs. Wilkes are readily forgotten. Clark Gable is, as always, Clark Gable, playing the man's man, the loveable scoundrel. Hattie McDaniel is superb and earned her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (the first African-American to ever win an Oscar). Belle Watling and Gerald O'Hara are particularly interesting characters which could have been developed more.<br/><br/>I always put off watching Gone With the Wind because most love stories set during a war end up being horrid movies, but it's well worth 4 hours of your time to see just why it's heralded as one of the greatest movies ever made."
"srslatten","Null","1","1","10 June 2002"," Probably The Best
","This one astounds me. I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen during it's 60th anniversary re-release in 1998. What an experience. At the time, ""Titanic"" was the big movie and I had my doubts about sitting through another epic (GWTW is 1/2 hour longer.) Fortunately, I was dragged to it. The thing that struck me immediately was how entertaining it was, even by today's standards. Usually, when watching an older film, one has to ""dumb down"" expectations a little. The only place I had to do this was with the white-washing of the slave treatment. The images of happy negroes whistling tunes can make you cringe. (Interestingly, hattie MacDaniel won an Oscar for the role of Mammie, but was not invited to the premier of the film in Atlanta.)  1930's values aside, GWTW delivers in every other way. It's comedic moments are still genuinely funny, its action, riveting. And the grand sweep of the production itself elicits the kind of emotions usually drawn only by movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""The Godfather."" It makes you want to cheer in places, cry in others. It pulls absolutely no punches; I actually found myself getting queazy in the hospital scenes, and I was shocked at the satisfied smile on Scarlett's face the morning after Rhett carries her up to bed. Audiences in the 1930's weren't quite as pure as we might think today. Rent the DVD and watch it on the biggest screen you can find, with surround sound. You'll be blown away. Definitely a 10/10.   Note: When adjusted for inflation, GWTW is far and away the biggest money-maker of all time."

For example, the main actress, VIVIEN LEIGH: She had the perfect physical appearance to do the part of Scarlet. Any of the other actresses of the moment could have done this role as well as she did; she adapted her ironic gaze and smile to Scarlet´s strong personality. And on the other hand, the plot is perfectly structured. There is no part of the film that should be omit; It has a good starting and a good ending."

The only other actor who I think could carry the part of Rhett as well as Gable did is Gary Cooper. He may not have filled the physical requirements of the part but his stature as an artist was just as great as Gable's.

","For the people who have given awful reviews of this movie they obviously do not understand the work that went into this movie over 60 years ago. Vivien Leigh, then just a 26 year old actress, portrayed Scarlett O'Hara, to a T.  She understood Scarlett because she was a Scarlett.  She obsessed about certain men, she was charming, and she was a good actress. I fell in love with Clark Gable after this film.   He made me believe in my heart that underneath sarcasm there is a heart. Olivia De Havilland was breath taking as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard was a perfect Ashley Wilkes.  Hattie McDaniel very much deserved her Oscar for playing Mammy.  Other great performances were by Thomas Mitchell, Evelyn Keyes, Ona Munson, Ann Rutherford, Barbara O'Neill, and Butterfly McQueen.

This film takes the viewer back to Civil War America so convincingly that you cannot help but be pulled into the world of Scarlett O'Hara. It is amazing that the 3 best films, in my opinion, ever (the other 2 being Casablanca & Citizen Kane) were made within 4 years of each other.

""Gone With the Wind"" was reissued when I was just a kid, and all my parents' friends were talking about how they loved this definitive romantic tale of the War Between the States. So my level of anticipation was high when my folks took me downtown to see it at the old Loews State Theater in Memphis. I was not disappointed. It was one of my first *adult* films, and I was swept away by the story and the music and the Technicolor cinematography and the sheer power of the melodrama. (A few days later, when I tried to obtain the book at the library, I actually had to get special permission to check it out with my juvenile library card.) I must have read the book ten times during junior high and high school. After I graduated college the movie was re-reissued, and I took a date to see it. She hated it and so did I. I couldn't believe I'd ever enjoyed such an overwrought potboiler. Then, some years later, Ted Turner restored the print to its original glory and I watched it on television.

","Growing up in the South with a, needles to say, southern mother I heard of this movie constantly from her when I was growing up.

The first time I saw it was when there was a re-release of it in 1976.  It seemed like a long time to sit in a theater, but why not?<br/><br/>From the moment the picture started, I sat hypnotized.  From the moment that Vivien Leigh shows up on the screen you are taken out of the present and sent back to a much gentler time.  You can feel the breeze on your face and smell magnolias.  The time seemed to fly by.<br/><br/>The sense of actually being in the lives of the characters is overwhelming. Clark Gable does a depiction of Rhett Butler that is unbelievable.  After having read the book and seeing the movie for about the 13th time I can say that I can't think of anyone in Hollywood when this movie was made that could have played Rhett any better.  Leslie Howard does a perfect job of displaying what a milquetoast Ashley Wilkes really was; living in his fantasy world of what should be and never really grasping what really is. Olivia de Haviland's Melanie compliments Howard's Ashley wonderfully by making us see that neither of them really can handle the world in an adult manner. Vivien Leigh gives us Scarlett O'Hara in perfect view from the teenager with a romantic view of everything to a powerful woman who never lets anything stop her from getting what she wants.<br/><br/>I loved the depiction of the Southern attitude towards the war: The scenes of the burning of Atlanta were, of course, so real it was great crying material.<br/><br/>I think this movie should be required viewing by all high school history classes!

","This is by far the best American Film ever made.  The acting is right on for the character.  Vivian Leigh is ideal for the melodramatic Scarlett.  Clark Gable's charm is right on and is his best acting role (closely followed by It Happened One Night).  Olivia De Havilland's idealistic Melanie is the perfect foil to the self-centered Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel is the actress that did the unthinkable; she upstaged Vivian Leigh in almost every scene the two actresses shared.<br/><br/>The movie, being nearly 60 years old, still holds up to today's standards of excellence.

"Ted-101","9","1","1","14 February 2001"," Compelling characters enrich great film of the Old South.
","Gone With The Wind is a hopelessly romantic film that has exquisite photography, breath-taking beauty, and a fast moving pace.  We follow the central character, Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) from her days just prior to the civil war, when she's a vain and spoiled girl, to the reconstruction years, when she is at last forged into a resolute woman with nerves of steel and tremendous drive to succeed in a world where despair and broken dreams are everywhere. <br/><br/>     Scarlett relentlessly pursues Ashley Wilkes, (Leslie Howard) and uses expediency, cunning, and total deception to either win him, be near him, or beguile him into betraying loving feelings for her.  Scarlett is intelligent, but her wants and needs are all she thinks about.  A cyclone could be whirling over her head and she wouldn't know it.  When the war turns against the South after Gettysburg, Scarlett is always shocked to hear... the Yankees are getting closer ... Atlanta will soon fall ... and Lee is on the brink of defeat.  You wonder if this woman ever picks up a newspaper. Callous and self absorbed, we wonder if there is a spark of good in her anywhere.  But, she remains to help Melanie have her baby, even as the Yankee bombardment rains down all around.  Yes, she did stay because of a promis she made to Ashley, but these days, how many people keep their promises?<br/><br/>     Rhett Butler, (Clark Gable) falls in love with Scarlett, because she is just like him; strong and ruthless.  He's one of the few characters that has Scarlett completely pegged, and he loves to tease her relentlessly.  The script of this film is superb.  It is full of sharp witt, and classic, rapid-fire exchanges.  Butler and Scarlett eventually marry, but after she has a baby, Scarlett closes her bedroom door on him.  For all his savvy, Rhett should have been smart enough to pass it off as a mood, but he takes her words too seriously, as firm policy.  Years later, when he swoops her off her feet and carries her up the stairs for passionate love-making, Scarlett is all smiles the next day.  Real proof he should have done it long before.<br/><br/>      Ashley Wilkes, (Leslie Howard) is the long suffering gentleman who has Scarlett stalking him relentlessly throughout the film.  Even her ""mammy"" knows it, when she says, ""Miss Scarlett, you're just going to that place because you know Mr. Wilkes will be there ... and you're going to sneak up on him like a spider!""  Scarlett works him over thoroughly whenever she gets him alone, and usually milks him for at least one ""I love you"" and a kiss. But he keeps telling her over and over he's not the man for her, that he can't match her courage or strength.  Scarlett just isn't listening or just can't accept that he maybe right.  Wilkes knows what kind of man he is. He's gentle, kind, and a bit of a softy.  But not a coward.  He commands troops during the war as a Confederate officer and has the respect of his men.  But he's right, he needs a woman like himself, and that woman is Melanie, who is kind and gentle just like he is.<br/><br/>     Melanie, (Olivia de Havilland) is a wonderful person, and in some strange way, is as remarkable as Scarlett, but with different powers.  She is completely unassuming, has no aires, thinks the best of everyone, and hasn't a vain drop of blood in her body.  Scarlett tries to steal her husband thoughout the story, and most know it, but whenever Melanie sees Scarlett, she treats her with love, friendship and warmth every time.  Of all the people in the world, Rhett Butler respects and admires Melanie more than anyone else.  Even Scarlett cannot resist Melanie's good will.  She may grumble against her on the side, but when face to face with Melanie she never ceases to be amazed at how well she is treated by her rival ... and can't help loving her and liking her in return.<br/><br/>     There is tragedy throughout the film, but Scarlett and Rhett suffer greatly towards the end.  There's so much heartbreak and harsh words, it's too much for their love to take.  Butler is more introspective than Scarlett.  He knows the war is a lost cause, knows it's foolish to get involved, but he has a conscience and joins up in the last year saying.  ""If I take a bullet I'll call myself a fool for getting into it ... but this is something I must do.""<br/><br/>     Scarlett is tough and strong, never more so than when she shoots a Yankee deserter at point-blank range on the staircase, with powder burns visible on the soldier's face.  Even Melanie knew there was no other way, and backed her up.  At the end, after getting knocked down with yet another disappointment, Scarlett won't quit.  We know ... she'll never quit.  ""I can't think about this now,"" she'll pout.  ""I'll think about it tomorrow!"" A good lesson for us all"

","As a black woman I despised having to watch this film. My mother made me watch this. She hated this film because could never speak out on why this film was disturbing to black people, but ""A film that white people hold up as one of the best movies ever made""<br/><br/>The film makes my mad because ""Prissy"" was simple minded and her mother was named ""Mammy"". Mammy of course was fat and loud but seemed to love taking care of the white folks.<br/><br/>What is shown is how rich white people suffered during the ""Civil War"" but it does not show black people that suffered the years before or after the war. In the same time period they could of shown how black people lived and how they were seen.<br/><br/>My mother took me to see this movie in 1989. She watched it with me and then said ""We Need to Stick around the Lobby after it ends"" and you will see how white will ""Go On & On"" about how wonderful it is but nobody will think about how inaccurate the film truly is. <br/><br/>Yes I hate this movie. How would white people feel if we made a 4 hour epic about the LA RIOTS of 1992. We make heroes out of the people out of all all black people and made all the cops ""On the take"".

","The acting is mediocre or histrionic, the plot is a bore. The sets are big and the costumes are good.  It had so much hype even back when they were casting for Scarlet O'Hara that no one ever maintained much objectivity about it.  Typical of that era, the blacks are displayed without any dignity at all. I didn't care about even one character.  It was an appropriate precedent to modern-day Hollywood in which enough hype and budget get all the attention regardless of quality."

","A good vine can age and thereby become even more superior but this surely isn't the case with ""Gone with the Wind"".<br/><br/>The acting had a theatrical quality to it, the relationship between colored and white were embarrassing to watch, Ashley was totally miscast and the outdoor scenes felt very much like indoor studio.<br/><br/>What was interesting to follow was the relationship between Scarlet and Rhett and specifically the way their gender roles were. Scarlet was deeply ""affected by poverty and the war"" as stated by Rhett and she had therefore developed a personality that was like a patriarch. She was cold hearted, mostly occupied with surviving and getting Tara (the family farm) back on foot again. In a sense she is the impersonation of the saying ""The south will rise again"". She has a lot of strength and will but lacks the tender side which Rhett on the other hand has. He is a very caring father, has a lot of affection towards Scarlet and is being eaten up by jealousy since Scarlett is in love with Ashley. The depiction of their roles in the relationship were interesting to engage in but at the same time their attitudes towards each other fitted to much into a pattern of ""when Rhett approaches Scarlet he is turned down and vice versa"". This made it tedious to watch in the long run.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review.

","Easily perhaps the most over-rated film of all time, ""Gone with the Wind"" would be a better movie if it ended with the war. The first half of the movie is a solid 7 out of ten nostalgic/historical piece - the script (of the first half) could be tighter and the characters a bit more realistic, but it's ""good enough"" and the large budget produced some great scenes to push it up a few notches. However, the second half of the movie is an unmittigatable disaster with more schlock and worse acting than anything that ever pushed detergent on afternoon TV. End result? A disjointed, overlong, overly sappy train wreck of a movie. While I am sure that this movie appeals to people who like the 'fairy tale' aspect to the story and the romantic idea of Southern Belles and gentlemen like Rex Butler, for me, GWTW borders on unwatchable."

"barleeku","6","7","19","29 January 2005"," Can't get past the racism
","Okay, I know it's supposed to be one of the all time epic movie masterpieces, but is it really that good? I'll give the characters a two-dimensionality - barely - but they all play through to type. You can argue it doesn't matter with this movie, that film doesn't have the same responsibility as a novel to explore the nuances of its characters' emotions. But if a film is going to make a claim to be one of the greatest all time, it should show some greater development than Scarlett turning into a spunky survivor. Ultimately, I know the movie is beautifully done with many wonderful scenes, but it's an exercise in sentimental glorification of a world that was far more brutal, ugly, and hollow than the film even hints at. I don't expect a cinematic monograph on the evils of plantation society from a 1939 Hollywood epic, but I also don't have to swallow its assumptions wholesale. The gentility moaning away on their soulless spirituals recalls the ""pastoral scene of the gallant south"" that Billie Holiday sang of in her anti-lynching song, ""Strange Fruit"". The irony is that the lynchings didn't simply date from the Civil War era in which the film takes place, but from the very year and decade in which the film was made and released. So sorry, I give it a 6 for all it does so well, but thematically it has aged very poorly."

","Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer. This film was ignored for a long time, and is now considered one of the most remarkable films ever made. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

"film-critic","4","8","23","18 December 2005"," A civilization gone with the wind...
","While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this ""epic"". The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high. I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind. Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying. Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind. It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our ""greatest love stories ever"". While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.<br/><br/>I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war. That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system. Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South. A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path. In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War. That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film. This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties. The technical aspects of this film are astonishing. While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South. The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film. For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>To begin, the stereotypes. While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society. I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters. Does that make this film dated? Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all. With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema? Is it worth of all the accolades that it received? No. In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release. This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.<br/><br/>There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent. I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story. I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist. Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him. There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable. They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end. The rest of it was just trivial. With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart. She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending. Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped. We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life. Where did his wealth come from? What was his past? Who knows Â… and none of it was fully explained. This can be said the same with Ashley. Who was this guy? Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors? Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason? Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for? Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film. They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film. Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull. All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.<br/><br/>Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film. Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades? I don't think so. I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society. From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.<br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"

"TheNabOwnzz","9","3","6","20 May 2018"," Magnificent, but not quite a great film
","There is no question that the pure artistic cinematic achievement of Gone with the Wind is extraordinary as it features one of the greatest pieces of cinematography i have ever seen, but its main purpose of connecting with main characters over such a long journey seems to be lacking a bit and therefore its reputation as one of the all time greats really isn't an objective one.<br/><br/>First we should obviously name the good, and the first thing that comes to mind is the cinematography. With such incredible indoor set design, elegant costume design, fantastic camera angles and beautiful outdoor scenery which mostly looks absolutely timeless, it is visually a masterpiece and an absolute delight to the eyes. Take the scene following Scarlett from the crane for example, slowly showing more of the victims of the civil war while Max Steiner's beautiful score plays, resulting in in itself an even emotional scene which also subtly shows us anti-war statements. However, the final scene or the scene right before the intermission with the camera showing silhouette's of characters next to a tree while zooming out when Max Steiner's score hits its climax has to be the ultimate cinematic perfection to such a long epic journey. There are also many of these kind of silhouette scenes throughout the movie, especially the first part before the intermission, and these scenes have once again gorgeous backdrops. <br/><br/>As one can tell by my praising above of most of the aspects of the film, there is mostly just one simple detail which alters my perception of the film into just a 'good' one, and that is Scarlett ( Vivien Leigh ). Scarlett is fake, manipulative, selfish, stubborn, immoral & plainly just unlikeable to a degree that you would want her to get shot from the moment you first see her. It is not possible to build an emotional connection with her, and i just did not care at all about what happens to her. Not all characters are this unlikeable, as even the sleazy and arrogant Rhett Butler ( Clark Gable ) has his good moments and is even likeable, or Melanie Hamilton ( Olivia de Havilland ) who is a stark contrast to Scarlett yet somehow the two of them can be best friends which is something that is not very realistic to start with. Unfortunately instead of following Melanie or Rhett we are subjected to 4 hours of torture because we are constantly following Scarlett and her pathetic schemes and cheating along the way. True, main characters do not have to be likeable as long as they are well developed, but Scarlett has to be one of the most annoying irritating leads in a film ever shown, and with a last hour built to severely heighten emotional value, it doesn't work because a connection with her cannot be formed. It also doesn't help that her character development is non existent as she ends as the pathetic cheat that she started out as.<br/><br/>A slightly smaller issue is that it is too fast paced, and especially when the final hour draws near main characters start dying one by one but scenes are cut short and are not dragged out which leads to one person dying and the other dying shortly after that while barely showing any of our characters responses to it. ( Except for Melanie Hamilton's, that one was done right ). In a cinematic experience, scenes, and especially scenes like this that are supposed to invoke emotion in the audience, need to be dragged out a bit so you can build a connection to it, but going from one dropping dead to the other dropping dead so quickly is a bit of an anti-climax and lessens the emotional connection because you cannot absorb what has happened before the next thing already happens. <br/><br/>It is still such an incredible experience that i cannot truly objective rate it any lower because of the absolutely beautiful cinematography, original score and long running time, but it isn't as immersive as it could have been due to Scarlett's character taking you out of the film and making you care less about what happens to her, and even to most of the people dumb enough to hang around with her. ( For example, Rhett seems like a smart guy, but still wants to marry Scarlett even though he should probably know that would end in disaster ). But its stunning visual beauty cannot be ignored and therefore its positives still far outweigh its negatives."

","Perennial, timeless classic and perhaps the most beloved movie of all time is Victor Fleming's 1939 best picture ""Gone With the Wind"". An epic in every sense of the word, and one that must be viewed with a big audience at the cinema.<br/><br/>Margaret Mitchell's novel, much celebrated in its day, about the Grand Old South at the time of the civil war, is lovingly and lavishly brought to the screen by David O. Selznick, the producer, and a cast of thousands. Vivien Leigh plays the headstrong, manipulative Katie Scarlett O'Hara very well, an attractive young Southern belle who appears to have literally dozens of beaux chasing her hand, as all the while she pines for the one love of her heart that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Clark Gable plays the dashing Rhett Butler, a womaniser who says he's not the marrying kind, but is completely taken by the determined young Scarlett. The rest of the cast are very enjoyable also, especially Hattie McDaniel who puts in a wonderful performance as the O'Hara's old mammy, an hilarious turn that is truly superb.<br/><br/>Production values are splendid too, with art/set decoration and cinematography being particularly spectacular, and Max Steiner's music nothing short of grandiose.<br/><br/>Definitely not for the restless or impatient at over three and a half hours, but certainly a must for anybody who calls themselves a movie buff or anyone who loves a sweeping saga of war and romance.<br/><br/>Sunday, August 14, 1994 - Astor Theatre<br/><br/>Best Picture for 1939, ""Gone With the Wind"" absolutely defines the word epic, and doesn't do a bad job at defining melodramatic either, or sweeping saga or whatever you like.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is positively charming as the dashing Rhett Butler, Vivien Leigh is a true diva, stunningly beautiful and incidentally not a half bad actress. In strong support of these two shining stars are Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland, as the sop Ashley Wilkes and the pure-hearted Melanie. Simply outstanding in her Oscar winning role is the O'Hara's shrewd old mammy, played delightfully by Hattie McDaniel.<br/><br/>The superlative technical team have provided some wonderful, extravagant costumes, incredibly convincing sets (Art Directors Lyle Wheeler and William Cameron Menzies) and amazing -for 1939 - special effects. The Atlanta fire is especially impressive.<br/><br/>Director Victor Fleming supplies fine direction throughout, though it is widely accepted that many others helped out (perhaps including producer David O. Selznick). Sidney Howard's screenplay adaptation does justice to Margaret Mitchell's enormous tale of the 'Grand Ole South', making for splendid story telling, though you may want to tackle it in two or three sittings. Max Steiner's music is grandiose, as is the cinematography from Ernest Haller, Ray Rennaham and Wilfrid M. Cline.<br/><br/>Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video"

","This movie was so anticipated that as soon as people started reading Margaret Mitchell's book, they clamored for a movie. The story of Selznick putting this together is one of legend. Sadly, the film hampered his later career as whenever Selznick was asked for advice after this movie, he's always answer by saying ""when we were doing GWTW.."" and then not listen to any ideas other than his own.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is no doubt a great actor, & so perfect as Rhett Butler that you'd shudder putting anyone else in the role. The same can be said for everyone pretty much in the movie. It's simply amazing how 3 directors & teams worked at putting this thing together.<br/><br/>At the time, folks thought it should have been 2 movies. I'd argue that it could have been. I'd end the first with Rhett kissing Scarlett by the bridge after their escape from Atlanta, on his way to join the Confederate Army. That way the second film would open in stark contrast to part 1, with a wrecked Tara & 12 Oaks. The second part would still be longer than the first, but each would stand on their own.<br/><br/>I used to kid people that there is a common cast member between this film & the Wizard of Oz, that Victor Fleming borrowed the ""horse of a different color"" from the Emerald City to help Rhett & Scarlett escape from Atlanta. Regardless, it is amazing that Fleming got full credit for both movies, yet had lots of help on each one.<br/><br/>What really is true is that 1939 is one of the greatest movie years ever for Hollywood under the old studio system. I am not sure if the in pending war had anything to do with this, but Gone With The Wind was at the head of some of the greatest work in film history, in the greatest year of film history.<br/><br/>Paulette Goddard, Charlie Chaplins second wife, who was considered the runner up to playing Scarlett, kept busy working on The Cat & The Canary & The Women with George Cukor that year. I believe she could have brought off Scarlett, but considering the other work she was doing then & in 1940 with The Ghost Breakers & The Great Dictator, it might be for the best that she missed this film. Besides, Vivian Leigh's Scarlett is one for the ages.<br/><br/>This film is one for the ages, & I am thankful for the restoration of the film on the latest DVD versions. This film will always be important because in reality, it is the first sound/Technicolor blockbuster film of all time."

We see her go through 3 husbands in record speed, while she still yearns for Ashley Wilkes, married to Melanie. (Olivia De Havilland) Despite fierce objections by Miss Mitchell, Leslie Howard was cast as Ashley. It was believed that Mitchell objected to Howard since the late actor was Jewish and she could not see him in that particular role. Whether anti-semitism played a part in her objection was unclear.<br/><br/>Hattie McDaniel, was the beloved, sly mammy, whose strong will kept a family going despite one tragedy after another. Both McDaniel and DeHavilland were nominated for best supporting actress; the former would win.<br/><br/>Scarlett loves Ashley but he is taken with Melanie. She marries his brother who dies of measles in the army. Frank, her 2nd husband, dies for her honor. Rhett, the real man of her dreams, becomes husband #3. Despite a wonderful life with him and bearing him a child, Scarlett can never stop thinking of her precious Mr. Wilkes.<br/><br/>There are fireworks from the actors as well as the great civil war scenes. Atlanta destroyed; the wounded crying out in agony is memorable.<br/><br/>We have carpetbaggers and scalawags ready to ravage an already ravaged south once the war ends.<br/><br/>Melanie's death, in childbirth, makes it very convenient for Scarlett. She can now divorce Rhett and have Ashley. Surprise!!!! Ashley professes never loving Scarlett who runs through the fog back to Rhett. She now realizes that she always loved him. Confusing? The confusion is worth it thanks to Vivien Leigh's forever memorable performance as Scarlett. She would win a well deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>As Rhett walks out on her, Scarlett declares that she will think about how to get him back tomorrow. This is one film to always think about.

","I have seen ""Gone With the Wind"" three or four times and I appreciate the strength of the story, direction, acting and costumes. Nevertheless, I have problems with Mararget Mitchell's racism and lack of knowledge about African Americans. Mammy who is the main black character seems to exist only to serve white people. Where is her family? Where are her children? These questions remain unanswered. Another flaw is that none of the black characters really seem to be fully dimensional human beings. What are their wants and desires? Historically, many blacks ran away from their slave masters. Others left as soon as the Civil War ended. Few stayed with their former owners. Moreover, the novel and the movie distort Reconstruction. Many of the blacks who served in the legislatures, the House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate were well educated. The country made tremendous progress in racial progress from 1865-1877. Then, it ended with the Hayes Compromise. Gone With the Wind is a fine movie,technically, but inaccurate and racist."

Rhett, for some reason beyond me, loves this more than rude woman although he barely treats her better than she treats him.

"chrisbishop5000","2","11","36","3 May 2006"," Hollywood's most loved film - but what in God's name is there to love?!!!
","Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara who is powerful, sometimes nasty, and beautiful and that matches perfectly with Clark Gable who plays the muscular, arrogant and seductive Rhett Butler who is handsome. Many of the film's characters are horribly arrogant in their own ways and that is one of the things I hate about this long, lifeless movie. Other bad points are that the film's storyline is so hard to understand, Scarlett and Rhett hardly ever get on, Rhett getting drunk so many times annoys the life out of me, all the nice characters die - like Melanie and Scalett's mother and so on, Scarlett suspects rivalry with Melanie over Ashley Wilkes who is dull and even just that little bit unattractive and I would expect someone like Scarlett to have a crush on strapping young men who have nice looks. Some scenes he looks better than others. I don't see what people love about this movie - it drags, its drama is extremely heavy, there is hardly any romance instead there's constant rowing and that doesn't create much of a love-story I don't think. It's on for 4 hours so I believe and to most people, ""Gone with the Wind"" would seem like 4 hours of romance, action, melodrama, difficult situations, stunning fire effects for Atlanta in flames - it's got the lot some may say, but I personally think that I can be so boring throughout most of its 4 hours. Very soon, in a couple of days or so I hope, my mum will watch it with me (I've got it on video and 4-disc DVD) and help me to get to know it better meaning she will hopefully help me understand the story and, who knows? I may grow quite fond of it. I do like the scene when Scarlett is forced to nurse a pregnant Melanie who is also very poorly and Prissy lies about being good at helping to drop babies she gets hit when she is caught out. I love the scene when Scarlett and Rhett take Melanie, her newborn baby and Prissy back to Tara and the fiery backdrop. It's not the best film I've ever seen I can tell you. I did watch it with mum and I did start to understand the story a bit better but I still find it rather uninteresting and irritating there really are so many things about it that irritate me arrgghh! - you wouldn't believe it! Oh, and by the way, as big, sometimes bullying and rather offencive Rhett Butler is (to all except little Bonnie who he spends his life and money around) Clark Gable was actually quite a wimp in reality and I found that out on the special 4-DVD box set. I'm not surprised he wanted to turn down the role of Rhett Butler he looks like such a twit but, I suppose, he did his best and nobody can do better than their best. Vivien Leigh looks like she's getting rather overexcited as Scarlett and not thinking about the proper character of Miss O'Hara mind you she is rather a gorgeous girl and I can see why Rhett was so jealous of the unattractive Ashley Wilkes. If you can endure people who always shout in a very grating way whenever they open their mouths ALL THE TIME instead of just talking like normal people do, seeing beautiful but abrupt Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara suspecting rivalry with a sweet-natured young lady over an ugly old man, Scarlett and Rhett's love affair lasting about a mere 10 minutes throughout a massive 4 hours, kind-hearted characters dying every two minutes at the end, seeing drunken Rhett trying to attack Scarlett and then take her daughter from her the very next morning then you are probably very likely to love GONE WITH THE WIND but if not then don't bother."
"mentalcritic","1","19","71","21 November 2004"," The true worst film of all time
","I didn't think Plan 9 From Outer Space was the worst film of all time. I think either The Creeping Terror or Gone With The Wind. At least, that's what the interviewee I refer to in my summary said. Not having seen The Creeping Terror myself, I will just nominate Gone With The Wind. The reasons why this film is horrible and overrated are numerous. Some of them may be considered politically correct, I don't know. But even the politically correct reasons have some pretty solid sub-reasons built into them.<br/><br/>One such reason, and it shows the mentality of the times, is Prissy, the maid who simply cannot seem to talk in a normal tone of voice. When she is telling Scarlett how she knows nothing about birthing babies, I could have sworn that if the lines were being ADRed (highly unlikely in those days, but bear with me), someone in the studio was putting a live wire somewhere where they probably shouldn't. African Americans constantly complain about how they are unfairly stereotyped, but I never hear them complaining about this film, which bewilders me to no end.<br/><br/>The opening crawls describe the lifestyle led by the so-called heroes as something ""gone with the wind"", hence the title. Well, things die for a reason. It's funny how they don't mention the rampant smallpox or measles that killed more Americans than the last five wars (that's wars, not three-month skirmishes) put together. Eras are only as wonderful as your investigations allow them to conclude. There are people, after all, who seem to believe the Middle Ages were a better time to live simply because the church had greater control over our society. Never mind things like bubonic plague (and people wonder why I consider Paul Verhoeven, maker of such realism exhibitions as Flesh + Blood, one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived).<br/><br/>Clark Gable makes a decent fist of his role, playing the cold, cool heroic character that has served as a prototype in everything from Elvis pictures to The Godfather. Vivien Leigh, on the other hand, is utterly annoying, and comes off more as a spoiled, bratty child than a heroine. Seriously, listen to her ""fiddle-dee-dee""s enough, and you'll be instantly reminded of that brat whose head got stuck in the lavatory bowl in a boarding school on a regular basis. Such a scene would have improved the film immeasurably.<br/><br/>And that, in a nutshell, is why I gave Gone With The Wind a one out of ten. People look back on the pre-civil war days with fondness, perhaps, but they only do so because of the rose-coloured glasses they look at the past with. Were I to make a film about the eMpTyV era that I grew up in, I'd describe it as an era that has gone with the proverbial wind, and like the one depicted here, I'd thank my stars that it has."
"mvrk","5","5","13","5 January 2019"," Oh the wrath white people had to indure during the civil war!
","Of all the people, white people had it worst during our civil war. They lost their homes, plantations, and worst of all, their relationships. The war put a heavy burden on those who were looked no for a mate. Then we are made to feel sorry for Scarlet O'Hara for feeling hungry as if no slave had ever gone to bed hungry before. And the Yankee is portrayed as this cruel lootin' and rapin' hooligan.<br/><br/>This is all what the movie portrays."

","I did not read the book, so I do not know how the original story begins and ends exactly, but for one thing, I checked the novel, I wanted to see if the novel has a first-person narration style and I did see that it has not.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I thought that there could only be one rescue for the novel to escape a type of harsh criticism, if it has a first-person narrator, we, as readers, can shape our comment with the sight of a Southern lady I figured. Yet, as I indicated before, it is presented without the first person narrator, and that's why it is irritating enough as the movie itself. I am actually bewildered by people's reviews on this movie as many cannot realize its one-sided and politically biased perspective on Civil War. It has disturbing scenes filled with folks from South who treat their slaves with such ""eloquence"", ""courtesy"", and ""consideration"" and how Unionists let these ""slaves of their own"" have property and such. Those were the times of collapse for them.. I do not even comment on characters who are akin to their sisters from Queen Victoria's Kingdom like they are thrown into this world from there, and Melanie... Oh, Melanie... What a type. No need to elucidate more as it may well be a verbose setting for a simple comment on this picture; one of the most overrated movies of all time."
"fondablaster","7","5","13","16 February 2005"," Great art + hateful characters = 65 years of debate, influence, misunderstanding and admiration
","Finally, seeing the film the way it was meant to be seen (in the newly released and restored, theatrical-ratio, letter-boxed format, digital transfer 4-disc DVD set, {phew!}) showed me more than I bargained for. ""Gone with the Wind"" has been (immediately following its 1939 release) hailed as a classic. And it does have all the makings of a classic: Sprawling sets, beautiful cinematography, amazing music, brilliant directing and the desire of two studios working together to get the job done properly. No expense was spared (and it shows) in the making of the film, and the audience was given a true visual treat. The script was fine, as most of the dialog was verbatim from Margaret Mitchell's novel, and the actors read their lines and performed their scenes to the best of their ability (some obviously better than others). Unfortunately, the problems with the picture far out weigh the positives and it was the same problems that the novel had. The characters that these wonderful to mediocre actors play are despicable. The lot of them. Scarlett is the most hateful female character I have encountered, ever. She is petty, selfish, dishonest, she puts on airs even when she has no reason to, she is unfaithful to her family (marrying her sister's romantic interest - even if it was to save the estate), she is manipulative and generally just an out and out witch (choice of first letter optional). Likewise, and making the perfect couple from Hell, Rhett is a scoundrel; an abuser, a womanizer, a drunk and would turn sides against the North or the South or his own mother if it were to raise his bank account. Ashley is horrid; he is wishy-washy (especially for a soldier), unfaithful to his wife - who is also his cousin (if not in body, most certainly in mind), weak-willed and idiotic in his decision to go to Atlanta instead of New York (away from the evil and manipulative Scarlett). Even Melanie is unlikable; at the very least because of the blind faith she places in her husband and the unwarranted, misplaced trust she places in Scarlett, if not for the incestuous relationship with Ashley. And those are just the leads! The secondary characters are no better. Mammy is arrogant and often unnecessarily angry; Prissy is a liar and a dolt; Ellen O'Hara (Scarlett's mother) is cold, bitter, distant and unpleasant, Gerald O'Hara (the father) is stubborn and rigid, and later weak and detached. In fact the only truly pleasant characters are Big Sam who saves Scarlett from attackers (much to this viewer's disappointment) and the prostitute-with-the-heart-of-gold who gives Melanie money for the hospital and later safe-houses Ashley for Rhett. And all of the above (well, except maybe Mammy, Prissy and Big Sam) are all in support of the Old South. If these characters are not hateful for the above reasons given (which they are - at least by yours truly) then they must be condemned simply for holding dearly a philosophy which, not only accepted, but championed slavery, incest and war and put more stock in keeping up appearances as opposed to accepting reality. I am not hater of great art, and I know a good movie when I see it. I loved this film for the cinematic genius that it must have taken to produce it. But watching loathsome people for nearly four hours is a bit hard to stomach, regardless of the ingenuity and obvious skill provided on-set and behind the scenes. In other classic films like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"" (and more recently with ""Falling Down"", ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Pulp Fiction""), the audience is able to enjoy the viewing experience because even though the main protagonist is disliked, dreaded or despised, at least they remain sympathetic. I did not feel sorry for one character at one time during ""Gone with the Wind"". They all got what they deserved. Even Bonnie is better off dead than have to live with the soul-sucking Scarlett as her mother. So, my final review: 10 stars out of 10 for production, direction, cinematography, musical composition and performance and faithful adaptation of the novel; 8 out of 10 stars for acting (brought up 2 whole points - one each for Clark Gable and Olivia de Havilland, both of whom were remarkable, regardless of their awful characters); 2 out of 10 stars for the characters and story (these are terrible people from head to toe, from page to screen; people whom you would walk across the street to spit on, but a 1 out of 10 stars is a score reserved for films like ""Glitter"", ""Crossroads"" and ""You Got Served""); and my overall score (10+8+2 divided by 3) is 6.7 stars out of 10. This film is obviously worth seeing and (this new version is) probably worth owning, but worth loving? I'm not so sure."
"Bryan-15","1","17","64","29 July 1998"," Utter nonsense
","This is probably the cheesiest most melodramatic nonsense to ever appear in the 20th century.  The only thing saving this is the lush photography.  I find the sentimentality stomach churning as well as 3/4 of the dialogue. Clark Gable's presence is stuck up and annoying and he just oozes greed. Vivian Leigh was a nobody when she was cast and remained just that after the movie.  The pacing, even for an old movie, is horrific and insipid. The 4 hr running time is excrutiating even if there's a violent storm outside.  This movie is just too overrated."
"zetes","5","8","25","13 July 2001"," Yuck
","Probably the most overblown, overrated classical film there is, GWTW fails in almost every account, acting being the biggest. The screenplay is poor in every respect. There are about three scenes that work, all in the first half (all the ones that are particularly famous), but the second half is nothing but dreck. Scarlette O'Hara is perhaps the most selfish, most annoying character ever committed to celluloid, and Rhett Butler is not much better. I sympathized with him, though, because his rudeness came about when having to deal with HER. And about the racism: you may attribute the casual racism to the era in which GWTW was made, but I feel this is unfair. Sure, people were racist at the time, in the North and in the South, but few in the 1930s would have argued against emancipation. This film is NOT just trying to depict how things were in the 1860s, but is actually arguing for slavery. And against the 15th amendment (? maybe 14th; blacks' right to vote, anyways). There is a scene where carpetbaggers are shown as cowardly, evil people as they try to convince black men to vote. How evil this movie is.<br/><br/>For comparison, read the novels of William Faulkner. It would be wrong to deny that he was racist, but, unlike GWTW, he writes about similar events with intelligence. In his novel The Unvanquished, there is a scene that is cognate to the carpetbaggers' trying to get the black men to vote. He does not, however, depict the carpetbaggers as caricatures, but depicts the pathos of the situation.<br/><br/>So the question arises: why does this Margaret Mitchell crap still exist when we as Americans have William Faulkner's insightful novels? It's just the stupidity of this country, I guess."

Now, where was the good part? Yes: no happy ending!"
"castiron-2","3","10","34","9 March 2001"," Not bad, perhaps, but soooo overrated...
","I just don't get the big deal about this movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call it actively bad, but why everybody insists on praising it to high heaven is beyond me.<br/><br/>Sure, the statistics are impressive enough: monster length, color, all-star cast, ambitious special effects which were probably unique at the time. It's clear enough that the movie *wants* to be big. The problem is that sheer flamboyance by itself does not make a great movie. The heart of a truly brilliant movie is in the characters and the plot.<br/><br/>And there's the rub. Neither the characters nor the plot do much for me. The characters are, to put it mildly, unlikable. Scarlett in particular has no redeeming features at all; she is just the whiniest, prickliest, most selfish piece of mischief I have ever wanted to say ""Frankly, my dear, you make me want to hurl"" to. The other characters are either just as selfish and unlikable or so downtrodden that my initial pity for them has eroded away to nothing by the end of the movie (another drawback of its ambitious length).<br/><br/>As to the plot--well, it's basically one melodramatic potboiler run into another melodramatic potboiler run into another... I can stand (even like) melodrama in small doses, but ""as God is my witness, this movie will never move me to tears again"" (as a matter of fact it never did in the first place, but anything for a pun...).<br/><br/>For the reasons just outlined, I do not agree with the widespread opinion that this is a great movie. Whether it is a good movie is a matter of taste and probably depends largely on how easily one can stomach its lesser flaws, the most glaring of which is its casual racism (that one carpetbagger just *had* to be an ""uppity n---er,"" didn't he?). But I wouldn't call it a flawed masterpiece--just a flawed melodramatic potboiler with rather uninteresting characters."

","The immortal ""Gone With the Wind"" is regarded as a classic in many quarters, both with film historians and the general public. However, labeling it as such might be stretching the truth somewhat. It may have been the most financially successful film in the history of motion pictures, but box-office receipts do not automatically translate into quality. The film has many strong points, but it also has its share of weaknesses; being completely uncritical towards it, as many have been, is a closed-minded attitude. It went through several different directors and writers, most of whom have not received credit for their efforts, which may explain its unevenness. The true ""author"" of the film is legendary producer David O. Selznick, to whom the movie was his pride and joy.<br/><br/>The first half is undeniably the strongest, containing most of the scenes that have cemented it into film legend. One of the most memorable shots is of the camera pulling back to reveal hundreds of dead and wounded soldiers on the streets of Atlanta. The sequence showing much of the city being burned is dramatically potent and visually compelling. A genuinely moving scene depicts the townspeople eagerly awaiting word of their loved ones' fates on the front, and their reactions to the inevitable bad news. The epic sweep of the Civil War is staggering, and for once the story is being told from the ""other side's"" perspective. The cinematography and set design is of uniformly high quality. However, the remainder of the movie, while still well-done, is overlong and redundant at times. At this point, most of the story has already been told, so chunks of it could easily have been omitted without harming the narrative. It threatens to become a soap opera, but the stars' chemistry help somewhat.<br/><br/>The best performance comes from Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett O' Hara. I admit to disliking her character at first, since she initially came off as a spoiled brat. However, as the film went on, the character grew on me. It was interesting to see how she adapts to new situations; she grows from a privileged, dainty young woman to a survivor, forced to salvage a meager existence from what is left of her estate. Leigh herself is consistently compelling, regardless of O' Hara's shortcomings. Though Clark Gable is first billed, his Rhett Butler character is actually a supporting player; he nonetheless gets some of the best material, and has great chemistry with Leigh. There are also solid supporting performances from Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland. However, Butterfly McQueen is simply irritating as a servant girl.<br/><br/>Hattie McDaniel has been noted as the first black person to win an Oscar, and she does a fine job of transcending what could have been a gross stereotype. ""Gone With the Wind"" may not be politically correct by today's standards, but it's not nearly as racist as I'd been led to believe. Nonetheless, the depiction of the Old South is still too romanticized. In fact, this aspect of the film is what dates it the most. Its downplaying of issues such as slavery or racism seems (at best) naive today. The fact that viewers continue to cherish it after more than sixty years does say something about its lasting appeal though. Despite these more complex and cynical times, its romantic allure is still, at least for some people, just as strong as ever.<br/><br/>*** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by MGM"

","Gone with the Wind is an extraordinary book and I was looking forward to seeing the movie, but it was horrible. It cut out so much important from the book and included all the minor details. And all the good lines were changed, and the actors don't look like their characters at all! Viven Leigh does not even remotely look like what Margaret Mitchell described Scarlett to be. Her eyes aren't even green! And Clark Gable DOES NOT look a bit like Rhett Butler. He's too kind to Scarlett. Rhett is supposed to be sarcastic and disliked. That's what makes the whole thing fun. He finds something to laugh about (even if its not right to laugh about) and makes Scarlett laugh too. And the other actors were good as actors, but not as who they were supposed to be. The movie cut out a lot of scenes when Scarlett arrives in Atlanta, and it gets rid of all of Wade's early scenes and Melanie isn't even pregnant when she's supposed to be! These scenes were probably cut out because they didn't have Rhett in them, but its not Rhett's movie! Clark Gable's role can't be made into a leading one when its not! Rhett Butler is a supporting role and Scarlett is supposed to be the star, but in the movie almost all of Scarlett's scenes without Rhett are cut out. All in all this movie was a waste of four perfectly good hours. I'm just going to go read the book again- at least that's the way its supposed to be."

","Why is it so popular? Especially with the apparently popular line at the end. What was that all about?! Wasted 4 hours of my life! What I hated about this movie is, my favorite people died, Rhett left Scarlett in the end, she never changed, and she was so fickle about who she loved or who she hated. Besides, it really had nothing to do with wind or the civil war. People, don't watch it because it's so popular and because of the dumb line at the end. Please don't waste your life watching this!

I was fully in a mindset of eager treasure-hunting, film-wise (I assumed I'd appreciate this as the ""masterpiece"" it's said to be), but sadly I realized that, while this is a good film, it's certainly not worthy of the time-honored accolades it's amazingly managed to accumulate.<br/><br/>As an American History major, I appreciate the period. The characters are, however, thinly-drawn caricatures trapped in a lingering melodrama.<br/><br/>The acting is over-the-top, unconvincing.

Clark Gable seems like he wishes he was somewhere else during his scenes, very distant. Vivien Leigh's performance was as dull(two dimensional) as dull can be. Reminded me of Madonna in Evita. The background landscape imagery was a real distraction. Looked like they did scenes in front of a motion picture screen. I guess they couldn't afford to do location shots. The lighting is terrible, indoor and outdoor scenes. The cinematography was mediocre at best. Not much happens during the 3 plus hours, that could have been covered in 1 hour.

There seems to be an obsession among romance writers about the antebellum South; this movie (and the book that spawned it) was no exception.<br/><br/>The film itself would be just another Hollywood big-production weepie except for the treatment of African American characters.  Any who didn't kiss the Massa's rear end are portrayed as evil and dangerous (coveting Miss Scarlett and other Flowers of Southern Womanhood, naturally), and the others are portrayed as child-like and nearly helpless, with the exception of Mammy (Hattie McDaniel).  Here's a fun fact -- Klansmen are shown as good guys here!  It all adds up to one word: repulsive.  Yeah, I know it was made in 1939.  Guess what -- it's 2000 now.  We should be embarrassed by this flick,not celebrating it, just like Birth of a Nation (1915).<br/><br/>I remember when Roots was on TV in 1976 and the Klan protested and asked for equal time.

","One of the longest movies I have watched. It was like diving into another world or a lot similar to time traveling. If you are not a fan of long duration movies like me, it will be very difficult to finish in one sitting. And the background music that never seems to stop makes it barely tolerable. But the annoying need of 'to know how it ends' kept me going and in one sitting! Now thinking back I'm glad that I did so. Even though the story description says about a girl so spoiled I see it differently. Maybe because I belong to the twenty first century where we witness much worse levels of ""spoiledness"". A girl with limited span of experience trying to survive and thrive in the physical and emotional conflicts that follow afterwards in the best way she thinks she is capable of. Nevertheless the character Scarlett; the protagonist is not easy to like or to approve. Yet she is interesting to observe and comical in more than one occasion. The gorgeous Viviane Leigh portrays her perfectly. And in the end she comes to a stage where anyone will come after such a hard journey disregard of the defeat or the victory that they might experience. It's a wonderful story yet we are so accustomed to everything fast delivered it's prone to get boring and tempting to walk away.

","Gone With The Wind is one of the best classics I have seen in a long time. Normally, I find lengthy movies to be a bit boring, but this one did not get tiring even after about four hours. It was partly because I had seen the colored version of the movie rather than the black and white one. Still it manages to sweep everyone's hearts.<br/><br/>The story itself goes so much with its title. Its certainly one of the best novel adaptions. The title is one of the best ever given to a novel/movie. IT also features some magnificent performances by Vivien Leigh and Cary Grant. In fact, the supporting cast, especially Hattie and Olivia were brilliant.<br/><br/>It is especially hard to like the arrogant, selfish, snooty and self-centered Vivien but that's how the story is and Vivien plays the character with finesse. I felt very sorry for Cary Grant and he took the right decision in the end. There is a huge cast giving fabulous performances. <br/><br/>The novel to movie transformation has been done so well. Certainly one of the best movies I have seen. 9 out of 10."
"preppy-3","10","3","7","19 February 2008"," What more can be said?
","This takes place before, during and after the Civil War. Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) sees her family and country torn apart by the war. She's also inexplicably in love with weak-willed Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). However he marries sickingly sweet Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett pines after him but she then meets rough tough Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who wants her.<br/><br/>It's kind of difficult to make any fair critical assessment of the this film. You either love it or hate it. I happen to think this is easily one of the best movies ever made. It does have some minor problems: Howard is way too old to play Ashley (even he said he was all wrong for the part); Scarlett's obsession with Ashley is never really explained; some of the treatment of blacks is pretty racist--especially in the character of Prissy (although Mammy seems more intelligent than anyone else in the film) and the chronology of the Civil War itself is highly suspect. Still all these problems are trivial because the rest of the picture is so great.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot in rich Technicolor; the score is just simply one of the best ever written; the direction is simply superb (hard to believe that three different directors worked on this); the attention to detail in this film is incredible and despite the almost 4 hour length you're never bored. The acting is great--Leigh (completely covering her accent)understandably won an Academy Award for this; Hattie McDaniel is a tower of strength as Mammy--she was the first black person to ever win an Academy Award; I always thought Gable was too old for his role but he really grows on you; de Havilland does wonders playing an impossibly sweet woman and everyone else is good--right down to the bit parts. Also this movie has some of the most quoted lines in history--""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""; ""I've birthed lots and lots of babies""; ""With God as my witness I'll never be hungry again"" and of course ""after all tomorrow is another day"".<br/><br/>Don't let the 220 minute length deter you--this is a true classic. A 10 all the way."
"eyeoftheliger","Null","7","23","10 December 2016"," This terrible film has been canonized, granted diplomatic immunity and is completely immune to criticism
","There are many problems with this film. Three major problems: it's a bad film and it's politically incorrect (to say the least), but I said three. The third problem is that the second problem (politics of the film) has overtaken the discussions of this ""work of art"" that we cannot discuss the former.<br/><br/>I don't want to discuss the politics or racial controversies in this film. It has been discussed to death and I have nothing new to add. <br/><br/>Even if it weren't racist/controversial, even if you see nothing wrong with any of the politics of the film, it's still a terrible film.<br/><br/>It doesn't stand up to many modern films, modern writing techniques, modern character development, modern storytelling, etc. This is partly unfair, it would be like ""comparing cave paintings to Renaissance era masterpieces."" Cinema was primitive, but it was not that primitive. A more fair comparison would be medieval art with early renaissance art. The problem is that this film (1939) does not stand up to films not made today (2016), but even films from the 60's.<br/><br/>It's not fair to compare this to modern films, but the unfairness is on modern films. This film is given a +5 star bonus on a 1-10 scale for being old. <br/><br/>La Grand Illusion, released a year before, is a better film. I have to mention this line because of the Gone With The Wind Defense League attacking anyone who disagrees with these lines:<br/><br/>1. You're just a Michael Bay fan. If a movie doesn't have explosions, you get bored very quickly. There's more to art than car chases. 2. You have a short attention span. 3. You want sex in films. You don't get films about family. 4. Millennials. Twitter-generation kids hate old stuff.<br/><br/>Etc. etc. I've heard it all. <br/><br/>I don't like Michael Bay's films, nor comic book films. I don't like action films all that much. I don't care for sex in films. If it adds to the story, good, if not, cut, cut, cut.<br/><br/>But that's the thing with this film. Cut is not a word they used off the set. It's 4 hours long for no reason. You could cut so much without affecting the story. It is needlessly long.<br/><br/>If someone were to make a 4-hour film with this exact script, critics would criticize the length, but this film gets a free pass because of it has the numbers ""1939"" next to its name.<br/><br/>The characters are one-dimensional and unrealistic. Forget backstory, some characters don't even have real names. There's no excuse for poor writing.<br/><br/>Sadly, the discussion of this film has been reduced to two sides: A: It's great, but it's racist. B: It's sucks because it's racist.<br/><br/>But the real thing is it just sucks (and it's racist.)<br/><br/>Cutting out all the racist stuff won't make this a better film. <br/><br/>Racial stereotypes are not just evidence of racism, but of poor writing. I've seen films that are more racist but were much better, had better characters, give depth, motives and personality to their characters, they aren't stereotypes, clichés and stock characters.<br/><br/>It's a 1930's soap opera - melodramatic, cheesy, insincere, ponderous and weak.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot, and that's where the +1 comes from. Otherwise I'd give it a zero, which is not possible on this site."
"Burleigh7","4","6","19","24 April 2009"," An Epic, Lushly Filmed Soap Opera is Still a Soap Opera
","Gone With The Wind has a reputation as an all time classic, but it is unfortunately hollow and even fluffy. The film is ultimately a four hour soap opera concerning the travails of a spoiled brat, an obnoxiously self centered loud mouthed young woman. Scarlett is not easy to like, and neither is the smug Rhett. It's difficult to sit through four hours with two lead characters that are hard to sympathize with. The film romanticizes the south in a laughably superficial depiction, and the portrayal of African Americans are demeaning stereotypes; it's too bad that the first African American Oscar Winner, Hattie McDaniel, had to play such an exaggerated stereotype to win. Of course, this was 1939, so it wouldn't be so much of a problem if the rest of the film was not so melodramatic, especially the last quarter of the film. The rather limited story is stretched to fit the epic running time, but it feels flat rather than majestic. You may say it's a timeless classic, but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

"CBlackwood157","9","2","4","29 January 2015"," Historical Accuracy
","On December 20, 1860, South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union, launching the nation into a civil war that ravaged the country for four years. Although the war officially ended in 1865, the conflict in which it stirred would cause much pain and turmoil for many years after, especially for the defeated southern states. <br/><br/>In the movie Gone with the Wind, a romanticized version of the old south is portrayed. Many scenes display vibrant colors and extravagant lifestyles led by the people of this civilization. The plot line follows a spoiled girl named Scarlett O'Hara and her struggles during and after the war. It shows how the south was stripped of all of the extravagance and laid to waste.<br/><br/>As far as historical accuracy goes, the way the south was portrayed had some truth, but there were also aspects that might have been a little twisted. Throughout the movie, the people of the southern states are made out to be faultless and all of their afflictions were caused by the ""yankees"" of the north. When looking at history, the south was the main instigator of the war. It was only when states began seceding the north got involved, desperate to keep the nation from falling apart. <br/><br/>Another aspect that was twisted is the attitude of the slaves towards their enslavement. All of the slaves in the movie seem content with their position. This attitude is obviously not historically accurate. Of course, there were some slaves that were not treated badly by their masters, but not once in the movie did a slave show animosity towards his/her position.<br/><br/>Despite some of these inaccuracies, some aspects of the movies did have historical significance. I felt the movie did a good job in conveying how the southerners were mistreated after the war. It was very interesting to get perspective from the characters while they were rebuilding their old home and getting their hands dirty for the first time in their lives. This was really how it was after the war was over. The southerners had everything taken from them, and many of their homes were burned to the ground. They had to start over and forge a new life from the ashes of their old civilization. I found this aspect to be true to history.<br/><br/>Watching the movie without taking history into account, I found it to be quite enjoyable. The engaging storyline kept me watching for more, and I thoroughly enjoyed observing Scarlett's transformation in character as the events in her life callous her. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a strong female character, or a film with a deep plot line."

Gone With The Wind shows us a rich and obsessive girl's mind and how the harsh situations like war change her life.<br/><br/>The story makes us part of the film, even if we don't really feel connected to a single character. We feel different about a character in different situations, sometimes we despise and sometimes we feel sorry. I certainly remember a time when i didn't gave a thought to where Frank Kennedy was.<br/><br/>The 2 year wait for Clark Gable as Rhett Butler certainly paid off. Event though Vivien Leigh's (Scarlett) initial acting looks like stage acting for the rest of the movie its good. The sets are certainly very grand of production days. But the cinematography take it to a next level. The color of the sky certainly makes you love Tara (Scarlett's Mansion).<br/><br/>And just to conclude, the movie ends with one of the greatest dialogue in the history of cinema."
"dwpollar","8","2","4","1 May 2014"," Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy...
","1st watched 4/27/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy in the anti-heroes of Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivian Leigh. Yes -- the movie is about the downfall of the old South, how people learn to survive thru desperate times, but mostly it's a saddening portrait of lost souls, in my opinion. The movie begins as 2 plantations in the pre-Civil war south live a life of grandeur but it is soon challenged by an inevitable war that threatens to ruin the fantasy world that they lived in -- and thus is ""Gone with the Wind."" Scarlett is a character that is used to getting what she wants due to her prestige or her good looks -- but she definitely can't handle things initially with they don't go her own way. She learns to manipulate and do whatever it takes to attempt to have her needs satisfied but constantly is denied her main pursuit which is trying to get her sister's fiancée to love her, and she pursues this up to almost the end of the movie. Rhett Butler is a wanderer who is really a lot like Scarlett but does eventually learn primarily because of having a daughter. This movie, based on the Margaret Mitchell novel, is mostly about character and shows us the examples of good and bad and the results of each's actions. The good souls are portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and Leslie Howard. Maureen as Scarlett's sister rarely does any wrong and Howard's character continually fight's off his temptations, but the other main characters do very little right. With so much sadness in this movie it's amazing it is so well liked. I believe the deeper meaning comes thru and people cling to that as I did while viewing this very uniquely filmed movie which does some amazing things with shadows with the cinematography overall being excellent. Despite the long length of the movie it keeps your interest, but I believe it would be a hard movie to watch more than once...I'm glad I gave it the once, and I understand why the movie was so critically acclaimed."

","The period of 1939-1940 was, quite possibly, the greatest period of movie production in the history of cinema. Several extraordinary movies were released during this period, the pinnacle of which is ""Gone With The Wind"".<br/><br/>The entire film is shot in Color, which is incredible when you consider that the length of the film meant that production costs at the time were stratospheric versus the standard black-and-white.

Even at that time I was aware at how enormous the picture was (though the length at that point in my life likely influenced my opinion more than anything else).<br/><br/>This still is one of the most accurate records of the aristocracy in the southern states during the Antebellum period, and the impact on that society as the nation advanced through the Civil War.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this film, I truly believe this is a movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives."
"daumi500","10","2","4","11 January 2014"," An unforgettable movie, the story of a woman ahead of her time.
","The unforgettable movie ""Gone with the wind"" is certainly a landmark in the history of cinema. The film was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by author Margaret Mitchell, and had the backdrop of the civil war between the North and the South of the United States, which has also been called the ""war of secession"". It charmed generations, and is considered the most beloved and unforgettable movie of all time, and the most watched, because it can reunite the elements that hold the viewer's attention. Filmed in color with the new technology Technicolor and Cinemascope, the movie was released in 1939, presenting a dramatic storyline, a strong soundtrack and the magnificent performance of Vivien Leigh for the character Scarlett, that led her to win an Oscar for the best actress in that year. ""Gone with the wind"" was also nominated to other Oscar categories, won eight and, outside of the traditional nominations, won two other special ones (an honorarium and an other technical). I still remember the time when I was a teenager; I had not completed my 13 years yet when I watched this movie for the first time. It was love at first sight, because I enjoyed everything, especially the charisma of the character Scarlett O'Hara, who even in the face of adversity has never been shattered by something or someone. My attachment to this film was so great that after having watched it for more than five times, I decided to even read the book, which I thought was wonderful. It is a volume with more than 1000 pages. The movie starts in the year 1861, where in front of the spectator opens the scenario of a lush southern farm cotton plantation in the State of Georgia named Tara, where the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a spoiled and willful young woman receives the news that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man who was bored with his life, will marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia Havilland). Scarlett is in love with Ashley, and decides to confess her love for him at a barbecue offered by Ashley's parents, at Twelve Oaks. There Scarlett meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who was hiding in the library at the time of her revelation. Rhett was known as a good living and seductive man. He was enchanted by Scarlett and he promised to keep her secret. At a given time one hears the news that the war has been proclaimed. Scarlett, in order to hurt and to be close to Ashley, accepts to marry Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks), brother of Melanie. Charles, with typhus, died in battle and Scarlett became a widow. The war continues and Atlanta is under siege. Scarlett decides to run away toward Tara, helped by Rhett. There she faces many adversities and she makes an oath: ""God is my witness. God is my witness they're not going to beat me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. Neither I nor anyone in my family. Even if I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill, God is my witness that I'll never be hungry again"". Again in trouble, Scarlett creates situations and uses trickery to achieve her goals. The film ending is surprising to everyone, because Scarlett discovers something she herself did not know. This movie shows Scarlett's determination depicting a woman ahead of her time."

Everyone in the supporting cast was excellent, especially Olivia DeHavilland, Leslie Howard, Thomas Mitchell, and Ona Munson! Now we come to the real star of this movie- Clark Gable! As far as I am concerned, he stole this movie with his great performance-his charm, humor, forcefulness, and humanity seemed to dominate the movie! Oh, how I wish there had been a tie for Best Actor Academy Award that year- Robert Donat for his great performance in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and Clark Gable for his great performance in ""Gone With The Wind""! If ever there was a year for a tie for Best Actor Academy Award, it was that year!"

","Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a 16 year old headstrong Southern belle just before the civil war. At every picnic and gathering of folks near her father's plantation in Georgia, our Miss O'Hara is knee deep in admiring men, for she is beautiful and saucy. Unhappily for her, however, the one gentleman she really has eyes for, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), doesn't seem to be interested in becoming a suitor, although he considers her a friend. This is because, after tradition, Ashley has been ""promised"" for a long time to his distant cousin, Melanie (Olivia DeHavilland). Being a bold lady, Scarlett tries to court HIM, when she is supposed to be napping before a ball. He turns her down, reluctantly and leaves the room. Scarlett throws a fit and a piece of china and narrowly misses another man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). From that moment, Mr. Butler has admiration for Scarlett, for he has defied a few conventions himself. Stung from Ashley's rejection, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother in haste, for the war has just started and he must leave to fight. Through the war, Scarlett and Melanie live together in Atlanta and when Sherman comes marching, Rhett rescues the ladies and actually declares his love for Scarlett, before leaving her on the road home, as he is enlisting, finally. She is as mad as a hatter, both from his hot kisses and his abandonment. Yet, Miss O'Hara makes it home, keeps hold of the plantation through the reconstruction period and still harbors love for Mr. Wilkes. Yet, when Scarlett's second husband dies, she agrees to, at last, marry Rhett, for he is very rich. But, will it be love everlasting? Wait and see. First, let me state that I LOVE the book and got it as an eighth grade birthday present. It is one of the great love stories of all time, set in the South at a difficult point in history. But, I've never been overly fond of the movie. There are several reasons. The cast, while some call it a ""dream"", is merely good. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the faithful mammy of Scarlett, is my favorite while Leigh, Howard and DeHavilland are certainly fine. Gable is good, too, but he's not my idea of the perfect Rhett, though many others think so. I always wanted Burt Reynolds, in his ""Dan August"" heyday to star in a new version, for he was smoking hot. Obviously, this won't happen. But, while sets, costumes, and photography are nicely done, the script is overly melodramatic and maudlin, taking power away from the story, and the direction must be blamed, too. All in all, there are so many remakes of classics today, why doesn't someone give this one a modern take? But, it probably won't occur, for most film fans, unlike myself, consider this the classic of all classics and feel any new version would fall on its face."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","8 March 2012"," Truly one of the greatest films ever made
","Having seen Casablanca earlier and liking it enough, I decided to give Gone with the Wind a go. After all, tonight I had six hours to spare, and seeing how long it was, this would be one of the only recent times where I would be able to watch it in the comfort of my own home without anyone to bother me. Well, I put off watching it this long because it never seemed that interesting. As it turns out, I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>The film's plot summary doesn't do it enough justice. This is really the tale of a woman in the turn of the Civil War and onwards. It is interesting to note that it's told from the perspective of her and many others living in the South, and the historical background of the film also gives it a deeper meaning. It's intriguing to see the different events in history take place, but also how they affect a small group of characters. But the film is essentially a character study of Scarlett O'Hara. Because of the iconic scenes already known all too well, even I knew the infamous ending line said by Gable, and also how the lead female was, ""unlikable"", to say the least. But I thought a film with a female like this would center on the male, and then be about how he meets her. Much to my surprise, it is the female's story, and how she meets several people throughout this time. It is her film, and it's not until about two-thirds into the film that Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) becomes a lead character. <br/><br/>Since I don't want to get into much of the plot and actual events that take place, I want to talk about the performances. The supporting cast is fantastic. Olivia De Havilland and Hattie McDaniel give the film the two most noble and giving characters, in their own ways of course. I knew McDaniel looked familiar, and sure enough she's the famous first- time African-American winner. She's fantastic really, nothing else to be said. But It's Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh that are the film's central power and focus. Vivien Leigh gives the single greatest female performance I have ever seen, and no, I don't use that term lightly. I have never seen her in any other film, but she's completely mesmerizing here. All of her flawed traits also make the character the best female character I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on screen. One doesn't know if we should like her or not, but damn is she a joy to watch. She isn't merely ""acting"" here, she embodies the character in a way that feels completely effortless. Because the film's script gives her a whole lot to work with, she injects humor, sadness, frustration, empathy, and even sympathy, maybe all at once. Every single facial expression, every single gesture is easily visible and perfectly portrayed. And really, it's not such an easy character to bring to the screen. In order for this to work, even if we don't like her all the time, we must still feel something for her and be intrigued by her. Leigh doesn't fail once. Clark Gable has a much more sympathetic character to work with, and he also does it naturally. His charm, wit, and humor mixed with the darker moments in his role create perhaps the best romantic male lead ever on screen. The way he sees Scarlett, the way that he communicates with her in the first two hours are refreshing and unique, to say the least.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned before, the characters, and the script of course, are really grade-A stuff. Technically, it's also amazing. From the opening shot to the last, it sweeps you off your feet. You have probably seen many single shots of the film many times before, but all in the context of it they all work perfectly. It's really impossible to find any glaring flaw in the cinematography, or even the incredibly passionate and soaring music score. The editing is brilliant, and must be congratulated for making a nearly 4-hour film go by so quickly. I know someone saying that seems like an exaggeration, but it's really not. It's incredibly entertaining for the simple reason that it's just so incredibly interesting and intriguing.<br/><br/>I did take a long time to see this, and normally epic films like this don't ignite anything in me, but this did... oh, it really did. The only other time that a classic film that was deemed among the ""greatest ever"" left me speechless by the end was 2001: A Space Odyssey (which I do consider my favorite film). Oh, and what about that ending? One of the best endings ever, and that final line is as perfect as I could hope for. Don't put off watching it like I did, you won't regret it. One of the greatest films ever made, indeed."

","I have not read the novel upon which this is based. Even though I've only just now seen this, I've known about a ton of scenes for years. This has been referenced and spoofed countless times, a sure sign that it has simply become part of popular culture. Everybody knows this, and it sure is difficult to argue with its greatness or its massive influence on movie-making. This film has an epic scope, and is a fantastic, sweeping love story. The pacing is spot-on, and while this has a running time of around three hours and forty minutes, it is never boring. It is simply so engaging and interesting. All roles are well-cast, and the acting is flawless. Leigh is impeccable, as is Gable, and frankly, everyone else. The characters are well-written, marvelously developed and their actions and, where applicable, growth, ring true as being entirely credible. Dialog has utterly golden, unforgettable and quotable lines, and is always delivered to perfection. The music is a grand, instrumental score. This is well-edited throughout, and the cinematography is excellent. There is some violent content in this, as well as the singular use of mild language that we all know. Sexuality is at most hinted at. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10"
"n-mo","10","2","4","29 July 2009"," Gone with the Wind moments
","A dear friend of mine said she'd definitely had a few of those during her sojourn in Atlanta, but frankly, you don't need to go all the way there to understand what that means. ""Gone with the Wind"" is a film about life: heaven and hell, heroes and villains, rich and poor, authority and obedience, love and hatred, civilisation and barbarism. Some deny that distinctions exist or ought to exist; others believe steadfastly that they are always on one side or the other, but as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn knew, and as ""Gone with the Wind"" shows, there is indeed a line and it oscillates not between humans but within every human heart.<br/><br/>Some, like the foreman, choose to eclipse any light totally in this world before going to hell, indulging without heed in vice and avarice. Some, like Melanie, conscientiously shine as brightly as possible, aware of their own weaknesses and working with them. Then there is every level in between: Belle, who lives in the dark but admires and even longs for the light that she can't bring herself to reach out and take; Ashley, who lives in the light and loves it passionately but whose sensibility allows him to tiptoe indulgently into the darkness...<br/><br/>... and, of course, Scarlet and Rhett, who strike the balance. Of course, the difference is that Scarlet will not come to terms with what she is, for that would force her to change. Rhett confesses his dark side openly and thinks it a necessary sacrifice... but one he hopes to overcome, some way, somehow.<br/><br/>But it is the setting of ""Gone with the Wind,"" in a civilisation in peril, that is essential to the understanding of the entire film. The balance of civilisation versus barbarism is the windpipe upon which this entire piece is tuned. One cannot appreciate ""Gone with the Wind"" without having tasted true civilisation, and so I fear its popularity may decline if my generation of Americans continues living in stifling, bland suburbs, never petting a real horse, seeing truly decorative art outside a museum or hearing liturgical music in a real Church--and insulating itself whenever it comes close to (the remnants of) a civilisation, and if Europe continues to sell itself to Americanist infatuations (which it has recommenced in vigour since the end of last year).<br/><br/>Those of us who intend to preserve some sort of civilisation, however, can only love ""Gone with the Wind,"" and can only speak of its strengths."
"michael_the_nermal","9","2","4","9 February 2009"," Vivien Leigh Pulls This Amazing Epic
","Warning! Some Spoilers<br/><br/>""Gone With The Wind"" succeeds largely on the strengths of its lead actors, and Selznic Productions were blessed to have an emotive, powerful lead in Vivien Leigh. While far from a saintly or sympathetic character, Scarlett O'Hara, the epic's protagonist, is given life through Leigh's passioned acting. While Scarlett is a conniving, mendacious person who uses people to get her way, we feel for her character thanks to Leigh's involved acting. Her facial expressions and body language add depth to the role and make her a pleasure to watch throughout the movie's nearly four-hour length.<br/><br/>Other great actors in the film include Olivia de Haviland as the long-suffering wife of Scarlett's love Ashley, Melanie. Hattie McDaniel also lends power to her role as Mammy, who serves as sort of a moral compass and conscience which Scarlett, lamentably, does little to follow. Clark Gable is absolutely perfect as the powerful male lead to counter Leigh's Scarlett. He convincingly portrays the roguish, tough, manly, yet sensitive and kind-hearted Rhett Butler. Still, even the character of Rhett is no match for the power of Scarlett's presence, and if one must must decide who is the better actor between Leigh and Gable, Leigh's presence is ultimately more indelible.<br/><br/>The set designers pulled out all of stops to create realistic-looking sets and costumes to evoke the feel of 1860s and 1870s Georgia. It was money well spent. It's hard to believe nowadays that films could with hundreds of flesh-and-blood extras and real pyrotechnic effects, in the days of computer animation. The effects and sets still dazzle almost seventy years later, mostly because we know they're REAL.<br/><br/>The title of the film, and much of the historical background which precipitates Scarlett's transformation as a character, presents a vision of American history that modern audiences---myself included---will find very difficult to swallow. The film presents the Reconstruction in a laughably melodramatic fashion, with evil Northern carpetbaggers (with literal carpetbags!) colluding with newly-freed black politicians to trample the defeated plantation aristocracy and tax them out of existence. The movie is highly negative in its portrayal of the Northern governors of the occupied South, and real historians may question not only the depiction of the historic events in the movie, but the movie's attempt to idealize the antebellum period. It seems fitting that the rough-cut premiere of ""Gone With the Wind"" was presented in a mission-style movie theater in downtown Riverside, California, where the nearby Mission Inn also attempts to present an image of an idealized past that may not have accurately reflected historical reality (in this case, the era of Spanish and Mexican rule in California).<br/><br/>Still, if modern audiences can get past the melodramatic treatment of history (which, nonetheless, is essential to the film's plot), they will be rewarded with an entertaining and intriguing movie anchored by a powerful, resourceful (if amoral) female protagonist, which is a treat to see in a world where there are few powerful female characters. Like ""The Godfather"", this movie's timelessness rest on its powerful acting. Please watch this epic film (though take two days if you can: its huge length is too much to take in one sitting)."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","2","4","10 November 2008"," A gorgeous Technicolor epic that has stood the test of time
","""Gone with the Wind"" is a film that needs no introduction. I mean, who isn't familiar with the quote, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn""? Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara are household names and the film itself is regarded as a timeless classic more than seventy years after its initial release.<br/><br/>One part of the film's enduring appeal is its stars. Vivien Leigh, besides looking absolutely stunning, delivers a top-notch performance which won her an Oscar. Another well-deserved Oscar went to Hattie McDaniel in the Supporting Actress category. In winning that award she beat out Olivia de Havilland who turned in an excellent performance herself. Finally, let's not forget Clark Gable who received a Best Actor nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>The film's look is simply breathtaking, being absolutely drenched in sumptuous Technicolor. It's no wonder that the film won Oscars for cinematography & art direction, not to mention an honorary award to production designer William Cameron Menzies. Director Victor Fleming (with uncredited assistance from George Cukor and Sam Wood) deftly used this palette and wound up earning himself an Oscar. The Max Steiner score (which was nominated but lost to ""The Wizard of Oz"") was voted by the AFI as the second best film score of all time. I wouldn't rate it quite that highly but I have to admit that the main theme is exemplary and the sheer volume of music over the film's running time is impressive.<br/><br/>The story is compelling but I can certainly imagine today's audiences finding the nearly four hour length somewhat arduous. Another factor in the enjoyment of the story will be the sensitivity to the racial matters inherent in the source material. Personally, it didn't bother me since, while the film does romanticize the old South, it didn't strike me as suggesting that it was ethically excusable. In any case, while the plot is interesting on its own, it's the characters that really bring the movie to life. Scarlett & Rhett are of course iconic as one of the definitive screen couples but the characters of Ashley Wilkes and his wife Melanie are also fascinating.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while the unadulterated romance of ""Gone With the Wind"" makes it a movie that is likely to appeal more to a female audience, there's no question in my mind that, whether you are male or female, this is truly an essential film. If nothing else, watch it to find out precisely why Clark Gable doesn't give a damn."

"classicsoncall","9","2","4","12 January 2008"," ""You're not worth three hundred dollars, you'll never mean anything but misery to any man.""
","For a well rounded cinema education, everyone needs to see ""Gone With The Wind"", one of the most celebrated films of all time. It actually took me quite a while to get around to it, but now I can lay claim to that experience. Having just seen it, I can appreciate it's epic sweep and excellent cinematography at a time when color just wasn't being done, much less being done right. The sunsets in particular, like the magnificent shot of Scarlett and her father at the start of the picture, are among scenes that are memorable in their own right. And then of course, there's that celebrated musical theme that became the standard for all those Million Dollar Movies I used to watch back in the 1950's.<br/><br/>The thing I had to question though was the way the picture was introduced, heralding the era and locale of a time gone by that was noted for it's grand elegance and genteel nobility. It seemed to be an overly romantic sentiment to attach to a period in the nation's history for which the North and South went to war. I don't doubt that there were gentlemanly landowners like the O'Hara's and the Wilkeses, but I'm confident they were outnumbered by those of much crueler intent as regards their slaves. There was a little balance in telling that story, but by and large, the presentation of life in the South before and even during the War seemed a bit sanitized.<br/><br/>As for the principals, each did a remarkable job in their given role. Vivien Leigh exhibited the mark of a talented actress by taking me through a range of emotions regarding her character. In the early part of the story, I really disliked her character, maybe even hated Scarlett. But as the story progressed, one comes to sympathize with her and maybe even feel sorry for her by the time the first half of the movie is over. Then her character arouses the same set of emotions all over again following the mid point interlude.<br/><br/>With Clark Gable's Rhett Butler, I found myself enjoying a rascally scoundrel, and there were two scenes that reminded me immediately of my favorite movie, ""Casablanca"". Early in the story, Rhett opines on his personal philosophy - ""I believe in Rhett Butler, he's the only cause I know, the rest doesn't mean that much to me"". Strangely familiar with what Bogart's Rick Blaine would put forth to describe his motivation as a citizen of the world. Later, in a scene that would close out the first half of the picture, Rhett offers that 'whole silly world going to pieces' line to Scarlett, conjuring up the finale in ""Casablanca"" with Bogart comparing his troubles with Ingrid Bergman not amounting to a hill of beans in this crazy world. I wonder how much of an influence GWTW might have actually had on the later picture.<br/><br/>You know, when I saw ""Hollywoodland"", I had the impression that George Reeves' character was actually written out of the movie because of the way his acting fell short of expectation. So it was with some surprise to see him as one of the Tarleton Brothers romancing Scarlett, although a little hard to recognize if you weren't looking for him. I actually didn't think he was too bad, but then again, the role didn't call for a lot.<br/><br/>Back to Gable's Rhett Butler, I couldn't help thinking how Jock Mahoney might have handled the role if he was bit older at the time of the picture. I have this image of Mahoney in his TV role as Yancy Derringer, and you couldn't ask for a better portrayal of a rogue and street wise con man. That would have been an interesting challenge for Mahoney, but I won't kid myself, he's closer to Reeves than Gable in acting ability.<br/><br/>Hattie McDaniel was a treat though. I'm glad she picked up a Best Supporting Actress for the role of Mammy. There were a couple of times when she cinched the award just with her looks. I don't know about Prissy though (Butterfly McQueen). Maybe it was just me, but I couldn't understand most of what she was saying.<br/><br/>I usually don't get so long winded in my reviews (no pun there), but a classic deserves a little more I suppose. This one ought to be on your must see list, even if not on your list of all time best films. At almost four hours in length, it's worth watching at least one time to add perspective to an appreciation of great cinema."
"johnmichael-2","8","2","4","10 August 2007"," A definite classic, but not a very rewarding experience
","I have wanted to watch this movie for years, but I only just now got around to it, since its running time of 4 hours made it an inconvenient choice for the family. Now that I have watched it, after 6 or 7 years of waiting, I confess I am disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot with music that is surprisingly good for the 1930's. The acting and directing are great, and all the historical detail and other detail really put you into the Civil War. You feel that you are really there. I especially enjoyed the characters of Mammy the servant and Belle the harum-lady.<br/><br/>It was the themes in the story, however, that disappointed me. Scarlett is one of the most selfish heroines in existence, and Rhett isn't all goodhearted himself. They blunder through this epic, causing a good deal of misery around them. In the end, we learn another ""this-is-what-you-should-NOT-do"" lesson. Perhaps these lessons are good for us, and perhaps the struggles are relatable, but--good gracious!--did I feel miserable when ""THE END"" flashed across the screen. The material was way too heavy for its running length; I would have felt a lot less cheated if I had only gotten two hours of it. As it is, the time I spent didn't feel entirely justified.<br/><br/>This is a classic, but not an amazing one. After all, there's a million movies that show people being selfish in love and out of love. But show me a well-made, realistic movie with a ""this-is-what-you-SHOULD-do"" lesson, and you'll have shown me a DESERVING classic. Such an example would be ""Casablanca"", made barely a few years after this sprawling epic.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this film... Don't feel obligated to watch it. Only watch it if you really want to; otherwise, go after another classic that's more uplifting and helpful."
"ecjones1951","10","2","4","2 July 2006"," Further comments are redundant. . .
","nonetheless, I'll throw in my two cents.<br/><br/>""Gone With The Wind"" is surely the best-known American movie ever made, but as is obvious from many other comments here, it is beloved the world over. No one film can claim the title of the ""greatest movie ever made,"" but there are plenty of reasons for the enduring, almost mythical popularity of GWTW.<br/><br/>This was the finest hour for many of the principals involved, most notably producer David O. Selznick, whose baby it was and who was as ruthless as his heroine in getting exactly the movie he wanted. Every scene bears his stamp, with its exacting attention to period detail, costumes, music and lighting.<br/><br/>Focusing purely on the spectacular look of GWTW for a moment, it owes many of its special effects to the painstaking efforts of talented glass painters (as shown in the excellent documentary ""The Making of a Legend."") William Cameron Menzies's production design and Lyle Wheeler's sets are so strong as to almost be secondary characters. Setting afire to many old MGM sets to simulate the burning of Atlanta was a master stroke. It's clear you're watching a real fire, not just CGI. And what about that scene's conclusionwith the railroad cars full of ammo going POW! POW! POW! and then the facade of the burning building falling in graceful slow motionjust as the wagon rattles past. (Film buffs know that burning building was once the gates used in ""King Kong"" (1933), and that stagehands pulled guywires to bring the facade down on cue. Doesn't matter. It's wonderful film-making.)<br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned the depth and clarity of the Technicolor process, seldom used to such great advantage as it is here. Painstaking restoration work in recent years has revived the vivid colors captured by Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan. Over time the film had begun to look like a slideshow of faded picture postcards, but no more. <br/><br/>Finally, it's Hattie McDaniel's portrayal of the indomitable Mammy that seems to improve year after year. More so even than Olivia De Havilland's Melanie, Mammy is the moral compass of the film. Even before she becomes a free woman midway through the film, Mammy is dignity personified. She is also pragmatic and bursting with common sense. Only she can prevail upon the headstrong Scarlett in every area (except matters of the heart).<br/><br/>I've long been convinced the scene that won for Hattie McDaniel the Oscar she so well deserved is the staircase scene with Melanie, who she's summoned to console Rhett. Rhett has said earlier that Mammy is one of the few people ""whose respect I'd like to have."" By the film's end, he has it, and so do we."
"Micmataholyze","Null","2","4","12 February 2006"," One of the great Hollywood films ever
","""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" Most famous quote in cinema history came after Scarlett pleading to Rhett Butler about what she should do next. There is no singular motion picture that had left such profound impact on me as film buff and not only film buff but as a regular guy who enjoy really good cinema. I personally think it's one of the greatest epic films ever made and will not be matched because it is really product of its time and everything just fall in right time.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh's performance as Scarlett O'Hara is so outstanding that one has to overlook the many candidates for that role. Also, it should be interesting to see that Leigh has been always first choice, despite huge auditions process with many well known actresses like Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead. Without Leigh, Gone with the Wind would be very soapy, very dated, and somewhat dull. Also, it helped that Leigh had solid co-star, whose is Clark Gable. Gable brought his own style to his role, which is amazing because I cannot think of anyone in that role. In fact, I was surprised to learn that Gary Cooper had been offered that role but rejected it because he thought it would be huge flop in Hollywood history. Gable only accepted that role so he can get married to Carole Lombard, whose was magnificent comedian in her own rights.<br/><br/>You know how you always watch great films but always find something new in each viewing? God, Gone with the Wind was like that for me. When I watch it for umpteenth time, there are so many parts that I had forgotten and it add a lot to the experience. I had forgotten how wonderful barbwire dialogues between Gable and Leigh and it enhanced the film very well. I would love to see it in theater someday but I'm perfectly satisfied with my copy of DVD.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind remains landmark because it is quintessential epic film and it has genuine sweep of any epics that I had seen. Modern filmmakers wouldn't know how to structure the film like Gone with the Wind because they don't know how to tell the story. I felt that today's epics are just bunch of b movies with huge budgets like Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Jackson's King Kong. Gone with the Wind is in class all by itself and the box office has prove that since it is the film that sold the most tickets ever. When you adjust the box office inflation, Gone with the Wind would be always number 1 because it is made for blockbuster and it shows that the audience is very appreciative.<br/><br/>On repeated viewing, I was very surprised to see how the editing works so well in Gone with the Wind that I hadn't noticed on my previous viewings. Take the scene where Gable and Leigh are riding through Atlanta when it is about to burn. Look at the background between one of their dialogues part and you can see rear projection but when it is cut to other side, everything around them is very real, especially the house. It show how ahead Gone with the Wind is in technical sense. But it doesn't matter because the story is so gripping and very engrossing that you just develop the attachment to the characters, which I did.<br/><br/>It is seldom to see singular piece of motion picture that just fall in right place, right time, and everything is just in sync. But that is Gone with the Wind. It isn't known for director's film but much of the film's success goes to David Selznick, a famous producer of Golden Era of Hollywood. Selznick was able to gamble everything he had on this film and he succeeds. Unfortunately, it's his huge failure as well because he cannot duplicate the success again, which would haunt him for rest of his life. Nonetheless, it remains the bona fide landmark film that would never ever be challenge.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see 4 directors worked on this film yet only one got credit. George Cukor got fired because he didn't think it would be good. Victor Fleming replaced him and suffering from nervous breakdown and 2 directors relieved him. But like I said, it is astonishing piece of film-making craft because everything in this film is so convincing real.<br/><br/>I don't think I would find another film that is like Gone with the Wind, if one is so inclined to remake it, which would flop for certain since the budget would be so outrageous enough for the studios not to pursue it. I don't doubt that one would be very reluctant to see this film because it is clocked at 3 hours and 50 minutes but I would like to assure that it is very engaging and move at relatively fast paced film. I've seen 2 hours films that would felt like if it last all day with no ending come in the sight but Gone with the Wind, despite its running time, move faster than any 2 hours films I saw. It proved that it is able to engage the audience and left profound impact on them.<br/><br/>It is genuine magnificent motion picture, make no mistake about it."

They all manage to portray intriguing, realistic and interesting characters with their own strong personalities. The really make the story work on both dramatic as romantic levels. This movie is not regarded a classic and perhaps the ultimate romantic movie, just for no reason.<br/><br/>The story is long but it needs to be.

Her story is told very subtle and the dramatic moments are build up nicely which provides them with maximum effect to us the viewers.<br/><br/>Technically there also is very little wrong with the movie. Of course the costumes and sets are impressive and so the refreshing cinematography by Ernest Haller, Lee Garmes and Ray Rennahan and of course the well known musical score main theme composed by Max Steiner.<br/><br/>The movie has a very epic feeling and some impressive war scene's from the civil war and other unforgettable and impressive moments, which this movie is truly filled with.<br/><br/>Still the movie is a bit too 'blah' at times and I in generally aren't very fond of costume drama's, that are the only reasons which prevent me from giving a perfect 10 out of 10 score. The movie is glued perfectly together by both cast and crew and make this movie a pioneering achievement in movie history.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"instantxkarmaa","10","2","4","3 January 2005"," Gone With the Wind is an A+ film!
","Gone With the Wind is an amazing film especially when considering it debuted in 1939. Clark Gable is powerful as the dashing Rhett Butler, and Vivien Leigh is the perfect Scarlett O'Hara to match his Rhett. The film is centered around Scarlett, an Irish Southern Belle that has every boy in town eating out of her hand and gazing into her always batting eyelashes. She has her eye on the handsome Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, yet Ashley has his eye on Melanie, played by the demure Oliva De'Havilland.The film boasts a strong actors, incredible action sequences, and enchanting sets amidst a compelling story of love and the Old South. Margaret Mitchell's novel has truly come to life in this film. At almost four hours, the long film still leaves the viewer desiring more insight into the tale of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. A must see for any true movie fan or film buff!"

"jbirtel","10","2","4","27 August 2004"," Still A Milestone Entertainment!!
","Back in 76' (geeessh, that long ago?), this movie played to a packed theater in college (showtime @ 7pm & an intermission)...and ranked as one of my best movie going experiences. 80% of the audience was (probably) between 18-22, and this audience rocked. They cheered at the opening titles; they cheered at each of the 4 main character's intro scene; the 'scandalous' waltz; Melanie & Ashley's (cliched)reunion; Gable's return after a lengthy hiatus; Scarlett's smitten 'morning after' reaction to Rhett's drunken seduction (an especially loud cheer as Leigh awakens, then stretches and purrs with guilty satisfaction; it's hysterical!!), Rhett's exit line; and on and on...and on. The audience's reaction was contagious and their (my) attitude toward the film was treated with equal camp and respect. Ya just don't get that much fun at the movies with regular movie goers at regular theaters (unfortunately). 25 years later when the movie was restored and rereleased at the theaters (98 or 99), it played at some colleges and the reaction was...the same. Now that's a testament to the durable and indestructible power that this film will always have. (Note: this experience was in upstate New York, not down south)<br/><br/>There's no allusions to the fact that this is a self-centered southern (and very outdated...sometime insulting) fantasy soap opera. Scarlett is mostly a despicable character that has strength fueled by her selfish ambitions. So is Rhett! (but at least with half a heart). The fact that we still care about the characters is the real power of this film as our emotions are jerked between rooting for them and despising their actions at the same time. What this film reveals the most is...the viewer!!! If the viewer defends Scarlett's actions, is repulsed by her antics, or tries to maintain some clarity of the type of person Scarlett really is...that, in itself, can be as revealing about just what type of person the viewer is as about the characters themselves.<br/><br/>This movie has color! It has scope! It has a big story to tell in its (short) 4 hour running time. The direction is tight, it moves quick. There's no time for an actor's ego of ""hey, let the camera linger and linger...and linger on ME to show the world what a great talent I (think I) have"". Especially nowadays when so many performances are obsessed with (hollow) Oscar ambitions. This is a film where the story comes and is served first...the way a film's story should be.<br/><br/>All the actors (it seems) were born to play these roles. They come off with conviction (if not in reality). But, then again, this isn't a reality movie. It just wants to tell its story and move the story along in the same spirit as the story is told in the book. You don't have to agree with its philosophies or its perceptions to deprive yourself of its entertainment. And 65 years later, entertains it does!<br/><br/>And contrary to popular belief: Vivien Leigh was chosen by David O. Selznick as early as 37' (revealed by his many memos). His masterminded scheme of conducting a bogus 'free publicity' casting search for Scarlett was brilliant! After all these years, many people are gullible enough to still believe he started filming the 'burning of Atlanta' scene without securing the star of a massive, expensive 4 hour flick. But as one of director John Ford's movie character once said; ""When the legend becomes fact...print the legend"". <br/><br/>Still a 10!"
"agmoldham","8","2","4","23 December 2003"," The original blockbuster ?
","I can't think of any film of modern times that would have had as much hype as this did during production. The casting sounds like it owed as much to politics as it did to finding the right people for the parts. It's somewhat surprising that they managed to cast so well bearing in mind what pressure they must have been under.<br/><br/>The themes of this film are timeless. Scarlett is in love with Ashley who marries Melanie. Ashley obviously has feelings for Scarlett, but never really returns the love. Set in the civil war Scarlett continues to chase a dream and doesn't even notice what she is missing until it is too late. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are excellent in the leads and are well supported. The photography is fantastic even 60 years on. A hit at the box office and thank god they didn't make sequels when this was made."

"jfurst","7","2","4","17 August 2000"," Fair, at best.
","It is always a shame not to have grown up with something that is considered a classic.  I can't draw back on my childhood memories of visiting a movie palace and taking in this movie in the time for which it was intended.  I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, remastered in 5.1 dolby digital. It is a beautifully photographed movie, but other than it's historical significance I can find little positive to say about it.  Much like Star Wars for my generation, this movie lives in the glory of its period.<br/><br/>The acting was, for the most part, good.  I can't really criticize any of the actors, as they all play their parts well.<br/><br/>Much of what makes a movie enjoyable to watch, however, are the characters. When have lead characters been so unlikeable?<br/><br/>Scarlett O'Hara may be the least likeable female romantic character ever conceived.  I did not, for one minute, give a damn (no pun intended) about her.  She was whiny, bratty, conceited, and annoying from the first scene. Nowhere in three hours and fifty-two minutes did I find myself with any sympathy for her.  Her epiphany was about three hours too late in the movie for me to even consider.  And the glory of her ancestral home was lost on me.  ""As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again!"".  Hmmm.  If the purpose of Scarlett was to annoy and alienate the audience, I must say, she was beautifully acted.<br/><br/>The altruistic Melanie Wilkes, played convincingly by Olivia de Havilland, was another character I could not bring myself to care about.  Her fragile naivite made her feel weak and stupid to me.  Constantly abused by Scarlett, she never came away from kindness.  What a little angel.  The anti-Scarlett, (and equally extreme in goodness as Scarlett was in whinyness) I found her character ridiculous.  Olivia, in my opinion, was the film's most physically appealing actress.  By far.<br/><br/>Hattie McDaniel's character, Mammy was archetypical, but appealing nonetheless.  Her acting was excellent, with well timed deliveries and always an appropriate look of fear on her face.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is a charming actor.  I enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>As for the plot, drama, drama, and more drama.  Endless ridiculous drama. This movie is like a realization of Murphy's law.  Everything that could go wrong, does.  Despite the extreme length, the movie moves along fairly briskly.  This is due to the continuous string of tragedies that play out over its course.  Make no mistake, this is a soap opera, in perhaps it's grandest form, but soap opera nonetheless.  Non-stop yelling, whining, death, unhappy marriages, and more death.  I threw up my hands on more than one occasion.  Isn't there a limit on the number of horse-related accidents you can have in one film, no matter the length?  No rest for the weary, let me tell you.<br/><br/>Wow, this is sure starting to sound cynical.  I gave the movie 7 out of 10 stars, based solely on a few good performances, the stunning cinematography, and the historical significance.  I can't say I enjoyed the film, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever sit down to watch it again.  But I think everyone should see this film once, simply to make up their own mind on it's value.<br/><br/>In sum: a glorious relic from the past that has acquired a sour taste in the present."

Appreciated the wonderful performances of the famous two starring Fei Wenli and Gable. Unexpectedly, the 1939 film was still in color.<br/><br/>This film is an epic blockbuster based on the American Civil War, and is described from the perspective of the failed South. Although there are black people, there is no description of the change in the status of black people. Or through the main line of emotion through the film.<br/><br/>To be honest, I personally prefer Melanie in the film. Indeed, as Reid said, it is a perfect woman, virtuous and virtuous, and noble and kind. Although there is no outstanding personality, it is the type I like. I don't really like Scarlett's beautiful and lively but too profit-driven type.<br/><br/>Wishes are often not as good as people want, do their best to obey the destiny."

","I've never felt so divided about a film before.<br/><br/>On the one end I admire its brutal depiction of love and its realities in real (i.e. flawed) people, yet its unnecessarily lengthy beginning combined with arguably poor dialogue at times made it hard to stay focused particularly in the beginning once again. But as the film rolled on, it evolved into a film I began to love. I just wished it could've started sooner and could've been consistently there.<br/><br/>Olivia de Havilland and Clark Gable and Butterfly McQueen are perfect in their roles. And there are great moments throughout the rest of the film especially involving Leslie Howard. While I wish there were certain aspects of the film that could be changed, it is the way it is, and it's a damn good film as it progresses."

","This film is adapted from Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind. Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, it tells the love story of Scarlett and Bared, and the story of Melanie, Ashley and others.
Fei Wenli's beauty is that eye-catching beauty, which makes people feel refreshed. With her beautiful appearance and superb acting skills, she tightly combines her character with Scarlett, as if she can be Scarlett The soul is expressive.
What impressed me the most and what struck me the most should be Scarlett's truth. She is free and unrestrained, and is not bound by those rules. She likes to be close to her, and she does not hide her disgust if she does not like it.
Things that may be lost will look even better. Maybe one day in the future, Scarlett will meet Bared again, and they will stay together forever, and they will be happy after the storm."

But it was the gritty characters and spectacular acting that really made this movie as enjoyable as we found it. <br/><br/>Saying that, the character of Scarlett O'Hara was insufferable most of the time. You spend the whole film shouting at her to grow up and get over it. Then you can't help but feel at the end of the film that she totally had it coming to her. But if she had been the meek and subservient woman that her sisters and friends were then there wouldn't have been a story to start with so you can forgive her for being a complete and utter insufferable snob."
"joylynncraft","10","0","0","10 June 2012"," Taking care of Family or Taking Care of Self: What was Scarlett's real motivation?
","I am currently a student taking a course in The Art of Film at a community college in Dayton, Ohio. One of the assignments is to write a post or add to a post of a movie of our choice. I chose Gone with the Wind because it has to be one of my favorite movies. Katie ""Scarlett"" O'Hara-Hamilton-Kennedy-Butler has to be one of the best female roles in film to me. When she is depicted before the Civil War, she is immediately shown with two beaus at her house on a beautiful summer's day. When the two young men start speaking of war she explains that talk of war bores her. As the two beaus continue to ask about war, Scarlett begins to retreat into the house. The men suddenly come to their senses and apologize, while saying they will not talk about war anymore. It is here we see Scarlett does get her way. As they change the subject to the barbecue at the Wilkes', a neighbor's plantation, she is stunned to find out that the love of life is marrying his cousin (just have to add that I am glad people do not do that anymore)! Scarlett immediately storms off in anger and confusion, wondering how that could be if Ashley, her crush, loves her. While storming off she is told by her ""Mammy"" that it was rude to leave the company standing there without asking them to stay for dinner and that she needs a shawl on her shoulders if she is going to be out in the evening. Scarlett yells back that she is waiting for her father to get home from the Wilkes', to get the inside information on what is really going on. The movie takes place in the south, before, during, and after the Civil War era, when slavery was the largest problem of the United States. To Scarlett, war was a stupid problem that she never wanted to talk about; she was happy having every beau in the county sit next to her at a barbecue and drool all over her. Even though her love for Ashley never wavered, she married three men throughout her life as a means to survive. I do not think she was just trying to survive for herself, I think she showed that she had heart and truly cared for her family when she married Frank Kennedy. Knowing that Frank was Suellen's beau, I think she figured once Suellen and Frank were married that they would leave and would no longer have to worry about Tara and the rest of the family. Therefore, Scarlett married Frank and paid the taxes on Tara so the family would have a home. A selfish person would not have done that, a person with no morals might have.<br/><br/>Really looking at Katie Scarlett O'Hara-Hamilton-Kennedy-Butler, she married her first husband as a tactic to make Ashley jealous. It did not work, and as a result, she ended up being a young widow. Scarlett did not love Charles Hamilton, she took advantage of his love for her, when he asks her to marry him all the while Scarlett is looking out the large window at Ashley and Melanie kissing goodbye. Though it was sad that Charles died, it feels like Scarlett was getting what she deserved. Marrying her second husband Frank, she guaranteed the home and land for her family to live on. Even though Frank was Scarlett's sister Suellen's beau, she lied to him, as well. Scarlett told Frank that her sister was tired of waiting for him, that Suellen thought she would be an ""old maid"", so she married a boy in the county they lived in. Telling this awful lie on her sister, caused Frank to marry Scarlett, which allowed her to use his money and pay the taxes on Tara. With her final marriage to Rhett Butler, it seemed like she married him for his money. I think that Scarlett did not want to be alone. The last scene before the intermission, Scarlett has made it home with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy, her ""simple-minded"" slave, to find that the day before her mother had died, which pushed her into the role of the head of the household. Having nothing to eat and nothing of value, she finds herself in the garden outside. Having nothing in it but radishes, Scarlett grabs one and starts to eat it, she immediately gets sick and falls to the ground, crying. When she collects herself, she stands and makes a pledge that she will never go hungry again, nor any of her folks; if she has to lie, steal, cheat, or kill as God as her witness she will never be hungry again. That promise, to me, sounds like she is a woman who has seen and been defeated by outside forces that she had no control over. I admire Scarlett because she was in fact a woman, living in a world of a great revolution. Even though the Civil War was fighting for the freedom of the slavery, women were still seen as dainty things, of little to no importance to men. She proved to be a smart woman, with a mind for business and the strong will to handle personal problems when they arose, as seen with the shooting of the Union soldier who doubled-back after the army had left Tara. I think she was always protecting her family, even though she did not see the true love that Rhett had for her until Melanie died, when he left her, Scarlett went home to Tara to solve her problems. Back home to her family."
"Kubris","9","0","0","23 February 2012"," Excellent yet deceiving
","IMDb Top 250: 154<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is intimidating. Not only is it just short of 4 hours long, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most important American films ever created. It's a sprawling story of the South during the Civil War, and was crafted during the time when the world would be plunged into war again. So you'd better like it!<br/><br/>Have I mentioned that it isn't at all what I expected? Here I was preparing for a love story set in a difficult time, a match made in heaven torn apart by hell. That's not what played out: most of the morals are stern warnings, and there's very little loving going on. Even the overall plot surprised me, and this is the most important thing one can tell you about the film before you see it: Gone with the Wind is not about Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).<br/><br/>That's right, despite Clark's star billing GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and her life, starting with breezy, flirtatious pre-war days, her forced maturing during the tumultuous events and even more so after the fighting has stopped, and then her return to bliss. She is a fascinating character with a contradictious set of morals and a near perfect performance from Leigh, who can capture all the little facial twitches and all the wide emotional changes that Scarlett goes through. She really captures the complex (but is she really?) character of Ms. O'Hara.<br/><br/>That's not to say Clark isn't a presence, because Rhett Butler is one of film's greatest characters. Rhett visits from Charleston in a flurry of rumors, and immediately votes against the popular opinion about the war. We love him because he speaks his mind and stays cool-headed, mostly. However he does take the backseat to Scarlett, and has very few scenes without her. GWTW is a greater film than It Happened One Night, but I feel Clark had more to work with in that film, and therefore gives a greater performance. What one can draw from this paragraph is that GWTW is about women and the men who chase after them. <br/><br/>It doesn't feel fair having to force the entire support into this little paragraph, but due to size limits I'll have to. Gone with the Wind has a gigantic supporting cast of family members and friends with no weak links, but several very strong ones, like Melanie, Ashley and the award- winning (and deserving) Hattie MacDonald.<br/><br/>So now that the acting has been assessed we can continue on to the rest of the film. If Gone with the Wind is not a romance, then what is it? I like to say it is a period drama with romantic elements, because it looks happy on the outside but has some dark material, like abortion. It's not a good date movie, and not just because of the run time. Some say the ending isn't meant to coerce negative emotions, but it did for me. Don't expect to feel too great after.<br/><br/>I created a sort of 'Civil War' unit of film, and one of which I saw was The Birth of a Nation. While Birth is more blatantly racist than GWTW, there are similarities. Gone with the Wind works around the negative aspects of the slavery issue and leaves out all the actual battle, as well as totally leaving out the assassination of Lincoln. Also there's two things that bug me, neither of which are really spoilers, but skip this part if you don't want to know ANYTHING. First, Ashley wants to marry his cousin, because ""they are the same blood and understand each other"". Are they the beginning of the 'redneck' culture more terrifyingly seen in films like Deliverance? Rednecks had to come from somewhere in history. This relationship is totally OK with everyone in the film, except for Scarlett. Also, main characters are mildly implied to be in the KKK, which no one has an opinion on. These incidences show that GWTW tries to sugarcoat Southern history. The main conflict here is that the poor Southerners had their peachy way of life uprooted and now can't have their slaves. The portrayal of Southern life is easily the most romantic part of the film.<br/><br/>There's no getting around this: a huge part of the picture's success is that it is in colour. All the way back in 1939, the colour brings forth the beauty of the land, sets, and costumes. It was a worthy endeavour making this in colour: a 4 hour black and white film would be agonizing, especially considering this material. It would be a shame no to get to see the costumes in their true form.<br/><br/>Lastly we'll discuss the thematic value. Most of them revolve around Scarlett, but the point of this film is plot, not morals. The title gives away the first idea communicated. The old carefree south is gone with the wind, quickly uprooted. The film (and book) try to make you feel for these poor Southerners, who I already mentioned were slave owners. There is clearly bias in this film. We also learn that money isn't happiness, a moral taken from The Great Gatsby, and it may be a coincidence but F. Scott Fitzgerald helped write this film. Adding to that, if you are never content you may be left with nothing- all cynical messages. There's just one that Gone with the Wind really pushes, and that is that only your land is constant: that's what Scarlett learns.<br/><br/>It was amazing feat creating this film, which one notable critic claims to be 'a towering landmark of film'. You can't put it any better than that. It's very good, not one of the very best, but should be mandatory viewing for its historical significance and reputation. Just don't expect a politically correct history lesson or a happy ride. 8.7/10"

","First, I thought this movie was made in the '50s, but it was made in the '30s. I'm surprised that such fantastic movie production was possible back then.<br/><br/>I think everyone knows the story already so I'll skip the synopsis. I'm not particularly a fan of period piece movie like this, or any of the actors, but the grand production of this movie blows me away. The style of this movie is absolutely lavish. It might be the most lavish movie ever produced. Just on this point alone, this movie is an important landmark.<br/><br/>They didn't have cell phones in civil war era south, but rich people really had luxurious life back then. Even in this luxury, people can't seem to find happiness. Everybody still is putting in their dues. I guess that the whole point of this story.<br/><br/>Clark Gable was absolutely charming in this movie. The movie wouldn't have been the same without him.<br/><br/>Every scene is shot perfectly, and this movie is artistic in every way.<br/><br/>Scaret O'Hara reminds me of modern spoiled high school kid. Vivian Leigh plays it strait but with a little bit of a twist, she could have easily starred in modern teenager movie.<br/><br/>If I see one flaw in this movie, it's the mismatch of characters between Gable and Leigh. They have no chemistry together. Otherwise, it's a startling production, and no wonder it is considered a classic for so many years."

","There are racist elements to this movie, because this was a racist time period in America, especially in the South. Not only was the South racist in 1863 but was also in 1936. It would be untruthful to depict it otherwise. Though Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammy was groundbreaking, earning the first Oscar for an African-American actor. And, interestingly, the way Hattie played her role, she was no door mat. She continually stood up to Scarlett and often put her in her place, and she often seemed like she was the only one who had any common sense in the film. Mammy even put Ward Bond in his place. Butterfly McQueen's role as Prissy is very hard to take. But she herself, in later life, said that she was glad she took the role, even though she didn't feel that way at the time. That being said, Gone With the Wind is still a great movie, an epic. Clark Gable had completely perfected his on-screen persona by this film; he was a wise cracking, clever, tough, devil -may-care man who really sort of did care, but just didn't want to let others know that side of himself. Vivian Leigh was amazing-although British, she perfectly captured Scarlett, the head-strong, spoiled and devilish Southern Belle. The whole acting was good all the way around; Howard and De Havilland lend good support. The burning of Atlanta is the climactic scene, along with Gable's movie ending line."

","The theme and plot of the movie have been described before, and I'm not going to bore the readers here by going into it again.<br/><br/>Let me put it this way. As far as I have seen, there are only two movies that I would give ten stars to, GWTW and the Wizard of Oz. It's unfortunate that they had the misfortune of being released in the same year (from an Oscar standpoint, of course) and to have been directed by the same director.<br/><br/>Pauline Kael, the noted movie ""reviewer."" famously tossed off GWTW as being ""the woman as bitch"" (referring to Scarlet O'Hara) My retort: yeah, so? I've seen it at least 10 times in the last 30 years, and it never ceases to fascinate.<br/><br/>Actually, I will make a comment on the plot, but not much of one.

","Producer David O. Selznick wanted ""Gone With The Wind"" to be somehow more than a movie,a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this grand 1939 magnificent spectacule which went on the become to all-time box office champ in terms of tickets sold,and in some far beyond the goal that it have went onward to achieve. The results were astounding. The movie went on to received a boatload full of Oscars--ten Oscars in all,including Best Picture of 1939. The primary results were historical as well,and a first in motion pictures. Actress Hattie McDaniel,became the first African-American in the history of the American cinema to received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress,a feat that went beyond expectations and open doors for other astounding black actors later on. The film itself is a cinematic classic,and it still is the top attraction to see,even if those individuals who have never seen this movie before,it is worth seeing,especially in a movie theatre projected onto a huge screen in front of a capacity audience. Any with good reason. It is no wonder that ""Gone With The Wind"" became MGM's biggest and most fiscally successful film not only in the history of motion pictures,but within the studio itself,making MGM a perennial powerhouse in Hollywood. In all,cinematic achievement which is right up there with two other MGM hits as well...The Charlton Heston spectacle of 1959's ""Ben-Hur"",and also the 1968 science-fiction masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"".<br/><br/>Getting back to ""Gone With The Wind"",based on the Margaret Mitchell's grand scale novel,the story is based on the tale of the Old South and the coming of the Civil War. While the first half of the Civil War is taut and suspenseful as well as nostalgic,the second half is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there is no question that the film is an emormous achievement is terms of its every resource--art director,color,sound,cimematopgraphy-being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivian Leigh's character of Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most magnificently narcissistic performances in the history of the cinema. Her performance here stands out. Olivia de Havilland's character as the angelic and lovely as Melanie Hamliton,and Leslie Howard's reckless and aristocratic Ashley Wilkes are one of the key elements that make the film come full circle. But the main reason and the performance that will stand out is Clark Gable's character of Rhett Butler. He gives one of the most vital,masculine,commanding performances ever committed to film. His one-liner ensemble is one of the greatest in screen history.<br/><br/>""Frankly my dear,I don't give a damn."" <br/><br/>Produced by Selznick Productions and MGM-Running Time of 222 minutes which was restored for the re-release in 1999(for its golden 50th anniversary and later in the extended DVD version in its original run of 238 minutes). MGM has re-released this film numerous times between its release from 1939 and today(which is shown in selected theatres restored to its original Technicolor glory and re-mastered from its original 70MM print) for all audiences to enjoy."

","This is an excellent film very true to the original book. It gives a good picture of this period in history of the USA during the civil war. The way people with money and power carried out their lives. Servants, cotton pickers, grooms, cooks, maids, nannies, butlers etc waiting on them. The slowness and peacefulness with regard to no noisy aeroplanes, cars, lorries etc. Just the quite countryside with the sounds of horses, birds, cattle and other creatures. It is a good example of the destruction of war and the changes to their lives that were made.

"roghache","10","0","0","20 May 2006"," Lavish Civil War saga with a scheming but complex Southern belle
","This magnificent epic portrays the Civil War, as seen through the famous green eyes of its self absorbed heroine, Scarlett O'Hara. With its expansive panoramas...from the old fashioned barbecue at Twelve Oaks plantation to the spectacular burning of Atlanta by the Yankees...it paints a vivid portrait of the gracious lifestyle of the Old South, the horrific Civil War itself, and its Reconstruction after effects on a society whose customs are literally Gone With the Wind. It boasts colorful scenes, a tumultuous historical setting, lavish costumes (especially one particular green velvet gown), but above all a complex, immortal heroine and an appealing, roguish hero.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh adds the right touch of charm to her role as the spoiled daughter of a plantation owner, a flirtatious Southern belle who boasts the smallest waist in three counties. I can see Scarlett now surrounded by the Tarleton twins and all her retinue of would be beaux, vying for her attentions at the Wilkes's barbecue. This is a conniving young lady who...fiddle dee dee...simply MUST have her own way and nothing or no one must be allowed to interfere with her plans. Scarlett tends to elicit viewer outrage for marrying a shy, innocent, unsuspecting boy in order to enact revenge on the man who spurns her for a lesser mortal, and for later employing all her feminine wiles on a prosperous older man, betraying her own sister, Suellen, in the process. Not to mention her viewing the Civil War's tragedy only as it affects her own selfish interests, her assorted attempted manipulations of Rhett (the man who truly loves her), and her ongoing betrayal of the trusting Melanie. Even after war devastates her circumstances, Scarlett remains the same inner schemer and the same outward manipulator. <br/><br/>Margaret Mitchell's novel provides a deeper insight into Scarlett, and might tend to elicit a little more sympathy for this selfish heroine who deals with any unpleasantness by 'thinking about it all tomorrow'. Even in the movie, Scarlett is not totally villainous but a three dimensional character who does have her strengths. She has an undying loyalty and passion for her beloved Tara, exhibiting courage, determination, and back breaking labour to protect her home plantation from the Yankees and feed her helpless family. She is fiercely protective of her loved ones, even her sisters who are an annoyance to her, and Melanie who is married to the object of her desire. She does indeed experience growth as a result of all the unfolding events, suffering the loss of the daughter she genuinely loves and eventually coming to appreciate Melanie's friendship...and, alas too late, Rhett's love.<br/><br/>Clark Gable IS that virile, dangerous, and totally endearing rake and scoundrel, Rhett Butler, in the role he was born to play. Can't you just picture Gable's Rhett languishing in a plantation smoking room, enjoying a glass of fine bourbon? His actual film scenes are amazing...chuckling over the antics of the spoiled young belle at the barbecue, scandalously dancing with the young widow, denouncing her manipulative scheme to extract money from him, carrying his wife passionately up those stairs (who can forget?), grieving the loss of his precious little Bonnie Blue Butler, baring his soul to his dear friend Melanie, and finally his legendary 'Frankly, my dear...'<br/><br/>The supporting cast are wonderful as well. Leslie Howard portrays Ashley Wilkes, the bookish idealist Scarlett has set her cap for. Olivia de Havilland is perfect as his sweet, kind, loyal, and unsuspecting wife, Melanie, a genuine lady. I agree with another's comment that Melanie's finest hour is when, loyal to the last, she asks Scarlett to receive guests with her at her sister-in-law's birthday party even though it's rumored Scarlett has been carrying on with her husband. Thomas Mitchell excels in the role of Scarlett's earthy, blustery Irish father, Gerald O'Hara, whose own love of the land lives on in Scarlett.<br/><br/>The black roles are especially well presented. Hattie McDaniell more than deserved her Best Supporing Actress Oscar for portraying Scarlett's large, buxom, disapproving, wise Mammy, the only person besides Rhett who is fully aware of Scarlett's schemes. She is priceless with her red petticoat. Prissy, the young slave girl with questionable knowledge 'bout birthin' babies, is also well drawn with her large frightened eyes and high pitched, shrill voice.<br/><br/>The story's theme of wanting what one cannot have is common throughout humanity, though especially exaggerated in Scarlett. She constantly pines for a man who belongs to another, and once he becomes available, she no longer desires him. The dreary, dreamy, scholarly Ashley is totally unsuited to Scarlett, who continues ungratefully & foolishly unaware of what she already has in Rhett, her true soul mate. Scarlett and Rhett are kindred spirits, both proudly selfish and neither conforming to society. Furthermore, Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, despite having full awareness of her manipulative ways. As for Ashley, he seems rather a pathetic & weak character really, in love with his gentle wife but constantly tempted by Scarlett, never firmly discouraging her but instead dully half leading her on for years.<br/><br/>No one should miss this legendary Civil War extravaganza that paints with such a vivid brush that dramatic period in Georgia's history. True, few heroines are more flawed than Scarlett O'Hara, but for all her schemes and manipulations, you cannot help but become engrossed in her fate."

","It's a shame to see that such a remarkable film can be judged in today's society just because of the age of the film. I saw the film as a teen and couldn't deny loving it. The film boasts with brilliance and terrific story and drama. Gone with the wind is by far the greatest film ever made and proved by many film lists and so on. The film takes place in the Civil war, the southerners and the Yankees. It shows the affect f the war and how it affected those who lived through it in particular, Scarlett, probably one of the greatest characters in film history. She goes from being a spoilt young woman to a forced to survive hero. She fights and slaves with those around her to keep hold of her plantation 'Tara' and will go to extreme lengths to keep hold of it after the affect of the war. The film is also a major love story mainly between Scarlett, the man she wants so badly, Ashley, and the man who falls for her, millionaire Rhett Butler. By the end of the film Scarlett realises she's been dreaming of something that she never really wanted, but after the many tragedies that occur is it too late for her to keep hold on what she's really been wanting? Gone with the wind is and will always be without a doubt, the greatest movie of all time even in years to come when the cinematic audience of the film aren't around, those who know films will know that it can never be beaten!"

"critical-escapist","9","0","0","24 March 2006"," A beautiful love story that spins out both romance and tragedy.
","This is the way you do romantic epics, okay? One thing I absolutely loved about Gone with the Wind is that it doesn't start slow. It gets right into the center of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and portrays her as a selfish, spoiled brat. She loves the well-mannered, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man she cannot have and he will be soon marrying the naive Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). She meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is far from who Ashley is  he is no gentleman at all but he loves Scarlett, only Scarlett does not have the same love for him as she does for Ashley. Every character in this film is memorable, even Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), the black woman who is loyal the O'Hara household. Even though the DVD edition of the film is roughly 3hrs and 58mins long, time goes fast when you're actually watching a good movie. This is what romances are all about: It doesn't matter if you don't have explicit love scenes, all that matters are characters that are true to the story itself.<br/><br/>What is wrong with the actresses today? Why can't they be more like  Vivien Leigh? I think one of the best female performances I have seen so far has to be Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the selfish, beautiful, spoiled, and rather manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. This is what Hollywood lacks today: Amazing actresses who are able to carry a film role all by themselves and be permanently remembered by it. This is what makes Leigh's performance so amazing because every time someone mentions her name, they would instantly think of the film. Even though this was Leigh's time to shine, the other performances weren't too bad: Clark Gable was absolutely charming as Rhett Butler and makes you believe him if he was drunk or pretending that he is drunk. There is another very underrated performance here that I would like to mention, and that is of Olivia de Havilland as Melanie. This is one very likable character and I keep hoping that Scarlett would accept her at the end, and fortunately she did, but I don't want to spoil too much of that for those who hasn't seen this classic. There is also Leslie Howard as Ashley, who was not as amazing as his co-stars but was able to muster up Ashley's blank expressions towards Scarlett and perfects moments of uncertainty. Hattie McDaniels also made Mammy  who could of had been quite a simple character  memorable.<br/><br/>Most beautiful movie ever made? Everything from the cinematography to the costume design was just breathtaking. With an estimated budget of $3,900,000 (at the time, that was a big movie). Compared to the films we have today, where Peter Jackson uses about one thousand green screens, it is even more of a wonder to watch. Gone with the Wind is still a true masterpiece and it is still truly unforgettable. If only our tech-systems can improve plots by just typing in the screenplay  Final thoughts.<br/><br/>I adored this film and everything about it. I have little to complain  even though this film is over 65 years old, there is nothing to hate about a true classic that can make you remember it for it. The final scenes in the film are just priceless and I don't think any other film can succeed the ending that Gone with the Wind provided for its story. I think I really like films that end with regret and tragedy, I think it's probably my favorite genre of ending. This is also probably my favorite romance because of the ending, and for those who know me: I dread romances  but not this one! Well, I might improve my tastes and look for happier movies, but I'll think about it tomorrow. ""After all tomorrow is another day."""

","A powerful and moving adaptation of one of the greatest American novels ever written.  While it must be said that the story is only fully appreciated if one has read the book, the movie does an excellent job of developing the major characters and plot points.  Unfortunately, however, many of the main complaints people have about the movie are actually due to omissions from the book.  For example, the classic complaint that Scarlett is selfish, especially in regard to having more children.  In the book, you see a heavy scene between her and Ashley where he practically throws himself at her and tells her that she should never have married Rhett, and can't even stand the thought of Rhett touching her.  This immediately precedes Scarlett telling Rhett she doesn't want more kids.<br/><br/>As far as historical complaints, remember that history is written by the victors.  No one is advocating slavery in this movie...it is a reality of that time period.  Ashley even says that he would have freed his slaves if the war hadn't freed them first.  Also, the carpetbaggers are not portrayed as evil because they are encouraging blacks to vote, but because they took advantage of destitute people whose lives were decimated by war, and of freed slaves who put their trust in them.  The vast majority of southerners were not wealthy and did not own slaves, or if they did, perhaps one or two...not the hundreds that plantation owners had.  The carpetbaggers came down and grabbed up property at foreclosure auctions and left thousands of families with nothing.  The carpetbaggers largely used the freed blacks to exert their own influence on the Reconstruction government in the south. They didn't see blacks as their equals any more than the southerners who once owned them.  They just wanted to use them as pawns against the South. The movie shows the irony of the carpetbaggers' words versus the reality of their actions.  They promised ""40 Acres and a Mule"" to buy their votes, but never delivered on that promise.  They were used, and then hung out to dry when Reconstruction was over and white southerners reclaimed control of their state governments.<br/><br/>All in all, a critique of a movie should not be a critique of the historical period in which it took place.  That is like saying Gladiator is a bad movie because it advocates Romans putting slaves to death in the arena.  It does no such thing...it just depicts a reality of the time.  Gone With the Wind is a classic for reasons having nothing to do with anyone's views on race relations."

","SPOILERS The story is so simple a young girl loves a young boy who loves his 1st cousin set during the Civil War. At any point in time this could have been a simple story but since there are so many players (the war being 1 of them) everything seems to go hairwire quickly.<br/><br/>Scarlett has this obession with Ashley Wilkes and no one not even the audience can understand why this is. Everyone wants her to go with Rhett and she refuses. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Scarlett marries Melanie's brother so that she can stay close to Mrs. Ashley Wilkes while Mr. Wilkes and her husband go off to war. I get the feeling that Scarlet never wanted to live a complex life but she is going to get one that is for sure. Scarlett's husband is killed and she is not sorrowful at all but pretends to be.They work in the hospital until Melanie gives birth, Captain Butler gets them half way home to Tara and then leaves.<br/><br/>
You have to ask yourself, if he loved her so much why would he leave her at that awful juncture? I know he tries to explain it later but his explanation plays a bit short. So she pulls the strength out of herself somehow and gets them to Tara only to find it is in shambles and what is worst is that her mother is dead and her Father is crazy. Melanie is so weak she must stay upstairs in bed to rest. One day a crazy Yankee comes looking for money and Melanie shoots him from behind. They both act hurried to hide his body and bury him. I bet alot of that type of stuff happened back then. I think this forms some form of strange bond beteween them: first they brought life into this world together under highly dangerous times (Why didnt scarlet say she forgot to get melanie and the baby to get them out of the way?) and now they have murdered someone together? This would explain Melanie's insistance that Scarlet be welcomed at the party (where she wears a red dress)...<br/><br/>anyway, the interesting parts of the  movie occur when Scarlet and Rhett go on a honeymoon and scarlet wakes up in the middle of hte night crying she screams out 'the fog the fog"" and he is like ""What?"" she is like i am lost in the fog looking for someone, and i can't find him..i keep calling out..."" he comforts her.<br/><br/>Then Melanie dies and Scarlet realizes that Asley has been lying to her all these years, he only could love Melanie. So Scarlet runs out into the streets to find Rhett and there is FOG everywhere...she is running and runnig and crying, ""Rhett"" ""Rhett""...i expected the movie to end here with him coming out from the fog and saying ""I love you Scarlett""...but it does not end that way..."

","Gone With The Wind was indeed, and still remains, a cinematic classic. Even to this day the words ""frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" are often heard repeated by persons who have never even seen the 1939 original that is based on the best selling novel by Margaret Mitchell.<br/><br/>The film romantically depicts the civil war era struggle between the head-strong Scarlet O'Hara and the grande-debonair stylist, Rhett Butler. The ""cat & mouse"" sort of romantic pursuit between Scarlet & Rhett is brilliantly played and wonderfully scripted.<br/><br/>1939 was a year of block buster films, such as The Wizard of Oz, and Gone with the wind was the supreme leader of this year. Though some today describe this film as a ""chick flick"" it should be remembered that it remained a block buster epic saga for more than 25 years, and commanded packed movie theaters and intense movie-going interest. Detractors today should view it in its proper historical context when referring to it as a classic.<br/><br/>The film has scenes of life before and during the civil war. Strong African American actors such as Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen give strong & unforgettable performances that earned them both a place in Hollywood as well as a place in African-American history.<br/><br/>Aside from the film itself the history of the making of this grand epic is just as entertaining and thrilling as the film itself. Gone with the wind is also a strong statement of the morality and race bias that was present in Hollywood in the pre-WWII era, and will serve as a perfect study for any student of american cinematic history, African-American history, or the post civil was romanticism that has lasted for nearly 140 years."

","It's probably one of the most famous film making stories that Vivien Leigh was 'at the right place at the right time.' I've heard her often quoted as saying, ""I read the (book and) i knew i was going to play her."" (that isn't a direct quote...but you get the drift). And boy i'm glad she thought that. If you believe in reincarnation, then Vivien Leigh was Scarlett O'Hara in a past life and has created a memorable screen heroine. Feminists should be dancing the Charleston in rejoice. Never have i seen a more engaging character on screen. Nor a more engaging drama. This is more than just a 'great' romance. (I say that probably because i'm not a romantic- ironic, seeing that this is my favourite movie). Not to sound soppy, but this is a movie about the human spirit, about endurance, our ability to survive and also about human nature. Yes, Scarlett may seem to be selfish, a human trait, but that it what is so intriguing about her character. The honest approach to humanity- acknowledging our faults as represented through Scarlett, as well as our positives- represented through Melanie, makes this story so engaging. We see that humanity is strong (both lead actresses are, as are the males - except maybe poor old Ashley Wilkes-lol)which may seem ironic in that it is set against the backdrop of war. The last scenes are unforgettable. Leigh as Scarlett strips away her glamour, showing the strength of her acting abilities when she cries out her famous lines at the bottom of the staircase. Again, this reinforces and reminds us of the ties to the land that we must hold, especially in this increasingly globalised, consumerist, materialist world we live in.  This is an uplifting movie, and although sad, the war is a perfect backdrop for humanity's triumph. Scarlett has been described as the most famous screen villan--- she's my hero."
"jorg1111","Null","0","0","6 July 2003"," Vivien Leigh - A timeless performance
","The most amazing thing about ""Gone With the Wind"" may not be any more than the simple truth of the acting-with the paramount contribution being England's great Vivien Leigh . Vivien Leigh gives a timeless performance so real and true to Margaret Mitchell's vision of Scarlett O'Hara that the author herself called her ""perfect."" Considering that Mitchell would not go on record about anything else related to the movie,it is the highest accolade possible. Never mind the more than deserved Academy Award, this is one of the most modern or even post modern performances committed to film.<br/><br/>From the first moment that she is introduced on camera, she is the living, breathing Scarlett and all the subtlety, nuance and feline charm that exude from this phenomenal actress bring the entire film to life. It is rare that an actor seems to just exist on camera and still be the character like this, but it is a tribute to Leigh's skill and naturalness that makes Scarlett seem uncontrived as a performance. It is also a rare peak into what psychologists might call the ""feminine-hysterical"" psyche.<br/><br/>
In any case, I guarantee that Scarlett will be understood better by women more than by most men. Vivien Leigh so understood the character that she brings things subtlety from the book to the screen. The scene in which she descends the stairs at the Atlanta mansion to find Rhett in the drawing room, for example, contains a brief bit where she glances behind her as if she might better make a break for it. That moment came directly from the book and not the script or director. Selznick was telling Leigh to throw the ""damned"" book away, but she studied it before each scene and it shows. Recently, after a viewing in Los Angeles, a man who had obviously been dragged to see the film for the first time by his girlfriend was heard to say ""That Vivien Leigh could be acting now."" In looking at the jumbled script it is almost impossible to figure out how any actress could make some of the expository dialogue sound natural or memorable. Vivien Leigh does it brilliantly. She is natural and yet expressive.<br/><br/>There will be many who do not like or admire Scarlett. But it would be a sorry soul indeed who did not perceive the mastery and genius of this performance by Leigh. As subjective as it is, I believe this may be unsurpassed by any cinematic performance. How many times do you leave the theatre remembering the name of the main character? What performance has ever spoken to the collective heart so loudly (""Garland in ""Oz,"" perhaps, or Brando as Don Corleone) Even Leigh admitted it was difficult to find sympathetic characteristics in Scarlett, but she manages to convey the unique vulnerability and determination that are the very heart of ""Gone With the Wind."" The actors around her shine as if illuminated by the nucleus of this great performance-and I don't think Gable, De Havilland or McDaniel could ever have been surpassed. I believe it was ""Entertainment Weekly"" that when polled a few years ago declared Vivien Leigh's the most deserved Oscar in the history of the Academy Awards.

","Oka This Movie is the best movie of all time. And yes this movie Is worth the credit it gets i mean some people that give bad comments about this movie have no good taste for classic movies. I was upset that this movie was places 133 in the top 250 best movies. This movie should have been in the top five. It has everything action, romance, adventure, historical history i mean i can go on.And i think gone with the wind is way better than casblanca. all casblanca is is some dued in a bar crying about this girl he used to like. i believe gone with the wind doesn't get as much credit as it deserves. And it was great in 1939 and still is i mean u look back at other movies of course they are going to be ordinary now.But this is the best movie hands down."

","What can't I say about one of the greatest movies of all time? Watching this masterpiece makes one long for a time when thought and energy was put into make a good film, when an epic really was epic. When actors were cast not for their looks and their fame rating, but for their talent and - maybe even most importantly - their chemistry with the other actors. Gone With the Wind has the reputation of being one of the best movies of all time, and for good reason.<br/><br/>Now, I had what I initially thought was the misfortune of seeing the movie before reading the book. I always say, Better to read the book first so as the movie doesn't influence your opinion of the writing too much. In the case of Gone With the Wind, I don't think it matters at all. The movie is as close to the 1000+ page book as possible. It's almost impossible to imagine anyone other than Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, and Olivia de Havilland playing the leads. The actors know their characters so well you'd think they actually helped Margaret Mitchell write the novel. Every cast member interacts wonderfully with each other and everything fits together so well. Gable and Leigh especially shine in their respective roles. Gable is so irresistibly handsome and suave, making him the perfect Rhett Butler, and at the same time he proves what a brilliant actor he is by adding subtle emotional depth to the character. Leigh is amazing in the role of Scarlett O'Hara, a difficult feat considering the complexity of a character like this one is often hard to lift out of the pages of a book and slap onto a movie screen. Leigh manages to play Scarlett with the proper amount of overwhelming emotion and underlying vulnerability. Both Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland are stunning in their roles and round out a perfect cast consisting of Hattie McDaniel, Butterfly McQueen, and the stellar Thomas Mitchell.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has many other qualities that I love about it - the costumes, the set design, the color, the music, and that oh-so-heartbreaking plot. But for me, characters more often than not make a story and Gone With the Wind has got a handful of wonderfully complex characters that are just cast brilliantly. If not for the on-screen chemistry of Gable and Leigh, why else would people watch this movie over and over, always hoping for a different ending?"

","Warning: Contains Spoilers, If Haven't Seen Movie PLEASE DON'T READ Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie of all time, I'm here to discuss the reasons I love it. The acting is great for the parts, because after the first fifteen minutes you start imagining Scarlett O'hara not as Vivian Leigh, but as Scarlett O'Hara, jealous, and selfish. The same thing happens with the other characters, actors, and actresses dissapear, and the characters come in. The directing, producing, and writing is fantastic. First of all by picking the actors and actresses, second of all by taking the chance of practically putting the whole book in the movie (not the whole book, but most of it) the writing is fantastic because not many movies have been adapted like this, and I think this is the first of it's time to have each scene actually mean something. Another thing is that rarely a commercially succesfull movie is great. This is also the first epic of it's time (maybe second but close to first) and not many people have done a movie like this. Also it was a great idea to keep the audience waiting three years, that's a tip for producers who are reading this, make them waiting a long, long, long time for a great movie, then you'll get big box office money. The story is fantastic showing a young girl, selfish, jealous, of everyone who has a man, then she becomes nice, and carefull when she's poor, but once she's rich again, she's back to her selfish, and jealous self. Then at the end with nothing left, no daughter, no son, no husband, nobody to love, she see's what she has to do go back to Tara, the place where she lived her childhood, and had a great time, the place where she got through the civil war, the place with her memories in it, the place that she loves."

","It is useless to try to sum up or understand the phenomenon that is ""Gone With the Wind"". The film will stand as the greatest most visceral film in the collective heart for all time. It has more real humanity-with all the foibles and charms-than any other motion picture ever made. If there is a single person out there who doesn't understand Scarlett's wanting something so much and never getting it, but letting her life's fortunes be guided by her own ill-conceived hopes, I want to congratulate you on having a dream life. The chemistry of these actors and the truth in their performances is the key to getting us into this world not too far from our own: where the wrong precepts are being taken into battle and the arrogance of war and false ideals is put beyond the value of human life. One may not like all the characters, or even may feel that the actors are more stereotyped and drawn bigger than the low-key performances that are supposed to be more ""real"" seen on the screen today(which are usually just underexpressed and not like real life and its melodramatics at all). In that case, please think back to a time where communication between real people was par for the course and one's sense of drama could be expressed in dialogue in real life... Certainly no one handles this better than the great Vivien Leigh. Her Scarlett is true and perfect at every turn. She is the life force of the film: maddening and monstrous, but desperately yearning and, so, understandable. Gable's performance shows subtlety and timeless vulnerability that make this performance seem more accomplished with each year. DeHavilland places Stanislavsky-like center of energy in her heart like a current-day Method actress. And Leslie Howard agonizingly reaches the tortured soul of someone who is physically attracted to a woman with whom he knows he could never make a relationship work. Beyond that the force of humor and pathos that Hattie McDaniel displays are true and beautiful in their execution. Butterfly McQueen slyly adds gestures and dimensions that may not be as visible until one concentrates on her performance. People have tried to understand or attack the magnetism of this film since its release to no avail. As long as human nature wants what it doesn't have or mourns what it feels it has lost, ""Gone With the Wind"" will be the film that resonates with the disillusionment and hope that we all share and which moves us forward."

","It took many years, six, I believe, for Margaret Mitchell to complete the writing of her Pulitzer Prize winning book on which the feature film is based.  The novel shows it and it was still being written with major changes, for example, in its title and the name of its  protagonist from Pansy to Scarlett even while its publisher, Macmillan, was preparing it for print.  <br/><br/>The film also took years in development, including the great struggle to locate exacting matches for its characters and then the application of some of the finest crafts men and women in what might have been the peak year of Hollywood's Golden Age.  The film shows that as well.  It should be included in all curricula on filmmaking and in long form writing.  It is a finely etched, beautifully considered character study.  As such it is a triumph in American literature in both novel and film forms.  Like all finely accomplished works of the human heart it has become timeless.<br/><br/>Beyond all of that we are left with a depiction of artistry in both literature and movie making when as in other forms, such as architecture, love was part if the gestalt of creation and profit at bottom line accounting and the marketplace were not the major compelling issues.  Here, we have an example of serendipity and timing of arts at a moment in our history when it was possible to create the enduring classic that this is. ""Gone with the Wind"" might also describe the possibility of such a moment."

They seem to think that you're SUPPOSED to like Scarlett. I never really liked Scarlett O'Hara. She's incredibly selfish, spoiled, and naive. That's sort of the purpose of Mellie's character, to highlight all that's wrong with Scarlett. But I can't help but admire her tenacity, her absolute desire to survive and to make it. It takes the death of her best friend and the only man she truly loved, Rhett Butler, leaving her in the end for her to realize her flaws, and it is the ending that is best of all.

","Gone With The Wind is definitely a classic film, with an amazing cast from Cammie King (Bonnie) to Clark Gable (Rhett). The acting is absolutely incredible, brought together by the amazingly talented Vivien Leigh (Scarlett). They-with perhaps the exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley-brought new life to the characters, giving more depth to them than any modern actor or actress ever could, especially in the given timeframe. The music and amazing cinematography are breathtaking, creating such classic scenes as the field of wounded soldiers, and the infamous 'frankly my dear...' scene- a ground-breaking scene in and of itself, as it was the first time an actor swore on-screen. For a movie compacting twelve years into four hours, it is incredible. However, in contrast to the book you will find that many scenes, important to understanding the characters-Scarlett in particular-were left out, in favor of building up the rather detestable character of Rhett Butler. As well as leaving out two very important players in Scarlett's life-her two eldest children, Wade Hamilton and Ella Kennedy. Scarlett's feelings are often cheapened, leaving the viewer to think she is simply a selfish bitch, instead of a spoiled child trying to survive in a world that was suddenly cold and unforgiving, where her only friends are a woman she despises, the married man she loves, and a man who cuts her down at every opportunity. The film's saving grace is in the abilities of Vivien Leigh, as she managed to give life and depth to Scarlett that I cannot imagine any other actress capturing, then or now. Perhaps if there had been more time it could have been more true to the novel, but as it is it remains a classic. This movie will forever be my favorite, and it pains me to know we will never be able to recapture the magic that was Gone With The Wind."

","The first half is a harrowing recreation of the problems faced by women during the civil war, but after Scarlett's second husband dies it becomes a kind of soap opera. Okay, the score is probably up there ahead of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and BEN HUR and the four leading performances are among the best of all timebut I am still undecided whether to like it. Vivien Leigh plays the main character who may not be the most likable character in the history of fiction but sure makes the film fun to watch.<br/><br/> The ending is probably my favourite of all time or at least one of them, that or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or CASABLANCA or BEN HUR. Clark Gable who was not around much until the last hour played an intriguing character in his usual laid back style. However, the only character who is completely likable dies at the end, seeing as the other characters include a damnably laid back officer, a manipulative witch(similar in many ways to Anne Baxter in ALL ABOUT EVE), and a simple minded servant with a squeaky voice.

","For contemporary moviegoers ""Gone with the wind"" offers a veritable shock of pleasure - more than a gorgeous monument, ""Gone with the wind"" along with ""Citizen Kane"" is probably the darkest movie ever produced within the studio system. A riveting tragedy of neurotic self destruction, it fixes its gaze on Scarlett O'Hara, the firebrand Dixie princess, as she ricochets with blind abandon between her Southern belle fantasies and her ruthless heart, between her abstract crush on Ashley Wilkes and her hunka burnin' lust for Rhett Butler (the man she hates herself for loving becomes he's as big a scoundrel as she is). The film begins as a bedazzled historical romance, but in the haunting final hour morphs into a Technicolor-gothic ""Scenes from a marriage"" with Vivien Leigh - now flirting, now raging, now smiling at heaven through tears - etching an indelible vision of feminine strength and self delusion. To see ""Gone with the wind"" is to weep for the fearlessness with which Hollywood once believed the sublime was possible."

I also love Mammy, because she steals the show with her humor and her pure charm. Hattie MacDaniel deserved her Oscar as well. You know, I think this movie would adapt into a great musical if someone with skill picked it up.  There are millions of spots where a song and/or dance number could be placed. This movie is among my favorite movies of all time.  It's a classic, you have to see it.  It's more romantic than ""Titanic"" will ever be."

","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  It's a true classic.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh is astonishing in one of my all-time favorite performances. It's so hard for me to believe that this movie is from the '30s because it's so timeless.<br/><br/>Love stories set against the background of war are a movie cliche at this point, but Gone With the Wind was original for its time, and is simply the greatest love story of all time.<br/><br/>You'll find yourself cheering for Scarlet then cheering for Rhett, then crying for both.  The acting is first class (naturally considering how many legendary performers starred), and the scenery and locations are just stellar and brilliant thanks to the color technology first used in the '30s.<br/><br/>Victor Fleming and the rest of the crew recreated the time period so well that I sometimes forget that this is a film from the 1930s and not footage from the 1860s.<br/><br/>This is also the most accurate retelling of a novel that I've ever seen. The only differences I noticed are that in the book Scarlet has three children, not one.  This is one movie that lives up to the book.<br/><br/>In short, Gone With the Wind is a touching look at the people caught in the middle of a war, and allowed me to actually feel compassion (despite their political beliefs) for the people who happened to live in the South, and is also the greatest love story ever told.<br/><br/>See this movie and you too will recite the final dialogue between Rhett and Scarlet with tear soaked cheeks forever... and never get sick of it."

","Do I think this is the greatest movie ever made?  No, but it is in the top five.  The first half of the film is one of the most gripping of all time, but thereafter it drags on interminably. Had interest such as the first half been kept up for the second half, then I would say this is the greatest film ever made. Fleming never loses sight of the book. Mitchell's book is not a happy one, for the South or for the main characters.  Ashley Wilkes may be a brave soldier, but he is a weak vacillating man, never able to completely break away from Scarlett; Rhett Butler, never able to win Scarlett's love until it is too late for both of them, becomes a fleshy topor in the end. Much like the South under Reconstruction as the Cavaliers give way to the carpetbaggers.  Only after Melanie dies does Scarlett realize, as she sees Ashley for real, that she is free to love Rhett; as the South realizes it must adjust to a new paradigm. One of the most gripping scenes in all filmdom opens the door for the complete degradation of the south and its aristocratic cavaliers:  The scene in the Atlanta rail yards with the hundreds of wounded and dying men set against the tattered Confederate battle standard..what a scene! Despite the dragging part of Confederate post partum agonies, this is a film that one can see over and over again, especially the war scenes and the destruction of the only true aristocratic civilization this country has ever known. I have always wondered just what Margaret Mitchell thought of all this up to the time she stepped in front of the automobile that took her life.  A suicide?  we'll never know. So we are left with the book and the magnum opus of this film which will never see a sequel that will do the original even close to justice."

Yes, it is a romantic melodrama (if you want the civil war details and the true characterisation, read the book) but it is all done with such class. Vivien Leigh is perfect as Scarlett and yes, she is a brat of a character but that is the point. The story is how she survives when everything she knows is turned upsidedown and taken away. The only weakness in the film is Leslie Howard who is simply not believable as someone who would hold Scarlett's attention for so many years.

Throw in the chaos caused by the war and you have one rip-roaring story.

","It's very hard to write about this film, because in one hand it's really one of the greatest film, but on the other hand I don't like this film very much and not my personal favourite. I have to appreciate its place in the movie history, the great achievements in cinematography and special effects (matte painting) and the performances by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. The thing, I don't like about this film is the story. It's full of sentimentalism, propagandizes conservative thoughts and behaviours and simply too long. But it's interesting to watch the film just because of the cinematography. Every pictures, every moments were so beautiful and eye-popping. It made the whole movie like a dream and so unreal. The use of colours, shades, contrasts. And Ernest Haller keeps the quality at the same level along the whole movie. And the level is perfect. Never could anyone reach it again. It's an interesting fact, that he photographed 'Jezebel', the other Southern epic, one year before. It was made in black-and-white and he could catch the mood of the South so well, that the only man who could made 'Gone with the Wind' was him. The scene of the burning of Atlanta is an essential scene in the movie history and a landmark in the action-photography. David O.Selznick was a talented economist too, because it was a great idea to burn down old sets in front of the cameras and put it in the movie as 'the burning of Atlanta'. No one wondered that 'the gate of King Kong' was in Atlanta. The other great thing is the set design. I was surprised, that how perfectly have the matte painting technic been used in this relatively early movie. Clark Gable is perfect as Rhett Butler. I think, that he was more believable than Robert Donat, who got the Academy Award for the Best Actor in 1939, in 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips'. Vivien Leigh is the only Scarlett O'Hara. The casting procedure and the hysteria across the United States was something what has never been before and never happened since then. And it was a huge fortune, that Selznick found Leigh at the last minute, because only one producer suggested her to the role. The background of the film is almost as interesting as the movie itself (three directors but only one credited, lot of versions of the screenplay and the most important: Hattie McDaniel was the first Afro-American actress, who got the Best Supporting Actress Oscar). All in all it's a great, landmarking picture from my favourite period of movie history, one of the biggest success of all time and got 8 Academy Awards."
"marcslope","Null","0","0","29 December 2000"," A Rolls-Royce for Middlebrows
","Not a great movie, in the strictest sense -- it doesn't tell us anything we don't know, it doesn't offer a new viewpoint on an old subject, and it hews rather too closely to conventional Hollywood narrative techniques. Further, the faithful-old-servant stuff is pretty hard to take in this day and age. But certainly it's a great testament to the studio system and its ability to conjure lost worlds with dazzling images. You'll never see Technicolor this rich again, a production this lavish, such recklessly extravagant casting (even the minor roles, like Isabell Jewell's Emmy Slattery or Laura Hope Crews' Aunt Pittypat, are perfection). <br/><br/>And yes, Scarlett and Rhett may be the stuff of women's novels, but as played by Gable and Leigh, they're strikingly adult, and flesh-and-blood--they convey much with looks and gestures that the Hays Office couldn't have been happy about. The fastest-moving four-hour movie ever made, and, as it has been described elsewhere, ""the movie-est of all movies."""

","This is the standard by which all other movies must be rated. And here, with a scale of 1 to 10, this must be rated a 10. This does not necessarily mean that there are not other movies that are better, a somewhat meaningless exercise since all ""10"" movies must be unique, so not truly comparable. But it is useful to keep Gone with the Wind in mind when rating other movies. I cannot comprehend how people can rate such trash as Fargo or even The Sound of Music as the greatest movie ever created. I wonder how many movies they have watched? Six?<br/><br/>Yes, GWTW has flaws. Leslie Howard supposedly refused to read the book before playing the part, and got Ashley wrong as a result. And the biggest flaw is that it glorifies a way of life based on the evil of slavery. If the movie came out today, how many people would believe that they could enjoy such a storyline? Surely it would be picketed as politically incorrect. And yet the movie, like all great movies, makes you suspend disbelief and accept its pretext.<br/><br/>This is not entirely surprising given that the story emerged from a society, the South, that had become expert at weaving a world of fantasy to justify its unspeakably evil past, and to some extent, still does so today. There is a lesson here: movies, as art, are not about political correctness. And simply watching - or reading - a story does not somehow instantly brainwash you into believing its political message. I come away from seeing GWTW with a bit more empathy for what the South went through (I have lived in Southern states), but not a lot. And it certainly does not leave me advocating a Southern Rebel mindset, just as a movie about Nazis does not leave me waving a swastika.<br/><br/>I still enjoy GWTW, I still rate it a 10. But the truth is, as I have watched it many times over the years, I have expected to see, somewhere, a condemnation of slavery, but have not found it. Great art expresses a truth that transcends its time. GWTW fails that standard, sadly. But it is still a thoroughly enjoyable movie. And with movies, that is the bottom line."

Clark Gable turns in a terrific performance as the handsome and rugged Rhett Butler.  Unfortunately, Vivien Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) is no match for him on the screen.  Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy is also noteworthy not only because it was expertly carried out, but also because it (in ironic contrast to the story of the film) is a celebrated moment for African-American actors.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is a pretty picture with a great performance be a Hollywood legend that is marred by its terrible flawed message.

But there was NOTHING that I haven't seen yet in other movies. Of course 'Gone with the Wind' inspired a lot of them. But I really have enough of it and that's why I couldn't enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>But except of the innovative style it really had a stupid story. It's about 230 minutes long and it didn't happen that much. I hate that Scarlett turns from a hoity-toity Lady into a hard working person WITHOUT A SINGLE COMPLAINT. Suddenly she is leading the family. That wasn't convincing at all. She is in love with Ashley without any reason given. It's just a constant in this movie that you have to accept. She never thinks of NOT loving him. What's so special about this guy? Not convincing at all. You don't get any case history, nothing.<br/><br/>Clark Gable's character was SO stereotype. They all were completely stereotype. There was not a single surprising action of any character. You can say that's because this movie was ""copied"" so often. That's half of the truth. It was really boring for me. It wasn't suspenseful, very less action, boring comedy, stereotyped and predictable drama. Romance? - Maybe, but I'm not naive enough to swallow that.<br/><br/>Probably an enjoyable and entertaining movie for me as kid, but I'm too old for it now. So also if I didn't feel the greatness of the movie I can accept its greatness. And the visuals are top.<br/><br/>6/10 for a non-convincing movie with some admirable aspects."

","If you are not a fan of romances, you will definitely yawn at this movie. I certainly did. I understand no one who calls this a masterpiece. The story is uninteresting and it's just painful to sit through. A definite 2/10 movie. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was out of respect for the people who think this movie's so wonderful."
"mistervela","6","3","8","18 December 2015"," Too much drama makes it look too fake
","I waited all my life to see this movie, I've heard about it since I grew up in the 70s but never got the chance to sit properly to watch it until I was 44 because of the length of the movie and the theme made me feel always a little apprehensive to withstand it.<br/><br/>I cannot review this movie with today's standards, as this movie was a pioneer in some dramatic elements which nowadays seem very obsolete (like the extreme melodramatic acting only seen in modern day Spanish soap operas) and some other flaws in camera work like weird framing, scene transitions or even editing, which again, at that time probably it was barely insignificant.<br/><br/>I was more disappointed with some directing choices on the drama curve and Scarlett weird and awkward behavior. <br/><br/>Scarlett's character seemed to me more like a mentally-ill person, ultra immature (too much), with an extreme obsession for Ashley and for the money. I'm sure in real life there are a lot of people today, men or women, just like her, who after getting married they still feel secretly in love with the one they didn't get to have, to the point it becomes an obsession and a reason to leave, even after having a perfect life. But if this type of person was the original type developed by Margaret Mitchell, it would fit better in a thriller movie where the lover is a psycho or a stalker. <br/><br/>As I was watching the movie and when Brett and Scarlett finally became a couple, I felt pleased that they were going to be finally a real happy couple, especially for the always charming Rhett. Of course, there's no novel nor movie without obstacles, but in here they seemed to appear out of nowhere. Scarlett with her ill-obsessions seemed to spoil it every time. She just could not see what a great husband and father Brett was and how much he loved her. Was she too immature to not see it (Rhett's love), too obsessed with money and her little palace, too obsessed with Ashley or just mentally sick and oblivious of the world around her? Just until the very end when Ashley's wife, Mel, died, she realized she could love or was in love with Brett but was too late. What a bummer!<br/><br/>In terms of the directing choices, there were a couple of mishaps. For instance when in one scene Rhett was mourning his little daughter, completely secluded with his pain, and Melanie was able to convince him to allow the funeral, right after she left the room, she collapsed ill, as if her effort to convince Brett was too physically exhausting. Then, a short scene of the funeral is lacking, because the next scene, when Brett and Scarlett are visiting dying Mel, Rhett now looks completely fine and seems that his immense pain has gone abruptly. Also, in this scene, Scarlett looks again like a psycho woman, completely oblivious of her surrounding circumstances, who doesn't even care about her daughter who had just died nor her ultra close dying friend, but she is solely interested in getting Ashley's love at last right on the spot, regardless of the people around her (that's why she got caught) while Ashley is crying for her beloved wife. At the end of the movie she promises in a maniacal way that she will get him back. Psycho Scarlett. Definitely a very weird character only comparable to Norma Desmond's in Sunset Boulevard.<br/><br/>I loved Mammy's acting, she became the first African American to win an academy award. Prissy's character (Butterfly McQueen) was kind of awkward too and also a little bit of a psycho as well, this can be seen when Scarlett had to go to look for the doctor after Prissy refused to do it. She's left in the scene completely out of her mind."

","Civil War-era love story, with spoiled Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara sparring with frequently-reluctant Rhett Butler, a blockade runner and smooth-talking charmer. From the sprawling bestseller by Margaret Mitchell, this beautiful-looking M-G-M production is filmed in eye-popping colors and enacted grandly by a well-chosen cast. Still, for modern tastes, this period in history is becoming more uncomfortable to tread through, especially for those with an unobjective eye. Emotions or personal bias may tend to rule out the romantic drama at the heart of the story, leaving the rest of the narrative seeming like ripened balderdash. Even so, it would be difficult to fault the main performances, with Clark Gable's Rhett the quintessential playboy and Vivien Leigh winning the Best Actress Oscar for her nearly-flawless performance as Scarlett (though real Southerners tend to balk at her accent). At nearly four hours, one begins to squirm after awhile, though Victor Fleming's Oscar-winning direction keeps the calamities coming at a spirited pace. Screenwriter Sidney Howard received a statue for his adaptation; Hattie McDaniel was also awarded for her typically rousing supporting turn as Scarlett's all-seeing, all-knowing ""Mammy"". Second-half, in which Scarlett returns to Tara after the Yankees have scorched the land and raped the property, is the most gripping section of the movie, let down a bit once Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes returns from a Yankee prison (Howard's performance is fine, if colorless). The film was named Best Picture of 1939, no small feat as this is generally considered one of the most prolific years for the entertainment industry. *** from ****"
"jzappa","6","3","8","9 August 2007"," I Don't Feel Sorry For You, Confederacy
","Imagine if Schindler's List was made from the Nazis' point of view, with our sympathy being invested in them. That is my way of describing Gone With the Wind. It's a bona fide epic of absolutely magnificent film-making that, since it can hold its own shockingly well right now in 2007, must've been the holiest of holies in 1939, but it's made from the point of view of the Confederates during the Civil War. Hello. They wanted to perpetuate slavery. This film is an adaptation of a novel that works as propaganda for the wrong people. That's not excusable the way The Godfather is excusable in its glamorization of an organized crime family or Cool Hand Luke's glamorization of prisoners. This film actually makes these slaves look healthy, well-fed and treated with dignity, downplays the wrongful deaths of loyal horses, and treats the South's blind pride and nomadic, Leonine attitude towards anything nonchalantly, like we aren't supposed to analyze it.<br/><br/>Somehow, I find myself hopping on the band wagon anyway and finding this film to be great. Margaret Mitchell, though she is the brain behind the film's aforementioned justification of the Confederacy, writes a story with unabashed love and emotion. Eventually, we learn to love these characters as individuals, the drama is constant and affecting, and thus the film overall is a very intense experience. The film's cast is led by the tremendous performance of Vivien Leigh, whose realization of hot-headed, selfish, greedy, impetuous and aggressive Scarlett O'Hara is clearcut and realistic. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the oldest slave who is somehow able to bark orders and take charge in some situations, has riveting moments of her own, especially one near the end that has an almost contemporary feeling in its elusive steadicam shot that loses itself in her gushing monologue. Olivia De Havilland inspires the most emotion from the audience, becoming the sweetest and most compassionate character you could imagine in that particular time and place, almost like an otherworldy personality in that setting.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the most staggeringly beautiful thing about the film, is full of beautiful framing, rich colors, and a look as if it were made just this year. There is a scene where Leigh and De Havilland are speaking in a dimly veiled room, and we only see their silhouettes. This is breathtaking film-making for 1939. The music is wonderful and lush, the epitome of a large-canvas orchestral score.<br/><br/>However, I could never see this film ever again. The length is not what bothers me, because there are many favorite films of mine that I would not mind any more if they were four hours long, but if the first two hours were as hard to swallow as those of this film, I definitely would. This movie's first half panhandles for our sympathy during scenes of wounded Confederates and weeping townsfolk. It displays a society that was naive, barbaric, and lazy yet arrogant, proud, and melodramatic, two trios of adjectives that are preposterous when hand in hand. However, once the intermission is over, the second half begins, and that is when the film is truly interesting to me. It becomes a saga that could've been set in many different contexts, because the last two hours are all about the individuals themselves and the motives each of them have that tie themselves in knots. The drama then is truly felt by me.<br/><br/>Let me finally note that the only older film available in any of the six video stores in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is Gone With the Wind."
"jboothmillard","9","3","8","6 September 2005"," Gone with the Wind
","35 million people saw this film, all four hours of it (I know this because it was number 1 on The Ultimate Film), and it is a great romance, with the American Civil War in between, ignore the black slavery aspects, from Oscar winning director Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz, out the same year). Basically, trying to be brief, the story, set in 1861 on a large cotton plantation called Tara, revolves around the life of the O'Hara family. Mainly, Scarlett O'Hara (Oscar winning Vivien Leigh), she has been in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) for a long time, and he at one point possibly mentioned marriage, but he is now set to marry her cousin Melanie Hamilton (Oscar nominated Olivia De Havilland). In a vengeful mood, Scarlett agrees to marry the enthusiastic Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies soon from measles when he enters the war, and Scarlett has now become a business woman. At that point the man who eyed her at a barbecue party, Rhett Butler (Oscar nominated Clark Gable, who had already won two), proposes marriage, but she is too self involved to agree. Then, not long later the war really hits home (literally), and everyone has to get out of town before the Yankees kill them. After the war has settled for a while, Scarlett has saved Melanie and her baby, she returns to her old house where the servants, including trustworthy, but easily annoyed Mammy (Oscar winning Hattie McDaniel, the first black woman ever to win one), and when the mother dies becomes head of the house. For a while, the story continues as the remaining family patching up the house partly destroyed. Rhett also returns from the Civil War to make a final commitment with Scarlett, and they also have a little girl. Years pass, and Scarlett and Rhett are starting to drift from each other and hate each other. More trauma follows when she reveals another baby, but falls down the stairs, and also their daughter Bonnie Blue Butler (Cammie King) is killed after falling off her horse. The concluding parts of the film see Melanie near death and asking Scarlett to promises to look after Ashley, and Rhett thinking that Scarlett still loves him. In the end, Scarlett has truly forgotten her love for Ashley and fallen for Rhett, but it is too late, because with the confusion, a lost baby and a dead daughter (was there a divorce though?), Rhett decides to go back home to Charleston, Scarlett is very upset, but does remember Ashely and Rhett both mentioning hope at her home land of Tara, I can't understand how, but she sees hope in getting her true love back. Phew! Also starring Thomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara, Barbara O'Neil as Ellen O'Hara, Laura Hope Crews as Aunt ""Pittypat"" Hamilton, Harry Davenport as Dr. Meade, Evelyn Keyes as Suellen O'Hara, Ann Rutherford as Careen O'Hara, Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, Alicia Rhett as India Wilkes and Everett Brown as Big Sam. Leigh is truly remarkable as Scarlett who can fake crying to get her own way, be heroic during the war and pain of others, and show true emotions about all situations in her journey, and Gable is just as good as Rhett. A long film, but if you can stay awake (which I did the second time), well worth it. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing; Best Writing, Screenplay, Technical Achievement Award and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Special Effects, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and an Honorary Award for William Cameron Menzies (for use of colour). Vivien Leigh was number 79, Clarke Gable number 63 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Gable was also number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Leigh was also number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 6 on Britain's Finest Actresses, she was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 66 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 2 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 59 (""As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again.""), number 31 (""After all, tomorrow is another day."") and number 1 (""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."") on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, it was number 75 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Films.

"thomaspkanell","3","5","17","20 August 2017"," Detestable Depiction of Romance and of ""Genteel"" Civilization
","As I write this review (in 2017) we have violence in Charlottesville, Virginia by white supremacists, a church group killed in Charleston, South Carolina by a gunman enamored of the Confederate flag (2015.) And over the last eighty years, we have ""Gone With The Wind"" as a kind of statement of a nostalgia for the ""good old days"" when slaves catered to the whim of white people, where white cousins married each other, where mistresses slapped their servants around, where people didn't marry for love, but for power, money, social standing and lust. Talk about depressing!<br/><br/>As if the institution of slavery weren't vile enough, we actually see the effect of slavery on the slave owners themselves who aren't able to have an honest romance with each other because they can't respect humanity enough to treat all people equally as ""endowed by their Creator"" with ""inalienable rights of life, liberty and happiness."" If the basis of Southern society were based on the denial of these rights, is it any wonder that the pursuit of happiness was forever out of reach for these people? If people can't love or respect those who labor honestly and serve them well, how can they possibly love themselves or each other?<br/><br/>Scarlett is a spoiled young woman, always scheming in the ways of love, who never grows up. Rhett sees the futility of war with the North, but yet he enlists with the Confederates after Atlanta falls because he can't keep himself from supporting a losing cause and because of his warped sense of ""honor."" The movie-goer is subjected to many rounds of deviousness, deception and tragedy, just as the Southerners deceived themselves about their own supposed virtue even while subjugating and enslaving of a whole class of people.<br/><br/>Men are always depicted as ""genteel,"" women as ""belles,"" slaves as ""simple and accommodating,"" the North as ""oppressive and ruthless."" The North and South are depicted as two separate countries, two separate civilizations. It's an affront to Lincoln's vision that the United States was one country which should remain united and held together as such.<br/><br/>The only character who shows any depth is Melanie, Ashley's wife, who is long-suffering and sacrificing, but her frailty and meekness overshadow her goodness.<br/><br/>It is unsettling that in 1939 and even today that this movie is considered one of the greatest ever made. To me, it's detestable! It's a national tragedy that slavery should ever have existed, but this movie is also a tragic in that it invokes a nostalgia for a civilization that should forever be relegated to the dust-bin of history. Just three years before this movie was released, Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and yet in his home country he was a second-class citizen. It would be another eight years that Jackie Robinson would become Rookie of the Year in Major League Baseball. The black actress, Hattie McDaniel, who won the Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actress"" in this movie was forbidden by Georgia authorities to attend her own movie's premiere in Atlanta! Let us not forget that 1939 was also the year that Hitler sought to create his own racist society by killing millions of innocent Jews, Slavs and other undesirables in WW2. When you have people praising this movie so glibly and glossing over the prevailing ideas of racism even today, one wonders to where our sense of moral outrage has disappeared.<br/><br/>Greatest film ever made? I just don't see it. It made me angry, nauseous and offended. I couldn't find any redemption for the film from a purely romantic point of view either. Everyone deceives each other, nobody is honest and for this reason, tragedy abounds. I think the film says more about American racism than it does about theatrical art. And this racism is not a theoretical racism incidental to the story line, but it's about the prevalent racism that had allowed the original institution to exist, this particular movie to be made and our present racial strife to perpetuate."
"ae7641","Null","4","13","15 December 2004"," THIS MOVIE SHOULD GO WITH THE WIND
","Someone pointed out flaws in this film, but there are more. Also someone downplayed or white-washed the racism in Gone With the Wind. In the first place happy slaves is a stupid idea. Slaves had no rights. No rights to education, voting or any freedom. Someone else decided who and when they were to ""marry"" or produce other slaves. They were bred and treated like cattle. They were legally beaten and murdered for no reason. Slave women were regularly raped by white owners. And where is Mammy's husband and children? Sold and ripped away from her at an auction block. All this and slaves are supposed to be happy. Secondly,how can we care about the likes of Scarlett, someone who profits from the death and suffering of enslaved people like a drug pusher? Slavery or having no rights at all does not produce happiness. There are reports of house slaves committing suicide or killing their children rather than have them subjected to slavery, and a famous one, Harriet Tubman, describes how degrading it is before she escapes. <br/><br/>Some viewers are caught up in the romance and music without stopping to note how the film white washes slavery and despicable people. How about happy smiling concentration camp victims and wonderful, beautiful and romantic sadistic nazi prison guards?"

","The people who made this film realized that the soap suds could easily plunge off the screen and drown the audience. So, wisely, they played many of the scenes for comedy to counteract the soap. Consider the scene in the library in which the very melodramatic encounter between Ashley and Scarlet is undercut quickly by Rhett's comments and actions after Ashley leaves.<br/><br/>The study of Scarlet is an interesting psychological portrait of obsession - - nothing comes close except SUNSET BLVD.<br/><br/>The newly restored version gives us an amazingly clear, crisp color image with sharp audio -- I understood some of the lines for the first time."

This movie sympathises with the slave owners and pretends as if the institution of slavery was not one of the greatest horrors of recent history. It is just as if someone made a movie sympathising with the Nazis and showing them as the good guys. No one would celebrate a movie like that. I don't understand why this one is celebrated."

It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict: I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on ""The Jack Benny Program"" on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S.

","Let's face it, it's virtually impossible to post a negative review of such an iconic movie and such a fixture in the history of Cinema. I'd seen it once, several years ago on TV and been suitably impressed by its scope and ambition but having just acquired it on DVD I've taken another look and one of the things that jumped out was the irony; my version weighs in at three and three quarter hours yet the main thrust is encompassed in the opening few scenes; the stereotypical vision of the 'South' beginning with the olde worlde charm and courtliness of belles and beaux on a large, well appointed plantation where the talk is of war to the chagrin of the spoilt, coquettish Scarlett O'Hara, then a scene of the other end of the spectrum, blacks toiling in the fields whose back-breaking work funds the affluence. We know that this is about to change dramatically and a case could be made that we don't need three and three quarter hours to illustrate it. Okay, I'm oversimplifying and it is a rich tapestry that is weaved for us though most of the striking visuals - two black children (they would, at the time, have been called pickaninnies)playing happily in cartwheels, silhouettes on a horizon at sundown, the pan across the wounded at and the burning of Atlanta etc - occur in the first half. Forget the misconception, happily fostered by the film, that the War Between The States was fought to free the slaves, and just enjoy the colour, the music, the spectacle and yes, the melodrama. Unique. Beyond classification."
"Fleapit","7","2","5","5 January 2009"," The Decamping Husband's Farewell
","GWTW is a woman's picture about feisty Scarlett and the men in her life. Ostensibly about the American civil war, it degenerates into a story of marital disharmony, recognisable in any era with its overtones of women's lib.<br/><br/>David Selznick's MGM background leads him to mimic their films which predominately reflect the lives of upper middle class American society. Scarlett comes from the upper echelons of the cotton plantation owners and when Ashley goes to fight the Yankees he becomes a Major. This is an unusually high rank for a young man with no previous military service;likewise Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton, becomes a Captain.Most young officers would have been second lieutenants. GWTW is atypical as it does not therefore represent the life of the ordinary fighting man. This fascination for the affluent in life reflects Miss Mitchell's own life since both her father and second husband were lawyers.<br/><br/>The film opens with Scarlett and her friends jabbering away at nineteen to the dozen. This fast pace of dialogue continues for several minutes making it impossible to catch much of what is being said. Eventually the film settles down to a more acceptable pace. All of her beaux seem to be West Point graduates which reflects Miss Mitchell's day dreaming at 15 of being a boy and entering West Point.<br/><br/>Mr. Howard as Ashley is so bewilderingly miscast that it is hard to understand why another player could not have been found. He comes over as a father figure rather than a newly wed young man. He looks his age (45) and is far too serious; he rarely laughs or jokes and is never frivolous.<br/><br/>Of the supporting actors, Thomas Mitchell plays Scarlett's father very convincingly and his Oscar was well deserved; in a smaller role Dr. Meade is very well played by Harry Davenport. Miss Mitchell probably based him on her own days as a beginning medical student.<br/><br/>The film is so drearily long because the plot is structurally unsound. The first part deals with the Civil War in a conventional way but only as it affects the privileged few. In the second part Scarlett eventually marries the likable rogue Rhett, based on the real life blockade runner Charles Trenholm, but after the birth of their only child she forsakes her marriage vows by excluding him from the marital bedroom. To which Rhett, obviously seriously hurt emotionally by Scarlett's rejection, responds ""You know I could divorce you for this?"" Forget about the Civil War from here on it's just the well-worn story of battling embittered spouses. Miss Mitchell's mother had been a suffragette and this seems to have rubbed off on her and her novel. One night a drunken Rhett, carries her upstairs in his arms to bed and ravishes her. This has parallels in Miss Mitchell's own life as her first marriage was annulled after she suffered the same fate from her husband.<br/><br/>I have not read the book but at over 1000 pages in length it has been considerably condensed; one major change is that Scarlett has three children by Rhett compared with just Bonnie in the film. This significantly changes the situation when Rhett leaves her with his oft-quoted farewell 'Frankly, my Dear, I don't give a damn' (a simple but effective piece of alliteration), a similar emotion must have passed through the mind of many an exiting spouse. Scarlett is left alone with no children compared with two in the novel. However this is where both the novel and the film end. Was this done to make Rhett's departure more morally acceptable? The entire film revolves around Scarlett and Rhett but although Scarlett is in almost every scene it is Rhett who is the commanding presence and steals all his scenes. At the beginning of the second part action drags without Rhett and Miss Leigh fails to hold her audience. The tedium which sets in could have been relieved if there had been a sub-plot to the story. This is an essential element of such a long story and is a weakness of Miss Mitchell's novel.<br/><br/>A further weakness is that there are too many convenient deaths. Characters are killed off willy-nilly when they hinder the story's development. Very early on, Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton, dies after a short illness. Later, her second husband Frank Kennedy is conveniently killed when they go out to a 'political meeting' concerning shanty-town raiders and get involved in a skirmish with Yankee soldiers. There is the death of Bonnie which lets Rhett off the hook morally as there are no children to support after he leaves Scarlett. The death of Scarlett's mother of typhoid fever is acceptable. This is another parallel with Miss Mitchell whose mother died of Spanish 'flu. Melanie conveniently dies in childbirth leaving Ashley potentially free to marry Rhett after he eventually leaves Scarlett but both the novel and the film only make this point obliquely when Rhett tells Scarlett that 'all you need now is a divorce and your dreams of Ashley can come true.' Finally he realises he has seen through Scarlett's scheming ways and tells her ' you think that by saying: 'I'm sorry,' all the past can be corrected'. In fact, Scarlett loves no one; she is incapable of love and just loves herself. She proved herself to be unsuited to married life as she rejects the act of procreation and behaved like a vixen throughout.<br/><br/>The story would have been more true-to-life if the clergy had been represented, especially in the hospital scenes.<br/><br/>The film is more outspoken on marital matters than the feature films of the period. It also makes it clear that the 'saloon', a centre point of westerns, is not just a place for men to have a drink, gamble and brawl but is a bawdy house.<br/><br/>The restored DVD has a sharpness and clarity previously unseen and I recommend it to any fan of GWTW."

This is a touching scene; one of a deeper understanding than the superficial one experienced by Scarlett and Ashely.<br/><br/>Melanie and her betrothed are standing in front of a curtained window facing each other. The window overlooks the gardens.

","Before telling anything about the movie I just should say that I always read the book before seeing an adaptation. ""Gone With The Wind"" is book that sounds like a book having racist elements in it. I am pretty aware that the book was published before nearly 30 years of the time activists like Martin Luther King but I can sense that M. Mitchell has a sympathy for the social strata of the South. She limns house slaves like Mammy and Pork as devoted and loving servants whom the whites treat like family. In the novel, all masters treat all slaves well. Although some admirable characters dislike slavery, Ashley and Frank among them, once the slaves are freed both the characters and the narrator describe blacks as ""trashy,"" ""insolent,"" and ""creatures of small intelligence."" Plus we can easily feel that the writer approves the acts of Ku Klux Klan. In the movie it's not too easy to see that element but you can catch a few words like Rhet Butler's description ""poorly-brained darkie""... Vivian Leigh as the strong,selfish,opportunistic Southern belle Scarlett has a good performance while Olivia de Havilland as the physically frail but spiritually strong and good-hearted Melanie is satisfactory enough. But let me tell you that Hattie McDaniel as the old heavy set mammy deserves the ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role"" she got as the the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar. I had admired Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins in ""Pygmalion"" but I thing his performance as ""the honorable but weak Ashely Wilkes"" is really poor. The performance of players give really something to the should of the movie but really I am a person who attaches importance to little details in a movie. It is not possible that you can see a detailed technical description of fall of Atlanta towards the end of civil war. Even f there were the necessary technology the runtime would not permit that. It's already 225 minutes. Another thing is that Scarlett has one kid from each of her three husbands but we don't really see any of her kids other than Bonnie. In the book characters use alcohol to cope with stress, but when they abuse alcohol, disaster ensues. Drinking is partly responsible for Gerald's death: he rides his horse while drunk, misses a jump, and is thrown to his death he doesn't actually dies because riding crazily after Jonas Wilkerson the white trash as he is called both in the book and in the movie.He gets drunk after refusing to sign an oath stating that he was a Union sympathizer, and breaks his neck jumping his horse over a fence on the way home.Morover in the book, Suellen ends up marrying Will Benteen, a ""Cracker"" who comes to live at Tara after the war.Will Benteen is not a character in the movieand so Suellen's marriage is never mentioned. One more thing is that...that night when Frank Ashley and other decent people go to a Ku Klux Klan meeting(the movie never mentions that name openly) well when the Yankee guards come to search Melanie's house they read David Copperfield at home in the movie but actually they read Les Miserables in the book and we never see Archie-Scarlett around in the movie! In the book, Archie is an ex-convict whom Melanie allows to sleep in her basement, and who stays on out of obligation to her. In the movie, several of Archie's lines in the scene where they are waiting for news of the ill-fated Klan raid are said by Mammy. But after all this is a pretty adaptation for such a 1000 page book. The performances of the players and the technical skill of the film in spite of its time make up for that.If someone is a book-worm he/she will definitely love the book more. The is not a flawless masterpiece but still worth-watching after all!"
"silverscreen888","8","2","5","21 June 2005"," Physically Breathtaking; a Seminal Epic; Admirable and Admired
","This epic film has been written about for decades; but what needs to be said about it has, perhaps, never been addressed. It is a very entertaining, well-photographed and generally well-acted historical work. The music by Max Steiner, the great scenes such as Scarlett O'Hara's descent into chaos as she seeks a doctor during the battle for Atlanta, the ball, the party at Twelve Oaks, the burning of Atlanta fight scene, and others have never been surpassed. But despite David O. Selznick's vast exertions with writer Sidney Howard and others to bring Margaret Mitchell's novel to the screen, some script problems were never solved. The film is in fact I assert a partially-completed allegory. Scarlett O' Hara, played by British Vivien Leigh represents southern womanhood wanting to live an American, a full life; her erstwhile love, Ashley Wilkes, played by Brit Leslie Howard, represents the Old South--which is why he could never find a handle on the motivations of his character. Scarlett was given straightforward actions; he was given several contradictory decisions to resolve. But the great triumphs of the film as Ayn Rand pointed out are that it involves all levels of the society in the great changes brought about by the Civil War, and its aftermath; and the other is that the use of observers as ""norms"" of the Southern viewpoint in so many scenes allows the viewer to understand both those who challenge and those who defend the Old South's ideas and practices. Every element of this huge cinematic 1939 production works beautifully. The actors, challenged by the style and scope of the script, who did very well include Leigh as Scarlett, Barbara O'Neill and Thomas Mitchell as her parents, Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel, Carroll Nye, Alicia Rhett, Victor Jory, Butterfly McQueen, Rand Brooks and dozen of others from Everett Brown as Big Sam to the most minor of roles. Clark Gable brings off Rhett Butler, but lacks classical speech training to complete a difficult role. Mention should be made of several others for their for their creative contributions including directors Sam Wood, Victor Fleming and George Cukor, production designer William Cameron Menzies, Walter Plunkett's costumes, Sydney Guilaroff's hairstylings and Lyle Wheeler's art direction.Whatever few questions one has about Ashley Wilkes' character, there is so much here that is outstanding here that this is a film for the ages in every sense, beautiful to watch and hard-to-forget."
"Doylenf","10","2","5","23 March 2001"," GWTW is still the all-time favorite!
","Just as Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was one of the most readable works ever written, so is David O. Selznick's production one of the most watchable films of all time. Something is happening every moment--and all of the characters relate to each other in fascinating ways only apparent after repeated viewings. It's the kind of movie that transports you to a time and place that may not have existed except in the mind of its Southern author--and yet, whatever historical inaccuracies are presented here--it's a remarkable achievement and has rightly become a part of American folklore and culture. <br/><br/>No other film has so many memorable ""quotes"" from a large cast of characters--and at the centerpiece is Vivien Leigh's striking performance as the willful Southern belle. Others around her are equally impressive, down to the smallest character roles--everyone has their moment of glory with the only weakness being the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Otherwise, the casting is perfect--Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Evelyn Keyes, Harry Davenport, Jane Darwell, Victor Jory, Ann Rutherford, Rand Brooks, Ona Munson--and the wonderful Hattie McDaniel giving the most genuine display of emotion in the whole film with her ""staircase scene"" with Melanie when she tells Scarlett's friend what Rhett has said and done after Bonnie's death. <br/><br/>All of the sets, costumes, art direction and photography are of the highest order. William Cameron Menzie's production design is superb (he storyboarded the whole concept of what the scenes should look like with beautiful watercolor paintings). The one film above all others that shows what Hollywood's expertise could do with a gigantic novel when transferring it to the screen. Much of the dialog is witty and pointed with some of the best lines delivered in mocking style by Clark Gable.<br/><br/>An abundant amount of humor and sharp observations about human nature are present in the script. No wonder it's still the most beloved American movie of all time--not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere in the international market. It was an instant classic and still remains one, richly deserving all eight of the Oscars it won, as well as the Irving G. Thalberg Award for David O. Selznick."
"patrick.hunter","Null","2","5","11 August 2000"," In Praise of Hattie
","To those who say the movie is racist, I sadly agree.  It gives me no pleasure to do because I also love this film.  Nevertheless, undeniably, it glorifies slavery and falsely claims that after the Civil War the worst victims in the South were the whites.  In fact, the real victims were the Southern African-American citizens; 1865 stands out as the year with the most lynchings in American history.  My one defence for its racism lies with an artist too little praised, judging from the other comments: Hattie MacDaniel, as Mammy.  <br/><br/>It's a brillant, Oscar-winning performance and it is not a stereotype. Maybe the character is a stereotype in Mitchell's novel, maybe even was one in the script--but the character is not a stereotype in confident hands of an artist like Ms. MacDaniel. There is nothing stupid about Mammy.  Aside from Rhett, she's the only one who sees through Scarlet's schemes.  In fact, Scarlett seems able to fool most all white men left and right, but she never fools Mammy.  Hattie MacDaniel, along with suggesting someone who is strong and smart, is also very funny, often evoking more laughs, at least from me, than even Rhett.  <br/><br/>Another plump African-American actress of the time, Louise Beavers, also played only Mammys in Hollywood movies, such as IMITATION OF LIFE (1934) and HOLIDAY INN.  Every time, she always played a house servant who was sweet, sacrificing, and slow-witted.  Thank God, or Selznick, that Beavers did not play this part.  So yes, the movie, like so many works from the past, is racist.  Nevertheless, it's a grand adolescent fairytale, an eye-popping spectacle, and it's got the most memorable, three-dimensional Mammy in the history of film (believe me, there many competitors)."

","When I was growing up, we were all told that ""Gone With the Wind"" was the greatest film ever made - by anyone - anywhere - of all time. When I finally saw it, years later, it was a colossal disappointment. When I was studying cinema I came across a survey by Sight and Sound, the magazine of the British Film Institute, asking critics around the world the nearly impossible question ""What are the best films ever made?"" or something to that effect.""Citizen Kane"" easily got over fifty votes while ""Gone With the Wind"" received only two, both from American critics by the way. In fact there were dozens of American films which ranked above it on the lists, so what happened? I'm suspecting the Selznik super-sell is responsible for the hype. Someone joked that the the book ""Memo from David O. Selznick"" was trimmed down from twenty-seven volumes to only one in order to sell it. The funny thing is that people are still listening to the publicity after all these years and some actually are still swallowing it. The film was grossly over-produced and suffered major damage with its hodgepodge of directors. In fact the bogus ""Southern accents"" have been the stuff for many take-offs and comic skits. So much for ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".<br/><br/>Curtis Stotlar"

","I know this comment will be viewed as sacrilege from the vast majority of movie lovers.  This is just one woman's opinion.  I find Gone With The Wind to be one of the greatest pageants ever filmed.  The opening scene at Twelve Trees is a dressmaker's dream.  The breadth and depth of the cast is amazing. This is clearly a big-budget epic.  There are many people who love grand-scale epics for, well, the sheer grandiosity of it.  This is what makes movies such an individual experience.  I am not one of those people.<br/><br/>I love believable characters, thoughtful premises, clever plot twists, terrific acting, and witty dialogue.  Gone With The Wind has all of these things, but only a sampling of them.  Clark Gable is tremendous as Rhett Butler and Ona Munson is unforgettable as Belle Watling.  But (here comes more heresy) Vivian Leigh's over-the-top frenetic performance of Scarlet O'Hara is bad acting at its zenith.  She is never anything but a cartoon. And, she is supposed to carry the film.  Even worse is an insipid Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  Hattie McDaniel is great as Mammy (It is a disgrace to realize that it was 62 more years before a Black woman could win another Oscar, also for Supporting Actress).  But Thomas Mitchell is present in body only as Scarlet's father.  The rest of the all-star cast fares much better in their bit parts.  <br/><br/>This is one movie that has never lived up to its legend for me."

","The doting hysteria surrounding this overblown tome of a film amazed me when I first saw it 50 years ago. It is as tedious now as then. With a few exceptions (especially Gable), the acting is overdone and phony. After the fourth silhouettes against the setting sun shot within the first 30 minutes, even the beauty of those scenes was diluted to visual doggerel. One of the few entertaining scenes was the newly widowed Scarlett dancing a jig below the serving table top at a soirée. As for historical accuracy - never mind. I know that I am in a small minority who rate this between 1 and 6 but there is always hope that more people will be less impressed with the scope and grandeur and notice what a silly soap opera this thing is."

","Considering that Gone with The Wind is more than 60 years old, it is holding up well. The plot moves along interestingly enough, even though I am not a guy who likes dramas or romance. But special effects have really improved since then.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for ""Gone with the Wind"", it is no longer fashionable to long for the Old South, primarily because of the connection to slavery. We see plenty of stereotyped African-Americans in the film, childlike and speaking poorly. We also see plenty of men abusing women, bubbleheaded weak women, and other glories of the Old South. (There are plenty of white males portrayed as idiots, too.)<br/><br/>There are other problems. The main character of the film, Scarlett O'Hara, is an anti-hero and hard to identify with. The movie doesn't really have a story -- it spans over a century and we see little vignettes taken from a whole life. An epic saga is a valid form for storytelling, but it's not quite as gripping as the usual story arc with a primary endgoal to be resolved.<br/><br/>All of this added up for me. I did find the film engaging, but I couldn't ignore the anti-women and anti-black stereotypes, even though they weren't the main focus of the film. So I have to give ""Gone With the Wind"" a 3 out of 10."

","As I seem to keep hearing, time and again, from the so-called 'real' movie connoisseurs who are out there, everywhere in the world...(till I'm sick of hearing it)....Is that Gone With The Wind (GWTW) is, without question, one of the absolute, all-time, greatest movies ever-ever made...Well, I say - Oh, really!!??...I repeat - OH, REALLY!!!!!????? <br/><br/>Well, hey, I gave GWTW a fair chance. I did. Yeah. I endured this tedious mess-terpiece (in its ridiculous entirety of an unbelievable 222 minutes) and I didn't think it was so great. It wasn't! In fact, it was nothing but an over-long bore for a good part of the time. <br/><br/>I couldn't believe how utterly pretentious most of the main characters were to me. I especially found that poor, little, rich girl, Scarlett O'Hara, to be insufferably annoying, far too often. I actually began to physically cringe and wince whenever Miss Scarlett uttered that mega-sickening, little ""Fiddle-Dee-Dee!"" line of hers.....Ugh! <br/><br/>I understand that GWTW has, ultimately, been hailed, from one end of the planet to the other, as one of the greatest, most dynamic love stories ever presented (for our envy) on the silver-screen. But I wasn't particularly impressed with the dysfunctional relationship that transpired between these 2 wacky-doodle-dandy 'love-birds' Scarlett and Rhett. <br/><br/>It seemed to me that for a good duration of GWTW Scarlett and Rhett were, literally, at each other's throats. I detected lots of real nasty, hitting-below-the-belt type dialogue going on between these 2. I mean, if anyone ever talked to me the way Scarlett and Rhett did to each other, I'd never have anything to do with that person ever again. I wouldn't. Not even if they looked as gorgeous as the honey-child Scarlett did.<br/><br/>What I thought was absolutely hilarious in this flick was Scarlett and Rhett's first round of 'married bliss' together. Here we had Scarlett carrying on like a, literal, frigid bitch all the time. (can you believe it?) She was even choosing to sleep apart from her husband in a separate bedroom, every night, and subjecting randy, old Rhett to the cold-shoulder treatment, non-stop.<br/><br/>Well, as it turned out, Rhett, literally, had to resort to physically, forcefully raping his own wife, the 'new' bride, Scarlett, just to get some sexual satisfaction. And, wouldn't you know it, Scarlett actually liked being 'taken' this way. She did. So, ironic as it was, rape was the key ingredient to a happy marriage for Rhett and Scarlett. Eh?......Hey, it was either that for Rhett, or go bang a hooker. What could he do? Surely there were plenty of hooker-types around for Rhett to choose from. Yeah. Even some real sleazy sluts who would've probably done Rhett for free, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong here, I don't completely pan GWTW, altogether. I mean, it was a mighty impressive production, as far as productions go. There's no arguing with that. And the sets were nothing short of stupendous. And the costumes were pretty fantastic, too. Yep, they sure were.<br/><br/>But, all in all, I think that the grandness, the splendor, and the glory that this story apparently stood for was largely lost in the muck, due to the focus that was deliberately put on such an incredibly petty and nonsensical affair, as the one that was taking place between Scarlett and Rhett.<br/><br/>I guess what it all comes down to is that I'll never, ever understand the irrational mind of the true Romantic. Never. It's all gone with the wind to me."

To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture."

It might be caused by something that has been taken out of the book, or just me because I'm used to coherent plots like Nolan films or Citizen Kane. Until pretty much the scene where Rossella decides to marry Rhett, it actually all worked, and would have worked on later too. What I refuse to believe is that a girl who already managed to survive hunger during the civil war by hard work would behave as childishly as Rossella does in the last hour of the movie. The ultimate ending, with Rhett leaving the moment Rossella realises she doesn't love Ashley (something that should have happened when Rhett left to London, about 30 minutes before) and particularly her famous quote just made me question why did I spend four hours watching a movie which had practically no ending.

","Contrary to IMDb's many pro or con reviews, the movie is neither America's best nor worst. In fact, this is the only film I can think of where that truism might usefully apply. One thing for sure— whatever one thinks of the film, it is likely America's best-known movie. Anyway, after 500+ reviews, there's no need for detail, so let me summarize.<br/><br/>On the plus side. The cast amounts to perfect visual counterparts of their characters. Whatever you think of his or her performance, can you visualize anyone but Gable as Rhett or Leigh as Scarlett, etc. Also, the historical sweep is filmed in striking Technicolor. The fiery reds, glowing golds, and dusky darker shades lend considerable eye and emotional appeal. Then too, the musical score is outstanding and shrewdly applied, especially Tara's Theme. Finally, the drama has all the elements of effective soap opera—a long-suffering heroine, a handsome manly hero, and an assortment of well-etched supporting players. In sum, as spectacle, the film is lavishly and effectively produced.<br/><br/>On the minus side. The 4-hour run time is definitely too long, even for lavishly assembled soap opera. I expect the large number of script writers, both credited and uncredited, has much to do with that. Either way, 240-minutes is much too much for any one sitting. But, most importantly and most damningly, Gone With The Wind, whatever else, does its best to prettify a lie. Now, there's no need to go into the movie's nostalgic treatment of the slave- holding Old South or its bitter, one-sided treatment of the Union North. These cosmetic features are all too obvious and have become more decisive over the decades in judging the movie's worth. Certainly, that's the case with the negative reviews on this site.<br/><br/>Now, the larger issue of whether a movie can be legitimately enjoyed apart from its politics is too complex for this context. Instead, consider how American audiences would react were British rule over the American colonies romanticized in a similar spectacular and personal way. This is not intended to equate the Confederate South with British colonial rule, but the thought experiment does, I think, illustrate an important point.<br/><br/>Anyway, in my little book, this most celebrated of American movies remains an over-long and badly flawed spectacle that ironically attracts and repels at the same time. Perhaps that's why the film continues to occupy such a central place in our movie history."

","Between the release of ""Birth of A Nation"" and ""GWTW--the Film"" 25 years had passed. After ""GWTW--the Film"", 26 more years would pass before the Civil Rights Movement rose to prominence in the U.S.<br/><br/>Just why do I bring this up, you the reader asks? ""Birth of a Nation"" started the Hollywood Civil Rights Movement (and yes it still has a long way to go) as it sparked outrage in the civil rights groups of 1914. Selznick's removing overall content in terms of blacks from the movie's screenplay was a deliberate act. I have little doubt had he let it stand, no small controversy would've flared in parts of the U.S. It had to be exorcised & the same approach would have to be administered if a remake were produced in the future.<br/><br/>I read the book three times, some passages multiple times. None of the passages I re-read involved Mitchell's descriptions, viewpoints regarding white planter-class southerners & blacks. Talk about wanting to barf--Benevolent, humane approach to Southern slave-owners interacting with their ""negroes"" conveyed as regular thing, the unbalanced depiction of brutality meted on the white south in as opposed to sanitizing of slavery. Regarding race relations, the aspect Mitchell's book pointed out without bias that the Yankees were no better than the South in their viewpoint of blacks as children. Although the n word appears sporadically, GWTW the book is the most racist book I've ever read and I took it out my library.<br/><br/>Regarless of the Hollywood depicting the books racist aspects at a higher degree or not, still hope I'm not alive to see a remake.<br/><br/>GWTW it's a good film both technically & the script rewrites makes lots of sense. The beautiful Technicolor, and the even more beautiful ""Tara's theme"" rises my grading it to 5.<br/><br/>The abridgments in the script rises my score to a 7 for the sensible changes. Scarlett's character is the biggest example, yes, even more than the blacks. Other than her adhering to promises once she gives them and that unshakable determination, Scarlett's book persona isn't likable: finds children generally annoying for a majority of the story, irrational (Ashley), and of course, her selfishness. Women, lots of them moms, coming to watch Gable would have had a problem seeing the real kid contemptuous Scarlett on screen. Another good example of efforts of removing racist elements, no mention of the KKK's ""righteous cause""--indeed no mention to the Klan by name at all.<br/><br/>There's a lot of excellent moments, scary moments, and above all that great cast. I think it's safe to say this movies' remake is in the far future as no major actress today could match Vivian Leigh's Scarlet. None of them. There are a small list for Melanie Hamilton. I just don't want to look at another person to play Rhett--Clark Gable is hot! Hattie McDaniel IS Mammy. The one flaw I can see in the cast major and minor character is Ashley. I'm talking physically here. Leslie Howard is too old. Leslie Howard knew he was too old but Selznick gave him an incentive and so he played Ashley. He did well with the role in terms of accuracy but looked at most twice Ashley's age (I always thought the novel's Ashley was in his mid twenties at most). <br/><br/>Watch it for the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, try ignoring the traces racism of here and there. If one still detests this movie's bigotry to African-Americans, a word of advice: Read the book, especially the post reconstruction parts."

It wasn't until years later that they redid the movie in a sort of 75 mm widescreen process using this earlier stereophonic soundtrack. Very impressive, even though the heads were chopped off, somewhat, in the viewing!<br/><br/>Well, poor Katy Scarlett had more twist and turns in her life which equaled the twist and turns of Erica Kane on All My Children, and after almost four hours of Gone With The Wind, what did Scarlett learn? Not a thing! She should have taken the prophetic words of her father when he told her that the only thing that meant anything was Tara and, especially, the land, before she went out chasing after Ashley and Rhett Butler with no success. Vivien Leigh played Scarlett like a grown up Shirley Temple who never grew up, and as far as her southern draw in the film goes, this was no problem. When the English first came to this land, they were up north and up north it gets so cold that they speak rapidly and when they migrated to the south, they spoke very slowly, and all Vivien Leigh did was draw out her English accent which made her sound like she was born and bread in the South! And what was also amusing was that after Vivien Leigh was chose to play Scarlett there were some catty remarks from southern women that at least no Yankee would play Scarlett! Can you just imagine Bette Davis and Errol Flynn playing Scarlett and Rhett? <br/><br/>This is probably one of the greatest Soap Opera's ever put on film, and what Acadamy Award Oscar Wining lines?<br/><br/>SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! GERALD O'HARA: It's I'm proud to be Irish! SCARLETT: War, war, war! PRISSY: I can berth babies! SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! RHETT: Has the war begun? SCARLETT: Sir, you've no gentleman! BELLE WATLING: It wouldn't be fit-tin'. SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! MELANIE: Oh, Scarlett, how I envy you! SCARLETT: Oh, Fiddle Dee Dee!<br/><br/>SCARLETT: After almost 4 hours in the movie theater: ""Ashley, why didn't you tell me you didn't love me!"" Uh! Pardon me? You mean, after almost 4 hours of movie time, Scarlett didn't know this, and decided, right there on the spot, that she really loved Rhett, but didn't know it? Well, the little user of men's flesh, just couldn't make up her mind, and it's a wonder that at that moment she didn't break into song singing ""I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No!""<br/><br/>Now, what puzzles me, and really amuses me, is why any red-headed sexy Sounthern Belle, like Scarlett O'Hara, would want to not trap some handsome man like Rhett Butler who just happens to look like Clark Gable, and not do everything possible to trap him and keep him! Scarlett had to be nuts! Let's face it, Leslie Howard was not that handsome for anyone to want to live with forever, and besides that, he and Melanie were cousins; and they got married? Was Scarlett nuts, or not? Well, maybe a little psycho! Give up Glark Gable?<br/><br/>I will, though, admit that the end of the first act where Scarlett vows that her kin-folk, and especially her, will never go hungry again, is a powerful scene and worth sitting through. especially since you're sitting through all the nonsense of her chasing after Ashley, ignoring Rhett, and facing the Yankees in the Civil War, plus Melanies birth of her baby, makes this scene worth it! Of course, Rhett was right when he said, ""God help the Yankees if they ever captured her!""<br/><br/>So, when I finally saw the end of the film, I wanted o destroy the projector and the theater for such a silly ending, and there's Scarlett still living in her dream world that she would go back to Tara and think about a way to get Rhett back which at that time was really very unrealistic, but not to Scarlett acting like a grown up Shirley Temple still living on the Good Ship Lollipop! But, at the end, Rhett summed up the whole thing when he said, ""Frankly my dear; I don't give a damn!"" And that's how I felt when I finally got a chance to leave the theater! Of course, before the movie ended, this would have been a great time for Scarlett to break out in song and sing ""The Man That Got Away"", or maybe re title it ""The Men That Got Away""! And, of course, no one would realize that many years later, one of the Tarleton Twins, George Reeves, would end up playing Superman on the television series. He couldn't make it as an actor, but he sure made it to the top playing Superman!<br/><br/>Years ago, the British turned ""Gone With The Wind"" into a musical, and Rex Reed panned it and said that it was so bad that at the end of the 1st Act, the horse on stage did something to show what even he, the horse, thought of the production and the 1st Act curtain lowered! Remake ""Gone With The Wind"" today? What a tragedy that would be! Who would they get to play Rhett? Danny DeVito?<br/><br/>Now, years later, I have to admit that I do appreciate the movie more than I did years ago seeing it as a teenager, but these very long movies only teach you one thing: When you go to a movie that's going to run for 3 to 4 hours, make sure you take with you, your lunch, a toothbrush, and a fresh change of underwear!"
"Spleen","8","2","6","10 July 1999"," It's fun to see once ...
","... but that's the most I'll allow.  -OK, maybe it's possible to get some pleasure out of it a second time, or even a third.  It must be possible to do so: people have.  Many bad movies are like that.  We can debate how enjoyable this one was - it's always hard to tell, bleary-eyed, after four hours' viewing - but one fact beyond dispute, is that this is a bad movie.<br/><br/>When it was first released the American Civil War was - just - within living memory of some of the audience.  It obviously spoke to United States audiences of the day. (What exactly it said, I have no idea.)  The universe is arranged so that whenever a movie does well in North America it does well everywhere else, and the same capricious forces of history that lifted ""Jaws"" from the level success to the level of freakish statistical anomaly did much the same thing to ""Gone with the Wind"".  No other film in history can touch it.  No-one knows why.<br/><br/>The truth is it was cranked out in a hurry.  The artists responsible were skilled and a few of them achieved great things, so it's not as ineptly put together as many other bloated successes; but there was little time for reflection; and no-one had the time to stand back and ask themselves just what the movie was meant to be about, anyway.  The best way of describing the plot is this: a lot of stuff happens to Scarlet O'Hara.  The illusion can be maintained in the first two hours or so that it's all going somewhere.  It isn't.  More and still more stuff happens until we drown in it.  The concluding scene, I feel, is only contingently the concluding scene; half a dozen or so earlier scenes would have done just as well.  A point was reached where no real ending was possible.  Any conclusion would look like a conclusion only by implicitly dismissing most of the previous footage as irrelevant.<br/><br/>Apart from length and colours that make my eyes hurt there's no intrinsic quality that could have stunned the audiences of 1939 into submission. (It MUST have been the memory of the Civil War.)  The acting is surprisingly bad in places - the early barbecue scene, and indeed most scenes lacking Clark Gable, are neither stylish nor convincing; and, in most moods, hard to sit through.  Set design and art direction - all that type of thing - is good in places but inconsistent.  The music soars but it too shows signs of being cranked out here and there. (And was it ever: Max Steiner had to dope himself in order to stay awake for the weeks it took to compose.)  All in all the memorable moments are exactly as many as the workings of chance would lead you to expect - no more."

","Even though 'Gone With the Wind' has many years on its neck, it's still one of the best Hollywood productions. Vivien Leight does a absolutely fabulous job here and Clark Gable is brilliant aswell. Just make sure you are prepared for the long run time when you start watching it - two sittings are required."
"caseyt-48511","9","1","2","23 May 2019"," Its Great, It Really Is
","How do you review a movie like Gone With the Wind in this day in age? There are scenes that are very hard for me to watch. Such as the ""I don't know nothing bout birthin no babies"" line. Yes, it is a classic line, but that whole scene just made me cringe. With that being said, when looking at the film in context, you have one of the most fantastic achievements in film history.
It is no wonder that despite controversy, this film has remained one of the most beloved of all time. The acting is brilliant. Vivian Leigh was never better, Gable is both lovable and detestable at once. Olivia De Havilland is spectacular. And of course there is Hattie McDaniel. Is it a stereotypical performance? Well, absolutely! However, I must admit, she is wonderful in this movie. She is the voice of reason for the main characters in this movie. Her Academy Award winning performance was a huge milestone that I feel goes underappreciated. The only lead actor who I feel does not shine is Leslie Howard. He is just okay. He had a hard time keeping his British accent in check while playing a southern man. He is great in other films I've seen him in, but here is not one of his better moments.
When it was being made, it is easy to say that it was the biggest movie ever for its time, To put it in modern context, it was the Avengers: Endgame of its day. If you adjust for inflation, it is still the highest grossing film of all time.
Three different directors worked on this movie, and while this would be a hindrance to most movies, but it somehow helps here.
One of the best parts of the film is the amazing cinematography. This movie is full of great shots that are still imitated today. Let us not forget the incredible musical score by Max Steiner, a man who contributed scores to many other great films. The main theme is easily one of the best in movie history. The themes of survival and a changing world also ring in strong. Despite the movie taking place during one specific place and time, I feel that its themes transcend boarders and time periods.
Is Gone With the Wind the best movie ever? No. I can think of several better movies (Citizen Kane, The Godfather, In the Heat of the Night, Star Wars, Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc). And some of its politics are pretty outdated. However, It is an overall fantastic movie that should be watched at least once by anyone. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot. Or don't, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."
"packerhof","9","1","2","1 March 2019"," A labor of love
","This review is less about the story line, and more about the labor of love, the level of professionalism and perfection that went into bringing this commentary of a dark time in our nations history, and the very fabric of what should be making our country stronger.
Historically, there was so much more that went into the civil war. This story was but a sliver of that time. Fleming went to great lengths to show the horrors of war, the miles of bodies, injuries, predjudices and the like. The use of the camera to tell the story of love and deception of the innermost kind. Good or bad, it all survives. Sherman takes Georgia, Atlanta burns, people turn into animals in regards to the spoils of war and the Grace of God can be found. Once you choose who the heroine is, you see they both survive-one in meekness and the other in spirit. Atlanta and Scarlett's Tara still survive! Similar to Citizen Kane's Rosebud, it comes back to Tara.. and tomorrow. This was the first color picture to win the best picture award. The strength of which was the cinematography and the ability to cut a story that saw Mammy get grey (Hattie McDaniel's Award winning supporting role award for her awesome portrayal) going from the talk of war, the act of war, and the aftermath all in 238 minutes. (It's worth noting Hattie was the first African/American to not only be nominated, but to win the Oscar, deservingly so) Olivia de Havelland was as much the star as Vivian Leigh, in this long cast of great performances. Vivian Leigh took home Best Actress, well deserved. Victor Fleming took the best director. The film also took home best cinematography and Art direction.
Sadly, Sid Howard would get his Oscar posthumously for the magnificent screenplay. That was the first time an award was given posthumously. The film took home the Technical Achievement Award. Very well deserved because Hal Kern and RD Musgrave, the film nearly 80 years later, still takes you back to Atlanta during the civil war."

","This movie is simply spectacular! They took care of every single detail back then. Even making sure Scarlett wears her wedding ring when she has to. No one was that detailed back then. I simply admire this movie. Every time you watch you notice so many new things. Scenario is brilliant. Character of Scarlet is absolute masterpiece. Vivien Leigh is the one perfect actress that is truly irreplaceable as Miss O' Hara, but not only that- the way that character of Scarlet grew through movie. First - She was a spoiled little brat flirting with men just to annoy other ladies and to prove herself being Queen B... And then in a war she is independent warrior, a true fighter that brought entire family back on their feet. She has balls, especially if we think of an era she comes from. Probably one od first very feminist characters. Don't try to find flaws in this movie. You won't succeed. Besides it was made in 1939."
"weezeralfalfa","9","1","2","19 July 2018"," A coming of age story, among other things
","Although not usually described as such, among other things, book author Margaret Mitchell(MM) meant this to be a coming of age story for Scarlett, who ages from 16 to 28 in the book. It doesn't seem quite that long in the movie. Scarlett is partly based on MM herself. Like Scarlet, she was a society debutant, often with a flock of beaus simultaneously. According to the book, and somewhat exemplified in the movie, Scarlett has little taste for sex, finding it often painful and embarrassing, and sometimes leading to the more painful process of birth. She decides that she doesn't want any more babies after the first, because her waist expanded after her first birthing. Thus, lovers find it frustrating that this beauty is so frigid. .....Another overpowering theme of the book and movie is the differences in skill and luck in surviving adversity. Both Rhett and Ashley are survivals of the war, whereas most of their neighbors and relatives are not. Scarlett and Melanie are also survivors, sometimes using men to get their post-war businesses on their feet. In some ways, Scarlett is a feminist. She has good native intelligence, is manipulative, becomes a good manager of her plantation, and her new lumber business. She has learned that she can get along without a man. However, I'm puzzled by her parting question, as Rhett leaves for good: ""Where will I go? What will I do""? She still had her plantation, which seemed to be operating at a profit. She had managed before without a man. She probably would like to have another child, or perhaps take in several of the many orphans or widows left from the war, since she's worried about the effect of pregnancy on her figure. Since Ashley is now a widower, she might finagle him into a largely sexless marriage?........It's not real apparent to me why Rhett is wealthy. Perhaps from his blockade running? Also, apparently, he became a scalawag after the war, which may have brought in some income........Neither Gable nor Leslie Howard(Ashley) wanted to be in this movie. For one thing, Gable dismissed it as ""a woman's movie"". Howard thought he was far too old(46) to be playing a supposedly 21 y.o. when Scarlett was 16. However, the casting director felt he had the best personality and physique to play the effete Ashley. In contrast, there was much competition for the roles of Scarlet and Melanie. George Cukor: the beginning director, was famous as a woman's director, in contrast to his replacement: Victor Fleming. Thus, after he was canned, Cukor still coached Vivien Leigh (Scarlett) and Olivia DeHavilland (Melanie) on weekends!.......It's strange that Melanie died soon after collapsing(swooning?), just after she exited Rhett's room, where he was mourning the death of his daughter. Suggests she had some underlying health problem, that was enhanced by psychological stress........This was but one of several tragedies late in the film. Of course, the accidental death of Rhett's and Scarlett's little girl was a shock. Rhett seemed more disturbed than Scarlett, apparently feeling that his marriage was jinxed, which accelerated his determination to opt out of the marriage......Then, there was a the pervasive tragedy of Scarlett's unreciprocated love of Ashley, and the fact that she didn't really warm up to Rhett consistently until it was too late.......Of course, the cinematography, production values, sets, costumes, and acting are all topnotch, not to mention the very memorable theme song."

","Considered one of the greatest love stories of all time, Gone with the Wind is a classic romance tale from 1939. A story of love and loss during the Civil War era the star crossed lovers Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh, attempt to survive Atlanta as the Union Army approaches. It was originally released in black and white but was later rereleased in 1969 in color.
It was well known for its iconic wardrobes and clothing, it had over 1,500 extras in huge scenes (with around1,000 dummies since there weren't enough extras at the time) and it actually had three directors during filming that its almost alarming that the film made it to editing let alone theaters. It even made one of the first historic slips through the Hays Code at the time, the iconic line ""frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" almost wasn't in the movie due to the word damn but after much convincing the director at the time was able to get the censors to allow it. Probably the only huge issue with the film was it's usage of racism from the Civil Way era, although historically accurate it was a little raunchy even for 1930's folks."
"herron-caroline","7","1","2","23 February 2015"," review
","Review of ""Gone with the Wind""<br/><br/>Southerners revile the idea of her and feminists shiver at the concept of her, for Scarlett O'Hara is manipulative, dishonest, and constantly in turmoil over the men in her life. Gone with the Wind depicts a tale of the survival of a woman in a world dominated by men. Scarlett O'Hara is described as ""feisty"" and ""stubborn"", not at all what many southerners feel accurately depicts the ""gentility"" of southern women (Ebert). Feminists find her to be a glorified southern belle, fitting the ideal illustration of ""female bondage"" (White). However, Scarlett O'Hara as seen in Gone with the Wind, depicts strong feminist principles in her determination, free spirit, and search for control over her own life. Although set in the 1860's, Gone with the Wind was released in 1939. Parallels can be drawn between elements of Scarlett O'Hara's personality and the women of the World War II time period. Women were just beginning to fill the jobs left vacant by men sent overseas, taking control of their economic situation. One of Scarlett O'Hara's motivating factors through out the movie is her need to sustain herself, her family, and her home. She alone controlled her economic status at first in a beneficial marriage, then by planting and picking the cotton on the plantation herself, and finally successfully running a lumber business. She sought control in all aspects of her life and became an inspiring character to the women of the 1930's. Ebert refers to Scarlett O' Hara as ""the spiritual sister of Rosie the Riveter"". The characteristics of Scarlett O'Hara identify with working women of The World War II era as well as more current time periods Scarlett O' Hara is portrayed by Vivian Leigh in the film adaptation of the novel Gone with the Wind written by Margaret Mitchell. Leigh displayed Scarlett's determination as something described as ""a demonic energy, a feverishness that would later tip over into illness and pathology"" (White). This determination to ""never be hungry again"" motivates Scarlett ""to lie, steal, cheat or kill."" (Gone). Scarlett's fear of loss of control ultimately pushes her into marriages over and over again. It is within these marriages that she is able to provide for herself and control her life. This is clearly illustrated in the film when we see Scarlett driving through ""Shanty Town"" (Gone) without an escort. A woman of gentile birth would never dare to venture to such a town, but for Scarlett it is the only way to reach her lumber mill, which secures the promise of continued financial stability. The only thought in Scarlett's mind is that of economic sustainability and control, the idea of being afraid of such an area seems absurd to her character. Armond White concurs that Scarlett O'Hara does depict feminine principles in stating that ""Scarlett embodies the secret masculinization of the outwardly feminine, the uninhibited will to act of every tomboy adolescent, here justified by the rule-bending crisis of war."" Very much a topic of gossip, Scarlett pays little mind to tradition during a time where tradition and social standing were of utmost importance. Furthermore, Scarlett ever the personification of determination, purposefully instigates such gossip, breaking out against southern mourning traditions and attending balls to meet her next husband of choice. She is a survivor, as proved when she is quick to abandon the ways of the ""Old South"" and adapt to the ways of the Reconstruction Period so as not to experience any disadvantages (Gone). Scarlett eventually works her own cotton fields, abandoning the wealth and luxury of a previous time, in order to adapt to new demands. From the very beginning of the film, Scarlett expresses frustration with the social norms of femininity, ""I'm tired of everlastingly being unnatural and never doing anything I want to do. I'm tired of acting like I don't eat more than a bird, and walking when I want to run and saying I feel faint after a waltz, when I could dance for two days and never get tired. I'm tired of saying, ""How wonderful you are!"" to fool men who haven't got one-half the sense I've got, and I'm tired of pretending I don't know anything, so men can tell me things and feel important while they're doing it "" (Gone). Scarlett says what is on her mind, not to be held back by what was expected of women. She commands power yet accesses it through unusual avenues, such as running her business, for a women of her time and stature. This conflict makes Scarlett both hated and adored, striking, even dazzling, character. As the film comes to a close and audiences are accosted by the scene of Scarlett losing Rhett, those who abhor her cheer as Rhett declares, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"", an obstacle those audience members assume Scarlett will not be able to overcome. Those who were drawn to her tenacity and sheer will to survive, cling to the ever optimistic and determined response of ""I'll think of some way to get him back. After all... tomorrow is another day"" (Gone). No matter what occurs in the life of Scarlett O' Hara, her determination, free spirit, and search for control expose feminist principles in Gone with the Wind. After all, in her mind, tomorrow would come regardless.<br/><br/>Works Cited<br/><br/>Ebert, Roger. ""Gone With the Wind Movie Review (1939)."" Roger<br/><br/>Ebert.com.

"disinterested_spectator","10","1","2","14 February 2015"," The Movie, the Book,and Reality
","Most movies can be discussed without comparing them to reality, but not so ""Gone With the Wind,"" owing to its paternalistic depiction of slavery as something benign, in which the slaves are so well-treated that you would almost think their Southern masters were doing them a favor. The closest thing to slave beating is when Scarlett slaps Prissy in exasperation. And an unnamed Ku Klux Klan is subtly presented (without sheets) as a force for good. Indeed, this movie is to slavery what ""The Godfather"" (1972) is to organized crime: a glorification of something despicable, a beautification of something ugly.<br/><br/>And yet the movie is tame compared to the book, which required a great deal of sanitizing to make it suitable for a Hollywood production. As an example of the sort of thing that had to be excised in the process of turning this book into a movie, there is the passage where Rhett Butler admits to Scarlett that he shot a black man for insulting a white woman: ""He was uppity to a lady, and what else could a Southern gentleman do?""<br/><br/>In comparing the movie first to reality and then to the book, we get something of a paradox. By avoiding much of the really offensive material in the book, the movie becomes less realistic than its source, because the racist sentiments expressed in the book accurately reflect the racist sentiments of the white South at the time. However much we might deplore Rhett's murder of an African American, such things undoubtedly happened in those days.<br/><br/>What is less clear is whether ""Gone With the Wind"" is feminist or traditionalist in its attitude toward women. On the one hand, Scarlett is portrayed as strong, resourceful, and shrewd, a woman who chafes at the ridiculous restraints placed on women during those times, and who breaks those restraints one by one as the story progresses. On the other hand, she is portrayed as wrong-headed. Three men, her father, Ashley, and then Rhett, seem to know better than she does what will make her happy (i.e., marrying someone who is like her), but she simply will not listen.<br/><br/>She is so wrong-headed, in fact, that she needs to be raped. In the movie, we see Rhett carry her up the stairs against her will, followed by a scene the next morning where she is happily reflecting on the night before. What is ironic is that the book was written by a woman. In ""The Forsyte Saga,"" on the other hand, another man rapes his wife for similar reasons, being frustrated by his wife's love for another man. But in that case, the rape is so traumatic that it not only ruins their marriage, but also ruins things for the next generation. And this novel was written by a man, John Galsworthy, also in the early part of the twentieth century. In short, the novel written by a man was more feminist than the one written by a woman.<br/><br/>Back before the movie version had been made, when people read the novel without knowing how it would end, they probably thought Scarlett would eventually realize how much she really loved Rhett, and they would live happily ever after; or, failing that, she would be punished for her stubbornness. And indeed she is. She realizes just how much she loves Rhett only at the point where it is too late. To this extent, the movie is faithful to the book. But what those who read the novel did not expect was the destruction of Rhett. And this difference in what was expected and the actual outcome is the biggest difference between the movie and the book.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, when Rhett leaves Scarlett, we feel relieved. He is through with her, and it is as if he has finally been cured of a sickness. There is the hint of a sneer when he tells her that he does not give a damn what happens to her, and there is a spring in his step as he heads out the door. But the depiction of Rhett in the novel is very different: ""He looked at her steadily with dark eyes that were heavy with fatigue and there was no leaping light in them . He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work .""<br/><br/>When Scarlett finally accepts that Rhett is leaving her, she says, ""Oh, my darling, if you go, what shall I do?"" Unlike the movie, where the tone of Rhett's voice and the look on his face as he makes his parting remark is almost triumphant, making us want to say, ""Good for him,"" in the book, he is defeated, and his words are full of resignation and regret: ""For a moment he hesitated as if debating whether a kind lie were kinder in the long run than the truth. Then he shrugged. ' I wish I could care what you do or where you go, but I can't.' He drew a short breath and said lightly but softly: 'My dear, I don't give a damn.'""<br/><br/>Whereas the movie stays with the notion that Scarlett is wrong-headed and gets what she deserves, the ending of the novel makes us realize that it was actually Rhett who was wrong-headed, and that he is the one who really pays the price for it. If Scarlett was foolish in thinking she could change Ashley regarding his tendency to spend a lot of time reading books and listening to music, how much more foolish was it for Rhett to think he could marry a woman who loved another man and somehow change that?"
"MissSimonetta","8","1","2","19 August 2014"," Dated in some ways, timeless in others
","There is no doubt that some aspects of this mammoth 1939 production of Gone with the Wind have dated badly. The portrayal of black Americans is rubbish and the second half of the film is less dramatically compelling than the first, going into full Victorian melodrama mode.<br/><br/>Yet it cannot be denied that this film's popularity has not waned much in the seventy-plus years since its release. It remains the highest grossing film of all time when adjusted for inflation and even young people like my preteen sister (who insists she dislikes old movies) have become big fans. What's the appeal? Well, the beautiful Technicolor photography and the sheer size of the production figure big time, as do the tempestuous central romance and themes of strength in the face of adversary and calamity.<br/><br/>However, the most enduring thing about GWTW is its heroine, the immortal Scarlett O'Hara. Love her or loathe her, she is a fascinating creature and no one could ever deny she is a strong female character. Vivien Leigh is perfect in the role; while some 1930s performances come off as too affected for the taste of modern audiences, Leigh is natural and truly seems to be channeling the character from the book. I'd say her portrayal is my second favorite movie performance ever, after Maria Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928).<br/><br/>While the problematic elements have made my love for this movie more reserved than they would be otherwise, I still check it out every fall. It's beautiful and anytime someone insists strong movie heroines did not exist until the 1970s, give the poor soul a referral to Miss O'Hara."
"SaveFerris97","9","1","2","12 March 2014"," A must-see
","Gone with the Wind (1939, George Cusak, Victor Fleming, Sam Wood) is a perfect adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel of the same name. Scarlett and Rhett's twisted romance rising and falling takes place in the heart of a war where any and every win from either side is a Pyrrhic victory, and the groundbreaking use of color was just in time to improve an already beautiful film. I can only assume that without color, this film would be lessened, but still a wonderful depiction of what Mitchell created. This alluring and headstrong woman represents the sheer will of the Southern states in the tumultuous Civil War, and her stubbornness, like the South's, leads to her ultimate failure in achieving happiness. The shots, specifically the extremely wide ones such as the scene where Scarlett is picking her way through the crowd of bodies that embody the dying of the old South, are very interesting to look for. The lighting is normally very bright, and in the scene where Rhett is assisting Scarlett, Melanie, her baby, and Prissy to flee the burning Atlanta, it is so bright and warm that it truly does look like their little Southern world is ablaze. The use of shadows and silhouettes is also very interesting. Several shots in scenes set at Tara, Scarlett's childhood home, often use wide shots that do not completely articulate the in-shot characters' features. Instead, they capture their silhouettes. As for design and costuming, the steady decline in the elegance of living conditions and clothing perfectly exemplifies the fall of class and grace at that time. In my opinion, Gone with the Wind is an absolute must-see. However, I highly recommend reading the book first, as it makes the photography of the film easier to appreciate."
"ReeltalkwithLaura","8","1","2","3 March 2014"," A Love Story for the Ages...
","Winning best picture in 1939, Gone with the Wind takes a huge leap from where movies had been telling stories for years. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable bring a tale of southern love during the Civil War under the direction of Victor Fleming , who also directed The Wizard of Oz which was nominated for best picture that year as well. As the audience we see a story unfold for a total of four hours where we are never bored. Everything on the screen is beautiful, due mostly to Ernest Heller, the wonderful cinematographer who captured the beauty of the South. The costumes were breathtakingly designed by Walter Plunkett with my personal favorite being the emerald green curtain dress. <br/><br/>Vivian Leigh plays the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara, a true southern belle. She was the envy of every woman and the desire of every man. She is in love with Ashley played by Leslie Howard, who falls for Melanie (his cousin) and chooses to marry her instead of Scarlett. Because Scarlett does not get the man that she believes she deserves, in anger she marries Melanie's brother. <br/><br/>Enter Clark Gable...swoon...who plays Rhett Butler. He is your """"bad boy"" with a somewhat shady reputation, making money on the war and favoring no side. We fall in love with Rhett and know he's the man for Scarlett long before she does. Eventually realizing Scarlett is still too in love with her delusion of marrying Ashley to give him a chance, Rhett decides to fight for the South even though the war is almost over. <br/><br/>Scarlett being born into a very prestigious family had everything at her fingertips until the war began and she lost everything. All of the men, including Ashley left for war for a short time but it becomes years. Scarlett must assume responsibilities she never wanted and is even forced to leave her beloved plantation, Tara, in order to survive.<br/><br/>After everything is in ruins from the war Scarlett returns to Tara to keep her family together, while still pining for Ashley and waiting for him to return from war. She makes a vow that she will never be hungry or poor again, which prompts her to marry her sister's beau so she can get the money she needs to save Tara. Soon after becoming a widow for a second time, she is reunited with Rhett who convinces her to marry him. We all keep waiting for her to realize Rhett is her true love and forget wimpy Ashley. How long will Rhett put up with her rejection?<br/><br/>To understand and get the entire story you'll have to watch the film. It is a story of love, loss, war, family, and drama: great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. It has won several awards, been on must see lists, and has the number one quoted line in film history. It is a beautiful story that stands the test of time. I promise you will fall in love with these characters and their story, and if you don't... ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."""
"hondacivicdx","9","1","2","8 January 2014"," Epic Classic - Must See
","This movie is an epic classic. Back in the time when movies were a huge undertaking.<br/><br/>Some trivia is that Vivien Leigh was overcome by Clark Gable's bad breath (from his dentures and she wasn't the only actress that felt this way). Thus in scenes you can see how she cringes whenever they are in a romantic embrace. The movie director was smart and used this to their advantage to indicate she was swooning from his embrace.<br/><br/>Also, she had a complex about her hands being too big and you can see this throughout the movie as her fingers are always tucked in when in an embrace, her fists on Rhett's chest even on the rare occasions they were getting along.<br/><br/>It's too bad Scarlett and Rhett couldn't ever seem to get on the same page. If they could have, they would have been a lot happier but instead they are like two ships passing in the night. Ah unrequited love.<br/><br/>The movie was very well done for the time. The book is much better. Interesting how in the book Scarlett is actually pregnant while Rhett courts her = a huge no no back in those days! Even exceptional was that she would leave the house in her pregnant state to go out with him. Yet the movie didn't include this - probably too racy back in those days. Highly recommend reading the book.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is a class movie that everyone should see."
"saytosandeep","8","1","2","20 October 2013"," MY REVIEW: Going to Live Forever!!
","Gone with the Wind. Around 4 hours long colorful rich romantic drama on the backdrop of war was made long way back in 1939. At that time it created a havoc at theaters by grossing close to $400 million which is now equal to more than $3000 million. The lead character Scarlett is a rich spoilt manipulative selfish girl in the times of American civil war and meets her counterpart in Rhett another spoilt gentleman who falls in love with her because she is as bad as him. But both lead actors are honest to each other and they have a habit of never quitting even in the gravest danger. The movie is a journey of Scarlett from pre war to post war times in Georgia. She marries two times; once for revenge and once for money before she finally marries to our hero. You must be thinking what good it would be to live through journey of such flawed characters? Well, the fun lies in the well written drama, soothing back ground score, delicious dialogs, colorful rich sets and an array of small but significant characters around Scarlett. The movie never tries to make a point and showcases both selfish and kind characters with equal love. The movie is special because it does not seem dated at all and charms you even after 70 years."
"BadPuppy2223","Null","1","2","12 October 2013"," Gone With the Wind review...
","Vivian Leigh did an excellent job portraying Scarlett, the petulant and jealous southern belle. I doubt her performance could have been matched by anyone else. The period dress of all the characters is authentic and even the accents and speech as well. All the way down to minute details such as the descending ringlets in Scarlett's hairstyle. Thomas Mitchell was at his usual best and was perfect for the role of the Irish plantation owner. I would have liked to have seen an actual battle scene or two in the film, but this is primarily a love story. I have a special affinity for this film, due to the fact I was named for one of its central characters-Ashley Wilkes,the owner of Twelve Oaks Plantation-played by the great English actor Leslie Howard. This film is a true great, a blockbuster then and now."
"sissybrooklyn13","9","1","2","12 October 2013"," Gone with the Wind review
","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It gave a good picture and history of the civil war. The fight scenes looked very realistic.<br/><br/>It takes place on a plantation in the south. They had many slaves but they were treated kindly. My favorite scene was Scarlett saying ""I will never be hungry again"". When the war ended, she had to start over again. She was very determined to make the plantation and the people work again. The movie had a lot of high spots which I thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend this movie to be watched as a family. The death of Scarlett's father was too sudden. He fell off the wagon, and the fall killed him. The first time I saw this, I cried in the living room while eating the popcorn.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"TxMike","Null","1","2","1 October 2013"," ""I'll figure a way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day.""
","It is a bit remarkable that I, a long-time fan of the movies, only now got around to watching GWTW, even though it was released just 6 years before I was born. I was able to get the DVD of the restored film from my public library. <br/><br/>A film this old and this famous, a film that has been analyzed so much over the decades, there really isn't anything I can contribute to its description or analysis. My only intent here is to capture a few of my own reactions to the story and to the characters.<br/><br/>Certainly the central character is Scarlett O'Hara played well by Vivien Leigh, as a spoiled and impetuous young lady (she must have been 24 or 25 during filming) in deep southern Georgia. She and her family are hit hard by the War Between The States, not only changing their lives but resulting in their beloved plantation 'Tara' being left in ruins.<br/><br/>Scarlett had a very hard time loving, or even really caring, for anyone. She wanted the things she wanted and found ways to get what she wanted, most often by manipulation. When she met Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a wealthy man from Charleston, she saw him as a ticket back to wealth. But in a manner befitting both of their strong wills, there was a deep affection between them that they just were unable to express in a productive and loving manner.<br/><br/>Even though Gable was obviously a big movie star, I have not seen much of him before seeing GWTW. Even if we ignore his uncredited roles, he had about 40 movie roles before this one, and almost 30 more after that. So seeing him here is really the only role I can relate to, and I found him just perfect. <br/><br/>GWTW is a melodrama, the war is just interwoven to make Scarlett's and Rhett's stories more interesting. Some fans will certainly muse, that had the story not ended where it did, Scarlett would have made good on her final lines, to restore Tara and get Rhett back: ""I'll figure out how to get him back, After all, tomorrow is another day."" <br/><br/>Perhaps as a reflection of their roles in this movie, neither Gable nor Leigh reached 60. He was 59 when he died of a heart attack, and she, reportedly a very heavy smoker, died of tuberculosis when she was only 53."
"mtischbe-804-247824","9","1","2","29 September 2013"," A movie for the whole family!
","I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said ""I will never go hungry again"" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history."

","I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet."
"wizzardSS","10","1","2","8 August 2012"," I give a damn
","If you've never heard of Gone with the Wind, get out. You're no film fan and frankly my dears, I don't give a damn about you.<br/><br/>If you've vaguely heard of Gone with the Wind, I bet you'll never guess what it's about. Judging by the pictures either side of this paragraph, you'll probably guess some love story between two people - and you'd be half right. It's a war epic shrouded by a love story.<br/><br/>If you've seen Gone with the Wind, or ever read a review about Gone with the Wind you'll know what's coming and might as well skip to the bottom for an completely unshocking star rating.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind is, relatively speaking and factoring in inflation, the highest grossing film of all time - leading second placed Avatar by a staggering $250 million.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to know how this is possible. At four hours long, Gone with the Wind isn't your average I'm-going-to-watch-this-casually-on-a-Sunday-afternoon film. It's a lets-prepare-for-a-four-hour-battering-months-in-advance affair. So, for it to have accumulated over 3 billion of those inflation adjusted dollars is frankly ridiculous.<br/><br/>The farce gets even bigger when you come to realise that Gone with the Wind is effectively about a stupid woman who chases after someone she can't have, whilst being fawned over by a general who wishes to worship the ground she walks on. Incessant cries of ""Ashley, oh Ashley"" are only mirrored in quantity by her getting slapped across the face and told to get a hold of herself. Quite right.<br/><br/>Jokes aside though, and Gone with the Wind is an epic. The background war setting shows America being ravished by itself during the civil war, and the change in the community before, during and after the events. There are also themes of racism (cue the various olden terms for the servants), but even these characters have so much to add the story.<br/><br/>OK, I'm going to come out and say it - Mammy is my favourite Gone with the Wind character. And Hattie McDaniel takes the role and really gives her character a certain fire and resilience. Whilst, during the rest of the story, the characters are running around screaming about how war and marriage is affecting their chance to copulate, Mammy keeps her dignity, shakes them around the head and utters some wise story that sets them back on the straight and narrow.<br/><br/>That said, the story wouldn't be made without the rest. As irritating as Scarlett is, she is the centrepiece of the story and it is her stupidity that forms most of the scripting. She is also very unpredictable, loving Ashley, hating Ashley, loving Rhett and hating Rhett. Vivien Leigh does well to keep the audience loving and empathising with her character even while she's being an idiot.<br/><br/>As for the boys, Ashley is much like his wife with an air of dignity, but he is flawed by his occasional weak lust for Scarlett. Rhett is probably ideally suited for Scarlett in that they are both after someone who doesn't love them in return and one does wonder whether the turn of events at the end of the film would have happened sooner had Scarlett felt differently about him.<br/><br/>All these words and nothing yet about the scenery! My mother described it as ""orange"" and she wouldn't be far wrong. One of the most romantic backdrops? Sunset. Colour? Orange. One of the most ravished backdrops? War and fire. Colour? Orange. Of course, it does vary (surprisingly, it isn't 4 hours of mobile phone advertising), flicking from olden sawmills with convict workers, to the sweeping plains of Tara. The various country houses aren't to be sniffed at either.<br/><br/>It is easy to take for granted the director Victor Fleming and producer David O. Selznick in this rave. Naturally, it is in their vision that the film takes place - adapted from Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel of the same name - and what a stirling job. Impressive concentration to create a four hour masterpiece.<br/><br/>Enjoy the splendour."

","'Gone with the Wind' combines historical and personal story lines, offers a dramatic character-driven plot and every time you see it amazes you with its exquisite perfection. The reasons to love 'Gone with the Wind'.<br/><br/>*Original score. That's what I always appreciate in every movie I see. In 'Gone with the Wind' the sublime music fills you with hope for a better future and creating a perfect mood for every scene in the film.<br/><br/>*Blockbuster-ish type. It's epic.<br/><br/>*Restored version. 'Gone with the Wind' is the first color film to win in the Best Picture category at the Oscars. Fortunately, with it restored, we can enjoy vivid colors of sunset in the famous scenes.<br/><br/>*History.'Gone with the Wind' has a large share of history, bringing events of Civil War to screen, and this makes the movie not just a tale about a capricious girl but of the whole nation and of fighting for equality of all people.<br/><br/>*Successful screen adaptation. It is common that a film spoils and deprives of spice a book it is based upon but definitely not in this case. <br/><br/>*Verisimilitude. Everything, from sets of then American South to many-sided personalities of heroes, makes you believe that they are almost real: Atlanta on fire, hundreds of extras, described in detail and well acted characters with different temperaments. <br/><br/>*Quotes. ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" ""With enough courage, you can do without a reputation."" ""As God is my witness, as God is my witness they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. No, nor any of my folk. If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill. As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again."" ""Tara! Home. I'll go home. And I'll think of some way to get him back. After all... tomorrow is another day.""<br/><br/>*Cast. Vivien Leigh was best suited to the cast for the role of Scarlett O'Hara. Hattie McDaniel was really fantastic as Mammy <br/><br/>*Characters. For them we can be grateful to the writer and to the cast, of course. Scarlett O'Hara, a southern beauty, capricious and childish in her youth, changes into a strong-willed, materialistic, quick-tempered pseudo-lady and she is a symbol of strength and determination. She shows that before you get something, you have to work, sacrifice or resort to cunning. No matter how hard she works and how much she abases herself before Ashley, she always knows her own value and she reaches almost every goal she marks out. Even though she can't win in love, she will overcome every obstacle and survive any war, any grief, any affliction to befall her.<br/><br/>*Story. Many think it's a story about love, but I, for one, abandon myself to the idea that it's a story about survival and zest for life. For it is life that must be appreciated the most, must be valued, must be made happy. ""After all, tomorrow is another day!"""
"Desertman84","10","1","2","11 November 2011"," Dated But A Benchmark For Historical Epic Movies
","Gone with the Wind is a historical epic picture adapted from Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer-winning 1936 novel of the same title. It was directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. The film stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel.It was set in the nineteenth century and tells a story of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a Southern point of view.It boils down to a story about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. <br/><br/>Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton. Despite warnings from her father and her faithful servant Mammy, Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind's famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta through the now-classic closing line, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" The movie is definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.It won 10 Academy Awards, a record that stood for 20 years with Ben-Hur surpassing it in 1960.It was an engaging movie from beginning to end.The performances of cast like Clark Gable and most especially,Vivien Leigh were definitely excellent and outstanding.It maybe dated but it serves as a benchmark for historical epic movies."

","GWTW was a 1936 novel written by Margaret Mitchell, and it was a phenomenon and every 14 year-old girl read the book multiple times. The movie takes place during the American Civil War and concentrates on the aftermath of the south and how the war seriously made the south pay for the old way of living. The story also concentrates on Scarlett O'Hara who is in love with Ashleyn Wilkes(Howard) but he is uninterested and marries his cousin Melanie(de Havilland)who is the kindest person period. The other main character is Rhett Butler(Gable) who is a blockade runner and frankly, doesn't give a damn. He and Scarlett are very much similar in the sense of they wanting to put their interests ahead of others to ensure their own happiness. The rest goes on, but this movie is just spectacular. Its long, but it is a film that everyone at some point needs to see. The film has the best film score ever and it gives the movie a more ""epic"" feel.

"rcb0017","10","1","2","31 October 2009"," A timeless film of a romance set in a time long passed
","The film ""Gone with the Wind"" is a classic romance film which has been the corner stone of romance movies since its release in 1930. The torrent affair between Scarlet O' Hara played by Viven Leigh, and Rhett Butler played by Clark Cable is at the center of this film which is set in the midst of the Civil War. The film portrays the sensation of grace, honor and defeat of a time, which is gone forever. Gone with the Wind gave the world the term ""Frankly my Dear I don't give a damn"", a statement of frustration which has transcended generations.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind begins at Tara, the plantation of Scarlett O'Hara's parents in 1861. At its onset, the theme begins to develop by casting Scarlett as a very selfish and self centered demanding person. Scarlett is a privileged woman, residing at Tara a southern plantation, with all the titles and social requirements befitting a Southern Belle of the time. It is Scarlett's persona that drives the film, her character so strong it at times forces the other characters around her to succumb to her will, all of course except for Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>As the film quickly moves into the Civil War Scarlett is faced with the burden of running a large southern plantation without the male labor required of the time. Largely, due to the civil war the plantation begins to degrade and the glamor of the plantation quickly fades away. Between the needs of the military and the raiders, the plantation and Scarlett loose more of their glamor. Scarlett's selfishness is the determinate factor, driving her to survive the time and endeavor to return Tara to its original glamor. The reality is that it was not as much Tara but Scarlett's original glamor that was import.<br/><br/>Upon the return of Rhett Butler Scarlett finds herself in a dilemma with nothing suitable to wear to the occasion. It was then she pulls down the drapery, turning to Mammy to have a dress suitable for the occasion out of the material. This act symbolized the depth of commitment that Scarlett had to returning to her previous status.<br/><br/>Rhett Butler and Scarlett have a torrent relationship. Both of them are coy and centered on their individual needs. Despite this they are in love in their own way with each other although frustrated with the relationship. The relationship of Rhett and Scarlett portrayed in the film has much the same feeling as in Casablanca. Each depicting a want to return to what was rather than what is.<br/><br/>Throughout the film the use of lighting brings emotion and feeling to scenes. In one particular scene the red setting sun is seen behind Scarlett as she proclaims ""as God is my witness I will never be hungry again"". The lighting helps to provide a feeling of determination resulting from the desperation of Scarlett's human condition. The lighting gives it a more dramatic feeling and gives depth to her statement.<br/><br/>Angles are used throughout the film to focus the viewer's attention to specific elements within the film. Of particular favor with Gone with the Wind is the footage of the cover where Rhett and Scarlett are engaged in a passionate embrace and kiss. Another scene is the view of the injured from a civil war battle the camera view at an angle higher than the filed and at some distance.<br/><br/>The film Gone with the Wind is a passionate romance which is depicts the turbulent love affair of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It is a classic which has withstood the test of over seventy years since its release. It is still today sought out by film viewers for its depiction of a time of glamor that has long passed, and of the passion of two people as fresh as this day."

","As much a period piece as this is, ""Gone with the Wind"" nevertheless is so good as to be nearly without parallel. In fact, of all the movies I have seen based on books I have read--and there are quite a few--this is the only one that is better than the novel. Margaret Mitchell's book is very good, but the move is without doubt stunning.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to get an accurate feel for what antebellum plantation life was like in the South needs to see this movie. The depictions are often stereotyped and overdrawn--part of the charm of this epic and entirely necessary in context--but what one takes away will be as accurate a grasp as anyone could hope for in the time the movie takes to play."

Also, the background history of the Civil War makes this very emotional and historic.<br/><br/>The film and cinematography are just beautiful. I saw it on a movie sized screen - and if you can see it on the big screen as opposed to a DVD on a TV screen, I really recommend it. It is so breath-taking and beautiful.

Selznick.<br/><br/>Based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel published in 1936, a novel long regarded by many to be the ""Great American Novel"", Gone With The Wind remains a larger-than-life, grandiose classic and the most expensive and talked about film of its day. Released in 1939, the ""Wind"" swept the Oscars, winning Best Picture, Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), Best Actor (Clark Gable) Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, the first black woman to ever receive an Oscar) Best Screenplay Sidney Howard and a total of 10 Academy Awards, unheard of for a single film at the time. This is the one movie that provided everlasting fame for producer David O. Selznick. His tomb still reads: ""Director of Gone With The Wind"" and this zenith of American cinema masterpiece will be linked with his name, as well as the title of ""great movie"" for all time. At a little over 3 hours long, shot in the innovative new Technicolar and with a beautiful orchestral score by Max Steiner, it was unlike anything audiences had ever seen. Set in Georgia before, during and after the Civil War, the film is a glorified, romantic vision of the Old South and it sheds a sympathetic light over its people, never mind the issue of African-American slavery and political turmoil between North and South. Rather than focusing on large-scale historical issues, including the ante-bellum period, Civil War and Reconstruction, the film chronicles the drama of the life of the unforgettable Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) who journeys from spoiled, flirtatious Southern belle used to getting her way to resourceful, strong, independent and even jaded grown woman whose hard-up life has turned her into a complex, money-loving and semi-tragic, semi- triumphant figure. The object of her romantic pursuit ? The genteel, brooding intellectual aristocrat Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard)who cannot return her love due to his being in a strong, conventional marriage to a good wife. The REAL love of Scarlett's life ? The hot, adventurous, powerful maverick Rhett Butler (Clark Gable in his best film performance). Gable's Rhett Butler was unsurpassed, and he encompassed all the rogue qualities, machismo, strength, charm, frustration and passion of the literary hero from Mitchell's novel. An equal strong performance by Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Hamilton, Ashley's sweet, compassionate, altruistic wife, envied by Scarlett for being married to Ashley but who is a model of old-fashioned Christian virtue, a peaceful, secure and passive contrast to the willful, lusty and tempestuous Scarlett. Melanie and Scarlett endure the same plight but while Melanie does not let the evil of the world damage her sweet nature, Scarlett changes from innocent to world-weary woman.Throughout the film, Scarlett schemes and manipulates to attain her goals. She endures incredible hardships, overcoming the siege and burning of Atlanta by Northern General Sherman, the famine of a ruined plantation,Yankee occupation, hunger, defeat, death (of both her mother, father and two husbands). Because she breaks almost every social more of her time and is more assertive than a woman was in her day, she is able to provide for her family, for the defeated War veteran that Ashley becomes, delivers Melanies baby and wrestles with financial crisis. She is money-loving and materialistic, ambitious and willful, but because of her irrepressible spirit, she is always able to keep Tara, the beloved plantation built by her Irish father, protecting home and family from any threat to its existence. Even with all the panorama of dramatic events and multiple characters, the strength of the film lies in the tragic, antagonistic relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, who are each other's counterparts. Rhett Butler finds not only passion with Scarlett, but his first true love and is her salvation and true key to happiness, but Scarlett's blind love for both Ashley and for money keeps her at a cold distance from him. When he's had enough, she finally realizes Ashley was merely a prolonged crush and she is willing to love Rhett. But by then Clark Gable utters the infamous words , ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" and walks away from her life. No matter. Scarlett is determined to get him back, after all, tomorrow is another day. The film is a feast for the eyes. Great cinematography by Ernest Haller, production design by William Cameron Menzies and gorgeous costumes by Walter Plunkett, whose career in costume design for movies was long. Who can forget Scarlett's beautiful green barbecue dress and sun hat, her velvet gown she makes out of the green drapes to visit Rhett in jail and the scandalous red gown she wears at Ashley's birthday party after being accused of adultery with him. Not only are Scarlett's gowns each a work of art, but the other actors' costumes are gorgeous and historically accurate. ""The Wind's"" powerful theme of hope and survival resonated with America and the rest of the world in 1939. America had gone through the Depression and was at the brink of World War II. Even Nazi-occupied countries found comfort in Scarlett's tale of survival (Nazis being the stand-in for Yankees). Fans of the novel, then and now, see a somewhat condensed version of the book but nevertheless remained faithful to the spirit of Mitchell's novel. This inspirational epic film ranks among Hollywood's most important and beloved movie classics and ought to be placed in a time capsule to represent one of the greatest films of the 20th century."
"screenman","8","1","2","1 April 2006"," Definitely not my scene
","There is no doubt in my mind that this is an excellent movie. I cannot fault the acting, directing, set-pieces, wardrobe, photography, whatever.<br/><br/>The trouble is - I detest it. Which probably means I detest the story; though I have not actually read the book.<br/><br/>I first saw it as a child. Hauled off to the cinema by young parents who I suspect couldn't afford a baby-sitter. It's not a movie for kids. It's epic length cannot sustain juvenile interest. I dozed and woke as kids do. But I particularly remember waking to see its heroine mercilessly beating a pony she had driven to exhaustion, until it collapsed and died in harness. I was, as we say, gobsmacked. It was the first time I had seen female brutality depicted anywhere. This single scene coloured my entire interpretation of the movie. It was many, many years before I would sit and watch it again.<br/><br/>Even though I have learnt to appreciate the sumptuousness of its cinematic qualities, I remain as bitterly entrenched today about its leading character as I was so long ago.<br/><br/>I just cannot understand how such an utterly unworthy individual as Scarlett O'Hara can be cast in the guise of a heroine. She is the most feckless, ruthless, spineless, selfish, vain, manipulative, scheming pariah imaginable. She possesses not one redeeming particle of virtue. She will do anything to anyone in order to have her own way. To see her strutting petulantly about in a street littered with thousands of dead and dying soldiers still has me reaching for something to pelt at the screen.<br/><br/>Feminists have represented her as some kind of ideal: a strong woman succeeding in a man's world. Well, if these are the qualities they admire - heaven help any world. Scarlett O'Hara is Uriah Heep with 'umbleness supplanted by arrogance.<br/><br/>A male cast in a similar light would receive a very grisly and appropriate come-uppance indeed. And for me that is where the movie (and presumably the book) fails. It is the most amoral thing I have ever seen. Even at the end, when the comparatively decent Rhett Butler finally begins to realise the true extent of her malignancy and 'frankly doesn't give a damn' any more, she remains quite unabashed. 'Tomorrow is another day': she'll go on being as base and self-centred as ever.<br/><br/>The moral of the story seems to be this: if you really are rotten enough, you can survive just about anything. <br/><br/>To create a masterpiece and place a rodent at its centre is either irrational or surreal."
"creekin111","10","1","2","19 February 2006"," My #13 favorite film of all time
","I dare anyone to find a more memorable female lead character in Scarlett O'Hara or a more memorable supporting female character in Mammy. Both bring such a powerful presence to Gone With the Wind that makes it one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>One of my favorite shots of all time is when we see Scarlett enter a medical camp and the camera pulls back to see all the injured soldiers. Beautiful color cinematography, music score and setting all blend perfectly together. This is the epitome of the Hollywood epic. The rest of the cast are marvelous. Its amazing how Rhett Butler throughout the whole film takes so much crap from Scarlett that finally by the end he ""just doesn't give a damn."" But I'm sure many who view Gone with the Wind will."
"Stormy_Autumn","Null","1","2","24 January 2006"," ""Gone With the Wind"" the Movie is Over-rated...Novel is Great!
","(Vivien Leigh was made for Scarlett's part.) Let's start with her. She has got to be the most overbearing brat that ever lived on film. Her father (Thomas Mitchell) taught her all that was important was the land, Tara, his plantation, her inheritance. Obviously, he forgot to mention the importance of family, Mother Ellen and sisters, Suellen and Carreen. Or if he did she wasn't listening. When it came to their wants, needs or relationships, Scarlett wasn't interested unless it was someone she needed. The only heart she showed was during the the war, while fighting to get herself, Melanie and Melanie's baby to safety. But we must remember that Rhett had left them and she, too, was hungry and scared. That can bring out the 'nobility' in most of us.<br/><br/>(Clark Gable IS Rhett Butler.) But Rhett doesn't do enough to put Scarlett in her place from the very beginning. After the war he gives her everything she wants, unless it interferes with his wants. But it's obvious he enjoys her fiery spirit (and ducking thrown vases) but he needs to be more firm about her attitude towards her others. Let her know it's not necessary to be so high-handed or self-center all of the time. As the movie progresses he becomes more cruel to her...a cruelty mixed with loathing. But I must say that he does a great job of standing around and looking very much the southern gentleman.<br/><br/>Then we have Ashley and Melanie Wilkes (Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland). Ashley is just plain wishy-wash. He doesn't have the testicular fortitude to come out and tell Scarlett he loves Melanie and that's that. But, of course, that might end the story right there. And Melanie is Scarlett's best buddy no matter what she's accused off.. That's because of all Scarlett does to get them home. The worst case of hero worship I've ever seen. But that I can understand.<br/><br/>(Hattie McDaniel plays Mammy to perfection.) Mammy, a wise strong woman of color, who tries to raise the girls right; this especially comes true after Miss Ellen (O'Hara) dies. We, still, have Gerald to care for his daughters, but with Miss Ellen's death, he's pretty much out of it. <br/><br/>It will be Mammy the girls' nurse who will take over there. She is a 'slave' (in body only, NOT in mind of spirit) who loves her 'family' and does all she can for them, but in spite of her obvious love, wisdom and dedication, a deaf ear is often turned towards her advise.<br/><br/>(Butterfly McQueen as Prissy.) She ""don't know nothing' about birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett!"". It's amazing, that in spite of her flightiness she sure learn's fast. And Ashley and Melanie's child is born.<br/><br/>They make it home. With the Civil War ended, we have a long drawn out Reconstruction Period. It wasn't handled as President Lincoln wanted it to be. He wanted the two halves of the nation to come together peacefully and rebuild the South. But his assassination stopped that plan.<br/><br/>During that time, because of Scarlett's selfish actions, we get to see the activities of the KKK. This because she wouldn't listen to the men about staying out of town and away from the undesirable element. No, she 'decides' to go to work and gets roughed up on the way. The men take over avenging her honor. Which brings about tragic results. But we do, finally, get to meet Belle Watling (Ona Munson), owner of a house of ill-repute and a friend and business partner of Rhett's. <br/><br/>What happens next? So much more than I can express here. Do Rhett and Scarlett finally get together? Does her infatuation with Ashley ever die? See the movie if you don't mind wasting 222 minutes of your life. Or better yet read the book. You can put it down when you need a break to figure out the threads that link the relationships. And there are many more relationships to solve in there! <br/><br/>I've given the reader of this comment my perspective on a famous novel/movie. The actors did well and I tried not to give out any spoilers. Here are some little asides: <br/><br/>1) When Margaret Mitchell was ask ""who should play Rhett Butler?"" Her calm, straight-faced answer was, ""Groucho Marx."" <br/><br/>2) Margaret was born November 8, 1900. She died August 16, 1949 after being struck by an automobile in a crosswalk in her home town.<br/><br/>3) She received $50,000 from David O. Selznik for the original film rights to her book. Then another $50,000 through another business transaction from Selznik.<br/><br/>4) After she passed away her brother, Stephen Mitchell, held the copyright to the book until his death. He didn't allow for a sequel.<br/><br/>5) In the 1990's Alexandra Ripley was chosen to write the sequel ""Scarlett"" It was done as a TV mini-series in 1994. Margaret and Stephen must both be spinning over in their graves now."

Which is when the famous line...'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' comes to life and never fails to crack me up.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh, plays Scarlett O'Hara so well, you really do want to slap her for being such a cold and heartless b*t*h!

She married him to get money to save her beloved homeland Tara,not because she is a greedy evil woman,if thats what some of you are thinking.Kennedy than was killed by union troops while with other men,planning to start a KKK raid against carpetbaggers,who attacked and tire to rob Scarlett one day.Then Rhett Butler tries to court Scarlett.Unfortunutely,Scarlett still has feelings for Ashley,which caused the divorce between Rhett an her,just when Scarlett finds out it's Rhett,not Ashley,she really loves.Scarlett then returns to her homeland Tara to find a way to get Rhett back.The rest is mentioned in Scarlett,the sequel to the novel.The musical score is amazing,perhaps one of the best!The acting is superb!and the cinematography is beautiful!This film ranks in every way as Hollywood's best film,and is 10X better than the crappy Titanic!You should go to the video store and rent this film,or if you are in Georgia and its summer time,you should go to the Theaters watch this film.(Every summer in Georgia,they show this film in theaters.)"

","I'm not going to go into details why I think this movie is one of the all-time greatest movies- suffice it to say that IMO it is.<br/><br/>I'd rather like to concentrate on the racist aspect of the movie- which IMO is non-existent, or at least way overrated. True, the concept of happy slaves is ridiculous, but this is a Hollywood movie. ""Gone with the Wind"" is not meant to be a historic documentary, but an entertaining, epic movie; not more, not less. Yes, they twisted the truth in order to adjust it to their plot, but not only regarding slaves, but also the entire Civil War and Southern life of those days. IMO people should stop getting all worked up on the slave issue. Even slightly intelligent people should know how to distinguish between ""Hollywood movie"" (whose intention it is purely to entertain) and ""Documentary"". One of my best friends is black, and she absolutely loves the movie as well."

Also there is a book called "" The Wind Done Gone"" it is from the viewpoint of Cinara-Scarett's slave half sister. Her mother is MAMMY and her father Gerald O'Hara.

Vivien Leigh with the greatest female role in the history of film, Clark Gable never sexier, Olivia de Havilland all sweetness and light, and the Great Hattie McDaniel!!! Even Leslie Howard, probably the weakest in the cast, is even good. This movie will stand the test of time as long as we have entertainment and can see and hear. And this is a 65 year old movie. Titanic & LOTR (all 3 of them) just wish they were this great. That why, with respect to the Bible, this is the greatest story ever told, at least in the movies."
"grahamsj3","8","1","2","4 February 2004"," Vivian Leigh's best work
","This is a stunning film, especially considering it's vintage. Vivian Leigh does the best work of her career in this film. Clark Gable is pretty fair in this as well, but this isn't his crowning moment, at least in my opinion. The story is grand, the characters all larger than life and the cinematography is among the best ever done. Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes and Olivia de Havilland as Melanie also give strong performances. This one should be the standard against which all other films are judged - it's that good!"
"TooShortforThatGesture","9","1","2","4 January 2004"," Hey! What a good movie!
","No point in writing a long commentary on a classic.  But I just feel compelled to say that I just saw GWTW all the way through for the first time ever and --- even with commercials --- I was really caught up in it and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It's a remarkably well-constructed movie -- I believe I'm paraphrasing Olivia DeHavilland who noted that ""something happens every 3 minutes.""  It tells a very complicated story very well and keeps your attention.<br/><br/>
Also, (and again, I admit it is sinful that I've never seen GWTW or read the book) I was surprised to find that that characters --- especially Scarlett of course --- are not at all as black and white (excusing the sort of racial pun there) as one would think from the way they are used in general cultural discourse.  Of course, the depth of the characters is part of what makes this such a fine film.<br/><br/>It's also still a pretty technically good-looking film, especially given that it will be 65 years old this year.  <br/><br/>Only bad things:  (1) Leslie Howard's English accent and (2) the fact that (at least in this film) Vivien Leigh has very similar eyes to Lucille Ball and sometimes when Scarlett rolls her eyes around I half expect her ask Mammy to see if Mrs. Trumball can babysit little Bonnie and  call Ethel into the room so that they can plot their revenge on Rhett and Fred."

The first part is great movie making. The characters are set up effectively and scene is set for the epic war scenes. They epic war scenes never come. this film is not about war, but the affects of war on those left behind. the forgotton people of war, the mothers, sisters, and daughters of the soldiers that fight. This is a rare story in which we get the loser's prepective. It is a testament to the acting and directing that we feel for the characters and their problems, even if we do not agree with their political views. the romance of the second half is second to none. it is the second half that makes this film one of the greatest of all time.

","Let me explain Margaret Mitchell's reasoning behind her great novel. When she wrote this novel over half a century ago, she was capturing the feeling of the southern people of that time(Civil War Era)! They had just lost everything they own to people that they hated. Change at that time was severely unwelcomed. Since it was written in the southern people's point of view, it is going to lean more toward pro-slavery and against the emancipation of that race. I am not saying what they did was okay because I know it was not.

"spqrclaudius","10","1","2","28 August 2003"," Absolutely Magnificent
","Gone With the Wind needs no apology. Quite simply, whatever one may think of its artistic merits, (and I believe that they are stunning), it takes its place in cinematic history as the most popular film of all time, and all time box-office champion when its earnings are adjusted for inflation. Although the focus of GWTW's sentimentality has become poltically incorrect, the heart of the film remains timeless. It is the tale of Scarlett O'Hara and the conflict between her vain obsession with Ashley Wilkes and charismatic attraction to Rhett Butler set within the context of the American Civil War. The very qualities which enable Scarlett to survive the Civil War and flourish in its aftermath, (her selfish determination, her single-minded obstinacy, her willingness to flout traditional social values), are in fact the very self-destructive aspects of her character which lead to the dissolution of her marriage with Rhett Butler. The audience is subsequently presented with an age-old tragic formula in which one's greatest virtues become their own worst enemies, and the acceptance of responsibility comes just a moment too late. This Aristotelian facet to GWTW unites both halves of the movie, (I've never understood complaints that the second half of the film is inferior to the first due to this unity), and is set within a thrilling framework of astronomic production values. There is an honesty to GWTW, a freshness bound to its lack of naivete. Scenes of amputations, abusive marriages and cynical passions instill it with a stubborn modernity- the film is timeless because the film is honest. Scarlett O'Hara wading through a sea of corpses at the depot, her defiant shadow set against the backdrop of Tara, the burning of Atlanta, Rhett Butler disappearing into the mist, all of these images have ingrained themselves into the American psyche. And of course, Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel deliver some of the finest, nuanced performances ever set down on film. From its stunning production values to its witty script, it is a towering example of storytelling and refuses to lose its momentum after over three hours in the theatre. Other films come and go. There is only one Gone With the Wind."
"bsilvey","Null","1","2","18 August 2003"," Frankly, One Damn Fine Movie
","I know ""Gone with the Wind"" has been teased to death, and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama. But the thing that impresses me about ""Gone with the Wind"" after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie. The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match. Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.<br/><br/>The success of any adaptation of ""Wind"" is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett, and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance. I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role, so perfectly does Ms. Leigh embody it. She's in virtually every scene, but even after four hours of her, I'm not tired of her, and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is Clark Gable, perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh, but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work.<br/><br/>I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland. In her own way, she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's. Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh. But she holds her own nonetheless. And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together. The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red, braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence, and Melanie walks slowly forward, determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally, is a tour de force for both actresses.<br/><br/>I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt, but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

Without comparing it to any other of the landmark films in studio history, which like this one, almost always seem to be gloriously overblown quasi-historical romantic melodramatic epics (i.e. ""Birth of a Nation"" or eckkkk ""Titanic""), as it is, this is a monstrously schizophrenic mess of a movie (which I suspect has to do with switching directors in mid-production).  Everything is over the top and over reaching and over long, but I'll be damned if it isn't entertaining every bit of the way throughout its engaging four hours.  This is the ultimate example of how powerful the studio machine was in the heyday of Hollywood, in that it could turn an overblown, overbudget heap of celluloid into an ""event"" that still stands the test of time as a testament to possibilities of movies as an art form."
"perfectbond","8","1","2","23 February 2003"," Definitely NOT the greatest Hollywood film of all time
","There are many things I liked about Gone With the Wind: Vivien Leigh's defiant petulance and perseverance as she ran riches to rags to riches again, Clark Gable's roguish gentleman frustrated by Scarlett's unrequited devotion to Ashley. And of course there is Mammy. The cinematography and vibrant colors are also breathtaking to behold. I can also appreciate the ambition and the scope of the picture and how it holds up perfectly today. I haven't read Margret Mithcell's book but I think I read somewhere that there is at least one major difference between the film and the book. In the film a black laborer saves Scarlett from being raped by a white hoodlum but in the book the ethnicity of assailant and savior are reversed. I don't know if this change was made for political reasons. I rate this movie 8/10. In my humble opinion it is not superior to Casablanca or Citizen Kane. In fact I think there are dozens of movies I think are better than GWTW."

","This is the best of the best.   The best film, the best actors, the best year of movies EVER.   So many movies have tried to compare or copy - but nothing can replace Gable and Leigh!!   There has never been greater sizzle and fire - whether Gable & Leigh or the burning of Atlanta."
"lula-3","10","1","2","27 January 2003"," Probably the Greatest Movie of All Time
","If the U.S. had to export one film only to third world/foreign nations to depict U.S. history, and the magnificence of U.S. art, this would be it. Few movies tell a fairly detailed and accurate(covering the siege of Atlanta to blacks in uniform to carpetbaggers) story of the greatest war in the greatest country, with the greatest actors.  This is THE epic film, THE American masterpiece, equal to Huckleberry Finn in literary significance. A wonderful, romantic, morality tale wrapped in epic, historic proportion. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy makes us laugh and cry, though she is just the ""supporting"" actress. (She makes Hallie Berry look like chopped liver!). McDaniel portrays humanity and dignity in African-American slaves/servants - and so, in African-Americans in general. (probably not done much before this).  Though GWTW doesn't capture much of the inhumanity and cruelty of slavery, there was a taste of it when Scarlet slaps Butterfly McQueen's character, Prissy.  This may have been, in 1939, about all America was ready to publicly acknowledge, but it was an important acknowledgement.  And, certainly, a beginning to much future thought, discussion and action. GWTW is so great, on so many levels, it is mind-boggling.  Thoroughly enjoyable and shockingly real, with new lessons, each time I watch it. It will never become aged, outdated."

Immediately, I rented the movie and absolutely loved it!  Scarlett is very bitchy, and beautiful and the movie tackles everything in the book.  Rhett is dashing, and Melanie is so kind and generous.

I am only 15 but found that 'Gone with the wind' was better than a lot of the films on offer today.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is superb in his role of Rhett Butler. Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland are brilliant as Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. But it is Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, who really stands out. A brilliant performance and well deserved Oscar win.<br/><br/>The film itself is brilliant in so many ways. It is a long film, but everything in it is relevant to the story, and it pretty much sticks to the book.

"kaztaylor","10","1","2","2 September 2002"," A must see for one and all
","Gone With the Wind is one of the all-time classic films, not only for its ""cast of thousands"" and beautiful vistas, but for its classic characters. Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate Southern belle, Rhett Butler her dashing rogue...and you even get to learn a little something about the Civil War! There's something for everyone in GWTW -- the horror of war, a heart-wrenching romance, comedy, tragedy, and deeply drawn characters. While many dislike Scarlett for her vanity and selfishness, she is a product of her times and her upbringing, and when the chips are down, she works her fingers to the bone to take care of those she loves.  She's a flawed heroine, and utterly compelling to watch (and if you want to learn the art of flirting, just watch her at work!)  And is there anyone more manly, more charming than Clark Gable as Rhett Butler?  This beautiful movie is one every person should experience!"
"dieusani","10","1","2","20 August 2002"," A true classic
","""Gone With the Wind"" is one of those films that I've had recommended to me for most of my life, but had never actually gotten around to seeing...until recently.  Let me establish that I am not, by any means, a romantic guy. Unquestionably, the genre this film would be placed in is that of Romance, or possibly Romantic Drama if you want to be really specific.  But...in another review (Star Wars Episode II) I mentioned films that rise above their genre and become something more, something nearly everyone can enjoy. ""Gone With the Wind"" is one of those films. The story surrounds Scarlet O'Hara, and her struggle to survive and regain the style of life that the Civil War took from her.  She starts out as a manipulative, largely false and uncaring young woman, whose only real care in life is to get her way.  She is ""in love"" with Ashley Wilkes, largely, in my opinion, because she can't have him.  Ashley is a nice enough man, but he certainly isn't the type for Scarlet.  In the beginning of the film, the characters are nicely established.  The acting is top-notch, the writing is excellent, and this is one of those films you just have to see to believe. This is another of those films that I really can't comment on too much without giving away parts of the plot, so at this point I'd advise you to stop reading if you don't want to risk having something given away to you. SPOILER WARNING. Now, my philosophy on the film--you aren't supposed to like Scarlet.  She is manipulative.  She is shallow.  She rarely shows compassion for others unless it will get her something in return.  She lures two prospective husbands away from other girls via lies and false affection (not that the men aren't partially at fault there) and then basically makes the men miserable for what little time they live afterwards.  That's simply the way she is for most of the film--a person who uses the misery of others, from slaves to prisoners to her husbands, to enhance her own life.  Ashley says it himself in the later parts of the film, commenting that her use of prisoners in her business is wrong, that she should hire people (and, incidentally, that he'd intended to free his family's slaves when his father died and they became his, if the war hadn't done it first).  Her entire life is focused around getting something she cannot have--Ashley Wilkes.  He is husband to Melanie (who is, incidentally, a sweet and kind woman who sacrifices herself for everyone else, and eventually dies because she gave too much of herself).  Scarlet is living in a fantasy world, where everything revolves around her, and refuses to accept that things will not go her way.  In the middle of the film, this gives her strength, and allows people to survive...but once her home is safe, she becomes unbearable again. She never changes, never realizes that the needs of other people matter too.  Even poor Rhett (who, to be fair, is quite the manipulative and false man himself, and is certainly not without fault) is manipulated by her, constantly pushed aside despite doing everything he can to show her his love, until finally his heart is broken and he can take no more.  The end of the film, where Scarlet finally turns to Rhett after Ashley finally musters up the will to tell her ""no"" for good, isn't uplifting...""Tommorrow is another day"" isn't hopeful.  It's tragic.  Scarlet still cannot accept the loss of something she wanted.  Rhett will never return to her, because she's caused him too much pain, but she will keep on trying, manipulating people, because she is still unable to let other people's needs go ahead of her own. Maybe it's just my way of seeing it (I /have/ been told that I ""missed the point,"" that somehow Scarlet's manipulation should be accepted because it is a search for security--I feel that's a reason, but not an excuse)...but in any case, I immensely enjoyed ""Gone With the Wind,"" despite hating Scarlet, and any movie that can inspire me to write for this long on just one of its many characters and points, on just a small part of the film, is certainly worth a look.  Watch and enjoy."
"Mr_Hulot","Null","1","2","13 August 2002"," A flawed but still vital masterpiece.
","Gone with the wind is first rate in spite of its obvious flaws.<br/><br/>Essentially it is the story of a woman of enormous psychological power and ambition who finally meets a man who is a match for her.  All this takes place against the backdrop of the demise of the Old South during the civil war.<br/><br/>Essentially the Old South is presented as an agrarian civilization that is destroyed by the waves of industrialization from the North.  The culture and its traditions, both good and bad we¡¯re entirely destroyed.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind soft-pedals the horrific realities of slavery.  The south is given the glow of a grand and dying better way of life.  It is presented as though it were an idyllic paradise.  The film¡¯s magnificent baroque cinematography contributes to this effect, who can forget that scene where Scarlett O¡¯Hera stands with her father atop a hill listening to him give a speech about the beauty of devotion to the land that you own.  The camera pulls back and we see a magnificent panorama of the white mansion surrounded by the green land and the red glow of the setting sun.  The scene is precisely mirrored later on when she looks down on the ruined mansion after the war has struck.  We are given a powerful contrast between the civilization as it once was compared to how it is after it has been crushed by war.<br/><br/>Much of the movie¡¯s emotional power draws on its image of the remnants of a thriving culture and civilization slowly decay and vanish.  Against that backdrop, we see the passions and lusts of an arrogant and selfish young woman destroy lives.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh, displaying none of the wary vulnerability she shows in A Streetcar Named Desire, is a woman of iron.  She is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a quiet reserved southern gentleman.  This love seems most improbable, it is never explained, most likely she wants him simply because he is the least likely human being to return her feelings.  Her advances are known, but not objected to by Melanie played by Olivia de Havilland, a gentle ill soul who is supposed to represent the true Christian spirit. To get her hands on Ashley, Scarlett betrays and manipulates everyone in sight. She finally meets her match in Rhett Butler, a dashing, dangerous and brilliant cad, played by Clark Gable, the most lusted after actor of his day.  Originally connecting with Rhett in order to drive Ashley mad with Jealousy eventually the two become indispensable to each other. Throughout their years together they are both steadfast partners and opponents each vying for the upper hand in the relationship.  All this emotional turmoil takes place, as I have stated, against a background of social and political upheaval that seems to mirror the turmoil in their lives.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind successfully invokes the feeling of a world entirely different from our own.  It really does immerse you in the world of the old south.  For that reason the airbrushing of the issue of slavery and the racist depictions of the black characters are unforgivable.  Though it is worth noting that despite her stereotypical image, the character of Mammy, played by Hattie McDaniel in an Oscar winning role, is portrayed as having greater intelligence and maturity then her master Scarlett.<br/><br/>Despite these reservations, Gone With The Wind is a cinematic landmark that demand to be seen by anyone with interest in the history of the film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Gone With the Wind, together with To Kill a Mockingbird, is the best book ever written, and the best movie ever. You are not meant to like Scarlett, she is complete bitch and very good she ended all alone at the end of the movie -she deserved it- but anyhow you just love her, an d hate her at the same time for being so mean, and for not accepting Rhett when she could, or for hating Melanie, she being so kind, but most of all, for believing she's in love with Ashley.<br/><br/>Simply great. 10 out of 10.

","I'll try not to gush. I really will.  GWTW was indeed, a banner movie in a banner year. Despite it's four-hour-ish length, despite the fact that some performances were indeed a bit 'over the top' and despite the fact that, by today's standards, the movie is cliched and trite...it continues to WORK as few movies do.  I've lost track of how many times I've seen it.  Dozens. Each time, I thoroughly enjoy it.  Gable is the single sexiest male to ever grace the silver screen.  Vivien Leigh is phenomenal, even though she completely over-acts.  Like I said...it works!  (Let's face it: Scarlett O'Hara is a larger-than-life character, and playing her any other way simply wouldn't work.) Moreover, the vibrant, eye-catching cinematography is still the standard by which I judge most films.  Certain scenes...particularly Scarlett in the long pan-back at the Atlanta hospital, and some of the early scenes of Tara, are mind-boggling in their intensity.  This, indeed, is a melodrama.  So what?  It is the MELODRAMA of melodramas!  It is not just a ""movie"" but a film experience!"

","This is the greatest movie of all-time according to many people.  But according to me, it's good but way too over-rated. Gable is incredible, Leigh is breathtaking, and McDaniel is excellent.  That's what I truly saw in this movie.  But are three excellent performances enough to make a movie that good?  They shouldn't.<br/><br/>When I saw AFI's top 100 all-time classics, I thought that it would be second after Casablanca or even maybe vice-versa but when I saw that ""The godfather"" was third before ""Gone with the wind"", I thought ""Maybe it's a little over-rated"" and when I did see it, I thought ""This is over-rated"".

","Gone With The Wind is so wonderful, it's hard to believe it was made in the 30s. What I like most about this film is that the characters are so real that you think you know them personally. GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara. She loves Ashley, but Ashley is married to his cousin, Melanie. So she married Melanie's brother Charles( a total loser) in spite. The war started, so the men goes off to fight and Charles died two weeks later. Scarlett moved in with Melanie in Atlanta. She ruined her reputation dancing with Rhett. Then more stuff happened. The plot is quite simple, but the strong characters saves this film along with other things. The music is great, the sceneries are nice, and the costumes are the best. Oh, did I mention that the acting is to near perfection by all the cast?"
"RwRobo","10","1","2","6 July 2001"," The ultimate piece of cinema
","GWTW is possibly the greatest film of all time. It neatly blends acting, script and beautiful art direction into a stunning film. Not many movies can hold your attention for four hours and this can. Vivien Leigh deliveres a powerhouse performance which is quite possibly the greatest of all time. She never loses her momentum despite the fact she is on screen in almost every scene. Together with Clark Gabel, Leslie Howard, and Hattie McDaniel she creates the ultimate Hollywood picture. GWTW is revolutinary also in it's brilliant use of color and art direction as well as landmark special effects. I give Gone With the Wind a 10 out of 10 and should be higher on both the AFI's list and IMDb's."
"baumer","8","1","2","14 June 2000"," The most annoying character in the history of film!
","I gave this film an 8 when I voted for it.  But that was a difficult decision for me.  Do I rate the film based on what it is worth in the scope of film or do I rate it based on what the film accomplished in it's day and age?  Because this film is still quite cardboard when it comes to acting and as some other people noted in here, this is really just a four hour episode of The Young and the Restless.  But then I also had to realize how the film made me feel.  And I did get through all 3 hours and 52 minutes of it, and that is an accomplishment in itself.  The first time I saw Citizen Kane, I fell asleep, the second time I saw Citizen Kane I wanted to smash the T.V. But Gone With The Wind is quite good, for this day and age or for the 30's or 40's.  I generally don't like older classic films because I just find that they are too one dimensional.  They don't have an edge to them and they are very synthetic.  Gone With The Wind does fall into that category in some ways, but in other ways it is brilliant.<br/><br/>To think that this film is 61 years old is quite remarkable.  It must have been quite the achievement back in the day.  The colour in this film was amazing as well as the cinematography, the landscape, the fire and yes even some of the acting.  I found Clark Gable to be fascinating to watch and I realized the the film was much more enjoyable when he was in the picture. That is not to say that Vivien Leigh was not good, she was, but I just found Rhett Butler's character to be very charming, engaging and suave.  I also liked his carefree attitude.  He always bounced back from whatever was troubling him and he never let Scarlett get him down, until the very end.<br/><br/>Scarlett on the other hand was the most annoying character I have ever seen in any film.  Vivien Leigh played her brilliantly and if that is what the script called for, a winy bitch that has no idea what life is really about, then Leigh nailed it perfectly.  But I must say that she got to me after a while.  When she constantly opted for Ashley instead of other men even after her and Melanie became good friends, I wanted her to die.  I was hoping the Yankees would capture her and torture her.  She was spoiled and nasty and people say that she went on some journey to discover who she was and such but she was the same at the end as she was in the beginning.  And that is why the famous line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" is so appropriate.  Someone finally told her off and it was about time.  She had been handed everything to her ( except Ashley ) and she didn't appreciate any of it.  I do think this was one of the great performances of the era.<br/><br/>Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel were also great.  Melanie was the backbone of the film and Mammie was just a joy to watch.  She made me laugh and I think she is one of the few characters from the old films that would still sound real and genuine today.  Both were a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>GWTW has it's place in history and I guess it deserves it.  Still I don't think this is one of the best films ever made although it is entertaining. I can only imagine how this must have delighted audiences back in the 30's and 40's though.<br/><br/>I really didn't want to see this film for the longest time.  I have been disappointed with some of the other so called classics and I was not looking forward to sitting through another, especially at 4 hours in length.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It captivated me and kept me entertained and that is what is missing from many of the 30's 40's and 50's films, entertainment. Gone With The Wind doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>8 out of 10.  A fine effort and a very enjoyable film."
"Pat-54","Null","1","2","16 October 1998"," Why not Franchot Tone?
","My only criticism of this, my all-time favorite film, is the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  In the book, Ashley is 28 when the story begins (and Leslie Howard was then pushing 40).  Franchot Tone would had been perfect and just the right age.  Why was he never considered?  Also, wouldn't it had been great if Elizabeth Taylor had been cast as Bonnie Blue? She too was EXACTLY the right age (seven) and would had been completely believable as the daughter of Vivien Leigh."

My sincere thanks go to the inventors of DVD technology. The movie was made for the romantic girls, women, not for the young guys or men I believe. It is apparent that producers spent a lot of money, and this film proved the power of advertisement. I am sure they collected every penny they spent. It is very, very, very boring film. 2 out of ten and these 2 points are for Vivien Leigh"

","I used to love this movie but not anymore. Scarlett is ridiculous, pining over a guy that is already taken. She's just sad and desperate and pathetic. Also I don't get how Melanie is so naive and stupid about Scarlett. When Scarlett finds out that she can't finally stand Ashley, she loses the one guy (Rhett) who loved her. Even at her worst, even when she was unlovable, he still loved her and tried to understand her and tried to help her and be loyal to her.<br/><br/>But I really don't respect Melanie. She just acts like an idiot. The acting by everyone is so melodramatic. Also Ashley is annoying. He's a wimp and a coward.

Starting with the opening title quote from Margaret Mitchell's apartheid source material to Scarlett's constant abuse of every African American who comes within shouting or beating range of her, this movie is the American equivalent to Germany's 1930s propaganda masterpiece, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Tragically, THE WIZARD OF OZ--jobbed out by WIND for 1939's ""Best Picture"" Oscar--probably would have been an even better movie if WIND producer David O. Selznick had not kidnapped Oz director Victor Fleming from the Emerald City and literally driven him into a mental institution by foisting upon him the impossible task of attempting to bring coherence to this misogynistic marathon melodrama. The best way to experience WIND is simply by listening to a CD of composer Max Steiner's outstanding score."

"lisamichelle190","5","3","17","1 January 2011"," Watchable movie, but please don't forget it's propaganda
","It was the best of films; it was the worst of films.<br/><br/>The good: GWTW is long but mostly engrossing. Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are not always sympathetic or even likable, but there is something about them that does draw you in to wonder what they could possibly say or do next. This is an old-fashioned epic, and it certainly shows the perspective of the Old South toward the Civil War. In that sense, GWTW is educational and instructional, and I'm glad I saw it.<br/><br/>The bad: Wow, I was appalled on so many levels by so many things in this movie. I'm equally appalled at how many people seem to love LOVE LOVE it, and who brush off the blatant, egregious dehumanization and racism of this movie. For those who say, oh, but the character of Mammy is strong and likable, and she criticizes ""poor white trash"" a few times, so how racist could it be? Hello? Wake up, people! This film glorifies slavery, which is the owning and control of certain people by other people based on the amount of melanin in their skin. It does so by suggesting that ""darkies"" cannot control their own destiny and that they enjoy their position in Southern society and that they do not want to be free. So we're given characters like Mammy and Big Sam, who are just so pleased and thrilled to serve their masters. And the whites who own them are portrayed as benevolent, as if this whole fantasy of plantations and genteel ladies and fancy dresses was not bought on the blood and sweat of people who were forcibly brought over in chains on boats from their homes, their families and children broken apart and stolen from them, their cultures and lives destroyed. Actually, the more I think about this and the more I think of all these glowing reviews of how wonderful this film is, the more livid I become.<br/><br/>I am willing to say that you can separate, at least on some level, the skill and artistry of the film itself from its subject matter, and to that degree I can appreciate GWTW. But if you believe this sentimentalized, one-sided, one-dimensional, totally self-serving (on the part of white slaveholders) portrayal of slavery, then there is something wrong with you. Go see Amistad or Rosewood, go read a book by Frederick Douglass. Educate yourself. Wake up, America."

The colors too, are vibrant and pleasant. Apart from that the first hour or so is enjoyable, and after that occasionally their are interesting moments. But ultimately it's just too long, and by the end I was done with all the melodrama. Clarks Rhett Butler is fun though, while DeHaivilands character is annoyingly upbeat. The ending too is a dissspointment. It should have cut right where Rhett tells Scarlett, ""I don't give a damn."" That would have been a sobering conclusion.

","I get why Gone with the Wind is probably the most successful film of all time. It's romantic in every sense of the word. It's beautifully shot and has excellent visual composition, showcasing the old South in all its old-style charm and gloriousness. There's also romantically belligerent sexual tension galore between the two protagonists, which always makes for a good time. With Rhett or without him, Scarlett consistently manages to be infuriatingly immature in her actions throughout the film. However, she maintains some redeeming appeal: as bratty and selfish as Scarlett is, she is also bold and daring.

","Ah, the old days. Maybe not so good old. As much as people want to see Gone With The Wind as a story of a complicated romance between Rhett Butler & Scarlett O'Hara, we really can't brush aside the racism, sexism, elitism, classicism, and perhaps 1 or 2 other isms. For every powerful ""as God is my witness"" line, there's the fact that Scarlett is a selfish jerk who only ever wants what she can't have. For every bold declaration of ""tomorrow is another day"", there's the marital rape. And, hoo boy, we can't forget the glossed-over slavery.<br/><br/>Not that we should dwell on those isms. The movie is 4 hours long. You can be cheesed off about those controversies for a solid hour and still have 3 more to wallow in the opulence! And it would be some decadent wallowing. Producer/mogul David Selznick spent a lot of MGM's money to build massive pre- and post-Civil War sets, then burned some of those sets to the ground. Enough different dresses to clothe a small southern town found their way to Vivien Leigh's back, only to be discarded after that first and only wearing. You know, reality.<br/><br/>It probably sounds like I want to spit rail spikes at this movie. That's not entirely true. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are terrific as Scarlett and Rhett. Olivia De Havilland is fine too, although her character's halo occasionally gets in the way of anything resembling a real person. As good as the stars were, Hattie McDaniel (in a solid performance) was the only actor to win an Oscar. The film won 7 other trophies, including Best Picture of 1939. As for the American Film Institute, Gone With The Wind was on 7 different Top 100 (or Top 25) lists. The AFI likey.

"neil-476","10","1","3","12 September 2010"," A true epic
","The thing which really astonishes me about GWTW is how artistically successful it is, given the time it was made. Sound was only 10 years old and full colour in a full length feature less than a year, yet GWTW - with three directors - uses both with a maturity that most movies still can't manage over 80 years later.<br/><br/>Rather than compliment the cast and production crew - there are plenty of comments here which say the same thing I would say - I want to sing the praises of the remastered DVD. The original 3 strip Technicolor had the 3 elements combined in an optical printer whenever a projection print was produced, and the mechanical process of doing this sometimes - often, if the DVD documentary is to be believed - produced far from perfect registration of the 3 elements. For the remastered DVD, new software has been written which enables the 3 elements to be registered digitally absolutely perfectly. As a result, the remastered DVD has the sharpest image most people will ever have seen, and I can confirm that this excellent film does indeed look better than I have ever seen it."

","Even after 70 years, this film holds it's own pretty well. The jewel-like 1930s Technicolor makes the ornate 19th century sets and lovely gowns look even more stunning, the story has epic sweep, and heroine Scarlett is both lovely and lively, albeit ultimately (and by accident) portrayed as truly ugly human being, just like every member of Southern upper-class. White trash indeed! (And no, this is not racism, I'm white!) All this comes from the source of GWTW, the novel by Margaret Mitchell, which is a love letter to the antebellum South but seems sometimes almost despising the characters. Her book is still quite good romantic drama, if one can stomach the sporadic whining and self-pity - it is thankfully largely cut from this movie."

It is a classic, and 70 years later I feel that it has not aged the slightest bit. Modern movies with their flashy special effects will never equal the subtle emotion and vivid storyline of Gone with the Wind. The acting is superb, especially Hattie McDaniel's convincing portrayal of Mammy, Olivia DeHavilland as the compassionate and reserved Melanie, and of course, Vivien Leigh's emotional and brilliant Scarlett O'Hara. The bottom line? Watch this movie, and watch it again. When you have, and you haved loved it (as I am sure you will) come and rate it on IMDb, and maybe it can get the ranking it deserves."

","Gone with the Wind is probably the most overrated film ever made, right next to Citizen Kane. Don't get me wrong, the film was excellent in look and design. Put the two together, along with story and characterization and the outcome isn't quite the same. This whole movie is basically the life of Scarlett O'Hara before and after the Civil War and her sick and twisted many loves of Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler and other men. There is just way too much of Scarlett and her stubborness and greedy self included in this movie and so little of everyone else. Clark Gable is the top billed star in this movie, but if you add up everybody else scenes compared to his, he's about the tenth star. The film looks great in the beginning and also all throughout the entire picture. Magnificent directing, well structured and detailed art direction, and great costume design. Some great scenes are featured, the burning of Atlanta, the massive amount of extras of wounded Civil War solders and the errie and stomach churning scene of the war vet getting is leg amputated, by the use of shadows of the man's leg and tortured screams. Cleverly directed by the three directors who lent a hand in making this classic film. The problems this movie has that I think doesn't make it a masterpiece, is like I said before this is a film about Scarlett O' Hara, not Rhett Butler. I think love story's make good for classic's, but not masterpiece's. A masterpiece in my opinion are film's that aren't love stories, films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Psycho. I wonder if Gone with the Wind was filmed in black and white, featured a lower budget and had no Clark Gable, would people still look at the film as great as they think it is now. I don't think so. Gone with the Wind has a great cast who did an extordinary job in bringing these characters to life. The ones who really catch your eye are Vivian Liegh and Clark Gable. Both do great jobs in portraying these complicated characters, especially Vivian Leigh. She defeintly deserved the oscar she recieved, but it's a shame Clark Gable didn't get one. He was snubbed. The person who played Mammie should of gave her oscar to him. I wonder how Errol Flynn would of done if he was chosen to play Rhett Butler, I think he would of played him probably more dashing, kinder and cooler. To sum it all up, a film for everyone to enjoy who are into classic's and love stories. **1/2 out of ****."

Lavish costumes, magnificent sets, a vicious love triangle and characters that are larger than life.  Of course, with the characters, David O. Selznick scored big time.  Vivian Leigh radiates confidence and sexuality as Scarlett O'Hara.  Clark Gable is cool and charming as Rhett Butler.  Oliva DeHaviland, as Melanie, is the perfect embodiment of a Southern woman.  Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, the movie spans so much time and does it so well, you'll wonder what's happened to the previous three and half hours.  For its' time, Gone With The Wind was a major milestone in movie making.  The burning of Atlanta scene holds up pretty well, along with the massive crane shot that shows the thousands of soldiers laying on the ground.  The score can never be topped. Max Steiner struck gold with the sweeping ""Tara's Theme"" and every time you hear it, you can't help but think about Scarlett and the troubles she endures in  her life.

"Tommy-92","8","1","3","15 September 1999"," Though very soapy at times, otherwise thorughly engrossing and wonderfully filmed and acted
","Yes, there are too many suds in the second part.  Perhaps the view of the Old South is too idealistic, but keep in mind that Margaret Mitchell based the book on stories her parents and grandparents had told her.  She was born in 1900, well after the Civil War, and grew up hearing this stuff.  Of course they were going to paint themselves as righteous, gallant, wonderful people so horribly wronged by the Yankees just because they owned darkies like cattle, and who was little Peggy to argue with them?  That said, the movie is pretty good.  <br/><br/>Alas, I've only seen it on T.V. and VHS, so I haven't seen the full power of the scope, but I've gotten a hefty dose of it, I think.  Many of the shots really are gorgeous, and some are quite powerful, too.  The first time I saw ut, for some reason I was so affected by the scene where Scarlett is driving Melanie, Prissy, and baby horugh a field right after the rain storm.  A rainbow is out and the sun is shining, but the field is bare and here and there are bloody corpses.  ""The devestation!"" I thought that first time I saw it; I really haven't thought otherwise in the 5 or so times I've seen it since.  While of course it was Selznick's picture and no one has ever argued with that, due credit must be given to the four directors (probably more) who worked on it for doing such a wonderful job in keeping the interest up through the whole four hours and doing such a great job at it, with only a few flagging-attention spots.  Then there's the acting.  Vivien Leigh is great; now I simply can't imagine anyone else as Scarlett.  Bette Davis? Joan Crawford??  Norma Shearer???  Lucille Ball????  I just can't imagine any of them in the role when Leigh was so good.  To be able to be flirtatious, sexy, bitchy, strong-willed, and a cry-baby, all equally well! She really brightens up the picture, and thank God for that; she's in every scene!  Clark Gable is wonderfully wry and provides a light touch, welcomely recieved, to the more sudsy, cheesy parts.  He and Leigh have marvelous chemistry, and he's very brave to be able to think he can tame her!  He plays it wonderfully cool in the last scene, while Leigh, in a very rare low spot, resorts to surprsingly annoying and cheesy histrionics, though she probably was so sick of the long hours/months spent on this that she was just taking out her frustration the only way she knew how.  Olivia De Havilland quietly plays the part of Melanie wonderfully; without calling attention to herself, she provides a solid anchor for Scarlett and just acts the part wonderfully.  Leslie Howard is just dull as Ashley, but then maybe that was supposed to be the point, that Scarlett somehow was so convinced he was perfect that she failed to realize how wrong he was for her.  Hattie McDaniel as Mammy is funny, but not in a demeaning way.  She must have worked very ahrd not to appear to be your average, ""Yes, mas'r, I'se here"" black maid as they were being portrayed at the time, and succeeds wnderfully.  Her performance was good enough to get an Oscar nomination, let alone the award, so that should say something!  Prissy, on the other hand, is pretty demeaning, because all she does is wail and act stupid.  No wonder Butterfly McQueen was ashamed of the role!  If I were her, I'd become a recluse and never think of leaving my house.  Yes, the view of slavery is over-simplified, but Peggy Mitchell's family's accounts of it probably were, too, as they didn't see anything wrong with it at all.<br/><br/>Masterful performances for the most part, masterful direction, script, music, (Oh, the music!), cinemetography, scenery, and everything else is entirely masterful.  No, it's not the greatest movie of all time, but it sure is close!  Definitly recommended."

Back then, movies and culture was a lot different, but Hollywood and Cinema was still overrated, just as it is now.

Heck, the movie makes them all look GOOD! It tells the story between the romance of two GOOD people from two different sides, Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, who, I must say, deliver GOOD performances. Hence, 'Gone with the Wind' is a GOOD movie from a not so GOOD time in the 20th century because War was going on and it wasn't nearly as hip (and GOOD. hehe) as the end of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Look, this was a GOOD movie. It wasn't great as a lot of people said, but maybe that's because you had to live in the GOOD old era of 1939, or just have to really love GOOD romance movies, regardless of how many flaws or boring scenes they actually had."

","It is really amazing that even now, over 60 years later this film can still be enjoyed. I mean comedic standards change, filmmaking techniques change, special effects change and so on. But all that did not made a difference to this films class. The jokes still work, the set decoration is good, the battle scenes and effects are still good (even nowadays and I didn't even watch the restored version from 1998), the film has a couple of great shots and a lot of diversity. But it is the effort and class of the two leading actors that make this film so good and worth while. Vivian Leigh is just perfect as the breathtaking and naive yet selfish and cruel Scarlett whereas Clark Gable pulls off the best ungentlemanly yet likeable money chaser I've ever seen. The combination of these two is really great, with Scarlett always whining and pretending to be such a poor, poor girl while Clark Gable makes fun of her and enjoys it himself extent.<br/><br/>
The thing that I found most amazing though was that although I felt not for Scarlett until the very end of the film, I found myself in the same situation as Rhett Butler. I fell for the charm of Scarlett and I must say, I sometimes hated myself for loving her. This is a classic film in many ways and one I must say I cannot imagine they will remake soon, because everyone who has seen this film, has the characters as they were portrayed by Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh imprinted into their memory forever.<br/><br/>

","I have watched a lot of movies over the years, and yet - as hard as it is to believe - I had never watched ""Gone With The Wind"" from beginning to end until now. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it still deserves to be considered a classic, even 62 years after its release.<br/><br/>It's true that this movie is far from perfect. It is overly sympathetic to the south, and foolishly romanticizes ""Old Dixie."" Masters and slaves were just one big happy family if you choose to believe this account. (In fairness the screenplay does point out, through the eyes of Rhett Butler, the foolishness of the South even getting into this war, let alone believing that it could actually win the thing.) The Civil War itself seemed to pass at lightning speed, which perhaps contributes to some questionable historical references. For example, reference is made seemingly early in the War to General Lee ""pushing the Yankees out of Virginia."" The problem is that I can't find any reference to Lee commanding troops in battle that early in the War. OK. That's pretty picky perhaps. There is certainly, however, the racist stereotyping of the happy slaves who just wish those damn Yankees would go away and let them go back to their nice, comfortable lives in the fields and slave huts, although that has to be looked at in the context of 1939; there is a very strange lack of southern accents among these Confederates; and, at about 3 and a half hours the movie is inexcusably long. The second half especially drags a little bit and lacks the sustained excitement of the first 90 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the negatives definitely do not outweigh the positives. Where to begin? How about the acting! There really isn't a weak performance anywhere, and there are a number of standouts. Is it even possible to imagine anyone but Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara? These two were superb in these roles. The chemistry between them literally drips from the screen as their complex love-hate relationship is explored. Gable demonstrated great versatility as he moved seamlessly from greedy blockade runner to doting father to abusive husband. Leigh captured the essence of Scarlett perfectly, and was very convincing in her statements of her love for Tara, the family plantation. Hattie McDaniel was great as Mammy - the house slave, and Olivia de Havilland put on a strong performance as Melanie Wilkes, the woman who married Scarlett's true love.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed by the special effects in this movie - especially the scenes as Rhett and Scarlett rush through Atlanta's  streets as the city burns down around them. There was also good use of low-key humour scattered throughout, which helped to break some of the dramatic tension in what was for the most part a pretty dark movie.<br/><br/>So, yes, even after 62 years, this holds up well. Every movie fan should watch it at least once. I rate it as an 8/10."

However, I promise you it's not gonna be that much of a satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The ending though is good considering that the movie was made in 1939.

","I have two words to say about this movie.<br/><br/>WORST!!! MOVIE!!! IN!!! HISTORY!!!<br/><br/>Okay, that's really four words, but still...it's absolutely terrible!<br/><br/>The film takes place in Southern America, where it witnesses the events of the Civil War and the Reconstruction Era. The film's protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivien Leigh), the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, who has a crush on Ashley Wilkes (played by Leslie Howard). But, he doesn't love her in return, and he's married to his cousin Melanie Hamilton (played by Olivia de Havilland). Along the way, Scarlett is being pursued by another man who does have a crush on her, Rhett Butler (played by Clark Gable).<br/><br/>I'm not gonna lie though, it isn't without its pros. I thought the performances that the cast gave their characters were really engaging, the most intriguing of them being Clark Gable's performance as Rhett Butler. <br/><br/>The historical accuracy that the film had was also a nice touch, such as showing the culture of the South, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction Era.<br/><br/>There are also some funny moments here and there. One comedic moments for instance being that a woman was secretly using her feet to dance even though she wasn't supposed to because she was in mourning.<br/><br/>But none of those pros will ever make up for how truly terrible this movie is.<br/><br/>Scarlett O' Hara was completely unlikeable! She's spoiled, greedy, a brat, and in every way selfish and mean. She kept wanting Ashley Wilkes to be the guy she would spend the rest of her life with despite the fact he doesn't love her back, and she kept pushing away Rhett Butler, the guy who really does love her. Whatever character development she also had came in too late, because by the time she figures out she doesn't need Ashley, loves Rhett, and completely commits to him, he leaves her!<br/><br/>Every character that actually was likable got taken out of the film as if director Victor Fleming hated them and wanted them dead, most notably, Scarlett's father, her daughter, and Ashley's wife, Melanie.<br/><br/>The story was very long and confusing too! The dramatic moments the film had were also too intense and didn't lead up to anything great. If Fleming's goal was to stay true to the book in order to make people depressed and angry to the point of seeing a counselor, he certainly accomplished that.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, Gone with the Wind isn't what I would even call a classic and should never have come into existence, and if I were you, I wouldn't see it even if my life depended on it!"

I'm old enough to remember the miniseries ""North and South"" that you absolutely could NOT get away from when it was on TV. Everyone but me seemed to be watching it.<br/><br/>I'm not overly offended by the portrayal of slavery in GWTW... it's inaccurate for sure, but it's no worse than that portrayed in ""Song of the South"" which has been banned and shunned for decades. Why is GWTW still worshiped? I don't know. Scarlett can threaten to beat Prissy with a strap and that seems to be okay, but God forbid Uncle Remus tell a few morality tales about a cartoon rabbit to a little boy. But I digress.<br/><br/>My real problem with GWTW is that all of the characters are either unpleasant or stupid... sometimes both (hello, Prissy). It's hard to sit there for four hours without being invested in what happens to anybody because they're so difficult to care about. Scarlett is cruel and selfish, Rhett is cruel and selfish, Ashley and Melanie are so dimwitted one wonders how many generations the Wilkes cousins have been intermarrying.<br/><br/>In short, it's beautifully filmed, but leaves me almost entirely cold."

","This review is solely for those contemplating watching an old classic movie for the first time. It's not a war movie despite being cast in this times. The scenes with men are so stereo typical and distraught that you'd wonder how such men could actually be soldiers. The Southern Gentlemen' way was shoe horned into soiled babies and dummies with southern accents. So what's the big deal about this? A girl named Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and her predilection for misplaced infatuation of one, married and too old for her, Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard). This is the film whose running story line (joke) is propped up by the noblest of Southern women captured by a genuine goodness or blind hospitality of his wife/cousin Melanie Hamilton ((Olivia de Haviland). If there is virtue exemplified, then Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is vile glorified. Don't get me wrong, without Rhett calling out Scarlett's spoiled kitten routine, we'd have no reason to continue, or watch over and over again.These four characters are Confederate juicy gossip and much as they are a high school roller-coaster ride of matchmaking."
"Derutterj-1","Null","1","4","20 January 2008"," Still Not Completely On Board
","There's no doubting its monumental power and ambition; Gone with the Wind is all that. It was David Selznick's testamentno movie before in the sound era had been so technically advanced and sweeping in its dramatic intention and scope (especially in its groundbreaking use of color to set mood and atmosphere). Among many, two things in particular stood out after several viewings. First, it foresaw the elongated structure of movies of three decades hence, where very long running times became typical. In the process it opened up extended running time as an option in the editing of lesser epics. The second, which I suddenly realized after the 4th viewing (and a departure from the normal convention up to that time), is that it declined to focus on the more virtuous figures, instead placing a couple of disreputable and flawed charactersa vain Southern belle and a shady alpha male gunrunnerat the center of the narrative.<br/><br/>As for the first innovation noted, I am ambivalent. As a former film editor for a UHF TV station, assigned to re-format Hollywood movies for airing and as a result required to evaluate cinematic storytelling closely, I often found the extensive length of many pictures made after 1955 to be self-indulgent; 'Scope and color invited plenty of scenic mood-setting. As a film-goer I often found them a test to take in during one sitting.<br/><br/>The second was a revelation; the characters are there in plain sight, and I should've taken them as a given, but for those of us growing up in the '60s, even film buffs, GWTW carries so much baggage that it remains hard for me to take merely on its filmic merits, which are those of timeless, romantic, and melodramatic skill. The problem is that it unabashedly glamorizes and pretties up the Antebellum South and the Confederacy. For a modern African-American, this is somewhat analogous to offering an idealized portrait of the Fourth Reich, with its high-living Albert Speers, their wives, mistresses and servants; enjoying their Alpine adventures and tooling around in their big Mercedes cars until war comes and it all falls apart. If you saw such a film would you applaud it? Would you find it of nostalgic value? If not, you see what I'm getting at.<br/><br/>It has been years now. I am familiar with the reputations of all involved here: they were film industry titans. The casting was inspired. There were many scenes which scream their epic pretensions. But I remain unmoved. In short, I know GWTW is a great movie but to me, because of the story at its very center, the entire exercise still seems hollow and morally suspect. Finally--I may be sounding overly picky, but the famous Atlanta-burning scene has a minor flaw too. It's the railroad cars. The fire inferno is impressive as all get out, but better miniature work was needed for the exploding freight cars. William Cameron Menzies was the best designer ever, but I don't think model work was his niche; other specialts like Fred Jackman, Fred Sersen, Dev Jennings or the Lydecker brothers were needed. Attributing the minor flaw to the distant era isn't a good enough excuse. Just look at the model work in Hell's Angels, Suez, In Old Chicago and The Dawn Patrol, among other films, and you'd see what I mean. In a way it points up a curious problem with Selznick's epics: they lack satisfactory action sequences (Viva Villa excluded). Selznick was interested in character, personality; he was right to be, of course, but such long pictures as this and Duel In The Sun need something other than stylistic posturing. They need real excitement. GWTW is a Civil War epic without a single battle scene. Something is wrong about that."

","""Gone With the Wind"" is such a tremendous achievement in cinema, that, after 66 years, it still deserves to be honored and cherished.<br/><br/>David O. Selznick had a very clear vision of what he wanted for this film. He was laughed at, he had to close down filming at one point - but he never gave up on it. His mania regarding the film is portrayed in a play, ""Moonlight and Magnolias,"" a comedy in which Selznick locks Victor Fleming and Ben Hecht in his office until they can come up with a shooting script. It's slapsticky, it's fluff, it takes historical liberties, but the underpinnings of the play are real.<br/><br/>This is one movie where it is worthwhile to see all the documentary footage available and then watch it again to appreciate the artistry that went into the backdrops, painting in the ceilings, the epic scenes, all done by master craftsmen without the aid of computers.<br/><br/>There's no point in commenting on the story or the performances. ""Gone With the Wind"" is a reminder of what an artistic vision, loving care to detail, a great story, and a great cast can achieve that's lasting."
"dmh7","Null","1","4","7 October 2004"," Too Late to Stop It Now!
","It is obviously too late to stop this film from being considered a masterpiece, but it isn't. It is entirely too overblown and full of its own importance to be taken seriously, and not funny enough to be a comedy or a camp classic. Clark is in fine macho fettle, and Vivien is spectacular, and captures well the ambiguity of her character, which - although an obvious and self-centered bitch - is also the ""force of nature"" which gets many of the other (more anemic) characters through the war and - more importantly - through the film.<br/><br/>Of the two female lead characters - Melanie and Scarlett - Melanie is the more overtly ""good"" yet - as is revealed in the post-war scenes - she is really not up to the task of holding everyone's world together. For that, an iron will is needed, and Scarlett has nothing but. Leslie Howard's character is massively useless, almost a psychic cripple, and he seems to know it. The only real complexity in the film is provided by Vivien's magnificent portrayal of what could otherwise have been a one-dimensional harridan.<br/><br/>Selznick later showed what horrors he could accomplish with his epic ""vision"" and an inferior cast and idea when (in his final production) he gave us ""Duel In The Sun,"" a horrid lump of a film with almost no redeeming elements, save Walter Huston's all-too-brief rendition of the bunko traveling preacher. Gone With The Wind is only a few nice performances shy of being just as irrelevant.<br/><br/>Truth be told, these sprawling ""historical"" dramas, which paste a love story over the almost beside-the-point backdrop of this event or another are usually irredeemable. A modern equivalent is something like ""The English Patient"" (which is, not coincidentally - another producer-driven concoction), which has its share of beautiful vistas, beautiful people, and a general lack of aesthetic value.<br/><br/>No one can fault the players; DeHavilland and Leslie do the best as they can with terminally-pallid human ghosts, and Clark and Vivien are never less than enjoyable. But the story is pure blarney, and - as has been noted before - basically racist in its depictions of blacks, and apparently rather irked by the fact it has to pay attention to the war at all. If one removes the Civil War background and just imagines this as a love story, it has little interest: a thousand better romances have been presented. So the entire thing strikes me as vastly pretentious.<br/><br/>Still, my wife loves it, so I have to watch it from time to time, and - honestly - it is better than most of what we get as film entertainment now. So - go ahead - enjoy it! It won't kill you."
"federovsky","Null","1","4","24 August 2004"," Cinematic museum piece, not masterpiece
","This is a story by and mainly for women, in any case only women might be able to appreciate and understand Scarlett O'Hara's totally irrational behaviour (if anyone can, please explain it to me). Still, it's such a cinema milestone you have to see it. It's an attractive, fairly durable (and fairly endurable) movie - everything you'd expect from a classic Hollywood epic, though time has revealed some deep flaws in its construction. <br/><br/>
On the positive side, there are some lush sets and rich colours, and the repeated use of silhouettes against a dramatic sky is very effective and memorable. The film also succeeds in making us think: what life was like in the heyday of the South; what the slaves made of it all; the utter waste of war (as always); how we would cope if our lives and homes were suddenly devastated. But unfortunately the film doesn't really want us to think, and scenes are hurried along presumably in order to squeeze in everyone's favourite episode from the book. There are some amusing moments, and some stirring moments - the story is clearly capable of arousing strong emotions, though this is mainly due to the numerous tragic deaths which are so liberally sprinkled throughout the film that we begin to feel distinctly manipulated.<br/><br/>This main failing of the film is that there is too much script. The dialogue is rapid fire and unnatural, it is often impossible to hear clearly what is being said. There is little in the way of dramatic silence and every action and emotion is represented or accompanied by an exhausting gush of Southern drawl. At times, such as when Prissy ascends the stairs with Melanie Hamilton, you can sense the actors' real exhaustion with the script.<br/><br/>As a result of the script, the acting is too stylized (nobody could speak those lines in a normal voice), and while this is no doubt intentional, subtlety and cinematic effect is sacrificed for an unsatisfying theatricality. In particular, Lesley Howard brings this film to its knees with a performance so wooden you can hear his legs creak, and the narrative slows perceptibly during his every scene. This is very disappointing, as Ashley could have been one of the more interesting and original characters in the story. <br/><br/>Originality is generally in short order. Margaret Mitchell's book may well have been a big success but is highly derivative of the feisty 19th century female literature of the South. There is nothing original in GTTW's story of rebellious womanhood, of urbane cads, or of chaps throwing their hats in the air at the prospect of going to war (dusted off yet again in `Cold Mountain'). This over-familiarity may tell on a sophisticated modern audience.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh (who is rarely off-screen) is excellent, almost miraculous, but Scarlett is made to sustain a tone of coquettish petulance for the full duration, and Leigh has no opportunity to modulate dramatic key. The result is a monotonous and eventually annoying performance (not helped by Scarlett's irksome irrationality). Gable and the lovely Olivia de Havilland are also victims of one-dimensional characterization.<br/><br/>The power of the film rests largely on the more dismal aspects of the story, and in the end it is the dismal aspects that leave the lasting impression, leaving us feeling slightly ill-at-ease and unsatisfied - particularly concerning the behaviour of Scarlett. <br/><br/>To get this movie and its relative merits into perspective, compare Hollywood's facile treatment of another blockbuster novel `War and Peace' with the 1968 Russian version. Then consider again how different - and how much better - GWWT might have been."

","I've seen this movie all the way through twice, and attempted to sit through all of it many other times.  I think it's classic status owes more to all of the hype surrounding its production than anything contained in the movie itself - the search for the right actress to play Scarlett, the trouble with directors, Selznick's infamous memos, etc., etc.<br/><br/>This is not to say there are no good things about the film.  Clark Gable is perfect, and so is Vivien Leigh.  Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell and Olivia De Havilland are also excellent.  There are some memorable images, such as the Atlanta fire, in fact the production values are good.  The use of Technicolor is outstanding - by 1939 standards.  And it stands as a great reminder of Hollywood's golden age.<br/><br/>But, the bad outweighs the good.  First of all, about 45 to 60 minutes could be shaved off of the running time.  Second, Leslie Howard is far too old for his role (Margaret Mitchell's quote - ""(Howard) was dreadful beyond compare"") and, really, how can anyone be as wimpy as Ashley Wilkes?  Then, the alleged heroine, Scarlett, has no redeeming qualities whatsoever; she is dishonest, she steals a man away from her sister to get money, and she is lazy and petulant through most of the film.  How can anyone root for her?<br/><br/>
This film more than any other serves as proof of David O. Selznick's theory that hype and publicity can elevate the status of an average film to classic status.  Those who think this is a ""timeless classic"" have been swept away by the hype.  I'd give it 6 out of 10 points."

Still overrated, in my view. Fans continue to echo the fanfare billboards of '39, when I, as a soph in college, sat through the Berkeley ""premiere"" with lady friend and, after the three-and-three-quarter hour melee, opined: interesting, but no cigar. Besides, it's butt-wearying. I have not seen the film again, but adoring fans, worldwide?, notwithstanding, I still have major plaints, to wit: 1: Has anyone else detected?, or am I mistaken, the egregious plagiarization by Margaret Mitchell, UNconsciously?, of the four chief protagonists in William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" plunked down in the Civil War ""South""??? 2: It took nearly FOUR hours of feckless ""romanticisms"" to reach an er, ah, ""climax"" of Rhett's sublimation of passion? Not to mention a ""daring"" uttering of the word ""damn""? 3: Whereas the heavily lobbied Oscar went to Hattie McDaniel, few seem to mind the Priss of Butterfly McQueen, who summons the ghosts of Step'n Fetchits past. I gagged, I kid you not. And I wasn't even aware, at the time, of my racial sensitivities. 4: Finally, despite a feisty Vivien Leigh, neither Olivia de Havilland nor Leslie Howard could rescue their roles from the doldrums of tedious tepidity. Forget Clark, who finally came to some life vis-a-vis Claudette Colbert when he finally blew the horn on their Wall of Jericho in an arguably deserving Oscar-winning vehicle. Today, I can only think of one candidate to rival ""GWTW"" for cinematic afflatus, and that is the Oscar-dominating ""Titanic."" The sight of was it James Cameron? pumping his fist and avowing his just deserts was less than inspiring. Here, I would place Viggo Mortensen's at the time six-year-old scion, Henry, as a proper ""critic."" The boy is said to have said, after sitting through the watery precincts: ""It should have been about the boat."" And not that laughable?, well, certainly corny, between-decks ""romance"" and emblematic necklace/pendants?

"daviddaphnered","10","1","5","19 May 2017"," THE big movie for ages
","This was the great feat for Hollywood the other side of ""The Godfather"". The movie is much quoted even today, more than seventy years after its release in 1939. It is an understatement to say it is no wonder that it won the Best Picture award for that same year. Truly, Margaret Mitchell's very long novel (a little over a thousand pages long) was definitely a great feat for the outstanding producer David O. Selznick and directors Victor Fleming and George Cukor, and a great accomplishment for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as well. This definitely made Clark Gable a household name after he played excellently the role of Rhett Butler, and the career of Vivien Leigh was catapulted in this great classic as she played the role of Scarlett O'Hara. The young Olivia deHavilland did something for her career in the movies as well by acting well the part of Melanie Wilkes. Truly Leslie Howard, who played Ashley Wilkes, the husband of Melanie as well as the owner of the plantation Twelve Oaks, typified a southern gentleman, even though in real life Howard was originally from England. Hattie McDaniel was the epitome of a southern mammy. Thomas Mitchell was an almost-perfect actor in his role as Mr. O'Hara, the owner of the plantation Tara and also Scarlet's father. Though not a major actor here, Harry Davenport was quite impressive as Dr. Meade. Butterfly McQueen was there mainly for decorative purposes, but herself did well. The movie depicted well the War Between the States very realistically and graphically, of course. (I will have to tell something on myself: when I was almost eight years of age in the summer of 1954 when this movie was a return, the burning of Atlanta was so loud that I declared to myself that I would never see this movie again, though that did not become the truth.) The screaming wounded Rebel soldiers(though many of them were actually mannequins) added to the cinematic work being realistic and graphic. And, of course, the undulating romance twixt Butler and Scarlett O'Hara was excellently depicted. And too, the southern pride of the characters came across strongly; after all, Scarlett fought well for the reconstruction of the estate Tara at all costs including lying and stealing. Though the movie was originally filmed in B&W, the color did come through beautifully later. And, who can forget the closing line of Gable/Butler to Leigh/Scarlett ""Frankly, my dear, I don't..."" (Surely the reader of this knows the completion of the line.) A fine of at least a thousand dollars was imposed for using that unforgettable line. For all the reasons listed, definitely it has been for over half a century a movie whose very title has a special ring to it."

It's become part of the data base of our shared vernacular culture. If you don't watch it, you won't be able to understand some of the allusions on The Tonight Show and David Letterman. It's got more tag lines than Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar.""<br/><br/>""As Gawd is my witness, I'll never be hungry again."" <br/><br/>""I'll think about that tomorrow."" <br/><br/>""I love you, Scarlett. I've always loved you."" <br/><br/>""Oh, Miss Scarlet, I don't know nothing' bout birthin' babies."" <br/><br/>""Tomorrow is another day."" <br/><br/>And the immortal, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" <br/><br/>Selznik, the producer, outdid himself here, the benzedrine being a big help, as did the half dozen or so directors whom he fired seriatim. The location shooting is magnificent -- all those silhouettes against all those vermilion skies -- even though the location shooting was confined to the RKO studios and back lot. The photography with its amber side lighting is stunning. The musical score is thrilling, arresting, exalted, majestic, commanding, opulent, colossal, bombastic.<br/><br/>Vivien Leigh sparkles. Clark Gable is masculine. Hattie McDaniel is impertinent. Olivia De Havilland is sweet. Leslie Howard is noble.<br/><br/>And every one of the performers, leads included, is a stereotype. Leigh is the bratty self-centered woman survivor who realizes too late, sigh, that real love was hers to be had all the time. I remember seeing it on one of its releases in a theater full of proletarians and the guy sitting next to me watched the camera close in on Vivien Leight in her low-cut maroon dress in the birthday party scene mumbled: ""Dat's a good lookin' woman."" Gable, with his irony and pursed lips, is the heroic guy who shows up from time to time to rescue the heroine who is in crisis. McDaniel is the devoted darky who has no life of her own and lives only for her masters. De Havilland is ""pure in thought, word, and deed"" -- a phrase I quote either from Catechism or the Boy Scout Manual, I forget. No man would dream of dreaming of De Havilland's knees. Howard is the high-minded weakling, elegant and honest, that women pine for but are soon bored with. He's the guy who reminds women of their first husband.<br/><br/>I admired the way the film cleaned up the novel. The book, written by a 1920s Southern flapper like Zelda Fitzgerald, was loaded with N words -- and not just the words but the attitudes that they embody. I mean, in the entire movie, which is one hundred and forty-two hours long, the word ""slaves"" is mentioned only once, a bellwether, the Klan never mentioned at all. If you visit Beau Rivage or some other Southern plantation the bungalows that housed the slaves are called ""servants' quarters."" <br/><br/>You'll laugh, you'll applaud, you'll shiver with fear and excitement, and most of all you'll sob. This is a romance. There is about the same ratio of love story to adventure as there is in ""Pearl Harbor"", except that here there is no combat whatever and very little violence. And of course no CGIs. The Atlanta that burns down behind the escaping wagon driven by Gable is actually King Kong's gate.<br/><br/>In its lack of battle scenes it differs from ""Birth of a Nation"" but the heavies are the same. Carpetbaggers and chicken-eating black legislators and Yankees generally. Not to mention General Sherman, who marched through Georgia destroying artifacts, housing, railroads, and produce as he went. Sherman is still cursed as a butcher by some but it sometimes seems to me that his march from Corinth to Savannah wasn't a bad strategy if you want to win a war. You destroy the adversary's ability to wage war with a minimum of casualties. That was the intent of the USAAF's precision daylight bombing campaign in Europe in World War II.<br/><br/>Anyway, whatever its cost or quality, it can't be ignored. It's simply there, like the moon is there, or the Grand Canyon, or Stonehenge, or the Great Barrier Reef, or the African Rift, or human folly."
"jwardww","7","1","5","9 April 2009"," A foul wind...please recast Ashley!
","The production values are spectacular and many of the performances are excellent, but the central theme of a romantic triangle ultimately fails to convince. It isn't that Leslie Howard was a bad actor. He was a great Henry Higgins. He was simply not the right casting choice for Ashley Wilkes. Yes, he played Ashley as a moralizing weakling, which is how Mitchell wrote the character. But he could not create the charisma one needed to sympathize with Scarlet's feelings of loss. Had Howard been cast opposite someone like Miriam Hopkins as Scarlet O'Hara, he would have held his own well enough. But throughout the 3 plus hours of the movie as produced with Vivien Leigh in the title role, one is too mystified as to why someone so glamorous and sexual as Scarlet cares about this flat-liner. One can't even buy it with the explanation that she only wants what she can't have or she only wants someone who rejects her. It's not just because Howard comes across as a colossal closet case, who married Melanie only because no one would expect sexual ardor of him with such a woman. It's just that Vivian Leigh's Scarlet is so aware of her worth and radiance, one can't imagine her being enthralled by anyone so inferior as Ashley, someone who doesn't even stand up well in comparison to her other long-shot suitors, let alone to Rhett. This fatal casting flaw makes the movie a magnificent misfire. In a few years, with the advance of computer imaging technology and convincing vocal duplication, Gone With The Wind can at last be redone with the existing footage enhanced by a better casting choice for Ashley spliced in. There are two ideal actors from the period. Both are blonds and exceptionally virile, offering a much more convincing counterbalance to the machismo of Clark Gable. The first is Errol Flynn, who, had he been cast, would have played wimpy against type and beat Gable and Robert Donat that year for the Oscar. The Academy loves the fabulous playing unfabulous. The second choice would be Brian Aherne, like Flynn also breathtakingly handsome and able to play the character as written by Mitchell. Both casting choices would have made the viewer understand Scarlet's misguided attraction. You would totally comprehend how it is possible to look at such a man and imagine something that is not there in a way that simply is not possible with Leslie Howard in the role."
"PWNYCNY","10","1","5","12 August 2005"," One of the great movies.
","This is a great movie, the reason for that being the incredible performance by Vivian Leigh who succeeds in carrying this movie. Without Leigh's strong and dominating performance, the story would have come off as hokey and melodramatic. Essentially, the story revolves around one person: Scarlett O'Hara, a flighty, impetuous, high-spirited and manipulative young woman who is pursuing a fantasy, to marry a man who does not love her and never will, and who by his own admission is a failure. People come and go, situations change, war starts and ends, but she never changes. Yet she also has endearing qualities - she is brave, resourceful, loyal, and a leader. She also commands respect. She is not adverse to working hard and stays focused on completing tasks. She understands business and is cognizant of the major political issues of the day. Of all the characters in the movie, she is the most complex, even more so than Rhett Butler. The story is engaging because of those many qualities which put her at odds with the rest of the world, which in the movie tests her ability and willingness to survive. Hence, Scarlett is hardly the conventional hero usually associated with Hollywood cinema. She is caught up in circumstances beyond her control that block her desire to achieve happiness, but refuses to back down. Nothing keeps her down. She will have her way because she is Scarlet O'Hara, and if the rest of the world doesn't like it, to bad for them.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who plays Scarlett's protagonist, Rhett Butler, is almost tangible to the touch. Both bring a flair and intensity to their characters' tempestuous relationship. Scarlett and Rhett see through each others' pretentiousness, which attracts and repels them at the same time. Their respectability is a sham, and they both know it. Butler is not a gentleman and Scarlett is not a lady. However, both are highly intelligent, well educated, well informed, and capable of managing large business enterprises. This makes them not only lovers but competitors, which really spices up their relationship and heightens the intensity of their interactions. <br/><br/>Am I the only person who ever read the book, ""Gone With the Wind"" by Margaret Mitchell? Because I read the book - the ENTIRE book - and movie should not be confused with the book. The book is a about a brave and resourceful woman living in a time of momentous social change and determined to survive. Unlike in the movie, in the book the character Scarlett is strong and there is nothing about her that is shrill or infantile, but the movie transforms the character into someone that is almost childish. Now I understand that a lot has to be condensed into one movie, but after reading the book the movie seems superficial. Nevertheless the movie is entertaining and worth watching and offers performances that have become part of movie legend."

","Spoiler Alert!! Are you ready? Do you need another minute? Okay, I'll wait...<br/><br/>This movie sucks.<br/><br/>I see you weren't ready. Take your time, get back to me when you're okay...as I was saying this is a bad movie. How this film has been allowed to rise to a position of immortality in Hollywood alongside works like ""Casablanca"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a mystery to my pundit-like understanding of movies and their audiences.<br/><br/>I saw this movie for the first time after it was named the number three film of all time (Is it 3? I think so) by the AFI. I had heard the hype and was expecting a grand love story with a Civil War backdrop. Instead I got an eighteen hour soap opera with bad acting, bad writing and characters I wouldn't lift a finger to save if they were being mugged right next to me.<br/><br/>Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most well-known figures in American films and if you told that to an English person, they would say that they understood why. She is stuck up, self-absorbed, arrogant, whiney, spoiled rotten, unfeeling, conniving...hell, she married a guy to spite Clark Gable and doesn't even care when he dies!! Her inconsiderate juggling of the feelings of others is disguised by the filmmakers as charming befuddlement and/or coming of age. She's a bad person and I'm p***ed that she doesn't die in the end.<br/><br/>But I can forgive her. I can forgive the character, I can forgive the racially insensitive characterizations, I can forgive the fact that the Civil War was way the hell more important than these two losers...Here's why I will always hate this movie. They had a brilliant endline in ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" Imagine a movie that ends on that line. What a perfect ending! Put Scarlett in her place, a star like Gable could shine. And how do they end the movie? With Scarlett's responsibility-dodging catchphrase, ""I'll think about it tomorrow."" And the overly-sappy, doesn't-mean-anything-really ""For tomorrow...is another day!""<br/><br/>WHERE'S GENERAL SHERMAN WHEN WE NEED HIM?!?!?"

","The most overrated movie of all time. I have never understood what people see in this movie. Even an old crappy episode of Dallas is better than this. Granted, the production is top notch even till this day. But the movie is so silly and boring. Make no mistake about it though, I am a movie buff and love movies, but absolutely not this one.

","What we have here is the single highest grossing movie of all time (to hell with your TITANIC and your E.T., the figures are inaccurate because inflation is not accounted for). This thing is the triumph that haunted producer David O. Selznick until his death. It's extravagant, it's well made, it's a landmark, it's highly overrated. What we have here is three good directors slaving under a maniacal producer to film a stuffy book to his satisfaction. The film is praised for its romance and scale, but its true assets are the crew and Clark Gable, whose Rhet Butler charmed the pants off multiple generations of viewers. The picture is a testament to the worth of the studio system. The trouble is that it just isn't as great as people say it is. The story is far from being the best (although it would be a challenge to find a better romance-against-the-backdrop-of-war picture). There are mistakes, like a pregnancy that lasts too long. Parts of the film drag terribly, particularly Scarlet and Rhet's marital troubles. In spite of all its strengths, GONE WITH THE WIND cannot rise above its short-comings to be what people claim it is. This movie couldn't hold a candle to CITIZEN KANE, or even make the top ten (the AFI is dead wrong on this point). The movie should be seen, just don't expect the greatest movie ever."

","Why is it that anytime somebody doesn't like something anymore, its either they're anti-patriotic or over-patriotic? We can have opinions without such things coming into consideration, can't we? I saw this movie several years ago, before September 11th, and it bored the hell out of me. I'm sorry. I understand that its a classic, and I do believe that the cinematography was wonderful and the use of color, but it just can't hold my attention. Maybe I'm just a product of the times we live in. I'd like to think that I can enjoy a movie that isn't an in-your-face, forty cuts a second, lets get to the action kind of flick, but I don't think that's the issue here. It drags on forever! I don't like the main character! Not to mention some of the racist undertones. I think its lost its appeal. It will always be a classic, but that doesn't mean that most people are going to enjoy it."
"Rutajit","Null","1","5","29 June 2003"," Great for 1939, Ordinary otherwise
","This movie was number 4 on the AFI's 100 greatest American movies of all time list. Makes you wonder if the AFI even understands movies. I guess film making has come a long way since 1939 but even then this movie is not worth a place in the top 10. Fantastic production values for a 1939 film, everything else about it though is not worthy of any of the hype that's been created around it.<br/><br/>Incredible cinematography and some really awesome sets are the only things that are appealing about it. How much the mechanics of movie making have changed over the years is apparent by the fact that the movie is projected as a David Selznick production. The director is pushed to the sideline and so is everyone else. Vivien Leigh is loud, uncomfortable and clearly an ordinary actress. An Oscar for this????? I guess the academy voters were as easily swayed by hype as their more modern counterparts. A best supporting actress award for Hattie Mcdaniel??? What were they even thinking? I guess they had to give an Oscar to an African American in a movie about the Civil War. If at all there is something in this movie worth watching, it is Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes. How unfortunate that her role is so badly built and so much of the book is not there. Here was an actress much ahead of her times. She is very balanced and very subtle. Everything else in this movie is loud, garish and so unreal.<br/><br/>Clark Gable is good in parts but has, like in the book, too little to do. His awesome screen presence though gives you an idea of why he was such a huge star. This movie is from start to finish a Vivien Leigh movie and to me she is completely unconvincing in the role. The constant arching of her eyebrows I guess was supposed to depict the manipulative nature of Scarlett but all that it does is irritate you. Her dialogue delivery seems forced and it is obvious she is more of a stage actress given to voicing long dialogues than an actress who understands film making. And like Margaret Mitchell says in the book, she is not beautiful but you will not realize it.<br/><br/>
If this movie is number 4 then Titanic should have been number 1.<br/><br/>Watch the movie for its grandeur in the context of when it was made. If you look for, like I did, quality film making, you will be disappointed."
"Kirasjeri","7","1","5","20 September 1999"," A ""Woman's Picture"" and a Dated Curio
","We know that much of GWTW was great: sets; performances; music; the epic scope; etc. But I will not say the plot was a standout, and here's why.<br/><br/>After the war was over, GWTW devolved into a tedious over-drawn soap; I really squirmed with some of those scenes in the mansion. It had been a ""woman's picture"" all along, and the last half of the movie was really a drag. Besides that, the appeal of Scarlett for Ashley - and Rhett for Scarlett - has long been a mystery to me. Scarlett herself was a conniving, selfish, self-centered, manipulative little witch with no discernible redeeming values. And Melanie and Ashley were bores, while Rhett was a smug egomaniac. No, I did not like the characters! Hattie McDaniel's ""Mammy"" did deserve the Oscar she got, though.<br/><br/>Besides the problems with the plot, ""GWTW"" is historically a tired old curio rife with distortions, although nowhere near as bad as the vicious ""Birth of a Nation"". The stereotypical scenes were all there: the ""happy darkies"" so pleased to be slaves; the malicious ""Yankee overlord""; the ""evil Carpetbaggers"" after the war; the ""poor oppresed South"" during Reconstruction; and so on. It was all a lie. The slaves were not happy to be slaves; the overlords were either Southerners or often slaves themselves; and Reconstruction was too easy on the racist South with it's Ku Klux Klan and other white racist gangs working to restore the status quo ante-bellum by terrorism.<br/><br/>If you like women's movies and know the History presented is nonsense, you can surely enjoy the grandeur of ""GWTW"" and the great performances of its huge stars."

Although I hate to admit it, this was a great movie for me to watch. The way Scarlett O'Hara acts is provoking to those even today, and the character of Rhett Butler is so charming, it kills me that Scarlett could'nt see how much he loved her. This is one of the most romantic movies of all time, and an utter classic that will live on in film forever. It still amazes me that in 1939, a film of this magnitude could be made.

I was not impressed with Vivien Leigh's performance even though Hollywood awarded her an Oscar. I know that this film has received many and varied reviews.

","After seeing this movie I could not figure out why everyone always talks about how great it is? Later, I read the book, and found it a lot better, and it also cleared up a few things. Because it was made in the dawn of time it had to be sanitized--they can't even say the word ""miscarriage"". Scarlet seems to whine a lot more than in the book as well. And she doesn't look anywhere near 16. And the ending is stupid. Read the book. OK."
"simonm-17313","4","1","6","25 December 2019"," Technical strengths but the plot loses its way in the second half.
","I don't really feel the need to spell out the issues around portrayal of slavery and romanticising the South. To the 2019 viewer, it's pretty evident and besides other reviewers already have. In spite of these issues I do take the point that great art can be appreciated while acknowledging the 'of its time/culture' mentality, uncomfortable though it may be.<br/><br/>And in several ways this is great art - in terms of cinematography and ambition it is way ahead of its time and should be admired for this. But sadly the narrative is such a fatal flaw that in spite of all that was beautifully made about this film I couldn't enjoy it. For the first half, we have a love story with the historical backdrop of the war. Scarlett goes through war and poverty, and at one point it looks like she's going to emerge with some character development as you'd expect. But then a series of bizzare narrative choices (that span something like two hours) later she seems to have learnt very little, and when the denouement finally comes and she realises her errors we had been put torturously through them for so long that the foregone conclusion loses any impact. Meanwhile the post-war repercussions were abruptly dropped to focus on the soap opera; the impact of one character's death is completely lost as it's followed immediately by another; the traumatic implication of Scarlett's marital rape is inexplicably followed by her waking up beaming with no explanation, etc. With a better - and more concise - script this could have been the masterpiece it's supposed to be but it ended up a bit of a disjointed mess.<br/><br/>Normally being on the opposite side of received wisdom about a classic I'd be willing to give it a second viewing, but at this run time? No thanks. Will leave others to enjoy it, but when they point to its great 'storytelling' as well as production values I'll be a bit mystified."
"Wuchakk","6","1","6","25 June 2017"," Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy and Tara
","Released in 1939 and directed by Victor Fleming, ""Gone with the Wind"" chronicles events at a Georgia plantation and points nearby before, during and after the Civil War. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable star as Scarlett and Rhett while Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard play Melanie and Ashley. Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen appear as Mammy and Prissy.<br/><br/>This is certainly an iconic movie and obviously spectacular in its day, but it was outdone by the same production team seven years later with ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946), which is just an all-around superior movie and holds up better all these decades later. Some people wrongly diss ""Gone with the Wind"" for depicting plantation life and the requisite slavery, not to mention portraying it in a relatively neutral light, but this institution was a fact-of-life in the Deep South at the time and, believe it or not, not all slave owners were inhuman monsters dripping with evil.<br/><br/>The opening act is weak with its hokey writing/acting. I half expected the peripheral cast to break out in choreographed song & dance at any moment. Once you get used to the quaint vibe, however, the story pretty much takes you in and really perks up with the burning of Atlanta. Unfortunately, Scarlett is a weak protagonist. She's selfish, neurotic and annoying despite her physical beauty. In the second half, just when you think she's redeemable, you find out you're wrong. Rhett isn't much better, but at least he has that charismatic gleam. Actually, I'm kinda impressed that they used these two as the protagonists because they're definitely antiheroes long before the antihero came into vogue. Melanie and Ashley are the true heroes of the movie, particularly the former.<br/><br/>Another problem is that, except for establishing shots (in Arkansas and Georgia), the movie was filmed in Southern California, including the outdoor sequences, and it's too obvious. An additional issue is that the last 45 minutes are generally weak for several reasons and the story just goes on & on when it seriously needed to wrap up. And then there's the hilariously delivered final line by Scarlett. Still, the movie's iconic and there's enough good here to make it worth checking out, as long as you can handle old-fashioned melodrama.<br/><br/>For a more realistic depiction of the Plantation Era, albeit on a TV budget, check out 1980's ""Beulah Land,"" which was shot on an actual plantation and points nearby in Natchez, Mississippi.<br/><br/>The film runs 335 minutes (5 minutes shy of 4 hours).<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"
"JoeKarlosi","6","1","6","24 May 2005"," Gone With the Wind (1939) **1/2
","(!Spoilers!)<br/><br/>I finally got around to dedicating four hours to this celebrated film, and while I had to admire its radiant Techincolor cinematography, strong characterizations and magnificent musical score (thank you, Max Steiner), I could not savor much of the actual movie itself. Therefore, I consider GONE WITH THE WIND way overrated in the rankings of all time ""best"" films. While it's very appealing on a technical level, it struck me as an ordinary soap opera dressed in vibrant garnish. It's an ugly, gloomy movie that's all prettied up with fancy decoration. If not for this lavish treatment, this would not be anywhere near as praised as it is today.<br/><br/>This is one of the long epics that really feels like it, and the meandering love story could have been told in half the time. The first side of the picture is mostly drawn out exposition, and it isn't really until the second half that WIND kicks into higher gear and finds its stride. As I said from the top, one positive is that all the characterizations are quite potent, and that goes double for Academy-Award winning Vivien Leigh, who succeeded continuously in making me despise her as Scarlett O'Hara, a hateful and abusive witch that makes you wonder why anyone would want to spend these four hours with her, never mind a lifetime (as clueless Rhett Butler so desperately wants to do). Scarlett is so mean and self-centered that I couldn't have cared less what happened to her (and I really wanted something to happen to her). I suppose that's part of the idea - but I can't get four hours of entertainment out of that unless O'Hara is actually Baby Jane or Lizzie Borden. How are we supposed to sympathize with her plight?<br/><br/>What does Scarlett see in geeky Ashley Wilkes? More importantly, what does Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) see in HER? Oh, right, I forgot - she's feisty, strong, says what's on her mind, etc. -- but it should have been quite clear to Butler that a marriage with this user could never work. And when they finally do tie the knot (after she's been married twice already to men she cared even less about than Rhett! HELL-LO!) it turns out that Butler finally sees he made a mistake. Well, maybe not -- because one minute he wants a divorce, the next minute he's hoping they can work things out, then it's back to divorce, then a pregnancy lights up his eyes again. Back and forth, back and forth, two and a half hours, three hours -- and finally, like me, he decides he just doesn't give a damn. Well, duh! <br/><br/>So Rhett rejects Scarlett. Their little girl dies. Goodbye Ashley Wilkes. Lovable Melly bites the dust too. But at least there's always tomorrow, and Scarlett still has her old land and another chance for Rhett. Ugh. While dramatically well rendered, it's all so sullen for this kind of a movie.<br/><br/>I still give GONE WITH THE WIND a rating of **1/2 (""Fair""), because it's certainly at least that - and especially taking into account its great cinematic strengths. When I think of this film, I keep hearing that marvelous, grandiose main title theme, and I keep seeing the beautiful orange sky with Leigh as a silhouette in the night swearing she'll never be hungry again. I see impressive camera shots, like the tracking sweep where Scarlett walks among row after row of fallen war-worn bodies. The only way I could use the word ""classic"" in good faith is to say this film is a classic case of style over substance."

","I expected Gone with the Wind to be nostalgic of the South and probably racist, but I was looking to like it anyway, attempting to keep it in historical perspective and judge it as a movie.  I failed.  Nostalgia is fine, racism can potentially be overlooked; I did NOT expect this movie to be blatantly pro-slavery.  Liking this movie is like liking an East German propaganda film from the 1960s, and to be perfectly honest, I don't understand why this film isn't dismissed as simply a KKK propaganda film in the same way ""Birth of a Nation"" is.<br/><br/>Overlooking the politics, this movie continued to make me angry.  My plot summary would be something like: a narcissistic, vain, manipulative woman whines her way through hardship before finding success in exploiting other people, then finally getting hers in the end.  Vivian Leigh just reminded me of too many ex-girlfriends of mine and the lessons of the movie I felt were wretched (maybe I'm just not enough of a capitalist, but I generally don't have a positive view of professional widows or other people who feed on the misery of others).<br/><br/>The one thing I do readily agree with is that this movie is fantastically filmed, considering the time period and that the whole thing was shot in California, and I'll never forget that painful scene with the veterans in Atlanta.  But I simply can't get past this movie's wretched political and moral beliefs enough to think of it without feeling anger rise in me."

","Gone with the Wind the greatest? Please. Scarlett O'Hara was a simpering white girl who we are supposed to feel bad for.

From its mendacious opening scroll to Rhett Butler's final words about Damnation, GONE WITH THE WIND (as well as Margaret Mitchell's poorly-written source material) perpetuates and celebrates the most Evil BIG LIE in all of American History. If Leni Riefenstahl were alive today to make a sequel to her star-making vehicle for Adolph Hitler (TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, an equally over-rated Propaganda Piece that came out within a few months of GWTW's Grand Premiere), and IF Der Fuhrer were alive and kicking (and able to rant in semi-coherent English), Hitler could easily co-opt the supporters of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin's White House Sock Puppet Don Juan Rump in a New York Minute. Such is the power of Big Money Cinema, even when this sinful enema is flushing out the most vile excrement imaginable, such as TRIUMPH OF THE WILL or GONE WITH THE WIND. It is ILLEGAL even Today for Germans to own a copy of Ms. Riefenstahl's Satanic TRIUMPH, and the U.S. Government MUST take similar action against GWTW immediately! How many Heather Heyers must die before this KKK recruiting tool is eradicated?!<br/><br/>When Kiddie Porn was outlawed, there was no ""Grandfather Clause"" to allow perverts to retain the smut that they had legally purchased in the 1950s for ""Old Time's Sake"" or ""to Preserve Film History."" (You can still Google stories about Oklahoma State Troopers seizing Blockbuster VHS tape rental records so that they could kick in the doors of folks who'd just rented the PG-13 movie version of Gunther Grass's coming-of-age novel, THE TIN DRUM.) Also, ISIS beheading Youtubes now can be found only on the Dark Web--NOT in public Art House Film Festival Revivals or in University Film Appreciation Classes aimed at Impressionable Youth. America MUST follow Germany's lead Vis a Vis Nazi paraphernalia in regard to GWTW. ALL copies of this Demonic Fake Facts Racist Screed MUST be incinerated ASAP, along with ALL the Rhett and Scarlett dolls, GWTW posters and lobby cards, Grand Premiere newsreel footage, and so forth. This should be VERY easy to do--all the GWTW offal added together amounts to less than 1% of the Kiddie Porn already stamped out by our Brave FBI Agents.

","As a piece of cinema this is a deeply engaging film. The colors, art direction and Fleming's technical composition and staging craft a film that has a storybook and deeply romantic quality. You get lost in the images as you are you get swept up in the storytelling. Each episode of the film has a unique feel to it and there's a ton of artful touches throughout. I especially liked the shadow work in the hospital and birth sequences. It certainly captures the genteel world of the Old South in rose colored glasses.<br/><br/>Likewise, the story of a head strong amorous woman doing her best to survive and thrive is deeply engaging and in some ways very forward looking for time. The messed up relationship between Scarlet and Rhett that is the heart of this film is still fascinating, complex and all to human. It grounds the epic actions in a intimate relationship. It helps that Leigh and Gable are at the top of their form along with technical aspects of the film. It is a long movie but story and characters are always vivid and alive.<br/><br/>Yet for all that this film is white supremacist to its core. It glorifies and bemoans the destruction of the Confederacy that was fighting for the preservation of slavery. It equates white prisoner's exploitation unfavorable to the chattel slavery of black people. It is insidiously pro-Jim Crow and Pro-KKK. (Through weirdly it whitewashes the hate group as a ""political meeting."")<br/><br/> This is duel characteristic of the film, well crafted ugliness, is most apparent in the character of Mammy. She is given agency and dignity by the screenplay; there is no ill treatment of her directly and more to the point Scarlett and Rhett both seek and follow her advice (abet in minor ways). And in McDaniel's hands the character is vividly fleshed out and very real. (She did the Oscar after all). And yet Mammy is a gross racial stereotype, she is still a slave and she is still not treated as an equal human being to the white characters. <br/><br/>This film is messed up. It should not be classic."

","I began watching this film in 1956. It was a nice day and I thought I'd slump down on my old, dilapidated leather couch and watch a movie. Little did I know, the couch would quickly become more dilapidated than it ever had been. After the first two hours, I was enjoying myself, only stopping twice to crack one out to an glourious technicolour image of Clark Gable... ehum.. I mean Vivien Leigh. I was happy back then, but now I am just a shadow of my former self. A withering, smelly shadow.<br/><br/>A year passed before the first seizure. I lock every door in my house before watching any film to get that real cinema feel of urgently wanting to go and pee but the rules of etiquette not allowing me. I usually love the feeling of isolation it creates but not today... no-one came for me today. I convulsed for what felt like hours. I couldn't feel my arms but luckily my egg like figure allowed me to roll on to my stomach my mouth aloft perhaps six inches from the ground. This meant that I didn't choke on my own saliva but now I realise that perhaps that would have been the right move.<br/><br/>After a decade, I began to eat myself. My fat reserves had been completely depleted for use concentrating on this marvel of cinema. The process of self-consumption was easy at first but became progressing hard. Eating your feet is easy if you have the stomach for it and believe me I did but gnawing your erm... how you say... Mr. Bojangles is much difficult. in hindsight it was obvious that I had to eat my ribs first then my sausage. That challenge pales in comparison to the real difficulty though. I had wiled away the years eating my various body parts. I had eaten my legs, arms, stomach and chest and all that was left of me was my head. This is the hard part. After a moment's thought I knew what I had to do. I unhinged my jaw and spun it backward, consuming my own head like a dying Pacman.

It's maximum effort and art and craft and production ingenuity in service of a story where the character doesn't grow (or, if she does, it's a fake and she goes back to being the spoiled 'fiddle-dee-dee' brat of the world) and seriously lags in the 2nd half until a lot of people start dying and/or get hurt.<br/><br/>Oh, and the ""I'll never go hungry again!"" bit makes no sense."

","Okay, so GWTW is considered to be the greatest film of all time with the largest audience of any film ever made, blah, blah, blah. But let's get real folks and look at GWTW in modern terms and face a few facts. First of all, and most important, is the story and what a story it is. It's like a civil war version of any soap on television. The story is simply not original. Scarlett O'Hara, the heroine - if she can be called that - is utterly loathsome. I mean she does not have one single redeeming trait. She's the classic woman you love to hate - the kind of woman Joan Crawford cut her eye teeth on and Joan Collins elevated to a high state of hysteria. Please! But there is so much that is absolutely annoying about the film aside from the fact all you want to do with Scarlett is put her over your knee and give her a well-deserved spanking. Of course these days you can't possibly do such a thing - you would be charged with felony assault and locked up in the local slammer for a year! But I digress. The music about drove me up the wall. If I had to listen to the GWTW theme one would time I would be running into the sunset never to look back. Clark Gable of course is superb - but then he's always superb. But look at what he went through to give the performance he did? The original director, George Cukor, bothered Gable so much that the actor had the director fired. By the time Victor Fleming came aboard he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown having just completed The Wizard of Oz - in fact Fleming did have a nervous breakdown when GWTW was completed. But the real problems with the film lay squarely in David Selznick's lap. His obsessive dedication to the novel show in every scene which are over blown and over the top every time. The story is not that big but Selznick has turned it into a story of Biblical proportions and in the process simply turned the film into something grotesque and horrible."
"apuluvmanjula","5","1","13","16 August 2001"," Why I DON'T like this film...
","It's not because of the production value.  It is by far one of the most beautiful looking films ever made.  The scenery is breathtaking and the sets phenomenal.  It's almost hard to believe that such a vast film was made in 1939.  When you live in a time with larger than life films being made on a regular basis with life-like CGI effects, a film that uses plain old ordinary sets and back lots really amazes you.<br/><br/>But a movie should be more than just production value.  Hence the reason why I found this nearly four-hour movie to be extremely boring and not worthy of my time.  Actually, the only true reason I practically despise this fabulously made film is the main character.  Scarlet O'Hara is the quintessential (word I cannot use on this website).  If I had to hear her say ""fiddle-dee-dee"" one more time, I was going to scream.  Actually, she didn't say it all that much, but every single line she uttered was either a whine or a plea for pity.  And this was in EVERY SCENE OF THE FILM!!!!  It seems that I'm supposed to admire her constant, melodramatic pleas for her one and only true love, Ashley.  Who cares that she married three men for no reason but to make the guy jealous (which by the way, did not work).  Who cares that the only marriage that lasts somewhat is the one to Rhett in the last hour of the film where it gets so sappy and tedious that I almost felt like falling asleep.  Now that could be because the film has been copied so much that having seen the rip-offs before watching the film itself ruined it for me.  And maybe I'm being to hard on Scarlet and her very tumultuous life as that is the entire point of the epic picture.  ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" simply wouldn't exist if Scarlet O'Hara wasn't the character she was.  But when you hate the main character so much, that really tends to make the whole film seem really bad.<br/><br/>I will recommend this film, though, as it is--like maybe Rob Reiner would say, an essential--because the film represents what all epic films should be.  I just wish Scarlet O'Hara had been a much more lovable character rather than the whiny, melodramatic ham I perceived her to be."

"SAMTHEBESTEST","7","0","1","23 April 2020"," 'She was a fool' but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it..
","Brief Review :-<br/><br/>Watched Gone With The Wind (1939) :<br/><br/>She was a fool but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it. Well, i remember watching this film in parts in childhood days when I had no sense of movie reviews. But in last 10 years I realise how legendary this film was and I wanted to watch it in a 'Single Viewing' and somehow I couldn't manage that due to its 4 hours long run time. Today during the lockdown i finally got to see it in 'One Take' so that i can review it properly. I guess I have said so much in the first sentence itself. I always wonder that why the most watched film of the industry never makes it to the Rank 1 in Best Films List well, there are surely reasons for it. Those films where legendary blockbusters in that time because it appealed to that particular audience of that era but it doesn't mean the film will have timeless magic. Fortunately you see most of the Top Rated films of all time are not legendary blockbusters but, as Feature Films they are much Greater than Huge Commercial blockbusters. I would like to add 'Gone With The Wind' in that list. It may be the Legendary and miraculous film of it's time and there is no denying to that but how does it stand today? Recently, I have seen several timeless Hollywood classics which came before GWTW and even today i found them Greatest of all time and not Just of their times. GWTW has a grand scale, so many conflicts but somehow those so many conflicts aren't enough to make a one Best scenario out of it. I was expecting a Clark Gable's show since i have loved him in several classics films before GWTW but in the this film it was moreover Vivien Leigh's show. The entite narrative is about her and she certainly did a great job. Clark Gable got the enough boost in second half of the film and i liked the way his character ended. I felt like, 'Those days when Men used to be like Men' and 'Women used to be like Women'. The latter part is fully justified by Olivia De Havilland's character but not by amateur and fool character of Scarlett. A story of a manipulative woman who is love with a married man who doesn't love her and the woman doesn't understand the man who man truly loves her, ain't a great stuff. That one thing hurt me more than anything else. When the centre character of the film doesn't seems to be making a sense then i just couldn't help myself. It took her so many years in the film and 4 hours of the runtime to realise that 'she was a fool' and audience realised it in first 10 minutes. If there had been something intellectual or even sacrificing stuff at the end, i would have still loved it more than now. I would definitely love to praise the director Victor Fleming for such a Big and intense film. The production value, dialogues, presentation of the War period, costumes of big cast all these deserves admiration even after 81 years of it's release. No one can take away their credit and Oscars honoured them all. Now coming to the most important point what's there so much in the film for my generation when we have seen so advanced, so complex and almost all kind of films by now then i am afraid i couldn't recommend if you're looking something extraordinary. One should watch it to relive the Legendary Blockbuster all time but you cannot expect the Best film of all time because we got some high time Cult Classics for that. A film with almost 40 crores Footfalls cannot be called Overlong or boring or useless feature film but yes it is Overlong for my generation at least and not boring surely. Nevertheless, this wasn't a problem in 40s and 50s decades that i am sure about. On my personal thoughts, Gone With The Wind could have been a better film and i wouldn't have minded if it had not been such a big commercial success. There would be some people who agree with me and surely there would be some bashing me but i think they shouldn't bother because this review doesn't really matter after 81 years.<br/><br/>Rating- 7/10*"

","On the eve of the American Civil War in 1861, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation in Georgia, with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that Ashley Wilkes-whom she secretly loves-is to be married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation Twelve Oaks.
At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, Rhett Butler, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of pneumonia and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas furlough, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a scalawag from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by Reconstructionists, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancÃ©, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a miscarriage. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love."

Nowadays, it's little more than a soap opera. I would only highlight 3 items that made for me the film:<br/><br/>1) The character of Mammy. Her sayings, interventions, struggle amongst her little girl (V. Leigh) and the constant commotion.<br/><br/>2) The great shot which shows us hundreds of southern wounded soldiers laying on the ground while the camera gently sweeps<br/><br/>3) The perfect ending: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" - fades away"
"shianne490","7","0","1","29 January 2015"," My personal opinion of the movie
","Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. Then first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, spins its wheels frequently. Theatrically, Gone with the Wind is an entirely different experience from its small-screen counterpart; some of the second-half narrative tedium is effaced by the glorious visuals. With a restored three- strip. Gone with the Wind has one of the best-known story lines of any film. Is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the spoiled, manipulative daughter of an Irish immigrant plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell). Scarlett has two sisters, but she is by far the most spirited of the three O'Hara girls, and her father, seeing her as his successor, teaches her lessons about the importance of the land. Scarlett is secretly in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is about to marry the gentle, demure Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland). When Scarlett confesses her love to Ashley, he admits his feelings for her, but notes that Melanie will make a much better wife. Immediately after this meeting, Scarlett has her first encounter with the irrepressible Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the cynical, smart hero who eventually falls in love with her. They are two headstrong likes who simultaneously repel and attract one another. Ultimately, when Rhett has finally had enough, he walks out of her life to her plaintive query about what she's supposed to do without him. The pre-intermission portion of Gone with the Wind, which runs about 115 minutes, is glorious from both a visual and an emotional standpoint. It's a grand tale of love and loss in the midst of this country's most bitter war. Most importantly, it shows Scarlett's development from a vain, spoiled brat into a hardened, determined young woman. Her relationship with Rhett is there, but kept carefully in the background. There is sadness, humor, and a number of breathtaking shots of Scarlett silhouetted against a reddish sunset. Gone with the Wind stands as a romantic monument to the Old South -- an homage to an era and a lifestyle long gone. To date, no film has sold more box-office tickets than Gone with the Wind. Domestically, the tally almost doubles that for the phenomenally-popular Titanic. Of course, when the movie was first released, it wasn't just another motion picture -- it was a spectacle, an event. Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades. Gone with the Wind has flaws, but it's still undeniably a classic and a legend."

","Gone with the Wind is a good film. Outdated, but it's good. Being said, everything on it seems necessary for the whole experience. Not the best or most entertaining three hours long-plus film I've watched, since that it varies from extremely good to very bad and melodramatic moments. Very inconsistent, but again, mostly good. And it's impossible to not consider how well made and big this film is, and then consider the age it was done(1939!). It basically did open the doors for the other successful 'epic' films that would come, due to it thunderous success(a film that big in 1939 would obviously make success).<br/><br/>What most surprised me was the dark tone of the film, I am certainly it bothered some prudes in the age. Treason and tragedies makes it looks like the film in the poster, which clearly suggests that it's a dull romance film. It does a good work picturing the horrors of war and how it changes people, mostly for bad. There is about a hour and a half passing through the war.<br/><br/>The cinematography is nothing less than excellent, but outdated, since that some angles aren't even used anymore. The special effects and the non-stop soundtrack bothered me as well,but not as much as the stage- like exaggerated acting, which was common in the 30s I suppose, but for now it's pretty ridiculous and outdated.<br/><br/>Well, I haven't much more to say about this film. If you are facing nothing to do so this film will fits well for you. Though if you are bored and wants something dynamic don't even try this film. It's length is the worst part about this film, even more for an audience that can't stand films that are slowly paced than The Avengers(2012) nowadays. But I'm sure that most film lovers really like this film, so if you want something mainstream but totally out of the parameters, check it out. 8.3/10"

","Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up.<br/><br/>*****S P O I L E R S***** <br/><br/>The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time.<br/><br/>Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed.<br/><br/>She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage.<br/><br/>Then they each get their famous final lines: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam.""

","Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy plantation owner in Georgia in the 1860's. Sought after by every eligible bachelor in the state, her world is about to turn upside down as the one man she loves marries someone else and civil war with the North threatens to destroy everything she holds dear.<br/><br/>Gone With The Wind is a must-see film for all cinema fans, if only because it epitomises everything Hollywood has always represented - opulence, glamour, spectacle, excitement and star power. Some think it's one of the greatest movies ever made, whilst others view it as mawkish overblown melodrama; in my view it's a bit of both - it has some faults and is way too long but is so beautiful to watch that it allows the patient viewer to be totally consumed and immersed in the period visuals. It's also important to remember what a gamble the movie was for producer David Selznick; it was the third most expensive film ever made at the time, had a relatively unknown actress in the lead, was more than twice the length of most pictures and was one of only a handful of American films made in colour. But the gamble paid off spectacularly, with the movie winning ten Oscars, going on to make a hundred times its huge budget at the box office and earning a place amongst the most influential films in cinema history. I'm not really a fan of either historical epics or love stories but in spite of this I really like the film, for two main reasons I think - the photography and the cast. The cameraman was Ernest Haller and for me he really brings the movie alive; the early Technicolor images are rich in reds, browns and blacks and the Southern iconography and the unbridled passion of the story come to the fore through his camera-work. The plot is really four episodes - Scarlett as the spoilt ingenue, the war, the return to Tara, and Scarlett and Rhett's doomed marriage - and Haller carefully adapts the style to suit each section, giving the big emotional highs a grand sweep and splendour whilst also picking out beautiful details, like the tears in the eyes of the young piper boy. If nothing else, the famous crane shot at the Atlanta rail depot as Scarlett searches for the doctor is worth watching the whole movie for and one of the most profound depictions of war in all cinema. Equally marvellous are the actors - everybody is terrific but Leigh and Gable are perhaps the most iconic of all screen lovers, DeHavilland (who is still alive at this time of writing) is superb and McDaniel is outstanding as the amazing Mammy and deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal (shamefully the only black person to do so until 1963). It's all great rip-roaring stuff, but there are some things that weaken it I think, the most obvious being the classic problem with epic tales in that it just kind of winds down. Rhett's last line is justifiably very famous, but all the good stuff happens in the first half. As Scarlett settles back into a life of ease the movie becomes a series of crying jags as characters get killed off arbitrarily or the wedded couple have another barney and throw some crockery around. It's maybe not fair to complain about the excessive running time of a movie where everything else is excessive as well, but, like Scarlett, it does go on a bit. Also, and I suspect this is a male thing, but what do any of the female characters find attractive about Ashley - the man is the biggest wet blanket in any movie. In some ways, the making of Gone With The Wind is as much of a fairy tale as the story itself - the casting stories are legendary, George Cukor was fired as the director after a few weeks, screenwriter Sidney Howard died in a farm accident four months before it was released, the use of a Novachord in Max Steiner's intermission score is the first synthesiser music in film, etc, and have been the subject of numerous books and documentaries. Put simply, it's a movie you have to see. Featuring astonishing production design by the talented William Cameron Menzies (Invaders From Mars) and adapted from Margaret Mitchell's much beloved and Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 novel."

","""Gone With the Wind"" is a beautiful romance film, directed by David Selznick. It is an amazing film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's immortal novel. ""Gone With the Wind"" is film epic describing the events of the Civil War and subsequent years. The film based on the history of the beautiful, selfless love, confrontation between two lovers, who don't want to sacrifice their pride and open up their feelings to each other. The main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett was played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett by Clark Gable, Ashley by Leslie Howard, and Melanie by Olivia de Havilland. Scarlett is in love with Ashley since childhood, she loves him devotedly and selflessly. She saves Melanie (Ashley's wife) and her son, cares for them, in spite of her own feelings. Scarlett builds her life against all customs and traditions. The values formed since childhoods are transformed into new. She understands it's impossible to return old world with old ideals and values, but it's possible to build a new life. Scarlett pursue the dream of Ashley, unaware that her happiness is very close. Rhett Butler is a man with scandalous reputation. He loves Scarlett, but disguises his feelings, because he was afraid to be rejected. Rhett is a representative of the new era, he sees the sough is doomed, watching the collapse of the old world, but he doesn't build any illusions and believes in new life. This film is well worth seeing. There are a lot of memorable moments: farewell of Rhett and Scarlett on the eve of the collapse of Atlanta, hospital, Rhett's proposal, the death of Melanie and Bony, an open end. Film is striking: breads of depicted life, a beautiful love story, wonderful pictures of nature, pathetic music, and unforgettable end!!! This is a very exciting film. The acting is above all praise! ""Gone With the Wind"" is the most magnificent picture ever!"

","Gone with the wind was made in 1939, the first full color epic at about four hours in length. Hollywood had begun to take over the American landscape and gwtw has remained the standard for over 70 years, quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Clarke Gable was already a big star at the time and his portrayal of Rhett Butler is dead on as is the temperamental Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled, petulant southern girl at Tara, a monumental Civil War plantation in Atlanta. As the bloody confrontation grows more and more ominous for the rebels, a love story unfolds between Rhett and Scarlett.<br/><br/>Slavery is also one of the themes addressed, and, in fact Hattie McDaniel was the first black actress to win an Academy Award for her role as Hattie, Scarlett's housemaid. Gwtw will always be a vital part of historical American cinema."
"mikegordan","8","0","1","9 March 2012"," Overrated, but still worth watching
","Before I begin, I would like to dedicate this review to my Uncle Mark, who had unexpectedly died 2 days ago. Last Sunday, he seemed totally fine, and, having never seen this movie, I asked if he could let me borrow it for a little while. That was the last time I've ever spent any time with him, and I would like to dedicate this review to him, for without his permission, I wouldn't be able to continue on with the Best Picture retrospective.<br/><br/>Now with that out of the way, yeah, up until today, I was pretty much the only person to have never seen Gone with the Wind. And for the longest time, I was curious because from a lot of circles, this was frequently regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. And even so, there were some circles (not all of them Wizard of Oz fans either) that considered it grotesquely overrated, and listed their reasons as such. So, I finally sat down, and watched both discs on my PS2...<br/><br/>...and I thought it was good. Not great, not terrible, not even meh. Just good.<br/><br/>I guess I should start with the production values, because those were the main reasons why it was such a huge success at the Oscars. One of the earliest films shot entirely in Technicolor, and it puts a heavy emphasis on twilight or scarlet-related colors (yeah, I'll get to her, later), and it still looks incredible. Seeing as how many of the earliest Technicolor marvels like Wizard of Oz or The Adventures of Robin Hood had very lavish and gawdy-looking colors that almost made them resemble cartoons, I'm at least content that the color hues weren't so bright and colorful, but instead were dark and foreboding. Still holds up, even today. Granted, the musical score is a little manipulative and overly sentimental, it's still fairly memorable as well. If you need only one reason to watch this movie, watch it for the production values, because you will have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>But what about the substance itself? The writing and acting? Well, let's be honest; even on the off chance that somebody else out there hasn't seen this movie either, or read the book (wich I haven't), I think it's a fair assumption that just about everybody knows the story and the characters, so I won't bore you with all the needless details. The acting though, while very good, I felt was too good for Vivien Leigh, who played Scarlett O'Hara. I can at least see how, in the book, her character was supposed to grow and be able to take care of herself, and I can even understand that that doesn't automatically mean that she stops being spoiled and selfish, but geez, she's borderline diabolical. Every shot where she tries to run away from the cold, harsh, truths of life such as death, she always comes off as the most uncaring and malicious of creatures. She makes Bella from Twilight look like a Saint for crying out loud. She was not a good person at all, and while he was wrong to marry her in the first place, Rhett Butler (played by the always charismatic Clark Gable) was right to leave her at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The real reason why I consider this movie overrated is the length. Almost 4 hours long, it is arguably (alongside 2 others) the longest film to ever won Best Picture. The problem I have with it isn't the pacing per Se, but that the 2 discs felt almost like 2 different movies. If anything, I felt this should have been split up into 2 different pictures because of how drastically different the 2 halves are. The first half deals with the South's experiences during the Civil War but constantly through the personal point of view of Miss Scarlett. The second half deals with the O'Hara family making it through the hard times as well as their returning fortunes and their fall from grace. And believe it or not, the 2 halves only have 1 thing in common with one another; it deals with the fading away of long- established traditions, families and cultures.<br/><br/>And while the similarity in themes are present, the halves are still jarringly different from one another that it begs the question as to why this was made as one movie in the first place. It almost feels like Disney's merging of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass into a single animated feature...which did happen, by the way. This is especially because the ending of the 1st half looked like a great place to end the picture, but that was just the end of disc 1. Disc 2 just feels like forever, and so much more trimming could have been done. Not to mention that every time I saw Scarlett run over to Ashley or so much as mentions Ashley, I wanted to strangle that woman. Aside from Butler's decision to marry her, which confounds me immensely as to why he'd do it in the first place, I had nothing more than pity for the man's married life to that woman. And the film just keeps going, and going, and going, and I just wanted to know when Butler would finally get up and say, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a dam."" (btw, that last word is deliberately misspelled to avoid being censored).<br/><br/>Overall though, everything good or bad about this film has already been said. The only thing I can offer you guys is a first-impressions review. And with that, I give this film an 8 out of 10. I'd recommend this film to people, but let's face it; you've most likely have already seen it."

","The Mitchell novel becomes an unforgettable screen epic. This is grand entertainment featuring superb Technicolor cinematography, a memorable score, and lavish production values. Despite it's formidable length, it doesn't drag for a minute. However, it does become too melodramatic at times and the acting is uneven. Gable is charming, and de Havilland is fine, although her Melanie is so sweet that it's sickening. This film, however, belongs to Leigh, who is fabulous as the scheming Scarlett. Howard is totally miscast - too old, too plain-looking, too wimpy, and too British for anyone to believe that Scarlett would be obsessed with him."

","No one has ever written Rhett's death, until NOW! www.deathofrhett.blogspot.com. The movie is quite different from the book. For instance, the first line of the book is ""Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful."" So, the casting of Vivien Leigh was a major departure from Margaret Mitchell's original character. All the other casting decisions where faithful to the book, in my opinion. Regarding Rhett's character, the movie failed to depict his huge change in values after Bonnie's birth. In the book, he suddenly became a Democrats and a Methodist! He reverted back to his old ways after Bonnie's death, however. So the Rhett at the end of novel resembles the Rhett of the movie."

","Normally when a classic novel is adapted to the screen, the novel still remains definitive. Austen, Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Wells and Verne will always be what they are regardless of how many films are made of their work. Gone with the Wind is a rare exception – a best-selling and critically acclaimed book upon release, and yet the name and the story now belong firmly to the motion picture tradition.<br/><br/>When you look at Gone with the Wind, in particular its heroine Scarlett O'Hara, it's sometimes hard to fathom its appeal. It is essentially the story of bull-headed individualism in the face of social catastrophe. But if there was ever an attempt to make bull-headed individualism look romantic, this was it. Gone with the Wind is not, as so many film noirs of the next decade would be, a misogynist mope about the men ruined by such a self-centred woman, but neither is it a feminist glorification of the strong-willed woman. I think its impact lies in that it is really two stories – the tragic depiction of a vanishing way of life, told through the eyes of someone who cares only for herself. The one offsets the other, and gives the whole some kind of honesty.<br/><br/>After that, it all comes down to the gloss and polish of David O. Selznick's production. There's no shame in this, any more than there is in making a painting or piece of music a work of beauty, and besides Gone with the Wind is the kind of lily that can withstand a substantial amount of gilding. Probably the most special thing about the way the picture is done is its cinematography – an absolutely magnificent job by Ernest Haller and Ray Renehan. Painting is an apt metaphor here. The tones and compositions are reminiscent of fine artists such as Auguste Renoir (especially at the Twelve Oaks barbecue), with some nods here and there to Renaissance art as well. There is also some excellent use of silhouettes, creating those now-iconic images at key moments, and demonstrating just how much that errant lock of hair can add to Clark Gable's allure.<br/><br/>Which brings us onto the actors Despite the hoo-hah over casting, a lot of the performers were simply ticking boxes – Mr Gable and Hattie McDaniel in particular. But this does not diminish their efforts. McDaniel was always a talented actress, she just needed a role big enough to show it. Yes, she plays a stereotype, but the beauty of the performance is that she brings intelligence, wit and humanity to the surface through the stereotype. As for Ashley, I would prefer to have seen Melyvn Douglas in the role. Leslie Howard is a good actor but his physique is too willowy, and he is far too English. However, no-one could have guessed the British background of Vivien Leigh (except possibly Henry Higgins, but he's fictional). Her ""southern belle"" authenticity is quite incredible, given how rare it was back then for players to become so immersed in character, and also given that her normal speaking voice made the queen sound common. I would say though that purely as a performance it is merely good rather than outstanding. It is really just 95% sulks and hissy-fits, but she at least nails all the right emotions and even manages to make us sympathise with Scarlett.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind was famously troubled by directors coming and going – which is always great for confounding the auteur theorists, not that many of them would touch this movie with a 10-foot pole in the first place. The thing is, it really doesn't harm the production. George Cukor and Victor Fleming may have been total opposites in personality (an urbane homosexual and a rugged outdoorsman), but their shooting styles were very similar. Both used a lot of movement, of the camera and within the frame, to give atmosphere and dynamism to the scene, and both gave their actors a lot of coaching. The difference with Fleming is that, despite being the ultimate man's man, probably had enough of the no-nonsense attitude to coax out the shrewishness in Scarlett. He certainly brings Scarlett's personality to the quality of the image, with the quick dolly-in that introduces her character, the general bustle in background and foreground, people walking and talking at the same time – all of which are Fleming trademarks. It's as if Scarlett's flighty, haughty, teenage persona has coloured the whole world around her, and it's a very effective way to open the movie, engaging us immediately.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, that despite it being a colossal cultural event in its time, and holding its box-office record for over thirty years, Gone with the Wind has since been surpassed in popularity by its contemporary The Wizard of Oz. And even though it is still a highly regarded classic, it is probably now remembered more than it is enjoyed. The truth is, Gone with the Wind was very much a wonder of its age – a work of unprecedented lavishness and a herald of maturity in the motion picture. Whereas The Wizard of Oz, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka and many other hits of 1939 were simply great pictures of their day which can speak to people of any place or time, Gone with the Wind was a great phenomenon which meant something to a generation, but is now just a pretty-looking melodrama."
"blogandsqualor","9","0","1","20 December 2009"," Classic for a Reason
","Gone With the Wind is a drawn out affair that many youngsters roll their eyes at if they ever catch a parent or grandparent watching it on TCM. Whenever I start watching it, I initially have the same reaction that I do when reading the Twilight Series ( I know! Sacrilegious to even mention them in the same sentence right?). Bella by the end of the Twilight series, is in effect, just another reincarnation of Scarlett, a whiny brat who somehow makes it through all this adversity and ends up with a throng of male followers. I always wonder why anybody cared about Scarlett and didn't leave her to the Yankees in the first place.<br/><br/>But while Bella remains boring, Gone With the Wind slips under your skin and drags you into the drama and web of selfishness. You aren't supposed to like Scarlett and her continuous melodramatic exclamations, she's not the heroine, but a train wreck. As she and Rhett spiral out of control, you can't help but start to care. It's an experience in itself to listen to the clever words drawl off of Clark Gable's lips.<br/><br/>This is the one film that is synonymous with Hollywood. Set against a beautiful cinematic backdrop where every epic scene is laid out with precision and care, the film captures the lushness of the South that exists within the collective American imagination (these images most likely influenced by this film itself). Before watching the film for the first time, I recommend reading a bit about the production and influence it had at the time, facts that only make the film even more impressive. In the background, it captures the death of an era and empire with just the right balance of subtlety and force, an excellent foil to the old Hollywood staginess of the production. But let's face it; that's part of the fun."
"lwilli201","10","0","2","2 December 2009"," I think it was a great movie
","I have read some comments about how bad this movie was. I think there is a generational gap between those that like it and those that do not. The movie can not be judged on todays standards and be considered very good. To compare it to soaps is very unfair since there were no soaps back then. Today if there is not full unabated action every minute, the movie is said to have slow periods. That is a sign of the times. I did not see this movie until the early 50's when I lived in Laredo, Texas. It took that long for it to get down there. For it's time, it was a very gritty movie and very close to the first movie I ever say in color. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is a lot better than some of the trash getting awards today."
"minamurray","10","0","2","28 September 2009"," Glorious movie and true classic
","Positive: Made in 1939, this adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel about selfish Southern belle and American Civil War shows how badly made many modern movies are. Colours are rich and beautiful, unlike in most modern films, making costumes, sets and scenery look gorgeous. It has really epic quality and vibrancy. Vivien Leigh is perfect as heroine Scarlett - lovely to look and full of life, but rotten to the core in the same time. Negative: Morally the movie is more problematic. I am not fan of Kim Newman, but I think he said it well: He gave it 5/5 rating in Empire but said it is a movie of ""selfish cow"". Quite frankly, treatment of everybody outside Southern upperclass - including Northerners and poor whites - is irritating. Ku Klux Klan, who terrorized blacks and whites, is supposedly a group of chivalric knights. And the movie was actually cleansed version of the story: book is full of whiny, maudlin, glorified trash who murder and terrorize left and right and never takes responsibility of their own actions.

","GWTW is without any doubt One of the Finest Films of all Time. Although it's had many critics through the years, in terms of pure film-crafting, it is amazing. Accused of being racist and hateful toward African-Americans, I tend to see it as merely reflecting the times (the 1860's), as Margaret Mitchell understood them to have been. I don't see it as malicious, in particular Sam was portrayed in a complimentary way. Having said all this, let me address those who believe it's THE greatest. I truly believe they are half-right. I challenge everyone who believes it to be the greatest American Film to watch it carefully One More Time; this time with an eye to compare the 1st and 2nd halves. I have seen the film numerous times, and absolutely believe that the 1st half IS the greatest Piece of American film there is. But, in all honesty, the second half doesn't Quite match the greatness of the 1st half(though still wonderful). All things considered, it's still definitely a 10 and one of the greatest American Films-Period."
"classicalsteve","10","0","1","30 May 2007"," Still a Masterpiece Despite Unfortunate Shortcomings
","One of the ways that Gone with the Wind succeeds and transcends its genre as a romantic period picture is its unwillingness to stick with convention. The relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is never stereotypical or predictable. At first, the love triangle between Scarlett, Melanie and Ashley Wilkes seems cliché, like a soap opera decades before ""The Young and the Restless"", until Clark Gable as Butler literally steps into the picture and messes up the melodrama. One of the best scenes occurs when Scarlett professes her love to Ashley in private at a large social gathering and unbeknown-st to the characters, Rhett Butler is hiding behind a couch watching the drama unfold. When he finally reveals himself to her, the scene moves into new and unchartered territory, and we learn that neither Scarlett nor Butler are stereotypical characters. As the film progresses, Scarlett continually rejects Butler, which was probably quite unusual for audiences of the time who were probably more akin to melodramatic instantaneous romance.<br/><br/>In the background is the sweeping story of the Civil War. In essence, the story is about the coming-of-age of Scarlett O'Hara, which was unusual at the time. Coming-of-age stories have (and still do) typically center around male and not female characters. She is at first the manipulative sex goddess who uses her looks and charisma to get the men in her life to serve her on hand and foot, even those dating other women. When Butler comes into her life, he is the first male not to be so hypnotized by her; he is willing to stand up to her and call her bluff. How the relationship between Butler and Scarlett unfolds is one of the great cinematic stories and not to be missed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie suffers from rather serious shortcomings in its portrayal of African-Americans, particularly the character of Prissie. What makes this aspect of the film so infuriating is that these scenes do nothing to further the plot and have very little to with the central story, particularly the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. African-Americans are characterized as either being witless, like Prissie, or loyal to the South which is completely unrealistic. Only the character of Mammy appears like her own character and at least is more rounded than her African-American counterparts in the film. The scenes with Prissie, which seem ad infinitum in the first half, are probably the worst of the film. Ironically, Hattie McDaniel who played Mammy was the first African-American to win an academy award. At least the second half is not as bad as the first half in this regard. The portrayal of Prissie and some of the other African-Americans tell us more about America's view of African-Americans in the 1930's than showing us a realistic picture of African-Americans during the time of the Civil War. For that story, there is probably no better production than Roots.<br/><br/>Does this mean that Gone with the Wind belongs on the latter list of movies that are certainly of quality but suffer from outdated viewpoints? That's a question that every viewer will have to make for him or herself. For me, it is still a timeless classic despite its shortcomings. The story of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best love stories ever told on the large screen. Is it a masterpiece? Well, in many ways yes, but its shortcomings are sometimes hard to overlook. I have to use the fast-forward button more than I would like when watching this film."

I've become a bit jaded over the years, and it was hard to put aside my prejudices and look at it in a fresh light. It is a huge undertaking. When one looks at the year it was made, one would say ""astounding."" There are battle scenes, fires, big houses, romances, Scarlett, Rhett. So many of these are such a part of Americana, I found myself anticipating famous quotes and scenes. I never felt much empathy for Scarlett or for Rhett. There is a chemistry that can't be explained rationally. There's that incredible score that swells and moves and makes what would be much less magnificent into true events. The acting is a bit over the top at times. People are often caricatures. One needs to overlook that racism or you can't watch this movie. I think it is a valid observation to say ""look when this was done."" It is, after all, the Civil War, and it does take place in the South. I think as a film fan, we need to see the canon of films that impressed the world, even something like ""Birth of a Nation."" If they offend at times, we should know about them and be fair to them."

","Have you ever sat and watched this movie putting yourself in the place of a person who had that extraordinary opportunity to see this movie when it first came to the big screen? How astounding it must have been to watch this glorious epic tale of a women who truly does not know what she wants.<br/><br/>Each character has such depth and power, and what a dynamic women Melanie is. How hard must it have been to be accepting of Scarlett after being caught with her husband? Yet, somehow, when Scarlett attends her birthday party dressed as a ""lady of the night,"" she walks over to her with outstretched arms and embraces her thanking her for coming and expressing her gratitude towards her. Melanie is most defiantly a pivotal character that is often over looked in the story. Most people think that the plot is between Rhett and Scarlett. However, if it weren't for Melanie, then there wouldn't be a story. When Melanie is giving birth to her child, Rhett comes and rescues them from the house as Atlanta is being destroyed. This allows Rhett and Scarlett once again to be in contact with each other, thus leading to their wedding. Melanie is basically the one that snaps Scarlett back into reality and makes her realize that she truly loves Rhett though it is far too late. Scarlett did indeed love Rhett, but she was too stubborn to allow herself to realize this. Even when Bonnie flew off the horse and broke her neck, she didn't understand. Melanie's death was the tragedy that woke Scarlett up. As she ran to greet Rhett, she knew she had lost him forever, but Melanie's thoughts were left behind when she passed. This is evident when Scarlett, whom we have seen the whole movie think about herself and wallow in self pity, rises from the stairs and proclaims, ""After all, tomorrow is another day,"" and Melanie will live in her mind forever after."

"kellidee","9","0","1","20 May 2006"," Classic, even if a little skimpy on details
","After reading the 1000+ page book, I was excited to see how the movie would interpret it. After all, it's a classic novel, with shocking scenes and beautiful windows to imagination. And Vivien Leigh portrayed a perfect Scarlett (even with the green eyes, though the movie made hers look a bit blue). And Clark Gable was the only person possible to play Rhett Butler. Olivia De Havilland was the spitting image of what I imagined Melly to look like. Leslie Howard held Ashley's grace, dignity, and ignorance. Victor Flenning directed a perfect imitation. <br/><br/>However, I was pretty sad to see so many details left out. The real story of Gerald O'Hara's demise, the two children that Scarlett had with Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, the lost story behind Ellen O'Hara's heartache, India Wilkes's stupid sister, Honey, and Suellen eventually marrying Will Benteen while Carreen went off to the convent over the heartache of losing Brent Tarleton. It goes even to the extent of the outfits Scarlett wore. But honestly, sometimes you can't fit all of the little details in these movies, otherwise they'd go on for monotonous hours. This movie had beautiful sets (Twelve Oaks was gorgeous, Tara was breathtaking, Atlanta was very well done...) <br/><br/>With what they had to work with, the creators of this movie did a marvelous job. It was a classic as special as the book, it was enjoyable, charming, clever and heartbreaking, all at the same time. You would find yourself crying when Scarlett wanted to cry, you felt indignant when she was. The characters were very identifiable and that, in my opinion, next to the set design and directing (and music) is what makes a movie a good movie. :o)"
"thubanstar-1","9","0","1","25 February 2006"," Wide screens and soap operas
","I'm sorry this is such a long post, but hey, I've been a fan ever since I was 13, and I'm 44 now, so I have a LOT to say.<br/><br/>First off, I've noticed that many people ask about why Gone with the Wind is not on ""wide screen"" on this board, so, maybe I can help.<br/><br/>When Gone With the Wind ORIGINALLY came out in 1939, there was no such thing as ""wide screen"". The proportions of a movie shown then were much more like a standard TV screen rather than the long rectangle shape of wide screen. The proportions you see now on the DVD are the ORIGINAL proportions shown in the first version.<br/><br/>In the 1950's, wide screen cinema became a standard since movies were now competing with TV and had to have ""something extra"" to bring people back to the theatres. That is when wide screen filming started. Then, for decades, those films were ""chopped"" on their sides to fit a TV screen.<br/><br/>In the case of Gone With the Wind, though, to show it wide screen when it was re-released in the 1950's and 1960's, the original print had its TOP and a bit of the BOTTOM ""chopped"" to make it ""stretch"". A lot of scenery was lost... for example, when Scarlett is in the train depot to try and find a doctor for Melanie, a lot of the scope of the shot is actually lost in ""wide screen"" since the top of the shot is discarded.<br/><br/>These prints also tended to look washed out compared to the original prints since the film had to be ""blown up"" to fit a big screen. So, to conclude, although it may seem like you are getting ""less"" with the non-wide screen version of this film, you are actually getting more, and better than many people saw for decades.<br/><br/>As for the movie definitely in my top ten movies. It used to be my #1, but as I got older, it slipped a bit. Not because it's a bad film, but because it's very primal, very direct, which I'm sure has been a big part of its appeal through the years, especially to younger fans.<br/><br/>People are given to say this movie is a ""soap opera"". I accepted this, until I noticed pretty much every movie with a female lead character gets dismissed as a ""soap opera"" from people who, unconsciously or not, don't see a film as being ""serious"" unless a man is the lead and focus.<br/><br/>Also, so many women are portrayed (especially on TV) as one dimensional. There is an abundance on US TV of ""perfect mommies/wives"" without unsightly tummy bulge and who are always one step ahead of bumbling daddy. There's also the stereotype of the ""business bitch"" that is either cold and ruthless or stunted and subdued. And she's almost always shown as a perfect wife/mommy just waiting to happen.<br/><br/>There are very few women characters who are not portrayed as a saint or a whore, even now, in our politically correct era.<br/><br/>Gone With the Wind was decades ahead of its time in its portrayal of a woman trying to survive in a hostile world who is not evil, not saintly, but just a person trying to make it. She's not smart enough in some ways, and very smart in others just like the rest of us.<br/><br/>People also say it's a bigoted film and its attitude is destructive. Yes and no to this one. Yes, Margaret Mitchell was a conventional white, southern woman of her time with all the good and bad that suggests. She was a bigot. So were the people who made this film. HOWEVER, if you watch this and are either so; 1. Weak minded it makes you into a bigot, or 2. You are already a bigot and think this is super-accurate history and every African American was thrilled to be a slave, then you have issues way beyond what this film could possibly address.<br/><br/>A sensible, rational person takes this film and realizes it represents attitudes which are not acceptable. They also see that a change of thought on the subject of race does not mean we erase and forget anything that smacks of it because once you forget history, it does tend to repeat.<br/><br/>To sum it up there's a truly interesting female lead. There is an unconventional love story that ends in an unconventional way, even for our day and age. And there is an outdated P.O.V. of a minority which may disturb some, but unfortunately is accurate for its time."

Its most lingering moment is when Clark Gable turns to Scarlett and blurts out, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!"" Bold dialogue in 1939. This story of the American Civil War comes from the only novel written by Margaret Mitchell. I tried to read the novel years ago but was unable to crack it. I have seen the film. After learning of the 65th Anniversary DVD, I want to see it again. I was in Atlanta recently and haunted by the thought of Tara, Scarlett's plantation. I want to pay attention to Scarlett.

The original novel is too good to be surpassed. I cannot deny this movie showed most great parts of the movie within 4 hours, that's quite difficult.<br/><br/>(2) Vivien Leigh should be credited for the success of this movie. Scarlett is no doubt the shining part in this movie, and Vivien is no doubt be perfect, both the looking and the performances.<br/><br/>The regrets: (3) I think the only regret in this movie is: sometimes, this movie made some characters be too perfect to be true. For example, Melanie. Melanie is of course a wonderful lady, perfect personalities, strong (although weak with health). Well, in the novel, Melanie is more like a human. In this movie, she became a ""godness"". She is a woman growing up in the south of Ameria, with good family education. In the movie, she became a ""brave"" lady that felt not shy when talking with a prostitute. While in the movie, she is very scared after encountering with that prostitute. I prefer the novel since that's more realistic."

","There is nothing more wonderful than a sweeping romance from the 30's or 40's. Better still in Southern Belle costumes and fakey Southern accents. Some people find fault that Clarke Gable fails to deliver his Southern drawl, and that Vivien Leigh's is decidedly English (her native country) but I find it unimportant. This is a movie that today people sneer at, think it's cheesy and fake and overblown but in the end, if you let yourself get carried into the emotion, you're in for a treat that's seldom experienced. There's nothing I like better than the soaring music, full-scale orchestra like all old films, and the dramatic lighting changes. Olivia de Havilland's acting never ceases to amaze me and I study every flicker in her face and eyes. She is an incredible actress, and is still radiant today. Vivien Leigh overtakes Scarlett, takes Mitchell's character, portrays her well, and gives us more to Scarlett than an empty head, greed and flirtatious airs. Leigh makes Scarlett human, and viewers identify with not only the protagonist, but the three supporting roles as well. We see bits of ourselves in Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley and at the same time love and hate them for it. The same goes for the movie. There are mistakes surely, which we correct in our mind, but it adds to the charm of this classic, that it's flawed and loved because of it, just like its heroine, and just like humanity, which Mitchell and Selznick so well portray, and we still embody today."

","In the years since it debuted, GONE WITH THE WIND has taken a beating from film critics and historians alike. The characters are often described as cardboard-ish; portions of the film are described as excessively melodramatic; some of the special effects (most notably the film's occasional use of rear-view projections) have dated. There is some truth to all of these comments, but by far the most serious accusation hurled at the film is that it is racist.<br/><br/>One's perception of the film as racist rather depends on whether you look at the film within the context of its era or from a purely modern standpoint. At the time, GONE WITH THE WIND was a major advance in the portrayal of blacks on screen, for the two major black characters--Mammy and Prissy--are a far cry from the obnoxious ""Stepin Fetchit"" stereotypes so common in the 1930s. In later years, both Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen would be derided for their participation in the film and accused of perpetuating stereotypes, but in fact their performances were anything but stereotypical at the time--indeed, their very power led Hollywood into a repetition of similar characters, and it was that repetition that later caused the originals to read as clichéd.<br/><br/>The real problem with GONE WITH THE WIND is that it, like the novel on which it is based, buys into the myth of great plantations, lovely Southern belles, gallant gentlemen, and a paternalistic form of slavery. These concepts have some basis in fact, but the vast majority of southern whites did not own plantations, much less own slaves, and those who did rarely practiced ""paternalistic"" slavery by any stretch of the imagination. But GONE WITH THE WIND is the myth, not the fact--and once we accept it as a highly romanticized vision of the South as it never really was, the film becomes incredibly entertaining and can still cast its spell upon the modern viewer.<br/><br/>The most powerful thing about the film is that it moves. Over the course of its very long run, the episodic story of the beautiful and willful Scarlett O'Hara and her rapacious drive to insulate herself from the hardships of the war never significantly drags. And the cast, from the leads to the bit players, is superior.<br/><br/>Margaret Michell might have created Rhett Butler with Clark Gable in mind; Vivien Leigh, a remarkable beauty and a very fine actress, was scarcely known outside England--but amazingly, when one considers the tremendous anticipation surrounding the casting of the role, she plays Scarlett with incredible success. Granted that the characters of Melanie and Ashley are rather unbelievable, but both Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard carry them off with conviction. And although they have already been mentioned, Hattie McDaniel's formidable Mammy and Butterfly McQueen's passive-aggressive and frequently hysterical Prissy are brilliant creations and more than worthy of a second mention.<br/><br/>True, advances in cinema technique have made some of the special effects seem dated, but the production values and art design are brilliant from throughout, and the film offers a multitude of iconographic moments: Rhett standing at the bottom of the staircase at Twelve Oaks; Scarlett caught up in a the panic during the siege of Atlanta; the tattered flag waving above the fallen troops at the train yard; the kiss between Rhett and Scarlett after the fall of Atlanta--these, yes, and many, many more.<br/><br/>GONE WITH THE WIND will no doubt become increasingly controversial as attitudes continue to change re race, slavery, and the Civil War--but in terms of pure cinema it is a remarkable achievement for all involved and it remains a landmark to this day. The DVD currently available offers a pristine picture and high quality sound, but I must note that the DVD has no great advantage over the current VHS release; a trailer aside, there are no bonus materials of any kind, and both are of equal quality. Strongly recommended, but with a warning: do not mistake it for fact. As I noted earlier, this is a South that never was, built on a form of slavery far removed from the slavery that actually existed. Enjoy it as a beautifully made and epic romance with a host of powerful performances--but not as history.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","I was finally persuaded to see this film by my wonderful girlfriend, and for the most part I am glad I did; I did not, however, find it the awe inspiring, chest crushing, mind blowing experience that she does every single time she puts it on. The film is a little melodramatic and sentimental but this can be overlooked when we consider the date of its release. The central character, Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a ruthless, underhand, devious little bitch who manages to survive the ravages of the American Civil War and Leigh plays the character with a great degree of skill.<br/><br/>Leigh's performance is matched by Gable's and the two certainly have an on-screen chemistry that lends a degree of realism to their highly volatile relationship; and a strong supporting cast lends a great deal of weight to the overall effect of the film.<br/><br/>This film however isn't a patch on the book. Whilst Margaret Mitchell's original has been treated with due care and attention, there simply isn't enough time to fit everything in; no amount of acting can do justice to Mitchell's original Scarlett O'Hara.<br/><br/>People are often quick to condemn this film as inaccurate and racist or jump on the other side and say that it is a milestone in film history. I think that it is both; it is inaccurate, it is racist and it is a very entertaining film. I cannot condone racism, but this film is a product of a different era, when things were different and should be viewed in that way. The time the film is set in was a highly racist time and this film helped bring black people into Hollywood.<br/><br/>If you can appreciate a film as a product of the time in which it was made, then you will probably like this film.

I am now in my thirties, and this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen, read about, and seriously dreamed about this movie for some time. I have seen it aleast 50-75 times and I can find no flaws. From casting, which is incredible and impossible to imagine any of the main characters being played by anyone else, to filming, which if you get the new 4 DVD set out you will see just how incredible it was to film this movie, I find absolutely no flaws with this spectacular movie. The storyline is, as is should be, written for word, right out of Mitchell's book. I do admit that the book is incredible and some of the storyline I wish had made it into the movie, ie. Scarlett's children. I would have liked to have seen her in the early mother role with a son that could barely speak his own name he was so timid of her! Back to the movie...if you are of southern descent and you have not seen this movie, someone should spank you! If you are northern and not seen this movie, then you should so you know how most of the south still feels about you. I have yet to met a northerner that was not 'out of the norm' of this movie. It pegs them to a tee! (And I've met plenty!) A movie with a wonderful story, wonderful scenery and a wonderful cast! I, too, do not believe that there was an American actress at that time that could have surpassed Leigh's performance. She is truly magnificent. My favorite line of her's is when ole Kennedy has died and she has been drinking brandy and Rhett comes to call on her and she see's him out her window and hiccups and say ""It's Rhett"". And then pretties herself up with cologne with Rhett smells right away and says "" Scarlett, you should never drink alone, people aways find out and it ruins their reputation!"" So true and yet so funny! The movie is wonderful, beginning to end, and if you haven't seen it, it's at least worth a Sunday afternoon of your time. Beautifully filmed, beautifully portrayed. My 8 year son now knows just about every line, he's loves this movie. His favorite line is when Mammie is putting Mr. Kennedy pants in the ""boilin' pot"", he doubles over every time he hears her say that. Yes, I know some black people believe this is a racist film and I'm sorry they feel that way. I don't take it upon myself to say it is or it isn't but that's the way it was only 'glorified'. I think ALL Americans should all be proud of the performances and at least HATTIE was given the first 'Supporting Actress Award"" for a black performer. She was excellent! NO ONE could have made a better performance. If you do research on the time she spent on GWTW you will get a good perspective of what she thought of the role and what she wanted to bring to the picture. My only disappoint was that Clark Gable did not receive an Academy Award for this picture...he was so good that everyone thought he wasn't really acting, he was just himself. I am a die-hard GABLE fan, and, yes, this part was made for him but he still had to act the part. I still believe he was robbed!! Studio would not let him get the Academy Award! That sucked!If you are not a Gable fan, please check out some of his other flics! He is still the best of the BEST!

She is strong-willed, intelligent and resourceful. I especially love the portrayal of her as caretaker of the weak. Had it not been for Scarlett, Melanie Hamilton and her child would have died in Atlanta. She worked to protect her family, and even to care for the woman who was married to the man she loved. She is vibrant and I aspire to imitate her courage and strength. The only flaw in the making of the film is that because of the nature of filming one cannot hear the thoughts of the characters in an epic like this one. It is those thoughts which give the real insight to who Scarlett O'Hara truly is on the inside. It is in those thoughts where she truly shows her gentle side and how she must be courageous for the sake of those around her. She, at times, seems to be uncaring, but it is only because she must be the source of everything for so many others.

I have never liked Scarlett, and to me the film is a great film in spite of Scarlet, who is nothing but a spoiled brat that never appears to grow up through out the entire film. GWTW was the first of the really great color films that was ever made, and at the time there were still many people who were alive during the Civil War. The only other film from its day that is nearly as epic is ""All Quiet On The Western Front.""<br/><br/>When I lived in Georgia, GWTW was shown almost every summer, and I can remember seeing it at a drive-in movie in the Atlanta area.  The little speaker did not do it justice. The soundtrack is extrodinary and the sweep of the film from its opening is something that takes you along on the wind. Some of the scenes from the picture you cannot ever get out of your mind. I just wish I could get over Scarlett O'hara being such a complete bitch. I really hate her.<br/><br/>It would appear to me that its place in great films is slipping more than a bit. I think this is justified. I saw the film first when I was a wee child and I was more than a bit reserved about it and I saw Scarlett as a zilch then. As my mother used to tell me when I started dating girs: ""Beauty is what beauty does."" A lot of the southern character was captured by the film and it is a shame to me that it has became not politically correct to appreciate anything about the south from the Civil War era. Beautifully made film that was ahead of its time. 1939 was possibly the most landmark year in the history of film making; The Wizzard of Oz, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and Gunga Din are just some of the spectacular films released that year."

","You know the drill: Scarlett ignores Rhett and pursues Melanie's husband Ashley while Atlanta burns down around her.<br/><br/>My two cents worth: The portrayal of the Civil War and the aftermath were superb, especially for the 1930's.  Costuming and set design were also very impressive, especially in the restored version.  The colors were vivid, and the people were all ideally cast for their parts.  I just couldn't stand anybody in the movie.  Scarlett was a jealous, spoiled brat, the stereotypical ""evil sorority chick"" type.  Rhett came off better, even though he had a wicked temper; he should have left sooner, or better yet, never married her in the first place.  Melanie was ""good"", to the point where people took advantage of her.  And Ashley... was he supposed to be good looking back then, or what?  Because he didn't seem to have much going on in the personality department.  Mammy was the only one who had any sense, and nobody listened to her.<br/><br/>Recommendations: Oh, I don't know.

The best characters of all is Hattie McDaniel as Mammy and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. I like them because they are the only ones who saw right through her, while everyone else was so naive.

Ashley Wilkes constantly refers to a (Southern) gentleman's code of honour in contrast to those marauding Yankees. The beauty and elegance of Tara is reduced to a wasteland caused the devastation of the Civil War. In other words, the film mourns a past that can never be recaptured.<br/><br/>As this film was released in 1939, I wonder whether this film was mirroring the anxieties that existed on the eve of the 2nd World War, when the threat of the possible destruction of civilisation was looming on the horizon?"

","Ok, so that is not a direct quote from Gone with the Wind, I allowed myself a little creative free reign.  Now, first things first, I'm not the kind of person who believes that, just because some one says a film is a classic, necessarily mean that it is a classic.  I don't know, maybe to everyone else in the world, Gone with the Wind is the greatest motion picture ever made, it may just be something someone my age doesn't understand, or as Prince put it, a Sign O' the times.  To me, Gone with the Wind looked like nothing more than a four-hour version of Dallas, spliced with Day of our Lives, directed by Ed Wood's older brother (if you could imagine such a thing).  Meaning that the plot was so threadbare and self-important that it really did bring to mind actual scenes from Dallas, and the colours of the film were so bright and sludgy (probably down to the primitive colour printing of the time) that it was hard to make out objects clearly.  The acting was hardly exemplary either, Vivien Leigh tried her best, but the character of Scarlett is one of the most obnoxious, self-obsessed, empty headed character to ever grace the screen, to get an idea of just how bad she is, let's just say she wouldn't be to far out of place in an episode of Beverly Hills 90210.  As for Rhett Butler, well he's a brutish man's man, who has no other characterisation other that the fact that he is Clark Gable and no one else, there is no other shimmer of a character lurking beneath the surface.  There are a couple of key memorable moments in the film, but besides the famous scenes that everyone knows fluently without ever having seen the film, nothing much happens, especially towards the end.  There is also a crass racism to the film, notably in the character Mammy, probably the mentality of the times, but it is surprising producer Selznick didn't just cast a white actor and black the up with boot polish.  Now I am not the kind of person who attacks classic (or so-called classic) films just to get attention, I really do enjoy most classic films, but Gone with the Wind is just to badly dated to even register as anything above average."
"Aidan McGuinness","7","0","3","29 January 2002"," Well done but left me feeling indifferent
","""Gone with the Wind"" is a classic. This is what we're always told. The huge story of Scarlett O'Hara, set against the American civil war and told over 234 minutes is one of the most famous movies of all time and, inflation adjusted, one of the most successful. This doesn't mean that it's any good however...<br/><br/>In the movie's favour it looks *fantastic*. Some scenes are incredible - and not just the burning of Atlanta, but scenes such as when Scarlett is walking among the wounded men (there is a LOT of them) or even just the social gatherings. Full respect to the production and design crew - the film looked the part and shows that FX are not always the best way forward.<br/><br/>However... Scarlett O'Hara is irritating. She epitomizes the spoilt brat. She'll use and abuse anyone to get her way - this includes any man unfortunate enough to fall in love with her. This is no real fault of Vivien Leigh but it certainly doesn't make me empathize with her character - I'm on the verge of gaining respect when off she goes and marries some poor soul to get his wallet. The idea of impossible love is hardly new and it's the core of this movie as Scarlett yearns for the one man she can never (and doesn't deserve to) have - Ashley. The only true match for her is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). His character has somewhat more depth than Scarlett's but he seems to spend the whole movie going around with a lop-sided grin. Fair enough but with such a long story I'd have appreciated more.<br/><br/>The story isn't pedantic and doesn't actually drag. It doesn't move along at a flying pace but hey, we're not watching your average slash-em up are we? It does seem to recycle the same concepts though - Scarlett wants Ashley. Can't have so marries someone else. Something unfortunate happens so Scarlett wants Ashley. She can't have him so ... - you see where I'm going.<br/><br/>
The movie is like a pulp novel - it knows exactly what it's doing and mostly pushes the right buttons. ""Titanic"" clued in on this idea of a grand love story set against a tragic event much later to similar success. It's undoubtedly well made but it's not actually an excellent movie when it comes to the story and I'm left somewhat cold by Scarlett's plight (and the rest of her family make me go even more ""fiddle-dee-dee""). Certainly it's superior to ""Titanic"" so those of who you enjoyed *that* movie should enjoy this. For myself I saw a movie that I was glad I saw but have no particular need to ever see again. Somewhat over-rated. 7.5/10."

","It is astonishing that a film made in 1939 should be considered technically the best ever made film. <br/><br/>But technology has not progressed so much in the sense this film shines.<br/><br/>The shots are splendid, the action is magnificent, the pictures are natural and complete, people are filmed just closely as the script requires, actors direction is wonderful.<br/><br/>It would have been, in my opinion, the best ever made film if the sequence of emotive scenes would have been more solid and acting would have been perfect instead of almost perfect.  I think that there are five films that I could put over this one, for different reasons, mainly due to better scripts, perfect acting or to originality: Fred Zinnemann´s ""A Man for all Seasons"", Léo Joannon´s ""Le Defroqué"", Serguei Bondarchuk´s ""War and Peace"", André Cayatte´s ""La vie conjugale"" and David Lean´s ""Lawrence of Arabia"". But only the last one and in a restricted sense - due to its impressive war scenes - the russian ""War and Peace"" could compete technically with ""Gone with the Wind"".<br/><br/>The famous burning of Atlanta is the best shot ever made.  I could say absolutely insuperable.<br/><br/>Direction is very good, though I have learned that Victor Flemming was not the main responsible for it as he was not the only director hired by producer David O. Selznick and that direction was more in the hands of the latter than in anyone´s else.<br/><br/>Acting is not outstanding but I could say very good.  Personally I liked the acting performances of secondary actors Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard more than the supposed to be fascinating Clark Gable´s and awarded Vivien Leigh´s and Hattie McDaniel´s performances.<br/><br/>Even with such minor limitations ""Gone with the Wind"" is a masterpiece and the fact that it belongs to 1939 is really incredible."
"sloopbillyb","5","0","12","15 October 2001"," Sloopbillyb skewers ""Gone with the Wind""
","Gone with the Wind is just about the most overrated film I have ever seen. Now, let me tell you why: 1. Scarlett O'Hara is the most dislikable protagonist created in American fiction, not counting Jar Jar Binks.  She is pushy and always wants her way. She is an immature brat.  And this movie makes her out to be some kind of heroine!? 2. Clark Gable has little acting talent in this movie, which disappointed me after seeing him in the hilarious ""It Happened One Night"".  He pretty much smiles and charms his way through the picture, and by the end of the movie you wonder who he is, really.  The movie could have built a kind of mysterious aura about him, like in ""Citizen Kane,"" but nope.  It pretty much assumes you already know him. 3. Every character is a stereotype.  Every single one.  I know this is a common criticism, but just look at it again.  Don't think I'm criticizing Hattie McDaniel, though.  She did wonderful with what little she was offered.  In fact, her performance is the best in the film. 4. Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland practically sleepwalk through their parts. 5.  The story is nothing more than a soap opera.  Now mind you, soap operas at least have the decency to have more than one corny, stupid story line so that there's some variety.  In ""Gone with the Wind,"" there is only one story: Scarlet.  Her relationship with Rhett is quite flexible; no more than five minutes pass in the movie when they love each other.  After five minutes, they hate each other.  Another five minutes, they're in love.  With a movie 234 minutes long, that means there is a monotonous love story with, oh let's see, 46.8 twists and turns.  We'll say about 40.  Oh my, isn't that exciting?<br/><br/>Actually, there are three redeeming qualities: Hattie McDaniel, a moment where Scarlet shoots the phony Union soldier with a pistol (the entire theater cheered), and the performance of Butterfly McQueen.  Her performance was witty and mature.  Here are some poignant quotes: ""Miss Melanie, Miss Melanie, I doesn't know nothin' about birthin'!"" ""Put a knife under 'da pillow and cut 'da pain in two."" How sad yet how true."
"HenryHextonEsq","7","0","1","24 June 2001"," A reasonable film !
","This legendarily popular epic romantic melodrama is in my opinion far from the greatest picture ever made, but is certainly a fine lavish spectacle. It would've been better if I'd viewed it in a cinema, as the photography was clearly luxurious and didn't best suit the small screen. The music is rather fitting, embellishing the emotions of the film well. I thought the historical period was well established, even if one should treat its accuracy as questionable. As for the political correctness, the attitudes and situations prevalent in the film regarding gender and race are redolent of earlier times and cannot be judged in view of today's standards. If it were made similarly today, one would suspect some indignation would arise, and probably be justifiable. I suppose it's the factor of the black slaves being so unrealistically happy in their place that seems historically questionable to me. The film's acting was mixed really; despite its length certain performers either fail to leave an adequate impression (Leslie Howard) or aren't given enough to do (Thomas Mitchell). Vivien Leigh creates a far from particularly nuanced role, but an effective one. Scarlett is indeed a rather flawed, stroppy girl, but one is compelled to follow her miseries with interest. Clark Gable truly gives the finest performance here though, creating a wonderfully wry, suave and likeable character. The plot itself is unspectacular, with aspects of the romantic entanglements not convincing as they should, largely due to Leslie Howard's below-par performance. The extent of Scarlett's self-delusion/misguidedness seems unlikely, even for her character. The length of the film was no problem really, as my interest was largely maintained. I would say the earlier part of the film, before the War is indeed the most cinematically accomplished part, with a good atmosphere well created, and the plot moves on quicker later on, with the numerous tragedies and episodes being well conveyed. There is a fine ending, although it should have ended straight after Gable's ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!"" ripsote. Clark Gable's fine acting, a steady storyline, fine music and photography are the aspects of this film that most impressed. I wouldn't call it overrated as such, because it is indeed a cinematic milestone, but there are better old films out there, and of the two major popular successes of the year 1939, I find ""The Wizard of Oz"" more enjoyable.
