","Another WWII movie but instead of D-Day and the Battle of Dunkirk, it's the Battle of Okinawa in Japan. Which means, new branch of military and new settings. Usually I want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters, but this movie changed my opinion. It tells the story of Desmond Doss and his life and how he joined the army, that was very interesting and well-acted. The beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others, who are also a good addition. BUT the rest of the movie is awesome. The battle scene is engaging, heart-wrenching, and epic. It is very gruesome, some may not like that, but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet, there's going to be blood. The fight portrayed Desmond's goal and his heart to save others, which you have to respect. Not only does this movie provide adrenaline, but also a learning experience."

","We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!"

","As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.<br/><br/>This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father. Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder.<br/><br/>As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality."
"bartonj2410","10","521","765","25 September 2016"," Welcome back Mr Gibson
","When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.<br/><br/>Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.<br/><br/>Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.<br/><br/>Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.<br/><br/>The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.<br/><br/>Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen."

","I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.<br/><br/>I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the clichÃ© violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.<br/><br/>By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.<br/><br/>Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.<br/><br/>Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.<br/><br/>Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded."

","Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers."
"gregorysmith-82520","10","255","389","8 October 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge: an emotional journey alongside the war-hero, Desmond Doss.
","Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.<br/><br/>Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller â€“ the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror â€“ these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.<br/><br/>The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey."
"CalRhys","Null","54","78","28 January 2017"," A Raw & Emotional Gut Punch
","With its late release over here in England, by the time the film was released, it had already come to prominence with overwhelming reviews and 6 Oscar nominations to its name, so I entered with relatively high expectations, which I generally find to be a bad call as you tend to be let down, however Gibson's first directorial effort in a decade, 'Hacksaw Ridge', is a raw and emotional gut punch.<br/><br/>With the history of cinema being littered with the production of World War II films, primarily in the form of over-the-top propaganda pictures such as 'Saving Private Ryan' (which nonetheless I still love), it's nice to see a movie that delves down the path of anti- war and focuses on the true-life tale of an uncaped superhero over fictional splendour, and 'Hacksaw Ridge' is just that. The film starts with rather over-sentimental, soap opera style tendencies which are occasionally funny to watch, but nonetheless they are perfect at delivering character development to our front-running hero Desmond Doss. I was initially expecting a 'Pearl Harbor' approach, with over an hour of lovey-dovey sentimental crap followed by under-accomplished action, but it was quite the opposite. The opening features the stated character development drama, but gives us an insight into Doss's personal reasons for his faith and religious approaches, then thrusts us into war.<br/><br/>Now, the war scenes... well, let's just say they're some scenes I doubt I'll be forgetting anytime soon. They're epic, they're visceral, they're emotional, they're gory, but above all else, they are executed perfectly. Upon reaching the top of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the squad are instantly driven into the horrors of war, the loss of friends and hope. The raw and visceral images are maybe even a little too realistic. Dead bodies are strewn across the ground, innards and entrails litter the floor, smoke and fire choke the landscape. This is war.<br/><br/>'Hacksaw Ridge' is a hard-hitting film that if watched and truly understood, will be an unforgettable experience, and the concluding interviews with the real-life Doss add to the emotional core. The cinematography is stunning, the music is beautifully alluring and the performances, especially from Andrew Garfield, are beyond fantastic, Garfield completely embodies the persona of Doss with sheer accuracy. Further shoutouts to Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and the surprisingly brilliant Vince Vaughn. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films to have graced 2016... or 2017 here in the UK! We forgive you Gibson!"
"trublu215","9","233","370","13 September 2016"," A film that is as courageous as its subject and as violent as the war it portrays.
","Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does."
"CineMuseFilms","8","127","196","18 October 2016"," one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema
","Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.<br/><br/>The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.<br/><br/>Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.<br/><br/>The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.<br/><br/>The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero."
"donprosseractor","9","148","240","19 October 2016"," Superbly crafted screenplay of the Doc
","I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.<br/><br/>I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers."
"autisticreviewers","10","229","394","17 October 2016"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.<br/><br/>The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 Â½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.<br/><br/>Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.<br/><br/>5/5 Autistic Reviewers"

"shelswel","9","53","91","18 October 2016"," Like a Doss!
","For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comesÂ… but not this time.<br/><br/>Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction, you can't help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. <br/><br/>The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond's alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond's heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa's Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.<br/><br/>True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save."

","I saw the movie with a number of friends this evening. Of the 10, 3 of us are combat veterans, with a total of 5 wars between us. (2 Vietnam, 2 Desert Storm and a current war in the Middle East veteran.) All the non-combat veterans thought the battle scenes were ""so horribly, so frighteningly realistic."" Those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon-ish.<br/><br/>The tactical mistakes such as bunching up, not seeking cover, bodies flying through the air, artillery explosions obviously gasoline, all the ridiculous yelling, were all so blatantly wrong. It was the worst depiction of battle we ever saw.<br/><br/>If the Japanese occupied the top of the ""ridge"" why didn't they simply cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed? Why didn't they throw grenades down on the assembled Americans below? How did the cargo netting ever get there is US troops didn't already occupy the top of the mountain? <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn was the Basic Training sergeant, again, best described as cartoon-ish. Peter Sellers as Inspector Cleuseau would have been more realistic.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad this movie really is.<br/><br/>In reality, battle is hell, in some ways worse than what was shown on the screen, but in terms of realism, this movie is atrocious."

","Although we have only just nudged our way into February I nominate this as a contender for Worst Film of 2017. It might even win.<br/><br/>This is a film of two halves. In fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films. The first half is comprised of two acts.<br/><br/>Act 1 sees us in Disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the Americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles, gleaming perfect white teeth, pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl clichÃ© in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance.<br/><br/>Act 2 Army training camp. New wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them. Familiar territory. You know the score: the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department.. The tough one. The farmer boy one. The handsome one. The oddly short one. The goofy one. And the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero's life a misery. And the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies. The sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit. Of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero.<br/><br/>Turns out our hero doesn't want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic. So instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots.<br/><br/>But with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial. The gal gives her guy a bible. We saw that coming. <br/><br/>Part Two: Our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff. The only way up to Hacksaw Ridge is via a single wide rope ladder. Atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million Japanese soldiers. All is quiet. And you can't help wondering why those evil Nips (their term, not mine) haven't simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below.<br/><br/>But we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened. But that rope ladder still bothers me.<br/><br/>However...the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff â€“ and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns.<br/><br/>Now let me state here that I have read about the battles against the Japanese for control of the Pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued. The Japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since Medieval times. But in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails, pools of glistening blood, severed limbs, decapitated heads, mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out-gore every war film that has gone before. Every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull. Every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device. And then there is more blood and guts and half- men screaming for their moms. <br/><br/>The tidal wave of Japs overwhelms the US soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder. It's not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho... What of our hero...? Well he is still up top â€“ now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind. A few Japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow.<br/><br/>Leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge. This is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety. He proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face. Actually there are only two blokes down there, smoking and chewing the fat. But they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp. Oddly no-one thinks to send a soldier or two â€“ or twenty â€“ up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero. They just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate.<br/><br/>And so it goes on. When our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him. Shame they didn't have the balls to go up and help him. But they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away.<br/><br/>At the risk of upsetting the 'Special Relationship' we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond â€“ and I know my fellow countrymen will understand this â€“ Hacksaw Ridge is just too American. A much better script and a British director would have delivered a subtle, more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war.<br/><br/>This is a true story. A story of towering heroism. Real men fighting real battles. But in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality. And all concerned deserved better than that."
"ddragosa","3","124","236","8 February 2017"," I am astonished by the reviews and score
","I begin my review by saying that I respect the history and the events that took place in WW2 and I have the utmost respect for the guys who gave their life for that cause. Having said that, let me tell you my opinion about the movie. And only the movie.<br/><br/>Well, first of all I found it dull and uninteresting. The actors were fake. The scenes looked like rehearsals and uncut material. It was split in two half: the first was about nothing (well you could say stubbornness and stupidity because I was made to fell nothing for the main character except annoyed and uninterested) and the second about guts and gore. Did I said the actors looked FAKE? Oh, yeah. But man, oh man that was the main problem for me. The actors looked fake and the entire movie looked like a poorly made joke.<br/><br/>The plot was something like this: let's establish the motives, good. Now the cause... good and now the effects. Perfect. Now we can move on. The audience got it. And so on and so forth. Now lets slip in some romance. You can't have a movie without romance. Good, check! Now let's be jerks about it and make his life uncomfortable in the army, check! But hey, he got beliefs, check! ONE BIG CHECK LIST. No emotion, no heart, no nothing. A dead flat feeling.<br/><br/>Let me tell you few spoilers from the movie that I found to be really bad.<br/><br/><ul><li>the scene where he meets the guys from the army in the barrack. Why in the hell should you put a naked guy (no brains, just muscles) to do pull-ups naked? Why? Because the target audience appreciate it? Little girls can't watch a movie that has no naked buff guys in it? I can only imagine the guys who made that crap scene: OK, guys I have an idea! We will introduce a stupid character that will do pull-ups naked in the barrack. But why? Doesn't matter, but it will be very funny and in that way we please the target audience. And check that out. We will make him run naked outside the barrack because the sergeant wouldn't let him get dressed and he will be forced to run naked during their exercises. Ha ha, so funny, NOT!.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the scene where they fight the Japanese. At some point the tough guy in the unit picks up a half dismembered body to use it as a shield and charged the battlefield killing 20 Japanese. WTF? At that point I was laughing and couldn't believe how bad this looks. Mel is becoming senile.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>another scene when some doctor got wounded and Dodds wanted to give him plasma and the doctor says ""No, give it to the other guy I don't know!"". And he did. After several minutes we see a scene where Dodds asks about the doctor and another guy says ""He didn't make it. He didn't have the plasma"". And he makes a stupid face and we as the audience understand everything. WOW that was very educating. It was explained to us like we were some retards and didn't understand the sacrifice he made. Very poorly done. Cheap.</li></ul><br/><br/>The battle looked like it was made by acrobats all jumping in spectacular ways, turning, twisting. All was about guts and gore. The more gore the better. Its as if the film was thought to get better with every gruesome scene over and over again. But it got worse. At some point after seeing so many body parts it became a joke. It began to fail and I was made to smile at how stupid this looks. Every scene made me think how the directors were scheming and constipating with ideas that were suppose to shock us until they run out of ideas and they just put more guts, gore and blood. That will shock them.<br/><br/>I can continue to rant about this movie as every scene has flaws and doesn't deliver. I wouldn't call this movie an Oscar or even a mention. Mel's only good movie was Braveheart and I stand by that. I cant believe how easy people fall for this violence nonsense mixed with religion and patriotism. Could it be that this a recipe for successful movies? Or we are ashamed to admit this is a crap movie because we are afraid that others will look upon us and accuse us we don't respect history and heroes? Wake up people!"
"jdesando","Null","69","130","31 October 2016"," A real war story told realistically.
","""I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques."" Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) <br/><br/>Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let's add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I'll let the film speak for itself.<br/><br/>The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa's Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).<br/><br/>Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichÃ©d story telling. The film's two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.<br/><br/>Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss's kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.<br/><br/>Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed."

"icasilas","7","8","11","8 April 2017"," An unexpectedly entertaining journey through the cruel depths of war.
","Hacksaw ridge is by far Mel Gibson's best movie as director; it had all the criteria for it to be this year's best picture. It is a calm journey through the life of a simple yet unstable southern family; it brought us to admire the simplest joys of life, the happy and loving daily life of the American suburban families before the war. This movie showed us the true meaning of love and compassion and restored our hope in humanity. And then as expected gave us its obscure side, throwing us in the most well directed and performed war decors ever filmed, a true human carnage between the seemingly weak American army and the ruthless Japanese battalions. Hacksaw ridge is a story of pain and suffering and war, but it also represents the eternal fight between good and evil, and by that not meaning the two armies themselves but the true battle between faith and despair. Hacksaw ridge is truly a modern odyssey. One of the most crucial elements of such an amazing quest is the protagonist Desmond doss, a man of iron will and unbreakable faith who tried to save humanity in my opinion from violence and war. Portraying such a persona is undoubtedly a great challenge, and Andrew Garfield was up to it: The young actor exhibited with the help of the industry's veteran Mel Gibson one of the most sincere performances in the history of war films, his great acting skills were a key element to the success of this picture. The character of private doss was itself a fascinating trait that contributed to the critical acclamation this picture had received, he is as Andrew Garfield perfectly fits a man of a poor physique yet of great courage and altruism, his a medic that dived head first into the hordes of dead in the battlefield without hesitation, he is a loving husband, a great son and a true patriot who stood willingly in the face of the dreadful war in japan in order to save his fellow brothers in arms. In this dire times , the only one who truly stood by the side of private doss was his father Thomas , a good turned cruel man that lived to tell about the war to end all wars, he was disturbed and traumatised , something that Hugo weaving mastered on screen , he was such a great cast choice and delivered more than what was needed from a secondary character, he visualized in every move he did and every word he spoke the true horrors of war, he was all the time dark and shocked demonstrating what a war could do to a country, a family and a man. To sum it up, hacksaw ridge is definitely a must watch, it's by far one of this year's most exciting and overwhelming pictures. It is a top notch movie that depicts unprecedentedly the march of one man to end a war, it's the story of a real war hero who chose not to take the life of his brethren, and it's a movie for the director Mel Gibson to be proud of."

","This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.<br/><br/>And I'm confused. Is this a political movie? I don't know anything about Mr Gibson's political views, but if this is it - I'm not buying.<br/><br/>Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it's OK to go to war in the name of God?.<br/><br/>I'm confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters! We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple? Hmm...don't think so.<br/><br/>This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a whooping 10/10 syrup bottles!

","Mel Gibson's Directorial Return, after a 10 Year Hiatus, is neither an Anti-War or Pro-War Film, it is both.<br/><br/>If it wasn't a Documented True Story of Conscientious Objector Desmond Doss who Refused to Touch a Gun, although Enlisting to Serve in WWII, one might get the Impression that the Film was Allegorical about the Resurrected Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>That Impression is Felt once the Movie's Second Half turns to the Battle of Okinawa and the ""Hero"" of the New Testament finds Himself in a Hell that is the Human Condition and still Maintains the ""Love Thy Neighbor"" and ""Turn the Other Cheek"" Demeanor that He, by Example, Maintains throughout the Carnage and Slaughter.<br/><br/>The Film is Grounded with Good Performances, not only Andrew Garfield, but also with Hugo Weaving as Doss's Father Riveting and Bristling with Gravitas, and others Contributing the Fleshing Out (literally) needed to make the Movie Mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The Battle Sequences get a lot of Ink and they are Visceral with the Violence Sharply Cutting on the Edges of the Frame as Garfield's Doss Centers the Action with a Calm that Defies Normal Human Reaction. It's as though He is Cloaked with Protection from an Unearthly Source.<br/><br/>The Film is Rife with War Movie and World War II Era ClichÃ©s that are Presented with a Pretension of Ease and seem Ironically Necessary to tell the Story. The First Half Develops the Desmond Doss Character and the Second Half Deconstructs the Convictions of His Belief.<br/><br/>A Fine Film that is Recommended and Deserves the Attention it has Received because in its Glorious Simplicity it is Accomplished and a Rewarding Experience."
"john-sorich","1","121","257","6 November 2016"," Mel Gibson Snuff Comedy/ Gore Film
","I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here's my opinion.... I don't know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie, since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie But it was more like a Mel Gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird Christian stuff too. <br/><br/>IF it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand (like a shield) while running toward a Japanese position and firing the BAR with one hand. The most shocking part was that they stole the scene from Saving Private Ryan!! The Soldier's started throwing 60mm mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets. ðŸ˜‘ As if that was done on a regular basis. There were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away. (FYI, if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off). ....Followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like Dragon's breath, igniting dozens and dozens of Japanese soldiers. All this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying "" Wow ""<br/><br/>The actual cool part was when they showed the medic, heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge. <br/><br/>My one beef with this movie was that it is NOT A REALISTIC INTERPRETATION of what actually happened in WWII, in ANY sense This was more of a comedy/ glorifying gore... followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie... WHICH, seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate. FAIL!!<br/><br/>Also casting Vince Von to play a Sergeant ðŸ˜‘ with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor, all of it.... epic fail and just hard to watch.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall This was about a 2, and slightly better than staring at a wall..."
"danielmanson","8","6","8","8 March 2020"," Fantastic film
","Okay. Yeah, this film is great. 100% worth watching, it works really well if you don't know the Doss story prior either. Acting, directing and cinematography all brilliant. My only real negatives are that the first half of the film felt longer than it needed to be.
Nothing much else to say, but watch this film if you haven't seen!"
"nhojnivra","7","6","8","13 March 2017"," Impressive performances all around
","Impressive performances all around and Andrew Garfield is surprisingly very effective and who the hell ever saw Spider-Man suiting up as an army medic carrying wounded soldiers overnight?.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge's detailed gruesomeness brought the added heaviness in its story, you'll see the bombs producing a destructive force and flying legs comes with it and bullets penetrating into the skin to the flesh of its victims.<br/><br/>This is Mel Gibson's first movie to direct after a some sort of hiatus in movie directing after Apocalypto (2006), Hacksaw Ridge is indeed his comeback film and he definitely earned a lot of respect again. Gibson has a thing with gore, his The Passion Of The Christ (2004) also dealt with a lot of blood and pain, same thing we saw in Hacksaw Ridge, both were great films in its respected area, so I think, gore is what his signature style should be 'cause he's good at it.<br/><br/>The movie is a decent retelling of one of the most heartfelt and incredible stories during the WWII, the part I'm looking forward to see is Doss saying these words: ""Please Lord, help me get one more. Help me get one more."" and God! That was my favorite slice of the film."

Was there really only ONE rope ladder to climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack?

"stefan-morcov","4","106","226","2 January 2017"," Boring and cheesy
","Great graphics and high budget, of course. The standard boring music doesn't even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain't."
"theinspireroffaith","10","39","76","7 November 2016"," Simply as Good as it could have been
","It has been just a while since the movie released and I have already watched it three times. This movie is beautiful and emotional. Mel Gibson has made a perfect comeback and I do think, not appreciating his work and his film would be totally unfair. The score is the backbone to the film just like Braveheart. I really loved Rupert-Gregson Williams work and I would compare it to likes of Hans Zimmer and Late James Horner. The movie is more about a love story than War, instead this film actually condemns war. If the critics stop their hatred for Mel Gibson then this will certainly be Best Picture and will wind up the whole Academy Awards. Andrew Garfield's intense acting fuels the film and keeps you interested. The only problem that I found in the film was that a lot of actors had their accent, this I found quite minor and not notable. People complaining about the violence will be shocked to see how beautifully Mel has handled those scenes. I would compare it to Saving Private Ryan and I personally feel like I has an edge over Spielberg's Movie. I am myself a Jew and I don't like Mel Gibson for his Anti-Semitic attitude, but denying his art would be wrong. ****I LOVED IT****"

","I was looking forward to watching this film. I heard about Desmond Doss a pacifist war hero was awarded the Medal of Honor. I believed a great story could be told without having to go over the top. It must have been very strange for the other soldiers training and fighting with a man who held such strong beliefs against killing others. I expected the director to look at Mr Doss and his colleagues from a psychological point of view I was hoping to see something akin to Platoon. No! What we got was more akin to Captain America. In the hands of Mel Gibson, Desmond Doss was more of a cartoon character than a real hero. It was so over the top I was actually embarrassed. Now for a fictitious character this movie would be OK. It was well made, well acted, with lots of action. Mel sold this film base don Desmond Doss and then he failed to tell his story. Don't watch this film expecting anything special it is a generic American war film."

"miplaycreate","10","18","32","10 March 2017"," Best movie seen in a long time
","This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. When I thought it'd be just another Hollywood war movie about a typical war hero, it definitely surprised me, especially when it's faithful to the True story.<br/><br/>I was amazed God is everywhere in this movie... in a Hollywood war movie? Wow.<br/><br/>Half way through the movie, I understand that without explaining this soldier's strong Christian faith, this real story cannot be told. Without God, it would not have happened.<br/><br/>** Might have spoilers below **<br/><br/>Without God, a young man named Doss would not stick to the ""thou shall not kill"" commandment even in the bloodiest war zone. He would not have promised God that he would not touch a firearm in the first place, and then volunteered to serve along other soldiers at the front line against the Jap troops. Yes, at the front line without anything protecting himself except his bible and faith in God (you really have to see the movie to see what the bloody war was like).<br/><br/>Without God, Doss would not have persevered even when he joined, when no one else understands/agrees with what he was doing, physically abused him, and almost put him into the war prison for disobeying the order to use a firearm. Many told him to give up and go home. He did not, even though he didn't fully understand why God calls him there. He persevered with his faith in God.<br/><br/>Without God, when his comrades retreated at the Hacksaw Ridge in Japan, Doss would not have stayed, and had faith to re-enter the war zone ALONE and without firearm one time after another to save the wounded, while the Jap troops were everywhere hunting for them. By a simple prayer: ""Lord, please help me get one more."" He saved 75 soldiers (his comrades said it was actually close to a 100 when Doss modestly said 50, so they took the average)<br/><br/>At the saving scene, I was so touched that I told my husband perhaps precisely because God didn't want to leave the wounded soldiers behind to die or to be captured, Doss has been called to be there. And not only that, what he did gave hope to his comrades for a comeback.<br/><br/>Praise the Lord, for He must be behind all this.<br/><br/>Thank you Mel Gibson and the production team because they were very faithful to the truth of this real story.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>I went to check some of the facts and wow they were mostly true, e.g. at historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/hacksaw-ridge/<br/><br/>The real Desmond Doss considers it a _miracle_ that he made it off the ridge on Okinawa. <br/><br/>""His heroics didn't go unnoticed, as fellow soldiers were often amazed he was still alive."" - The Conscientious Objector Documentary<br/><br/>""Doss doesn't hesitate to heal a man in need. He doesn't see skin colour, he doesn't see uniform, he doesn't see an enemy. This is a transcendent act and a rare thing to witness in our culture.""<br/><br/>Final note: Let's not undermine the contribution of the other soldiers who fought and were injured/died at the battlefields, nor justify war itself, but this story of Doss opens up a whole new perspective that if you stick to what God really teaches, something incredible happens."
"matthew-615-809824","3","16","28","3 April 2017"," A Great Story, Poorly Told
","Hacksaw Ridge is ultimately a good film made about a great story that squanders much of its potential with wooden dialogue, countless clichés, and telegraphed punches rather than foreshadowing.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie, I didn't know much about it and somehow missed in the opening credits that it was directed by Mel Gibson, but as I watched, I remember repeatedly saying to myself, ""Man, someone has a persecution complex."" Doss' pacifism was a central theme; it was so integral to the plot, that nobody could have missed it if it had not been treated so heavy-handedly. This would have been much better if it had been a war movie in which the protagonist takes a philosophical stand, rather than a movie about a man being persecuted for his beliefs (often fairly) with the war going on as a sub-plot and vehicle for it.<br/><br/>The grisly violence portrayed in the war scenes failed to create the atmosphere of a battlefield in the same way that better directed movies did; the reliance on graphic violence served to highlight the lack of tension and fear that should have been palpable, as we've been given in Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan, for that matter.<br/><br/>Still, the backbone of truth in the story is strong enough to overcome many of the film's shortcomings. Though most of the characters were just cartoon sketches of real people (many of them pretty cheesy), they were hard not to like... especially Doss himself, and his broken father."

","Just a couple of minor comments that I don't consider spoilers, but you know how it is.<br/><br/>The comment made by my wife as we left the theater today - both of us with shed and unshed tears in our eyes - was simple. ""What a story of commitment, and of faith."" That's what's been missing in what's coming out of Hollywood for so long.<br/><br/>That's what this boils down to. Desmond Doss made a commitment to God to not shed blood, to not kill, to never use a gun in anger. And when we see his childhood and the other events, you can understand it. <br/><br/>But when the Japanese attacked the U.S., he felt the same surge of patriotism as everyone else. He could have taken a pass, but he didn't feel right in staying home. He says in the movie that two guys from his home were found to be 4F and killed themselves from shame. So he didn't feel right in not going.<br/><br/>This is an extremely violent movie, extremely graphic. That's the reality of war. You get to know people during the basic training sequence, and then watch them die. Horrifically. Yet due to his actions, Desmond saved so many more that would have died otherwise. Anyone who complains that the Vince Vaughn drill sergeant is a ripoff of Full Metal Jacket has apparently never served in the military. That was also reality.<br/><br/>This movie will stick with you. People say it's racist against Japanese. That's ALSO how it was then. People will say it's too violent. That's the reality of war. What they miss is that it's also the journey of a man who made his relationship with God, made a promise to God, and kept that promise. ""One more, God, let me get one more."" Hands destroyed from rope burns, exhausted, beaten and battered. ""One more, God, let me get one more."""
"TheMovieDiorama","8","10","16","18 March 2018"," Hacksaw Ridge marks a triumphant return for Mel Gibson.
","Ten years since his last directorial effort 'Apocalypto' and many were wondering if he could match the excellence of his previous work, especially since this hiatus consisted of many controversies for the actor/director. Well, I'm pleased to say that Hacksaw Ridge is most definitely one of the best war films of this century. A bold claim such as this needs proof, and I always say ""proof is in the pudding"". Detailing the efforts of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to carry a weapon, during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese. Illustrating the heroism, valour and bravery of one man who, through inner strength and conviction, saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. I am a sucker for good old fashioned Hollywood stories about a hero who defied all the odds. Everyone and everything was against Doss, including the rest of his unit at first, which automatically creates emotional investment towards our protagonist. You want him to succeed in his endeavours, you want him to prove all the naysayers wrong. He does...and then some. Through visceral direction from Gibson, who honestly directed the heck out of this, Doss was portrayed enigmatically by Garfield. Balancing both innocence and conviction in equal measures to produce a character that breaks your heart. Every facial expression and action Garfield makes feels natural and racks up to be one of his best performances. Supported by an excellent cast, particularly Vaughn, Weaving and Worthington, who provide backstory and development to what could've been expendable assets. The battle scenes were breathtakingly claustrophobic, the usage of blood and violence contradicts the religious subtext in the narrative which further enhances the ideologies of pacifism. Countless bodies on fire and limbs gliding through the explosions, just relentless filmmaking. The overuse of melodrama during the first half did provide an unusual tonal shift for the second half, took me a while to adjust. But, in the end, all I have to say is ""Mel, welcome back!""."
"irishmom58","10","10","16","17 March 2017"," Riveting from the opening frame, hang on and go
","The BEST WWII film I have seen. Better than Band of Brothers, Fury, and Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson is a master cinematographer of the gut- wrenching realism of war, as well as the sweetness of human frailty. I had no knowledge of Desmond Doss nor his bravery. His conviction to his beliefs, faith, and love of country was incredible. Andrew Garfield should have won the Oscar, he is amazing in this film. The depth of character, reading the fear in his eyes, and yet he goes back to save his comrades. Please see this film."
"Pumpkin_Man","10","10","16","26 February 2017"," One of the Best War Movies I've Seen in Recent Years!!!
","I was really surprised with this film. I didn't expect to like it so much. The story and characters are intriguing. The action is bloody and suspenseful. It's all based on a true story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a devoted Christian and refused to carry a firearm during WWII. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Doss, a young man who enlists in the army to help people. He wants to be a medic and save lives, but not kill. Everyone ridicules him for it to the point where he's beaten up, and almost arrested for insubordination. His father helps by sending a letter to the court from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. <br/><br/>Soon enough, he's released and able to join his squad to the battle of Okinawa. During the bloody war, Desmond will do whatever it takes to save the wounded men, even without so much as picking up a gun. His faith and skills are put to the test. I don't usually go for war films, but this one is special. I highly recommend HACKSAW RIDGE!!!"
"sonofjuliet-88330","10","10","16","25 February 2017"," Cannot say enough positives about this movie!
","I don't know what I can add to the other reviews on here. This story of Desmond Doss reminds of the books of David McCullough. He writes his books about people in American history that have too long not received their dues, and it's about time we gave credit where credit is due. That is how I feel about the main character in this movie. Why haven't I ever heard about him before now!? The gore in the battle scenes puts Walking Dead to shame, but it's about time we see what war is really like. It's not about parades and flags and fireworks; it's the hand to hand blood and fire, sweat, and unimaginable fear that these people endured. It is no wonder they are called the greatest generation. Desmond Doss is my new hero because of this movie, and it deserves every nomination it has received for every award. Bravo!"
"somf","9","24","46","26 October 2016"," A triumph for Gibson
","No matter what you think about Gibson, and I don't think much of him as a man. He is an elite director. There is a unique genius in how he handles this film. I hope this does not constitute spoilers, I don't think it really does, but the battlefield scenes are the most harrowing I have ever seen. There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction. You may even think, oh God, this is just too much, as you are watching the battles unfold, but it all results in a unique payoff.<br/><br/>I like Garfield . He is a bit too goofy at the start and I feel like his hairdo makes him look more like the lead guitarist from the Spiders From Mars than a WWII hero. But once he gets in uniform his character really develops. Vince Vaughn seemed to love chewing the scenery as the Sarge, and Teresa Palmer was also solid.<br/><br/>As an agnostic, there was one scene at the end that I felt was a little over the top, but the religious angle is handled beautifully and the power of faith is a great lesson for anyone. This is going to be a real crowd pleaser, but it is decidedly not a family film despite the theme. It is the most violent film that I have ever seen."

The influence of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and especially, Full Metal Jacket, were WAY too obvious.

"paytonsapp","8","27","53","13 November 2016"," Mel Gibson's Triumphant Return
","Mel Gibson returns behind the camera a full 10 years after his last directorial outing in Apocalypto (2006). Mel Gibson has proved to be a master when it comes to direction particularly when he is constructing a battle scene. However, being a full 21 years after Braveheart (1995) I myself was a little worried that Gibson had gotten a little rusty. Regardless of this, when I heard he was going to direct another war film I was very excited to see him back behind the camera. But the question remains. Has Gibson lost a step in his 10 year hiatus from directing? The answer is NO. Mel Gibson has proved that he has perfected his craft and in my opinion he is the best when it comes to crafting a battle sequence. The action is gritty, violent, realistic and most of all, it is absolutely terrifying. The battles in this film resemble a horror movie and a few times I even jumped. The intensity is constantly cranked up to 100% through out the second half of the film. Notice that I said 2nd half, that is because through out the 1st half this film is about the Character of Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman, 99 Homes), struggling to stay true to his beliefs and attempting to prove to his peers that he is no coward. There is also a very heartfelt love story between Doss and his girlfriend Dorothy, played by Teresa Palmer (Lights Out), their relationship in no way feels forced and feels very authentic. I was very shocked when during the first hour there was little to no violence considering this was a Mel Gibson picture, but don't make the mistake of thinking he is only skilled at directing battle scenes because the character build up portrayed by Gibson is enthralling and allows you to invest in the characters as actual people so you care about them when it all goes down. So all in all, Gibson has proved that he is without a doubt one of the top 5 directors working today and he has no doubt earned, in my opinion, an Oscar nomination for Best Director.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was something I worried about and again, I was proved so wrong. Everyone gives an outstanding performance most notably, Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, V for Vendetta), Luke Bracey (Point Break, The November Man) and Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers, The Lost World). <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield proves that he is more than just Spider-Man and he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor or at least a nomination. I have no doubt that he will win several awards and more importantly, his performance will go down as one of the best in recent memory and he truly blew me away. <br/><br/>Luke Bracey gives the most surprising performance I have seen this year, maybe not an Oscar worthy performance but definitely a good, solid performance as a soldier fighting alongside Doss. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving gives maybe the best performance of his since The Matrix and is a possible candidate for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Doss' abusive, drunk father after serving in WWI.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer and really all others involved give great supporting Performances.<br/><br/>I can safely say Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan with brutal, terrifying battle sequences, beautiful cinematography, and incredible performances. Hacksaw Ridge deserves multiple Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture. This will go down as a classic and one of the best war films of all time and I strongly recommended you go see this in theaters ASAP. 10/10"
"orpheus-73398","10","17","31","13 March 2017"," Great come back for Mel Gibson
","This was by far the best picture of the year and a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It didn't win best picture because of the politicization of the Oscars. No way that ""Moonlight"" even came close to this film. To win an Oscar now you have to be non-white and LGBT. It reminds me of how ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to a ho-hum movie ""Shakespeare in Love."" People still watch SPR but who ever talks about the other movie. So I predict that Hacksaw Ridge will become a classic while the other movies is well forgotten. Hacksaw Ridge, on the other hand, is a story that is so unbelievable because it stretches all credibility but hits us in the face because it actually happened. One of those ""no one would believe it if they made a movie"" but it actually happened. The courage of that man going alone, unarmed, except for his faith in God, directly into the mouth of hell. I am not a Christian but the devotional aspect of this movie was very inspiring. I would recommend anyone to see this movie and forget the other movie."
"classicsoncall","10","21","40","5 November 2016"," ""Lord, please help me get one more.""
","""It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.<br/><br/>In terms of battle imagery, this is probably the most relentless, bloody and vicious film yet, even more so than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"". The absolute carnage on display is not for the faint of heart, and there are more than one scene that come out of nowhere to jar the viewer upright in your seat. Director Gibson even utilizes the technique in a civilian scene when Desmond Doss and his brother wind up fighting each other as kids, and Desmond uses a brick to lay out his sibling in a frightening scene, one that establishes Doss's very first insights about the morality of taking a person's life.<br/><br/>I thought Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Desmond Doss was superb during the battle segment which dominated the latter part of the picture. Some of the boot camp scenes came across as somewhat unrealistic to me in as much as Doss seemed to defy his superiors with a smile on his face and sometimes without recrimination, although he did suffer the abuse of his fellow soldiers who thought he was a coward. Another element that seemed to defy logic was how the entire company of men from training wound up in Okinawa together, including the officers from boot camp. Not having been in the military, I don't know how that works, but it didn't seem that likely to me.<br/><br/>Generally, I have a problem with war films that introduce a romantic element, however Desmond's relationship with future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) is handled with careful restraint. The interruption of Desmond's father (Hugo Weaving) at the military court martial proceedings was another one of those elements that seemed to defy credibility, so that's one I'll have to research.<br/><br/>Because of the film's central focus on Desmond Doss and his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge, one might be tempted to believe that this was the only battle he participated in. In fact, Doss also served in the Pacific Theater in the battle campaigns of Guam and Leyte Gulf, earning an entire host of citations for his bravery, including the Medal of Honor. Totally unexpected, but a very welcome conclusion to the picture had clips of the real life Desmond Doss speaking to his experience during the war prior to his death in 2006. Stills of the young Doss bear a remarkable likeness to the actor who portrayed him, thereby adding a further sense of realism to the story in retrospect. Over all, the movie is a remarkable tribute to a man who held a deep conviction and commitment to a higher power while stating ""I figure I'll be savin' people, not killin'."""

","Well, the first hour of Hacksaw Ridge is very sloooow and of course the hero marries a beautiful nurse he met... Yawn. After that you get a long-stretched and far more brutal version of Forrest Gumps Nam-hero scenes, sometimes underlined with very cheesy emotional music. Well, after all the fuzz over Mr. Gibsons behavior he must ofc deliver something to get back a favorable public opinion. I liked Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ a lot, also Apocalypto, and ofc Braveheart, but compared this is rather a weak movie. <br/><br/>I don't know why but between all the explosions and killed soldiers and the gore I don't see why this movie should be a new classic or Oscar material at all. Compared with (anti-)war movies like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Hotel Rwanda and the like I find this output of Mr. Gibson rather mediocre. <br/><br/>Well, sure we get some fine action scenes and lots of gore but this imo don't defines a (anti-) war-movie as a good one, the story of this one is rather stereotypical and stereotypical told and not very interesting - I mean with or without gun, there were and are thousands of medics always ""in action"", without such fuss about having no gun or having a gun. A movie told about a unit of medics, that would have been something to honor those men (and women), but this movie is something about a stubborn Christian guy which in my view is not very likable (all ppl talking to and with god are in my view highly suspicious ;)) I will just raise one question - if those hero has the choice to grab a gun and shoot a Japanese soldier to save one comrades life - what would be his decision!? This movie gives no answer to questions like this and is therefore imo just sentimental and a praise of Christian belief without contributing anything new to the questions war and its realities raise.<br/><br/>And the last ""heroic"" scene - our medic praying and the unit waiting for him to finish before to start the attack and then the attack in slow-mow with VERY cheesy music - this is just bad, a persiflage, a comical end to something who tries to be a movie about a serious matter. In the end our hero even plays football with nades... And ofc with help of the prayer of our hero and the help of the old god of Abraham the US boys beat the evil Japanese. No more to be said.<br/><br/>note: the nades kicking scene raises in my view the question how many ppl our hero killed (friends and enemies) unintentionally in just kicking them away in an overcrowded battlefield like depicted ;)"

"sol-","Null","5","7","5 June 2017"," Brave
","Based on the true story of an army medic who insisted on never carrying a weapon, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells a slice of World War II history that dares to redefine traditional notions of bravery. The graphic battle scenes are very well done with Gibson never shying away from the severity of battle wounds and how precious life in war is. For all is virtues though, the film often feels preachy with the protagonist's religion-motivated pacifism (and how this repulses everyone in the army) repeatedly brought up. A formulaic romance also weighs against the film and some of the casting is downright odd, with Vince Vaughn especially awkward as a drill sergeant who is hardly fearsome and seldom angry. The casting of Hugo Weaving as the medic's father is a stroke of genius though with Weaving stealing every scene as a former war veteran plagued by inner demons and horrific memories of World War I. Andrew Garfield is fine in the lead role, though against 'The Social Network', '99 Homes' and others, it is hardly his best work. Overall, this is an easy to film to recommend for those keen on unflinchingly realistic battle scenes and detailed insights into military bureaucracy. It is hardly a flawless film and perhaps a little message-heavy for its own good, however, it says quite a lot that the movie manages to pack a punch even when one knows about his heroism to come."
"TxMike","Null","5","7","24 April 2017"," Very meaningful WW2 movie, essentially a true story of one man's great bravery.
","We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. Sound and picture are exceptional, I have a good powered subwoofer, at key scenes the whole room was pulsating with the explosions. Mel Gibson directed, one of his sons is a key character.<br/><br/>This is essentially the true, accurate story of Desmond Doss. As a young man in the early 1940s he felt a great obligation to join the Army and fight for his country. But he was a religious young man and had decided that he would never take up a weapon, a gun or rifle, under any circumstances. But he would instead become a medic, one who would go in battle and help the wounded survive.<br/><br/>Much of the first half of the movie involves his early life, his meeting the pretty nurse he would eventually marry, his difficulties during basic training when they tried to break him to receive a discharge. They didn't want a coward in their unit, unaware that Doss was probably the bravest of the bunch.<br/><br/>Most of the second half involves the battle against the Japanese on Okinawa, particularly the effort to take Hacksaw Ridge. The Americans were ambushed, there were many casualties, the healthy retreated down the rope ladder on the ridge. <br/><br/>But Doss all night looked for wounded, dragged or carried them to the ridge, lowered them down. Through the night he saved about 75 men that way, when morning came the officers were amazed, ""Where did all these come from?"" <br/><br/>British actor Andrew Garfield is really good as Desmond Doss. The movie was filmed mostly in Australia, a favorite place of Director Gibson's, and features mostly Australian actors. In fact the only American actor I am sur4e of is Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>All-N-all a fine movie but often difficult to watch for the realistic depiction of the savagery and gore of infantry war.

","Hacksaw Ridge was supposed to be the glorious directorial return of Mel Gibson and is a tale (based on a true story!) about a soldier that refuses to carry a gun and rescues fellow soldiers on a battlefield. Sounds like Oscar worthy idea for a movie, sadly it falls flat on its face on the most basic level - being a good movie...<br/><br/>I was able to watch about half an hour of this movie before I just left the theater. There's so many things that I just couldn't stand. I'll give you few points:<br/><br/>1) in your freaking face catholic propaganda - I felt like 75% of dialogues and characters actions had something to do with catholic religion. Crosses everywhere, main character working for the church, soldiers biting their rosaries in the middle of the battle (so powerful symbolism right, like 'oh god, give me power and forgive me at the same time' or whatever), etc etc 2) lame love story 3) the biggest sin of all - battle scenes. They are absolutely goofy, bonkers and loony tunes cartoonish. How about a shot of guts and corpses interweaved with soldiers walking through this mess? Guts, soldiers, guts, soldiers, corpse, soldiers. I GET IT MEL! How about the guy, who is using dismembered corpse of another soldier as a shield, shooting rambo style, killing 4 enemies in a row. How about grenades and mortars blowing up next to the soldiers who then fly in all directions like freaking rabbits? Why does it feel like all of those soldiers on fire (in the beginning of the movie) were just told to jump on trampolines in greenscreen rooms (yes, special effects are THAT noticeable), and so on and so forth dude...<br/><br/>The last 'in your face' bad war movie (in my opinion of course) was American Sniper directed by Clint Eastwood. There was similar oversaturation of catholic themes, America, questionable motivations of characters, etc. But at least it was watchable, Hacksaw Ridge is just laughably goofy.<br/><br/>2/10"
"shumkae","3","14","26","20 February 2017"," Too much drama
","This is somewhat of a random series of thoughts rather than a cohesive review. But here it goes....<br/><br/>Garfield's portrayal of Doss is creepy and unnatural. I found myself annoyed with the main character to the point where it was hard to watch. <br/><br/>The supporting characters were underdeveloped except for Doss' dad. Everyone else starts out as an army thug jerk, who turns out to be a good guy in the end. <br/><br/>The action is comically bad. At one point a guy picks up a dead body and storms into the battle blocking gunfire with the corpse...?!<br/><br/>The setting of the battle is ridiculous. The Americans have to climb a rope ladder what looks to be about 100-150 ft to the top of the ridge where the Japanese are hiding out. There is nothing stopping the Japanese from cutting the ladder down, or standing at the top of the ladder and raining gunfire down on the Americans. Also, when you google the actual ridge, its about 20-30 ft maximum. The whole battle and setting lacks a sense realism for me.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this film feels unnecessarily dramatic. It's kind of hard to describe but everything from Garfield's performance to the combat scenes to the love story is slathered in a think layer of drama. I guess it's to make up for the lack of a compelling plot but after a while it starts to feel kind of dumb (for a lack of a better word). You get taken out of the story and the remarkable act of bravery to the point where you almost have to laugh (and eye roll) at how bad some of the scenes are. <br/><br/>The true story the film is based on is amazing and needs to be told, but I feel like this movie tries too hard and misses the mark.<br/><br/>I guess you have to watch it because of it Oscar nominations, but its really not that good."
"fieldingm-83135","10","6","9","13 March 2019"," Very Interesting And Suspensful
","I have watched lots of good war movies in my life. The difference between a good and mediocre war movie is the difference of plots and the amount of action. When watching Hacksaw Ridge, you will jump out of your seat and ugly cry until the night is young. The emotional rollercoaster of victories and losses is the perfect balance of war and tranquility. There's bombs, soldiers, and bullets galore. There's also bravery, empathy, and heroism beyond compare. This movie is based on a true story of a soldier who single handedly saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers in World War 2. The virtues and lessons of this movie make it a very interesting and enticing movie to watch.<br/><br/>During a moment of weakness, we tend to feel that there is nothing that we can do that would ever make a difference. That even though we may have completed the task, it would never be as impactful as we had hoped. However Hacksaw Ridge reminds us that no matter how small a victory may seem, it can make some of the biggest differences. During one of the most pivotal scenes in the movie, Desmond Doss is confronted with a very conflicting issue. He finds that he can't bare himself to kill anyone in the very gruesome war that is surrounding him. There is a short moment of pure terror for him because he truly has no idea how he was going to help out for his fellow soldiers, and for his country. However, he finds a whole new task when he sees a fallen soldier in the battlefield, who has no way of getting back to safety. In the spur of the moment he decides that he is going to save all of the men who cannot save themselves due to major injuries. He sacrificed his life to save ll of the soldiers that he did. Even though he wasn't fighting on the field, like he was intended to, he single-handedly saved 75 soldiers during that war. His story is one that people will remember for a very long time, and his nobility and sacrifices are what makes this movie so impactful.<br/><br/>This movie also has a great way of balancing dramatic scenes with calmer ones. It blends the two together seamlessly and leaves the viewers crying from laughter then screaming in terror as a character they love gets thrown into peril. That's another great thing about this movie. The director wasn't afraid to put the main characters into a vulnerable position. In a typical war hero movie, the character or ""hero"" is usually seen as the almighty person who could never be defeated. However the roles can be completely reversed in this movie and it is very refreshing. In the movie you have the actor who plays Desmond Doss, Darcy Bryce, who is known for his emotional, yet impactful performances. He brings just the right balance of wit, strength, and vulnerability to really pull of the role of Desmond Doss. In a few particular scenes during the war, he has a sort of inner turmoil going on inside of his head that is narrated throughout the movie. These narrarations let us know that he is truly scared for his future, and this adds not only to the seriousness of the situation, but also to the overall performance. Hacksaw ridge isn't your typical war story. You get to see first hand, what it's like for the hero to lose a battle, whether it be a physical or mental battle.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is not for the faint of heart. Yes, there is a little something for everyone in the movie including comedy, action, and heroism. However it sticks to the original story, which is a gruesome one. This movie is for those who seek a good hearted war story that has a historical background. Hacksaw Ridge stays true to the original events that actually happened, and this promotes an honest and wholesome story that everyone can learn from. The act of selflessness can be a pretty hard topic to try and cover, because it is such an expansive topic, and people tend to just brush off the idea or purpose of it. This is because it's hard; people don't want to put others safety and well being in front of their own. However I think it's something that people could really learn from, and I think that Hacksaw Ridge portrays the true meaning of this really well."

","This movie took me by surprise. I had heard of it, but since I rarely go to the actual theater to see films these days, it wasn't really on my radar. My husband and I were looking for something to rent on a rainy night and we chose this one. I like history-based films, including war films, even though I kind of hate films with gratuitous violence. Well, this film is brutal, but there is nothing gratuitous about it. It takes a common and very effective approach by telling a true, harrowing story through the lens of one individual, what got him there, and how he lived it. <br/><br/>I like that the movie addresses the main character's childhood and what drove him to become a faith-based conscientious objector. I also like that he is an actual person, an historic figure. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was probably based on someone, but we don't know exactly who....or at least that person was never interviewed or identified. It was an effective film, a great one. But I liked this one better.<br/><br/>I would never have believed this guy was real had I not seen him interviewed. It seemed impossible to believe. But again, when you see the historic backdrop, it comes into focus. It was a different time, a different country. You come to understand how he came to believe what he did and was able to do what he did without ever losing his humanity.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are absolutely brutal, but entirely real. My brother is a huge history buff and knows everything about WWII, and he can attest to that. The visuals take your breath away, though not in a good way. You see a lot of what are now considered ""war tropes,"" clichés, in this film. Well, now you see their origin, and why they are for real. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is a vague review because I don't want to spoil anything. I am not saying this is a perfect film. It has its flaws. I am no fan of Gibson as a person, and it probably helps that I didn't even know he had was the director when I watched it. But that's another matter. <br/><br/>Garfield is excellent, but honestly I was also impressed with the supporting cast and particularly with Vince Vaughan. I have always liked him and he fits this role really well. Like his character, he never takes himself too seriously. It works for the film.<br/><br/>If you like character-driven films, based on true stories, and can handle terrifying scenes (IMO), then watch this. It's an eye-opener."

","Despite all the controversies that Mel Gibson has around him as a person few will argue about his immense talent as a filmmaker. He has proved himself to be one of the most consistent directors working today and Hacksaw Ridge is some of the best work he's done in his entire career <br/><br/>The core story of this film is simply fascinating, a man who went into one of the worst engagements of the Second World War without any kind of weapon to defend himself with and this story is one that the viewer can easily get behind because it is so well established why Doss feels the need to do this while not shining him in a truly heroic light. Plenty of time is devoted to his opponents and it's also made clear why they oppose his views as it is understandable why they wouldn't feel they could depend on him to defend them in battle and there is room for the audience to decide where they stand in this argument. <br/><br/>One of this films greatest strengths is the fact that it's puts all its characters, as well as the actors who play them, first. Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, gives the best performance of his entire career in this film he just perfectly played Doss' constant inner struggle while always remaining optimistic. Vince Vaughn's role in this film had made me curious in the lead up to this film but it's easy to say that he exceeded all of my expectations, not only was he hilarious as a drill instructor but he gave some very good serious moments that made me like his character all the more and makes me want to see more of this kind of role from him. Teresa Palmer was also great in this movie she had excellent chemistry with Garfield and I absolutely bought her as a love interest. Hugo Weaving blew me away in this movie, I've never seen this kind of work from him, he was so believable as this torn up man who has had some much taken away from him by war.<br/><br/>He first half of this film mainly focuses of Doss' romance with his future wife and his motivations for his pacifism and while it's defiantly a bit slow and cheesy at times it worked very well. I loved the romance between Garfield and Palmer it was such a sweet relationship an one I could easily get behind. When we eventually got to the training portion of this film it became all the more engaging, seeing Doss face opposition at every turn was extremely engaging, you got a clear sense to both sides of the argument and perfectly set up the horrors that were to come in the next act. This film switched from an engaging drama to a terrifying experience in an instant and it worked to perfection. Everything the war was built up to be came to ahead and made it clear just how hard it was gong to be for a Doss to keep up his pact but it was no less engaging and was even more so. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson directed this film masterfully, he directions action like no other director working today. He doesn't show the battle of Okinawa in a glamorised way but as it was, as a hellish experience with very little hope of survival for the soldiers who thought in it. Even when bullets aren't flying he kept a consistent tension throughout this entire act that never let up. <br/><br/>My only real issue with Hacksaw Ridge was some aspects of the way it concluded, it feels as if Doss has proved something to his fellow soldiers and feels as if more could be explored now that he has but instead the film concludes in a very abrupt way that left me feeling as if they're was still more waiting to be explored and experienced. <br/><br/>Despite some aspects of its conclusion, Hacksaw Ridge worked on every other level. It was incredibly touching, harrowing and intense. While it was easy to get behind Doss as a character there were plenty moments where it felt as if they're was room to see the perspective of others in his views. When the war sequences begin they are depicted as they should be and in no way way that is glamorous or clean. I adored Hacksaw Ridge and I can't wait to see what Mel Gibson does next as a director. <br/><br/>9.5/10-A (Phenomenal)"

Desmond T. Doss.

","Desmond Doss is a hero. In the middle of total carnage he is out there saving lives. This should serve as the basis for a great movie. This movie comes close to being just that, a great movie, but just misses the mark. It has lots of action and excellent acting set in a time and place that is still known and remembered with reverence today. But most of all, it is about a man who stays true to his principles, and against all odds triumphs. The battle of Okinawa is depicted in all its gory violence. Soldiers on both sides are dying by the hundreds. Through it all, Desmond Doss does his duty, which, as a medic, is to save lives. Nothing stops him, not even a grenade. And if that isn't enough, he's married to a beautiful young lady who adores him and whose photograph he carries in his Bible, which she gave him as a present and which he takes into battle. To tell this story, the director Mel Gibson, pulls out the stops. It is Hollywood through and through. From the confrontation scene in the barracks, to the presence of the overbearing sergeant, to the inclusion of the devoted girlfriend, the hero perseveres and finally proves himself on the battlefield, proving all his detractors wrong. If someone wants to watch a movie about a hero, this is the movie to watch."
"stevenrotherforth","9","6","9","27 July 2017"," Hollywood falls back in love with Gibson
","Hacksaw ridge<br/><br/>Looking back over Mel Gibson's career the quality of the work that he has produced is staggering. Movies such as Braveheart, Apocalypto and The passion of the Christ show what a serious film maker he is. Such a shame then that Hollywood fell out of love with him. There is no denying that Gibson has made several films with such skill that he can be regarded among directional giants such as Spielberg, Scott and Scorsese. Gibson's return to the helm is welcome with Hacksaw Ridge. A true story about war hero Desmond Doss a conscientious objector who enlisted into the army during World war 2. Played here by the Oscar worthy Andrew Garfield, Doss refused to use a gun. Branded as a coward and a loon by his fellow comrade in arms he believed he could do more good by serving as a medic. The film depicts the struggle and persecution of a man who would prove to be a hero. A hero who would stand by his beliefs no matter the cost. One of the most fascinating facts about this film is that it struggled to get made because of the lack of consent from Desmond Doss. He believed he wasn't a hero, just a man doing his duty. I can honestly say that this film does the great man justice and sir you are indeed a hero.<br/><br/>Gibson's film is superbly realised on screen with epic performances by all cast members. Hugo Weaving is mesmerising as Desmond's broken father. A man who also served and is crushed by war. He begs for his sons not to enlist and wants to spare them of the horrors that he has witnessed. Vince Vaughn is terrific as Sgt Howell. Refreshing to see him acting in a serious role instead of the mediocre comedies we have become used to seeing him in. Sam Worthingtons faded star gets chance to shine once more as he plays a Captain who is so against Doss's beliefs. It is heartfelt when our hero proves him wrong and the Captain must humbly beg for his forgiveness.<br/><br/>Gibson's direction is good here too. Even if the film starts down the path of a sickly sweet Hallmark movie. The film soon becomes deadly serious when the art of war is displayed in full high definition on screen. A gripe I have is that the CGI explosions and dismembered appendages look a little too polished. Maybe a stripped back approach using more practical effects would have given the film an extra layer of authenticity. This is nitpicking though as the action scenes are epically staged and immerse the audience in the moment. Sound design is ear shatteringly good as bullets whizz passed the ear. I think Hacksaw ridge compares well to other modern classic war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, although it may not be remembered with the same affection. SPR was a game changer in this particular genre and will always be regarded as so. Hacksaw ridge can be remembered for it own merits. A compelling story about a true hero. Wonderful performances by a superb cast and a return to form for one of Hollywoods finest talents. Mel Gibson I salute you."

","In this Mel Gibson (Braveheart, Lethal Weapon) directed film, screenplay by Robert Schenkkan (All the Way, The Quiet American) and Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner, Full Frontal), Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman, Never Let Me Go) stars as Desmond Doss, the WWII American Army Medic who refuses to hold a weapon. <br/><br/>Brought up as a Seventh Day Adventist, with a drunken wife-beating father, possibly because he is former soldier and survivor of WWI, Tom (Hugo Weaving: The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings) and God-fearing mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths: My Best Friend's Wedding, Saving Mr Banks), Desmond vows never to raise his hand in violence. Following a serious accident where Desmond uses his belt as a tourniquet, he meets Dorothy (Teresa Palmer: I Am Number Four, Warm Bodies) a nurse, who he immediately falls in love with.<br/><br/>With the outbreak of War, Desmond feels he must fight alongside his fellow man and joins the Army where he meets several other new recruits, such as Hollywood Zane (Luke Pegler: Fool's Gold, See No Evil) and Smitty Riker (Luke Bracey: Point Break, The November Man) and his commanding officer Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn: The Internship, The Wedding Crashers). All goes well until weapons training and he refuses to pick up a gun. When threats by Howell and his Captain, Jack Glover (Sam Worthington: Avatar, Terminator Salvation) and a sustained campaign to get rid of the 'coward' do not work, the Army takes him to court, but with help from his father, it is proved to be against his constitutional rights. Once the company makes it to war, the 1945 battle of Okinawa, his comrades begin to see what Desmond is really made of.<br/><br/>This powerful film, based on a true story, is a little gem. From the very beginning we see, through the eyes of the protagonist, the joys and heartaches of life, love in it's many forms and the brutality and ultimate futility of war. <br/><br/>Not for the squeamish, for me the war scenes evoked echoes of Saving Private Ryan for their authenticity of what man can do to his fellow man, but never in a glorified way. But it is the highs and lows that Doss experiences in this part of his life that really pulls you along on this emotional journey with him. Dealing with all the issues surrounding war, including the psychological impact and after effects, by both the father and son.<br/><br/>With exceptional performances both from Garfield, who truly proves his acting chops in this movie, and the supporting cast, including a sublime Weaving and surprising Vaughn, where all the characters get to be more than two-dimensional, this is a courageous film that deserves to be ranked with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers."

Desmond Doss climbed with the troops to the top of the Hacksaw Ridge. All they can saw was the smoke everywhere with much body on the ground. They even could hear their breath sounds. The build of tense atmosphere here is very good. Suddenly someone was killed then I found the degree of tragic more than I imagined before. There are many soldiers were killed by Japanese and also a lot of soldiers were wounded. Desmond Doss tried his best to save people and he never give up. After a whole day, the US military was beaten back by suicide attack but Desmond Doss lost his time to retreat because of saving people.<br/><br/>In the next night, the US military found that many wounded on the top was hanging down one by one. That's what Desmond Doss did. No matter how he got tired, he still never give up. He just said: Let's me save one more. And when he saved more than one, he just repeated of these words: One more.<br/><br/>You can see it on HTTP://www.yidioo.com/ for free. No one thought he could survive after the war.

Doss and the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge in 1945.<br/><br/>Let me reiterate that this movie, directed by Mel Gibson, is R-Rated due to violence and blood only. This movie is not for anyone who cannot stand the site of blood---I watched the HD version (not 3-D) but every time someone got shot, it seemed like 3-D and reminded me of a Slasher movie and a zombie movie all in one with the gore. NOTE: If you have Military Related PTSD, this movie will likely trigger you!<br/><br/>OK; that being warned-- Mel Gibson out-did himself with this movie!!<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield (Spider-Man) portrayed his best acting ever and in surprise, Vince Vaughn was a key actor in the movie and not one ounce of comedy here and he out-did himself as well.<br/><br/>Private Doss was the first ever, Medal of honor recipient which is the highest medal next to the purple heart. He joined the Army to be a combat medic. Due to his Christian values of ""Shall Not Kill"" he refused to ever touch a weapon of any kind. The first half of the movie takes the audience through boot camp and faced with a Court Martial for disobeying several orders to go through rifle training which he refuses. Will his company (fellow soldiers) stand with him or against? There is a Court Martial Trial in the movie.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie (not really a spoiler here since it's based a true events; but when his platoon retreats down a 75-100 ft. ridge as Navy destroyers fire suppression rounds on the ridge to take out the Japanese forces, Private Doss runs back into the blasts and enemy gunfire equipped with only his Bible and a picture of his wife, he is faced with being shot at and going after wounded soldiers.<br/><br/>Private Doss single-handedly saved 75 men including 2 Japanese soldiers by lowering them down the ridge one at a time. Private Doss lived to be 87-years old (2006).<br/><br/>The movie is just over 2-hours with about 1-hour of blood and gore but at the same time, he was quoted for praying out to God and asking, ""Just let me save one more..."" of which he repeated about 70 times.<br/><br/>God was definitely there and I sure felt Jesus' presence through the eyes of Garfield, who no doubt was channeling Private Doss during the movie. I give this 10/10!<br/><br/>I am constantly trying to watch mostly Godly movies these days and ... WoW....Just WOW!!<br/><br/>(Highly Recommended ages 18+)."

","Directed by Mel Gibson, I knew this was one movie to look forward too. Starring Andrew Garfield as war medic who chose to serve in World War 2 but not to kill, the movie explores a very unique side of war. In the first part of the movie, we get to know Desmond Doss, our protagonist played by Garfield. We see his trials and tribulations (literally) for following his beliefs. In the next part, we see non-stop action where Garfield's character proves his bravery in battle. The casting choice was brilliant and all the supporting casts have a chance to shine. Hugo Weaving, an already talented actor gave a great performance as Garfield's troubled father, while Vince Vaughn gets to shine as a no-nonsense Sargeant ( which is surprising considering I used to see him in comedic roles). Sam Worthington was also great as Garfield's superior. In the movie, Gibson is able to display the gruesome violence of war without really criticizing war. This is not exactly an antiwar movie, it is just a movie about how a pacifist can apply his beliefs even in war. The soldiers in the movie are portrayed as real humans, with fears. Even the nameless Japanese fighting our protagonists are shown as normal people fighting for their lives. You can say it is an antiwar movie without looking like an antiwar movie. It does not preach pacifism, it just focuses on one pivotal moment in the protagonist's life and this focus makes the movie engaging. The war scenes are really gruesome, as you would expect from a Mel Gibson movie, but the gore serves to heighten the stakes, and not done for just the sake of gore. In short, this is a terrific war drama that delivers without being too weepy, and contains a lot of action and tension. Looking forward to the next Mel Gibson directed movie."

I don't want to explain the whole story again, so here are my pro's and con's about Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>+ The cast. Andrew Garfield at it's best. He plays the jerk in the beginning so well, his smile, his eyes, everything seems so real to me. His voice and how he turns into a soldier more and more is unbelievable. Also liked Teresa Palmer and Sam Worthington. But well, everyone was great. + The story, because almost everything is true. It's simple but so gross and sad. It's not like there's much backgroundinformation to know about, it's just the story of a young soldier saving people in a part of the 2nd ww. + simply: the setting. Everything's dusty and dark and totally destroyed, you can almost feel how hopeless everyone is because the environment is bombed and full of corpses. + The love story. Usually I don't like love stories like this, but I think it's an important point to show what Desmond is going to give up to follow his opportunities. It was simple but so cute and perfect. + The music. Not too much, not too less. Only at the parts where it was necessary and it fitted perfectly. + The original speeches of the soldiers in the end. It almost brought tears to my eyes. + That it wasn't too patriotic. Don't get me wrong, but I don't like movies where people are like ""we are the heroes, everyone else is the pure devil"" + It shows how gross and sad the war is for everyone, not only for American people. + It don't portrays the Japanese people as some kind of faceless killers without a soul.<br/><br/>What I don't liked: - That everyone had it's special role. I don't liked that, for example, in the hobbit, too. There's the small one, the young one, the old one, the I don't know one. Here we've got the teacher, the thin one, the naked one, bla bla. Hm, not that cool. - They should've done the film a bit longer, I don't know. It doesn't showed that much of a character development and for example the love story, it was like: HEY THERE - married. You know? - They don't showed a few important facts in the end. In reality, Desmond rolled over the.. (don't know the word) and wanted to save other people first. Actually he got hit by a sniper, but Gibson don't wanted to show that because it might look too unrealistic to be true.<br/><br/>To sum up: Hacksaw Ridge is an almost perfect movie for people who like love stories and war movies at the same time. It's so inspiring that someone did believe in something so hard and became a hero, even if the conditions are the worst. It was kind of sad, interesting, terrifying and funny at the same time. Really well done!"

"peterp-450-298716","8","6","9","1 March 2017"," You think ""Saving Private Ryan"" was gruesome and bloody .... This will blow your socks off.
","""Help me get one more."" <br/><br/>Even the worst horror can't make me look at the screen with disgust. But the moment one of these American soldiers set his hand on a seemingly lifeless body, a hysterical scream sounded and all hell broke loose, it did. The image of that unfortunate soldier whose body is torn to pieces by a devastating hail of bullets, took my breath away abruptly. And that's the start of a brutal and bloody narrative. Yet another unknown story, doomed to disappear in the annals of this terrible great world war. Again the story is infused with some goody-goody events. Plus it has a high ""outcast becomes ultimate hero"" level. But that's the only criticism I can think of. For the rest, this is an emotionally shattering film.<br/><br/>The film immediately begins with a slow motion footage of the battlefield. A chaotic war scene. Infantrymen are shot to pieces. Japanese soldiers are running towards a certain dead. Disemboweled bodies. A pile of mangled corpses. And when there's a sign of life, they are mercilessly burned with a flamethrower. After a while you wonder if this isn't a bit exaggerated. But then again, for those who weren't there, it's difficult to imagine the hell these soldiers were in. And even while sitting safely in your lazy chair watching this horrifying spectacle, the realistic sound effects and gruesome images will make you sh*t your pants out of sheer anguish for sure. And this, my friends, was just a foretaste.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" jumps back in time after this introduction. Back to the rustic rural life in Virginia where Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up. His pacifism was sparked the day he nearly killed his brother after hitting him in the head with a heavy brick. But he wants to serve his country and voluntarily signs up for the army. His family felt as though they have been hit by a bomb (no pun intended). Especially his father Tom (Hugo Weaving) , an ex-soldier who survived the 1st world war. When it turns out that Desmond stubbornly continues to refuse to touch a weapon, his training becomes a series of harassment by fellow soldiers and the military command does everything to get rid of him. But a verdict is delivered by the court-martial, after an ultimate interference by his father, stating that he may serve his country without taking up arms. So armed with nothing but a pocket-sized bible Desmonds he's off to the front. Hell on the island of Okinawa.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is divided into two contrasting parts. On the one hand the cozy, peaceful first part where the sprightly Desmond tries to seduce his future wife and where he enrolls after which he starts his training. And on the other the bloody battle on the island of Okinawa. Actually it's almost the same format as used in ""Full metal jacket"". The stereotype of the average medic serving in a war, whose job is to take care of the wounded on the battlefield, is being refined here in no time. That image of the huddled, frightened soldier with a red cross on his helmet is replaced by a heroic, self-sacrificing soldier who would walk through fire for his fallen comrades. And this image is reinforced by the figure Desmond, a conscientious objector who's running around the battlefield like a Speedy Gonzales and rescues abandoned soldiers who were doomed to die there. Unfortunately, this message was just a little bit exaggerated in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's not only the images of this war that'll leave an impression on you, but also the rather magnificent acting. Andrew Garfield plays in a convincing way the devout and sometimes seemingly naive Desmond. By smiling constantly in a retarded way, it looks as if he isn't right in his mind (No wonder he joined the army voluntarily). In addition, we see a few brilliant supporting roles such as the one from Vince ""Term Life"" Vaughn (again proof he can play something different than a goofy not-so-funny part) as drill sergeant Howell and Hugo Weaving as Desmond's father. But most impressive is the fact that this is all based on true facts and that Desmond Doss was the first conscientious objector who was awarded the ""Medal of Honor"" for ""conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action"".<br/><br/>In my opinion this film primarily showcases stupidity of mankind. A portrait of the madness during this World War. The senseless waste of young lives while trying to conquer an insignificant rock (A bit like ""Hamburger Hill"". Only in reverse). I'm convinced that many of those heroic soldiers were asking themselves what the hell they were doing there at that time. I bet they didn't see the point anymore of this whole operation. But stop the lingering. Orders are orders. Forward, straight ahead meeting your own demise. Madness! <br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man.

"alanpgini","10","7","11","5 July 2017"," A Tour de Force, a must see
","Mel Gibson astounds with this, the best movie he has ever made. A true story that pulls no punches, and has more upfront carnage than any war movie I have ever seen. But it doesn't lose sight of the story of this incredible man, who attains the highest honor, without abrogating his values. Most critics who are obviously agnostic or atheist, seem to want to obsess on the main characters religious values. Meanwhile,you don't even see them as being relevant to the story at all. The only ones that seem to see such a focus is these critics themselves. I didn't see anything overtly religious, till I read some reviews after watching the movie. The acting was also sterling on all fronts. You cant miss seeing this movie."
"amerbajramovic","9","7","11","15 June 2017"," Unbelievable story
","First of all, and maybe the most important, this a true story! That should be underlined in my review as much as it is in a movie. And I'll try to do it.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is by far one of the best war movies we have right now and probably in a whole movie history. It can easily pair Private Ryan with no doubt. Let's start with graphics and scenery. It is just amazing. It almost feels like you were there with Dos while he was running around dead and violated bodies of his comrades. The horror of a WWII and pretty much any war is depicted awfully realistic. Not for a weak stomach.<br/><br/>Let's head back to the start to say how touching and loving romance we have there. I think that love story of Hacksaw Ridge can make anyone jealous. Their love is so unconditional and without borders. Cute in a way, funny at a moments and truly great. I like that fusion between slow, nice beginning and chaos afterwards.<br/><br/>Notable thing when it comes to war and this movie has it is an objectiveness. Japanees are not described as monsters like in many war movies that are entirely black and white. Good guys are totally white while bad guys are monsters, murderers, invaders, psychopaths... Enemies in Hacksaw Ridge are people that only stand on an opposing side.<br/><br/>Acting of the whole crew is for an award. Andrew was amazing pick, even though he misses a mustache. His courage, defending of his ideals, faith... it all just made him an astonishing character.<br/><br/>Sticking to the original story made me give this movie a big plus. Even the dialogues, prayers, I think even screams were, or at least tried to be, real and just as they actually have been. And again, the bare fact that is is a true story, which is confirmed at the end, is just an amazing fact and definitely something that will sell this movie to anyone who likes a quality acting and a great, true story."

","Plot Overview: ​An incredible true story about Desmond Doss(Andrew Garfield), a religious soldier who went into Hacksaw Ridge as a battle medic... while refusing to hold a gun.<br/><br/>Directed by Mel Gibson<br/><br/>Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn and Teresa Palmer<br/><br/># NO SPOILERS! <br/><br/>Overall: This is one of the best war movies I've seen in a very, very long time. Say what you want about Gibson's personal life, but this movie proves he can direct.<br/><br/>Would Recommend!<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was phenomenal as Desmond Doss and really made the character shine. Teresa Palmer was great of Dorothy Doss. Vince Vaughn was good as Sergeant Howell but his character didn't exist and it really takes away from his performance. Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington were pretty good as Smitty and Captain Glover respectively. Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the drunken dad, Tom Doss. The character development was admirable.<br/><br/>It's a phenomenal, inspiring, emotional and beautifully written story that 100% needed to be made. I'm not a religious man but the way Gibson depicted it in the movie made me respect and truly admire his dedication to his faith. This was true until the end when I though the religious symbolism went too far and pushed too hard. I also feel the tribute at the end could have had more of an impact.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent and it's grittiness really showed the atrocities of war.<br/><br/>The effects were nigh flawless.<br/><br/>This movie showed the incredible story of courage and belief that is Desmond Doss. It also shows the barbaric nature of war and shows the torment and abuse Doss faced along his way.<br/><br/>The religious beliefs of Doss are definitely present but, not until the end, are not crammed down your throat. The attempts at humour succeeded. I admire how they didn't hold back on violence and the movie genuinely benefited from it. I think it could have had a better title because 'Hacksaw Ridge' makes you think more about the battle instead of Doss. The cleanup montage after Doss goes back into Hacksaw Ridge felt rushed and boring.<br/><br/>Personally, I was enthralled in this movie from start to finish and I enjoyed immensely.<br/><br/>10/10"

I doubt another cast could have even touched on the amount of emotion and powerful performances as well as this one. No one was wrongly casted, in fact the very opposite. I've hesitated watching anything attached to Mel Gibson but his character and person has nothing to do with his professional life and abilities and this one sure did shine. Why are there not more stories of these unbelievable men, and I'm sure there are plenty of them?

Doss refused to touch a gun, but knew he could serve his country's efforts as a medic. During one of the deadliest battles in all of the Pacific Theater, the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the unarmed medic saved 75 wounded soldiers, dragging them to safety. Doss would be decorated by President Truman for his bravery.<br/><br/>Kudos to Gibson. This movie is arguably one of the most graphic, gory and violent war films in a very long time.

The story was excellent, the visuals were gory but necessary for this particular tale. I found the underground network of tunnels interesting since I had read about those but never saw them. 75 guys were taken off that ridge by the one medic, that's an impressive feat and at the end, they did several short interviews of the real-life people from these events. I also notice since Mel built a church on his property, he tends to give God more of a spotlight in his films now, thus the Bible and Christian belief are featured in this film. Cheers"
"gary-91216","9","7","11","28 February 2017"," Plenty of action for those who are patient enough to wait for it
","Those who like their action movies to be founded in fact will enjoy this film. The heroism as depicted on screen is hard to believe, although in reality Army Medic Desmond T. Doss really did indeed achieve what any normal human being would imagine to be the impossible. While it understandably takes a while for the background story to be established, once the action starts the 'lead to air' ratio increases to the max. Director Mel Gibson and crew clearly pulled out all the stops to make the action scenes as realistic as possible. Some might even say the combat scenes are a little overdone, but then again you would have had to have been there to know for sure. Despite the various references to 'action' in this review, it's important to conclude by emphasizing the movie also tells a great story and encourages the viewer to reflect on the human costs of war."

Not that he was not good but he was not that convincing of a drill Sargent, but he was humorous, and it's a humor that really adds to the story. Hugo waving was just OK too.<br/><br/>But man was this a great war epic. Top notch right there in the battle.

"jordymann","8","7","11","25 February 2017"," Unspoiled Narrative of Heroism
","I have never had to suffer through a drought in our modern culture of well-made, dramatic war movies. With each new year, directing a film that can hold up to Saving Private Ryan, Flags of Our Fathers or even Black Hawk Down seems to be an impossible task, and yet it is done time and time again. Hacksaw Ridge is a chilling yet honoring account of the only Congressional Medal of Honor recipient who was a conscientious objector in WWII. Based on the trials and tribulations of U.S. Army medic Desmond T. Doss, director Mel Gibson put together a film and cast to make him worthy of a spot high on the list of top movie directors, (and he wasn't even an actor in it this time!)<br/><br/>From scene one Gibson sets the tone of the movie and sticks to his ""guns"". The film opens with a scene from hell, the typical horror of a combat scene sparing no eyes from shattered bones, searing flesh and the typical carnage. Then, to give some background, we are thrown years back and halfway around the world to the peaceful green hills of Virginia and Doss' childhood, years before American involvement in WWII. Due to a childhood accident, and his war veteran father's alcoholic rage, Doss becomes a pacifist, and from here vows to never kill another man. With some luck and a few cunning words, Doss manages to escape court-martial, and gain the trust of his comrades, but would be the only one to fight unarmed. What follows is Gibson's retelling of a pivotal battle in the Pacific theatre on the island of Okinawa, and the true account of this lionhearted peacemaker.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson knows what people like in a dramatic war movie. Using this man's unique life as a timeline, the movie is a well-made, cohesive piece and is a vital objective in the mission to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Flow from childhood to adulthood and from basic training to the Pacific front is fluidic which deepens the storyline. Massive, wide view camera shots are used in the latter half of the film, and convey a sense of awe that is required in a drama like this. Large scope views show the imposing cliff side of the island, the thunderous power of the U.S. battleships and the immense number of enemy soldiers. Numerous aerial shots are used to show the battlefield, and I can tell Gibson spares no expense to show why this place is called Hacksaw Ridge, and the reality that good men died to protect our freedom.<br/><br/>The familiar faces I recognized from previous films were aptly used by Gibson to shape the main character into who he culminated into at the end. Hugo Weaving personates Doss' father and is the initial source of Doss' pacifism. Yet later provides a solid foundation as Doss battles with his personal beliefs. As Doss's commanders, Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington use their unique personalities to push the main character to his physical and emotional limits, and help provide some light humor to lighten the tone.<br/><br/>Typical of American war movies, faith, family and the U.S.A. play an integral part, and Gibson uses this without malevolently stating his personal beliefs or being preachy. I think we clearly need to be reminded of the real people like Desmond Doss, and what we need to stand for as a country and as a culture. True heroism was translated from legend to screen, and unspoiled by bad acting or directing."
"richard-davis-987-676615","9","17","33","30 April 2017"," Ignore the critics
","Quite a few critics in the UK have panned this film as ""schmaltzy"" or a ""pastiche"" of warfare films. Ignore them. <br/><br/>Bottom line is - the story is fairly slow to get going. It's too slow to get through the back-story of his early life and only gets going after Doss arrives at Fort Jackson for basic training. From that moment on, the film starts to build up to what this is really all about - how he won the Medal of Honor (which is not a spoiler). <br/><br/>When they get to Hacksaw Ridge, there's 5-6 minutes of warfare gore that is totally full-on. Rightly so - it's disrespectful to those that served and died to depict their sacrifice and experience as anything other than unbelievably awful. <br/><br/>Then, just sit back and watch what Doss did next. It's an inspiring story. Can't believe I've never heard of this inspirational story of courage before now. Watch it and be prepared to shed a tear."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","17","33","18 March 2017"," In God, and Doss, we trust
","Those dreaded words – ""Based On A True Story"" – emerge again from the blackness of the opening page. Actually, no. In a move that could be considered arrogant if it wasn't so well researched, here we even lose the first two words. <br/><br/>When a war film is described as being ""visceral"" then you know you need to steel yourself mentally for what you might see. But given that this film is based around the horrendously brutal combat between the Americans and the Japanese on the Pacific island of Okinawa in 1945 this is a warning well-founded. For the battle scenes in this film are reminiscent of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in their brutality: long gone are the war films of John Wayne where there would be a shot, a grasp of the stomach and a casual descent to earth.<br/><br/>But before we get to the battle itself, the film has a leisurely hour of character building which is time well spent (although it could have perhaps been trimmed a tad tighter). Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield, ""The Amazing Spiderman"", ""Never Let Me Go"") grows up a God- fearing youngster in the beautiful surroundings of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. His alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving, ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix"") has been mentally traumatised by the First World War, further strengthening Desmond's fervent belief in following the Ten Commandments; most notably ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". But his patriotic sense of duty is also strong, and Doss signs up after Pearl Harbor and is posted to a rifle brigade that – given his refusal to even touch a rifle – puts him on a collision course with the US Army. It also (obviously) disrupts his romance with nurse sweetheart Dorothy (Teresa Palmer).<br/><br/>This is really two films in one, with the first half setting up extremely well the characters that make the second half so effective. For you care – really care – for what happens to most of the characters involved, especially the zealous and determined Doss who has nothing to face the Japanese hoards with but a medical bag. The feelings that comes to top of mind are awe that these real people actually had to go through this horror and hope that in today's increasingly unstable political world we will never need to again face such inhumanity of man against man again.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield really carries this film, and his Best Actor Oscar nomination is well-deserved. He is perfectly cast as the (onward) Christian soldier. Also outstanding is Hugo Weaving in an emotional and persuasive role playing opposite Rachel Griffiths (""Saving Mr Banks"") his wife. But the real acting surprise here for me was Vince Vaughn (""The Wedding Crashers"") who plays the no-nonsense platoon Sergeant Howell: never one of my favourite actors, here he brings in a warm and nuanced performance that ends with a memorable action scene. <br/><br/>Also worthy of specific note is Dan Oliver (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and his team of special effects technicians, the stunt teams (led by Kyle Gardiner and Mic Rodgers), production designer Barry Robinson and the hair and makeup team, all of who collaborate to make the final half of the film so gripping. <br/><br/>The film marks a comeback from the film society 'naughty step' of Mel Gibson after his much publicised fall from grace in the mid- noughties. A Best Director Oscar nomination would appear to cement that resurrection. For this is a phenomenal achievement in direction and one that should be applauded.<br/><br/>The film bears closest comparison with the interesting two-film combo from Clint Eastwood – ""Flags of our Fathers"" (from the American viewpoint) and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (from the Japanese viewpoint). While all three films share the same blood and guts quotient, with ""Hacksaw Ridge"" edging this award, the Eastwood films tend to have more emotional depth and a more thought-provoking treatment of the Japanese angle. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", while the war crimes of the Japanese are clear, the war crimes of the Americans are quietly cloaked behind a cryptic line (""They didn't make it""). <br/><br/>That being said, there is no crime in a rollicking good story well told, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is certainly that. This was a film I did not have high hopes for. But I was surprised to be proved wrong. Recommended.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","17","33","31 December 2016"," A film with two very different half's to it and one of the best war films ever
","This film surprised the hell out of me, going in I personally wasn't expecting much but this film delivers in some many aspects and then some. As mentioned in the title this film has two very different side to it, exactly like on a coin. The first half of the film is a drama/romance of the lead character, whilst the second half is full on war epic.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson, well there is a lot to say about the man but political statements and controversy aside this man is one brilliant director. He does so well with capturing the perfect essence of both sides to this story, whether it be about Desmond's personal life or the impending war he is about to endure. This film shows the chaos of war in a way I don't think Saving Private Ryan did, the horror and true evil that it is, is on a scale that at some times hard to watch. However the more private moments between Garfield and Palmer are also so perfectly done and fit in seamless to the story and film. This film is two films in one, there is the first hour of the film a drama/romance that is this really good, interesting, funny and heart warming. Whilst the other hour of the film is full on war film with shots that will be imprinted on your mind for a very long time, truly mesmerising. Gibson 100% deserves an Oscar nomination, fantastic. <br/><br/>The story again like mentioned is really interesting throughout its many layers and complexities, due to its characters and background. Its a true story that I personally had never heard about so was interested to learn more about the generation that gave up some much. Particularly a man who stood up for what he believed in, which I think is very relevant for what is happening around the world today and especially in America. This makes it that much more relatable to the character and the troubles he is having to deal with, even I can see why he can't pick up a gun because god told I'm too and Im an atheist haha. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are of the chain, starting with Andrew Garfield . With whom I was a little concern about with the distinct accent that the character has, but he managed to pull it off throughout the entire film. His performances is his best and one of the best of the year and should also get an Oscar nomination and even win, he is that good. Sensational as a character that the audience can really latch onto emotionally, due to him standing up for what he believes in, you really want him to succeed. All the other performances are also really good, Teresa Palmer is really good and also has a great accent in the film. Its a simple role but a really effective one at the same time it could have been over played. Vince Vaughn is great especially in the funny moments in this film which there are surprisingly many. Really interesting role for him but he fits into it so well, his wit and charm is brilliant in the role, also a decent leader when he gets to the battlefield. This film must be good when it gets good performances out of Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington!<br/><br/>Finally this film is a very true representation of war its horrifying, heart pounding, eye opening and at times is Saving Private Ryan on steroids. A truly great film of the year that not doubt will get Oscar buzz in the new year, 87 % out of 100 a really good film with two great sides to it. One minor problem could be that the first half does drag a little just a tiny bit, but the second half is well worth waiting for!"

Years later, he meets the nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) and they fall in love with each other. Desmond, who is Seventh-day Adventist Christian and conscientious objector, decides to join the army to serve his country in World War II; however he refuses to carry or use any weapon and requests to serve as combat medic to save lives.

","I was so disappointed with this film! After hearing all the Oscar carry on and stories of standing ovations etc I was so looking forward to seeing it. Firstly, the main character who plays Doss is so achingly awful in the beginning of the film that it is hard to watch. The scenes where he interacts with the woman who later becomes his wife are so cringe worthy I wanted to turn away. The action scenes in the film are pretty amazing but it just lies flat. The scene where Vince Vaughn is killing the Japanese while Garfield pulls him along on some type of material while rescuing him is just ridiculous and more suited to a teenage video game. Its an interesting story but the ending just leaves you with nothing. They spend a huge amount of time including his love interest in the story and then you never hear from her again. I also found it weird that they included the scene where he almost kills his brother at the beginning and then discounts this scene by saying he chose to never touch a weapon after he held a gun to his Father's head. I love war films but this was disappointing on all levels. Unbroken, fury etc. are just far better films. I really don't know what all the carry on is about. Its lazy and the ending is cop out. Meh!"

","Let me start by saying that the true story of Desmond T Doss is nothing short of incredible! What an amazing individual he must have been!<br/><br/>This film however, is absolutely dreadful!! I cannot comprehend how it's getting such great reviews. I can get over the fact that Spider- Man is trying to play the role of a real-life war hero. I cannot get over Vince Vaughn and his painfully bad attempt at playing the part of a drill sergeant. I love Vince Vaughn but this performance is awkward at the very best. Completely unconvincing in his portrayal of a soldier and drill sergeant.<br/><br/>Let's move on to accuracy in film... There is none. I mean none WHATSOEVER! The uniforms and equipment look very bargain basement which is disappointing considering the films 40 million dollar budget. The way military life and combat were depicted place this film in the same realm as Starship Troopers and early John Wayne films. <br/><br/>With movies like Braveheart and Apocalypto under his belt, I expected so much more from Gibson in the directing of this movie. In past works, he conveyed so much emotion and passion that you almost couldn't help but be swept up in the story. Hacksaw Ridge, however, pays no attention to detail. The scripting was uninspired, unconvincing and completely unrealistic. <br/><br/>I understand that no film could ever live up to the real-life heroism of Desmond Doss. But the attempt could have, and SHOULD have been much better! It makes me cringe to think that all some people will ever know of his awe-inspiring life, is what they saw in this shameful piece of film making."

","Having just watched 'Hacksaw Ridge', and then immediately after the 2002 bio-doc about Desmond T.

After a little research, almost unbelievably, this 'myth-making' Gibson movie turns out to be an accurate portrayal of the man, and a pretty accurate account of history. <br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good. What affects the viewer more than the brutal violence of war on display, more than the performances of the cast, more than Gibson's direction, is the unflinching determination, unselfish bravery, compassion and faith the real Desmond Doss showed throughout his life. <br/><br/>What a character.<br/><br/>Hats off to Desmond.

It's a new genre movie, especially made for white males with a narrow and religious view on the real world and it's history."
"punishable-by-death","4","33","73","2 November 2016"," Utter waste of time
","Hoo-rah! If it weren't for the admittedly intriguing story of an extremely religious man serving his country by helping the wounded, with no firearm, this would simply be yet another war movie glorifying America while their enemies, in this case the Japanese, are faceless and all the same, serving only as objects to shoot at. Enemies.<br/><br/>But let's head back to the beginning. The movie sets the tone by beginning with a fiery scene, in which we see destruction and mayhem on the battlefield. Our main character Desmond Doss begins to narrate, quoting scripture, which gives us an idea where the film is heading. We are then taken back to his childhood, where we learn why he refuses to wield a firearm.<br/><br/>This serves a nice introduction into why Desmond is the way he is. What doesn't work though is that barely 15 minutes into the movie, he meets a girl. Ten minutes later they want to get married.<br/><br/>Given this is a two hour movie, this entire sequence could have been snipped, making for a snappier movie, while also allowing us to not suffer through the awful, sentimental melancholic bullcrap that we are forced to watch.<br/><br/>This section of the movie honestly feels like a bog-standard romantic comedy, not to mention it feels very out of touch with the tone of the rest of the movie. It feels like it was shoehorned in, by someone lacking any ounce of filmmaking skill.<br/><br/>After this trite, we move to the army barracks for training. Desmond's refusal to carry a gun is seen by most of his comrades (and superiors) as cowardly, and his religious beliefs are mocked. ""This is war"" he is told, implying that God's commandments don't apply on the battlefield.<br/><br/>As if we are watching a remake of Full Metal Jacket, the next thirty or so minutes is dedicated to obstacle courses, a drill officer screaming insults at the privates (with little humour, unlike Kubrick's classic) while Desmond is alienated from the group. A religious, southern Private Pyle. Only Desmond's fate is far different, as we know.<br/><br/>Soon we find ourselves in the battlefield, as the film borrows another scene, this one from Band of Brothers, as the fresh soldiers see the battered men retreating from their goal: to capture and hold Hacksaw Ridge. Much like the entire film, this scenes has no semblance of subtlety at all, as the camera focuses on the trucks carrying dead soldiers, all conveniently placed so that their heads are at the end of the truck, where we can see them. Oh, and their faces are all covered in a ton of blood - and not dried blood either.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how dead men can bleed fresh blood either, but this film doesn't seem to have a great relationship with the concept of logic.<br/><br/>The final part of the film is where the action takes place, and it seems clear from the start that this is made for the Call of Duty crowd. Soldiers are killed all over, but since we don't get to know any of them, their deaths have no impact at all, and are dismissed in a one minute conversation that night between the men left. The same can be said for the men Desmond is able to save. Who are they? Mel Gibson takes some cues from Passion of the Christ, as the battle scenes are needlessly bloody and gory. Multiple shots of legless men, intestines lying on the ground, rats eating maggots out of a corpse it is far too much.<br/><br/>War is hell, we get it, but dwelling on the physical impact so much affects the rest of the movie. There should have been a lot to say, as Desmond's story is an incredible story of bravery and dedication. The fact that he had no gun on the battlefield is barely explored at all either, nor the situation of a religious man obeying the ten commandments on a war-field.<br/><br/>There is nothing intelligent here. Simply another war film that screams ""GO America!"" to the rest of the world, as we watch them incinerate their enemies in slow motion, with swelling, orchestral music in the background.<br/><br/>I liked Blood Father.

"KidWithOpinions","9","2","2","7 August 2018"," Hacksaw Ridge
","Hacksaw Ridge is a World War Two movie made by Mel Gibson. I loved this movie and I think that it deserves an A, for its well-told story and its acting.
Hacksaw Ridge is a good war movie that you could show your kids when they get into middle school ( around 8th grade would be best). Sure it is violent and pretty gory, but compared to the other war movies it is not as bad. There are no F-words, but there is one scene where a character is naked, and some implied sex, but other than that it is a pretty appropriate movie sexuality-wise. You should go into this movie knowing that it is made by Mel Gibson, and he makes very bloody films, but hopefully, that should already be expected. The movie has some parts in it that might scare young kids and it also might scare older viewers, because it is pretty disturbing, but if they are in the age range of 12 and 13 they should not get scared.
Hacksaw Ridge is a World War Two movie that shows us an American medic helping soldiers on the Pacific Front. The medic is Virginian Desmond Doss, who is very religious, and that will play a part in him being in the military. He refuses to pick up a weapon, and he does not want to kill anyone or in his words, "" I do not want to take the life of another human being, because that is the greatest sin,"". It starts out with Desmond and his brother ( whose name I do not have) hiking. It cuts to them fighting back at home, I do not want to spoil anything so I will just say that Desmond wins in the bad way. We then have to sit through an hour of Desmond dealing with a girl and his father disapproving of Desmond's choice's and actually getting to fight in the war, and then we get about 20 minutes of Doss at boot camp. It takes an hour and twenty minutes to get to the actual war part, but let me tell you that if you are missing the violence of war you will still see lots of blood in Desmond's everyday life, we only get about an hour of the war and fighting. 
What I really liked about Hacksaw Ridge was how they are showing us the Pacific Front instead of the European Front. Because we have seen enough movies about the Nazi party being overthrown by America because they were screwing with the American military ( the Nazi's), give us something new! Now I thought that Hugo Weaving did a great job acting. The entire cast does a really good job at acting, but I think the best acting was actually done by the people whom Doss was saving.
I am very sad that Andrew Garfield did not win Best Actor because he did a phenomenal job as Desmond Doss. I seem to forget he is British because all of his best roles are Americans. But I will still say my congratulations to Casey Affleck for winning his first Oscar.
Hacksaw Ridge was different from all the other war movies. Besides the immense amount of violence, it was a different kind of war movie. So it does not remind me of any movies. 
My final grade for Hacksaw Ridge is an A, for its well-told story and its great acting."
"pstopford","7","2","2","5 August 2018"," Mixed feelings...
","...Stunning in so many rights, but unnecessarily historically inaccurate in many others. While not a documentary, any film which takes on the mantle of re-creating a true story on screen (especially one about war) should, in my opinion, feel compelled to pay attention to detail. Some brief research online suggests this wasn't the case. I also think one-sided war films are a dangerous way to stir nationalistic views to modern audiences. I'd have much preferred to see both sides tales somewhat represented. In saying this, the very fact that this memorable film brings the story of one man's conviction in his faith leading to him saving 75 lives, deserves immense respect."

It makes me say a quote 'Faith in humanity restored'.<br/><br/>I find Oscars overrated, but here -this movie has won two Oscars, which makes me say, 'Faith in Oscars restored'.<br/><br/>The movie comes from the director Mel Gibson, the one who directed the passion of the Christ and apocalypto. He stands new coming into my conscience and what I would like to say is he is one hell of a director.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Movie coming from a director who understands faith so well is a reason why justice is done to the subject so nicely.

He proves himself a hero, in spite of his refusal to bear arms.<br/><br/>Watch this, and honor those who have passed. War is not a pleasant experience.

"adam-may-bower","8","2","2","2 June 2018"," Epic and Powerful
","'Hacksaw Ridge' may have its cheesy moments influenced by Hollywood blockbusters, but ultimately this film is an epic and powerful portrayal of the real-life hero Desmond Doss. Since the 1950's people were wanting to make the inspiring story of Desmond Doss into a film. The Christian who served in WWII without a single weapon and saved approximately 75 individuals is definitely a story worthy to be told on the screen, and after decades of several directors attempting to do so, Mel Gibson was fortunate enough to receive the green light and turn the story into a film. While I definitely think Gibson did a great job with this film, there were several moments that were quite melodramatic and cheesy - particularly with the approach to the love story of Doss and his wife Dorothy. However, that doesn't stop this film from being an amazing triumph. The acting is brilliant, with an A+ performance from Andrew Garfield who portrays Doss fantastically, and other highlights being Hugo Weaving and Sam Worthington. The action in this film is brutally realistic, with great direction by Gibson. There were some parts that seemed exaggerated and unnecessarily gory, but that's the realism of war - unnecessarily gory! The soundtrack Rupert Gregson-Williams is brilliant and really helps this film feel emotional and inspiring. Overall, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a great and inspiring film with only a few cheesy moments that rob the movie of being perfect."

It is nice to see true goodness - as opposed to the fake Hollywood variety - portrayed in film with all the complexity and courage that embodies."
"suvopyne49","8","2","2","2 April 2018"," The Hero of War
","It has been my belief that in war, most of the time there are no heroes, only participants. But, in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge, there is a hero. A hero in its truest sense. In this year's another sensational film, La La Land, we saw how it is important to never let go of what you want or what you dream, even if the circumstances are trying. In Hacksaw Ridge, we see even in dire situations and in face of dreadful consequences how it is important to never let go of who you are. <br/><br/>For in Hacksaw Ridge, the protagonist Desmond Doss reminds us that it is the belief, the ideology of person and their actions that define them and not the fulfillment of norms. Based on true events, the film tells the story of an American man who becomes the first Conscientious Objector to win the Medal of Honor. To put in a simpler term, Desmond Doss' belief and conscience does not allow him to kill another human being, or even pick a gun. He still enlists to serve as a combat medic.<br/><br/>What follows, is a struggle. Both internal and external where Doss is subjected to humiliation, violence and time in jail. There even comes a time when he had to choose between love and the belief that made him the person he is. But, his unfaltering energy and determination to stay true in its own eyes make him the hero that this film is celebrating. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson and writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan strike the perfect balance between a biographical drama and a war film. At one side, the battle scenes are shot exquisitely. Filled with realism and horrors of war. Gibson doesn't pull his punches in showing the harrowing brutality. The film would remind people of the battles in Saving Private Ryan or in the excellent mini-series Band of Brothers. At another side, there's enough room in the film to explore the life of Doss. The relationship with his father, his love for his wife, all these beautifully depicts the tenderness, the gentle yet resolute soul of Doss. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss and I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than him in this role. Garfield's boyish charm reflects the character's innocence. Be it when he flirts or when he refuses to carry firearms, he seems sincere and determined and yet gentle and sweet. The film is buoyed by the heroism of the character of Desmond Doss, which in turn is buoyed by Garfield's acting. The chemistry between Garfield and a fine Teresa Palmer, who plays Dorothy, Desmond's wife, strikes the emotional chord enough to give a dramatic dimension in this film. Speaking of emotional bond, Hugo Weaving churns a top performance as Doss' father. You feel the desperation and the frustration his character feels when his sons enlist in the army, as he had watched most of his friends die while serving himself. The supporting cast of 77th Infantry Division, including Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, and Vince Vaughn, does well too. Particularly Vaughn.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson directs this film after a gap of approximately 10 years, and it would appear that the time has not put rust on his direction mettle. Hacksaw Ridge is perhaps the best War film of this decade and certainly one of the finest of this genre."
"proud_luddite","7","2","2","29 March 2018"," A very unique war story
","Based on a true story: Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield) was an American pacifist who served as an unarmed medic on the battlefields during World War II. The film tells of his struggle to serve as he wanted to and his very unusual status as a war hero.<br/><br/>Doss's story as a conscientious objector is very unusual. In most cases, this situation was used to avoid military service entirely. In Doss' case, he truly wanted to serve but without holding or using a weapon. The uniqueness of this story goes further in the rare situation of a main character being ostracized due to faith (Doss was a Seventh-day Adventist) and principle. The story is further enhanced in its exploration of World War I veterans (here displayed by Desmond's father) who remain bitter from their war experiences and can't stand the idea of their sons going through the same hell.<br/><br/>Garfield does a fine job in displaying the naïveté and innocence of a rural Virginia boy with ideals that seem hopeless at first but who truly knows better by the end. Other stand-out performances include those of Hugo Weaving as Desmond's troubled father and Vince Vaughan as an over-the-top drill sergeant who's rather funny with his insults.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in Okinawa, Japan are very well orchestrated by director Mel Gibson. But sadly, these scenes are so long and frequent that their horror can end up numbing the audience who are well aware of the accuracy of such a tragic part of history - not only for that war but those that followed and those happening now.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a fine war film with a very different twist on the meaning of heroism."

A lot of the movie is the fighting on Okinawa, from the point of view of the armed soldiers, and their officers and NCOs. Sometimes, briefly, from the POV of the Japanese. <br/><br/>There are occasional cuts to little vignettes of our hero doing things. But they are disjointed and have no obvious point. <br/><br/>And the whole opening, the first hour or so, is tragically maudlin. A trite aw-shucks love story/basic training thing that turns into a slightly put-upon then triumphant but boring victory. <br/><br/>Boring is the deal. Sure the battle scenes are gory, but what's the point of it all? I mean, in the film, why are we watching this? Why does any of it inform anything we're supposed to understand about the morality or faith of our hero? <br/><br/>It all feels like a TED talk. A PPT that tells a Heartwarming Story of Success In Adversity. Or if you prefer, a sermon with a great story. But film should show, not tell. And this thing tells you, repeatedly, what you are supposed to think, then goes off a plays video games for a while in between."

","Hacksaw Ridge is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very interesting true story that I was never aware of. Following Desmond Doss, a man who chose to fight in the war without any ammunition, the danger and risk he put himself through is beautifully chronicled, Mel Gibson really hits it out of the park this time around. <br/><br/>I did find that the film spent an immensely long period time on the soldiers' preparation. Understandably a grueling process that is conveyed well, but I went in knowing it was a war movie, and I found myself thriving for them to go to the battlefield. <br/><br/>The cast is all around terrific, Sam Worthington and Vince Vaughn both shine as the army generals, not a role I would have seen either of them in, but they did an excellent job. Andrew Garfield is undoubtedly the highlight as Doss, he clearly immersed himself in to this role, bringing so much depth and honesty to the character, it is no surprise that he got as much awards praise as he did. <br/><br/>An impressive, unique piece of film. Intense, riveting and superbly acted, I would certainly recommend Hscksaw Ridge to anyone looking for a good war film. <br/><br/>
Follows the true story of Desmond Doss, who chose to fight in a war as a protector of his squad, rather than a murderer of his allies. <br/><br/>

"TheOny13","10","2","2","26 December 2017"," One of the best movies of 2016! (1st part spoiler free, the 2nd part with spoilers)
","***NO SPOILERS BELLOW***
This wonderful movie tells the story of Desmond Doss who joins the military but refuses to ever touch a gun. This is a powerful and touching movie about maintaining your beliefs and how those actions can inspire other people. The movie style resembles a lot with ""Braveheart"" and in general with Mel Gibson's way of directing a war-based movie. The performances are top notch especially from Andrew Garfield which gives one of the most original and different performance of his career. The story is original and challenging for both war-movie lovers and for drama-movie lovers. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELLOW***
One of the most powerfull scenes from the movie is one that was inspired almost word by word from Desmond Doss interview shown at the end of the movie. And the scene is the one where Desmond saves all those 75 soldiers. This scene summarized very well the authenticity of the movie and how much it stays true to the actual fact-based story which is rather odd for a Mel Gibson movie (you know what I mean if you've seen ""Braveheart""). But, for me the most inspiring and also the best scene in the entire movie is when Desmond saves a Japanese soldier. This scene sends a powerfull message about how your actions even if they may seem very odd but as long as they are made from clean conscience and with a good motivation, can inspire other people to do wonderful things also. And this is what this movie tries to do with its message that as long as you keep yourself clean and strong in your beliefs you can become an inspiration for others. The way this movie is constructed is very much like a Gibson style movie starting with childhood then youth and finishing with adult period. This makes the viewer involved in both the story and the main character and also makes the movie message the more easy to send and be later understood. The characters are also very well developed along the movie especially Desmond but others as well. As an ecample for the previous statement we see Smitty more as a bully at the beginning of the movie and then during the battles and the time spent with Desmond he becomes more of a mature and likeable character. This thus further proves the movie message that one action can inspire so many other people to be better and do wonderful things as well.<br/><br/>The score is excellent with many memorable moments that I recognised even while I was watching the movie (can't say the same about John Williams' scores which weren't memorable not even when I listened the score separately without the latest Star Wars movie) which is surprising for a composer that I only heard in Wonder Woman before, but one that can be a one to watch (or listen) for from now on. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful movie, one of the best I've seen in years, and up until now the best from 2016 along with Rogue One and La la Land. 10/10"
"Fredex8","10","2","2","14 December 2017"," Surprisingly Amazing
","Feels very much like two films in one with the first half being a heartfelt and interesting look at a subject not often covered - that of conscientious objectors before it suddenly takes a drastic turn into some of the most brutal, horrific (and high budget) WW2 battle scenes of any film which I feel does justice to the sheer terror and chaos of the stories about Okinawa.<br/><br/>Ultimately a very good film however it does at times stretch credulity and undoubtedly stray from the truth especially regarding the bulletproof potential of a human body, the ammo capacity of some weapons and the effectiveness of green troops. Yes maybe you could use a body to take a couple shots and save your life but when it gets peppered with rifle fire it only takes one shot to penetrate and you're dead. A BAR holds 20 rounds, an M3 holds 30, they are not inexhaustible Gatling guns capable of clearing everything in your path.<br/><br/>Accounts from WW2 veterans talk of fresh troops freezing when they first see people next to them killed and not showing complete dispassion and the ability to then instantly take down 6 enemy soldiers with an 8 round rifle. Or rather, the film seems to portray them as being green but a quick look online reveals that they saw action in Guam and the Philippines before Okinawa so it would be fair to say it takes some liberties with the truth.<br/><br/>Things like this ultimately don't detract from the film all that much as it still has an amazing story to tell with more truth than fiction although it does make you question if certain things actually happened or if they are artistic license. Until the end with the veteran interviews I did find it confusing that a medic not carrying a weapon was such a big deal when they were not required to do so and at most might have carried a pistol for self defence (at least in the Pacific theatre where the Geneva convention went out the window). Nonetheless it is such an incredible story and so well told that I'll let some of the more unbelievable combat scenes slide."

","Hacksaw Ridge begins as two young brothers are roughing each other up, fighting with each other with their father sitting on the front porch watching boys be boys. Next thing the viewer sees is the younger brother grabbing a brick and hitting his brother on the head. The mother and father quickly pick up their eldest of two sons, hoping their other son did not kill him, as he passes out. Nevertheless, the younger brother, whom is Desmond looks at the crucifix on the wall probably thinking he is going straight to hell if his brother dies. Flash forward a couple of years later. By now, you know the father beats up the mother, and possibly both his children because he is a drunk that was in WW I and cannot live with the atrocities of war and losing his friends in the military. In the meantime, Desmond takes an injured person to the hospital and meets his future wife who is a nurse with beautiful red hair with blue eyes. Desmond is quite mesmerized with her so much so that he must donate blood, a task that she has been assigned to that particular day. While there, he decides he wants to be a medic in the army. Desmond's brother enlists as well as all the rest of the boys in their town. Desmond feels it is his duty. Flashforward to basic training with Vince Vaughn as his sergeant and his fellow officers. They are all friends and getting along until Desmond will not bear arms. However, he is an Adventist and will not bear arms to kill a soul. He feels he can fulfill his duty as a medic. Then, the top officials in the ARMY find out his dilemma. They court marshall him. I won't spoil this part for you. Then, he goes overseas to Japan. While over there, the soldiers are made to learn everybody is different in a life changing way and not everybody is what they seem. The viewer definitely sees the ugliness of a war and the pure hell of death, but with this film's fabulous way of inspiring a man, it is most definitely worth seeing.

","Movie: Mel Gibson's MASSIVE comeback to the movie industry by directing Hacksaw Ridge, a movie about Desmond Doss and how he went into World War 2 without any self defense serving as a medic and became the first conscientious objector in American history to be rewarded the medal of honour. This movie blew away people across the world and movie critics are scoring high. Desmond Doss's actions in the movie were based on truly heroic true events, which needed to be carried out with a lot of courage and bravery. The movie also gives you a brutally honest R rated (American classification) vision of what happened in that war and how similar events were carried out in other wars.<br/><br/>Actors and directors: Andrew Garfield known as The Amazing Spiderman, played Desmond Doss with Excellency and had the right physical and verbal appearance to suit the roll. Another actor, Vince Vaughn who played Sergeant Howell, played him with great acting skills and character. Otherwise there's nothing to complain about the actors, they were all spectacular. Mel Gibson did this movie and man, what a comeback. If Mel Gibson didn't direct this movie, the whole movie would go in another direction. His last movie Expendables 3 in 2014 was the last we saw of him for 2 years. We know him as violence movie maker with movies such as Brave heart and Passion of the Christ, and boy is this a lot of gore and violence. But, it is good as it gives you the true explanation of what happened in the movie and real life and that is what makes the movie great and makes people's minds widen up to the subject of war and what really happened with scenes with amputated body parts and decapitations, as some people cover their eyes while there is the other people sucked into the movie.<br/><br/>Feedback: I strongly recommend everyone to go see this movie, especially people interested in war and movies with a catholic impact. The movie has a strong catholic impact to the story, with his faith giving him strength, people who are seeking Catholic movies, I recommend watching this. But if you are sensitive to gore, watch if you dare. Similar movies like this like Unbroken and American Sniper only got 7.1 & 7.2 from IMDb, which to me is pretty unexplainable, but I have to admit, Hacksaw Ridge tops the list. This movie got an astounding 8.7/10 from IMDb making it one of the most highest ranked movies ever, which to me is well deserved! This story and movie is just amazing! I rate Hacksaw Ridge 9/10."

","When I saw the reviews of this movie I was expecting another great war movie. Most war movies are excellent, they contain great story lines and somehow they can move you in a way other movies simply can't. Except this one. <br/><br/>I know it is based on a true story and I'm not saying it didn't happen. But come on.. Everything in this movie is extremely exaggerated. It's only written to appeal to your patriotism and make Americans look like heroes. It's directed by Mel Gibson, so that explains most of it. I seriously was considering turning the movie off, but as the reviews were so good I was hoping there would be a twist of some kind. There wasn't.. <br/><br/>A lot of scenes are just simply annoying. I'm not saying the directing is bad. The action scenes are excellent and the actors are pretty good. But there are just too many instances that really grind your gears as a neutral movie watcher. We've all seen it before and making up your lack of dialog skills with lots of blood and violence just doesn't cut it for me. <br/><br/>The ending is the worst of all. The Asian guys pretend to surrender, but then all of a sudden start throwing grenades. This movie hero guy smashes one grenade like a tennis ball (where the hell did it go) and kicks another grenade like a football (wow!). I bet he didn't tell Mel that. He just gets a scratch and of course the Americans win the battle. Then you see the Japanese commanders in their bunker after they have lost the battle. They decide to pick up their machetes and all of them commit suicide by stabbing themselves with their own machetes. Right.. I don't like Mel Gibson so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I didn't know he directed it until they showed it at the end. Before I knew Mel Gibson directed it I already thought it was a poor movie, after I found out Mel Gibson directed it everything fell into place. <br/><br/>If you're looking to feel patriotic and see anther American hero in the war, this is your cup of tea. If you want to watch a great war movie, skip this one. I seriously don't understand why the rating's so high. Probably a lot of Americans rated this movie and just couldn't handle not liking it."

President of the US gives to Doss the Medal of Honor in October 12,1945. The story clearly illustrates that the only weapon can be faith and pure love for life,combining with a remarkable dose of courage.I have to mention about the injustice born of inability and deep understanding,when soldier Doss in the training camp was one step away to face the martial court because he didn't want to use a gun,a crucial moment which eventually solved well,I was glad and relieved when his father came with the 'saving' letter from the general.

Just superb. The war scenes were brutal but realistic. Not for the squeamish. This movie is high on action, but not over the top ""expendables"" type, not that I don't enjoy those movies as well, but this is realistic. It is also inspirational. I for one am not or can never be a conscientious objector but what this soldier did and how he remained true to his convictions and why is what makes it inspirational.

"mjf-70387","10","9","16","2 March 2017"," An American Classic
","Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 film directed by Mel Gibson which marches the viewer in the gory Battle of Okinawa from the perspective of Desmond Doss, a Courageous war medic. While I have watched countless war films from the grave black and white In Harm's Way, to comical war scenes of Forrest Gump, Hacksaw Ridge trumps them all because of Mel Gibson unification of war with personal story allowing the viewer to relate a gigantic, incomprehensible war on a personal level. Because Gibson synergizes macroscopic and microscopic events, the macroscopic being the historic battle of Okinawa and the microscopic being the life and war efforts of the courageous medic, Desmond Doss, the viewer can be impacted by the film in a way that could never be accomplished in a documentary.<br/><br/>Gibson reveals details of Desmond Doss' adolescence at the start of the film to allow the viewer to connect emotionally to Doss, even though his adolescence does not directly pertain to the Okinawa War itself. The film begins with Desmond as a teenager fearlessly exploring the outdoors with his brother. As the two scale a bolder- covered mountain, Desmond's brother offers Desmond a hand up a large stone step up to reach the mountain's apex. Grinning, Desmond taps his brothers hand away, saying ""I got it"". In this first scene, Gibson builds enormous character into Desmond Doss. The viewer is not greeted by some generic, run of the mill, soldier on the battle field, he is greeted by a teenager, the age group of a heightened keenness towards uniqueness. The viewer is not presented with a Doss on the battle field, after he is forced by the army into a courageous mold, but is instead presented with a teenage Doss born to be born to be fearless, climbing to the highest ledge on the mountain peak, to dance along its crease, and born to be courageous, climbing to the top without a single helping hand from his older brother. Building details from Doss' youth in the first scenes allows Gibson to portray Doss as an easily relatable individual. Gibson also builds a sturdy foundation of Christianity into the Desmond Doss belief system. As a teenager, Desmond watches his drunk father beat his brother, while wheezing for another glass of whiskey. Desmond's brother collapses from physical and mental trauma. The camera pans from the front lawn where Desmond's older brother lay, to a tearing Desmond Doss in the kitchen, eyes affixed on brutal painting of Cain killing Able, with the bold red lettering underneath, ""Thou Shal Not Kill"", one of the Ten Commandments of the Lord. Doss prays to God. Later in the film, Desmond reveals that it was because of that painting, and watching his father nearly kill his brother, that he promised God to never touch a rifle, an incredible promise Desmond attempts to keep all through the war. The second object that Gibson reoccurring displays, to support Dosses appearance as a Christian, is a bible which Doss' Fiancé gifts to him through the window of his training camp bus, while saying good bye. ""Keep it close to your heart"", she reminds him. While the training camps other members read the Playboy Magazine other worldly material, Doss keeps his eyes on the bible, reading verses to himself every free moment. While ridiculed by his peers, Doss boldly continues reading and holding onto the bible until while fighting at Hacksaw ridge. The Hacksaw Ridge War Scene is brutally realistic, with blood, explosions, and death, each of which the average viewer cannot relate to. But when Gibson narrows the scope down to a war torn Doss, pleading too his carriers on a stretcher to find his bible where he had been wounded on the battle field, the scope of the battle is automatically put into perspective. The viewer, who is emotionally connected to Desmond Doss and understands his character, cannot reduce him to another soldier and must see him as the courageous, moral, and selfless individual, that Doss is. This perspective places invites the audience to ask, ""What would I do in Doss' situation"", a question that throws the viewer right beside Doss on his stretcher, begging with him for the bloodstained bible that he clung onto through his entire service in the cold bloody war. A war documentary's viewer-immersion-factor cannot compare to this Hacksaw Ridge's. <br/><br/>Finally, what makes Hacksaw Ridge a classic is not only how Gibson portrays Doss, but also the choice in choosing Doss to be the star of the film. The story of Doss is remarkable. When called by his commander at the war-front to retreat in battle, Doss hears his true calling from God to save the remaining men that were injured and abandoned on the field, positioned to be tortured by ruthless Japanese. Doss remains on Japanese territory alone, healing each injured Soldier he finds, including some injured Japanese, dragging them across the line of combat, into American Territory. Doss selflessly prays with each soldier he saves, ""Lord, help me find one more"" before running back into the devastated enemy terrain, until finding one more soldier and dragging them into American Territory. Doss, alone, saves 75 men, and without Doss' courageous actions, a mere 35 men would have returned from the week's fight. Desmond Doss' faith in God and bravery in the face of the worst danger is the inspiring plot that allows Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge to impact the masses.<br/><br/>Using details from Desmond Doss' adolescence, and displaying his character, Gibson connects the viewer emotionally to Doss, allowing the war which takes place around Doss to impact the viewer. Overall, Desmond Doss' actions leave the viewer with both a feeling of humility, longing to emulate the bravery of an American citizen nearly giving one's life to save many, and a feeling of courage, watching American demonstrate pure heroism. Hacksaw Ridge should remain an American classic forever."

","Mel Gibson really does seem to love his blood and gore, the passion of the Christ was notorious for it's unflinching scenes of gratuitous blood and violence. I know this is a war film but do we we really need to see such graphic detail? I actually think it detracts from the narrative, this is indeed a great story and one which should be told but it is spoilt by poor direction. The characters seem so unreal it is difficult to relate to any of them or to have any emotional connection. Andrew Garfield does an OK job playing the main character WWII American army medic Desmond Doss, but I quickly lost interest due to his lacklustre performance."
"Smallclone100","2","12","23","31 January 2017"," Incredible story, poor movie.
","The True Story of Desmond Doss is incredible. It's a story that genuinely deserves a wider audience. However what Mel Gibson does, is create a misty eyed, all American first act; and a second act that concentrates more on jump scares and gore than actual crafted, intelligent film-making. This could have been epic. But it wasn't. It was full of lazy romanticism, war clichés, absolutely awful dialogue and Vince Vaughn. It's such a shame because it truly is an incredible tale. But when you hear the likes of:<br/><br/>""You gotta be kiddin' me""; ""We gat company!""; ""Let's go to work boys""<br/><br/>And other such tired dialogue it rather ruins any tension or seriousness of the fraught situation we've just experienced. Some of the goofy lines and sequences were close to feeling that they were actually parodying other war movies. The end battle sequence is also ridiculous, and yes I know Desmond Doss really kicked a grenade out of the way in battle but this does not mean that the way Mel Gibson recreated it (which looked like a 'slo-mo' of a Soccer player scoring a goal in the world cup Final) was in any way captivating or entertaining and actually just made me laugh out loud. As did several other bits. <br/><br/>It could have been such a delve into one of the most remarkable men to ever go to war. Instead it just resembled Captain America in a US Army uniform for an hour. Despite some nice photography it is a wasted opportunity. Lovers of Michael Bay and/or superhero flicks may like this movie. I didn't. 5/10"
"midas-jacobs","10","12","23","12 November 2016"," War from a pacifist view
","""Hacksaw Ridge"" is about the pacifist Desomond Doss, who refuses to pick up a gun, but somehow still manages to save over 70 lives in the battle of Okanawa.<br/><br/>Last night I saw this movie and ""The accountant"" back to back, and I have to say that this movie was the best out of the both. Mel Gibsons directing was on point. After ten years of doing no directing, he still has it. His shot composition is very good and he has put some symbolism in the last frame. Quite obvious, but still. He also managed to created a realistic feel for the movie. Mel also has some for shadowing going on in the movie. It doesn't happen once or twice, but a couple of times. I didn't really mind it, but maybe you could get annoyed by this. Mel Gibsons way of showing war was very good. He put down hell on screen. A lot of things helped him with this thing, the make- up design for example. The make-up looked very real. It reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Heads and other body parts were flying everywhere. The costume design too was really good. The movie also reminded me of ""Full Metal Jacket"" in a way. The training sequences looked similar and there was the drill sergeant. It kind of mirrors the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>What Mel Gibson also did well were the battle sequences. If they are there, they hit hard. You feel so involved in those scenes. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, with goosebumps. The score was loud and worked perfectly with those scenes. An example of the well-crafted score is in the first battle sequence and also my favorite part of the movie. This is with the mist hanging there, hiding everything in a threatening way. The score slowly building up to the reveal. The slow editing. And then action breaks loose and the score is at its peak, with the pacing suddenly moving faster than before. That part was really brilliantly handled by Mel Gibson and he gave me chills in those parts. Something that he also did right were the scenes where Desmond is the only one up there saving everyone. You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat. At first I thought that it was going to get repetitive after a while (him constantly doing the same thing trying to help people), but Gibson managed to keep me interested, by showing new things constantly. The scenery in those scenes were good looking, jaw dropping even, but sometimes the Cgi was notable.<br/><br/>Now I've been praising the movie a lot for the battle sequences, but there are two things that I want to mention, which I didn't like from those parts. One is the scene where Desmond saves Sgt Howell, by dragging him on a blanket. That was just ridiculous. The ground was uneven everywhere and yet he pulls him forward like it's nothing, without any bumps even. Sgt Howell also just keeps shooting at the Japps like he is Rambo. And another thing I disliked was the cheap way that Desmond escapes from the Japps in the tunnels. That was lazy movie magic. And a thing that I disliked a tiny bit, is that the first act takes a long time to set up the rest of the movie. But after the first act, everything becomes ten times better.<br/><br/>The acting was really good. Andrew Garfield gave his best performance yet. He really showed how his character evolved from a normal boy, to a damaged man. He shone on the battlefield, with all the emotion he had. He could say things, without even speaking. His accent was very good. Hugo Weaving, who played Desmonds dad, really was fantastic too. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, there's something wrong with them. I think that Weaving managed to show what war could do to a man. He gave in my opinion the best performance of the movie. Someone that surprised me was Vince Vaughn. This was one of his more serious roles, and I think that he should keep doing them. He was phenomenal as the drill sergeant. Not as good as the one in ""Full Metal Jacket"", but still very good. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey are good in this movie. I didn't even realize that I was watching Worthington act. And last but not least: Teresa Palmer. She was very good, and also gave the performance of her career,. Which does not say much if you look at the other movies she has been in.<br/><br/>The script was good. It was good in the dialogue aspect, but very good in the charactorial aspect. The characters were well developed and had its arcs. We go from Smitty hating Desmond, to them building up a friendship. We go from a normal young man, to a damaged one. There were also some cliché characters (The hand someone, the nerd...), but they need to be there, because of the giant amount of other characters. The cliché ones are easier to recognize on the field. Some of the characters that they set up, were being underused in my opinion. Like I've said before I think that they could've left some bits out in the beginning of the movie. I understand why they put those things in there. They wanted to set up the characters believes and motivation for it, and give him some more substance, but it just took them to long to do this.<br/><br/>So that's my opinion of ""Hacksaw Ridge"", I probably forgot some things to say, because there's a lot to say about this movie.

","HACKSAW RIDGE (2016) **** Andrew Garfield, Teresa Palmer, Luke Bracey, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, Nathaniel Buzolic, Richard Roxburgh. Incredible true-story account of Desmond Doss (Garfield in a career defining performance of heart-breaking vigilance) a Virginia bred youth who enlists in WWII to become a field medic as a conscientious observer only to face a gauntlet of anger, indifference and resentment from the Army, his fellow soldiers and officers, while relying on his spiritual faith in God to get him thru literally a baptism of fire on the battlefield (skillfully and graphically recounted by Mel Gibson returning to form as a gritty filmmaker with no holds barred after a decade of personal controversy and questionable career choices). Well cast ensemble includes a funny and dedicated Vaughn as Doss' sergeant at arms/drill instructor, Worthington as his officer in command, Weaving and Griffiths as his loving yet troubled parents (Weaving is amazing as a demon-plagued alcoholic WWI vet who shows his true colors) and fresh-faced newcomer Palmer as his beloved fiancée. The war sequences are truly harrowing and give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a run for its money on the bloodshed, anarchy and destruction embroiled on the big-screen. Epic filmmaking and a must-see to see what being a true hero is truly about thanks to a recognizable yet profound screenplay by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight . One of the year's best films."
"pniemeyer-47222","8","8","14","23 April 2017"," Truth is stranger than fiction
","Desmond Doss is one of those people whose story seems almost too perfect to be true. It's almost unthinkable that anybody would have the nerve to march into battle not carrying a weapon, and even more unthinkable that that person would somehow manage to save dozens of lives and win the respect of his armed peers in the process. But Desmond Doss did exactly that, and if the movie about his life portrays him as a gawky, unimposing saint, maybe that's just the way he was. Andrew Garfield is very good in the lead role here, bringing to life the sort of character who very easily could have felt like a cardboard cutout. The script sometimes leans a little too hard on clichés (I thought some of the supporting characters could have been more sharply drawn), but then again, this is a movie about Desmond Doss, and he is more than compelling enough to hold our attention.<br/><br/>This movie is unflinchingly violent. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was nearly pornographic in how it portrayed Christ's suffering, and this film ladles on both the dismemberment and Christlike imagery. So it's not exactly subtle. Still, it's rare to see faith explored in a way that is both explicit and not overly preachy. Desmond Doss was a pacifist and devout Seventh Day Adventist, and like most good people of faith, he clearly sees his beliefs as a private and personal thing, even as he enlists in the military and disobeys a direct order to carry a rifle.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a film that asks its audience just what lengths we are going to go to stand up for what we feel is right. It devotes much screen time to a legal battle, and while I will not go into the specifics here, suffice to say that it can be sorely tempting to give one's tormentors what one thinks they want in hopes of some temporary release. But that is not, forgive me, what Christ would have done. You don't have to be a Christian (or even religious at all) to enjoy this movie. You need a high tolerance for bloodshed, but that's about it. It's time Hollywood let Mel Gibson back into the fold."
"tristintheshyman","8","8","14","19 April 2017"," Good movie, but don't watch if you're sensitive to gore.
","The movie overall is pretty good. The plot moves at a reasonable rate and the movie never feels like it's slowing down for any unreasonable reason. The movie gives a good explanation of his motives and you really understand why the guy was a pacifist and how difficult it was being in his shoes. The movie seems really historically accurate; there aren't too many ""Hollywood"" moments, where the hero gets saved at the minute, excluding the moment at the courthouse where he's getting court-marshaled. About half-way through the movie, the violence really starts to kick up a notch. The first scene in ""Japan"" you see a bunch of bloody dead bodies as they are brought past the soldiers. From then on, there is astonishingly disturbing and accurate war violence. Men are blown to pieces, people are shown disemboweled and with bullet holes through their bodies and without legs or with muscle showing. Trust me, this review does not do justice how gory this movie is. I implore you, once again, if you are even remotely put off by gore to avoid this movie, as it is unremitting past the one hour mark. If you can make it past the extreme gore, however, the movie is really good, well worth your time. The storytelling is excellent and the dialogue is very accurate. Overall, really good movie, solid 8.5/10."
"doxxman5","8","8","14","22 March 2017"," Lovely and Brutal
","Oh, the return of Mel Gibson. It should have a train wreck, right? Somehow it was not, and this might be the best directed movie he has ever done. Andrew Garfield plays a pacifist character stuck in a war he must fight with a heart that is beyond pure for a cause that is sublimely patriotic against an enemy that is pure evil, in the face of adversity of his peers. Yes, that could also be the plot synopsis of Braveheart or Passion of the Christ. Luckily, the movie is a visual feast for those who enjoy an engaging war story with a perfectly paced first act build up that has perfect pay offs in the finale. A true story to boot, and one of my favorite WW2 movies when all is said and done."
"colm-hearne365","9","8","14","19 March 2017"," A great come back for Mel Gibson
","I like Mel Gibson as an actor and director but I think he does better as a director and Hacksaw Ridge was a great return for him and it turned out to be one of my favourite war movies alongside Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan. But what makes Hacksaw Ridge so special is that it's based on the true story of Desmond Doss (played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield), a Christian soldier who refuses to take up arms and becomes a war hero in the Battle of Okinawa in World War II by single-handedly saving over 70 soldiers without firing a single shot nor killing anyone and in the end is awarded the Medal of Honour. And it just goes to show you that miracles can happen anywhere at anytime to anyone. I'm also glad that Hacksaw Ridge was a success both with critics and audiences and did well in awards season by winning 2 Oscars for Film Editing and Sound Mixing but I think Andrew Garfield should've won the award for Best Leading Actor instead of Casey Affleck because Manchester by the Sea is really overrated and underwhelming. I mean Garfield's character was more challenging because he had to play a real life war hero and had to put on the accent as well. But in conclusion, I just want to say I really enjoyed Hacksaw Ridge and I hope we will get to see more of Gibson and Garfield in the future."
"dion-perry","8","8","14","19 March 2017"," So powerful it is tear inducing
","Based on a true story, Hacksaw ridge is the story of a young man with incredible courage and unshakable faith. Having almost killed his brother and his father in two separate incidents Desmond made a pack with God ― thy shall not kill. Not only does he hold to this, he will not touch a firearm. The problem is, WWII has broken out and he has enlisted in the US army. As a Conscientious Objector, Desmond is beaten, harassed and court martialled. Quoting the constitution, his father, a veteran of WWI, convinces the military court to not only re- frame for jailing his son for disobeying a direct order, but to let him fight. Trained as a field medic, Desmond is sent to Japan to help fight the war.<br/><br/>The idea that a medic would remaining behind on an horrific battle front swarming with Japanese soldiers who do not give quarter, would seem implausible, if it were not true. Armed with only an unshakable faith in God, Desmond rescues seventy-five men. Not only does he drag them across the front line, but he lowers them down a cliff-face on a rope. Desmond, is the only Conscientious Objector to receive a medal of hour for bravery.<br/><br/>The story is well told and moves along at a fast pace. It is however, graphically violent and not for the fainthearted. If you have a strong stomach, this film is so powerful it is tear inducing. It is easily one of the best war films I have seen since Saving Private Ryan. I highly recommend it."

"marktuovinen32","8","8","14","15 March 2017"," Hacksaw Ridge - Review
","Mel Gibson has come out of his 10 year directing hole and shown us all once again how brilliant he is at directing. His last three films Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ & Apocalypto were all absolutely brilliant films and I'm glad to say, he isn't making rubbish anytime soon. Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond Doss, an Army Medic who served in the battle of Okinawa but refused to kill people. ""One of the greatest heroes in American history never fired a bullet"". Desmond is portrayed by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man [2012] & Silence [2016]), the film also stars Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving & Vince Vaughan. There is not one performance that I can find a flaw in during the whole duration of the film. The acting is superb which is wonderful, you can connect and empathize with the characters easily. The film does not only explore what Desmond experienced during the battle but explores his childhood, relationships with his family and his partner. It also shows how Desmond came to be on the battlefield without a weapon as a medic. Desmond is a Christian and has a strong belief that going out into the battlefield and fighting is murder, at the same time he wants to serve for his country whilst staying true to his beliefs. When it comes down to the battle sequences in this film, words can't describe it. When the battles start, THEY START! I have never seen battles more terrifying, harrowing, bloody and intense as Hacksaw Ridge. Every single camera angle, all the make-up and CGI are beyond phenomenal. I have never seen war sequences this terrifying since Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". I cannot praise this film enough for the amount of terror it imparts during these sequences. Andrew Garfield is phenomenal, after being in two awful Spiderman films to be portraying one the greatest war heroes of all time is an astonishing achievement. When it comes to brilliant war movies you think Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. Well Mel has put himself on the map of absolutely stunning War Films. I highly recommend this film, especially to those who are Christian, as a Christian myself it made me think about my morals and how I view ""The Act of War"". I think everybody should see this film at least once. It's not for the faint of heart, but it gives a brutally accurate representation of the battlefield and a glimpse at what it was actually like for Desmond. Film Classification: MA15+ Film Length: 139 mins Film Rating: 10/10"
"agulisane","10","8","14","14 March 2017"," A film that reminds you to respect the sacrifices of so many.
","This movie is one of the greatest war films I have ever seen. It is real, raw, and is definitely not for those who can't handle blood! Its lack of swearing is unique to this genre, but the brutality of some of the scenery makes up for the missing profanity. It puts you in the heart of someone's moral struggle of wanting to help, but being unwilling to submit to changing one's self. It makes you think about where you personally stand on issues, while causing you to reflect on the history of America and the very real battles we faced. It makes you respect those who have come before us all, and what their families and love ones have overcome."

","I'm not sure I see the difference between self-defense and relying on another for defense of self in order to complete an assigned mission. Yes, the actions of Doss were heroic, but could he have accomplished what he did without a soldier with a gun beside his side doing the killing for him? And if that's the case, what's the difference? The Japanese soldier is not any less dead no matter who pulled the trigger and Private Doss is no less involved in the death of that soldier than if he had pulled the trigger. Is the soldier who pulled the trigger on Doss' behalf more morally stained by the act of killing for another? Perhaps less so since he stepped forward to perform a necessary evil when another would not. The movie tries to make all of this a black and white morality issue and it is so far from that.<br/><br/>Did Doss really have the luxury of not eating meat on the WWII battlefield? I found this movie frustrating for several reasons. The lengthy buildup to combat was unnecessary and seemed forced in order to add length to the movie."

","I came to Hacksaw Ridge hoping for an interesting and realistic portrayal of the life of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who saved the lives of countless battlefield wounded, as a medic.<br/><br/>What you get instead is saccharine, hero stick, smothered beneath thick coatings of religious rhetoric. Its painful stuff, that had me squirming in my seat within the first five minutes of the film's opening scenes. <br/><br/>Just as bothersome is the assumption its ""OK"" to be a behave like a nihilistic, cruel drunk (the father character) because ""hey, he served in the war"". This is such a common excuse, in US made war films and television that really does not hold up to close scrutiny.<br/><br/>The war scenes in this film are well shot (it does come with a huge budget) and the acting is of a good caliber. That said, there's little of substance on offer here, aside from romanticizing brutal and awful events, that, in my mind, deserve a more somber, down to earth treatment. <br/><br/>Four out of ten from me."
"donaldb627","10","11","21","20 November 2016"," Heroes in spandex need not apply
","If there is one thing I could take away from this movie it is to beware of criticizing people different from your beliefs and values. The very values they embrace (and which you criticize), may one day save your life.<br/><br/>Growing up in the Adventist culture I met Desmond twice, once at a youth retreat, and another time I had lunch with him and family. They (Doss, wife, and son) were in a hospital cafeteria. They were sitting at a table for four and I asked if I could join them. They were more than happy for me to sit with them. I didn't recognize him at first, but his wife let me know who he was :) <br/><br/>He was a very gracious and quiet man. He did his duty without hesitation or regard for his own safety or an iota of self-interest. His courage and commitment to duty far outweighed any gun he might have holstered. The fact he was never killed in the line of duty is a miracle. The many, many lives he saved, amazingly even more so.<br/><br/>The part that got me the most in the film was when he started sending men down the escarpment in his (unofficial) double bowline custom knot. The soldiers watching didn't know what was going on, then they realized it was ""Doss, the coward"". No greater love hath a man that lays down his life for his friends - such act speaks louder and stronger than any sermon or speech given by politician or preacher. It transcends religion or ideology. It is the essence of what it means to be a loving human being.<br/><br/>To Mel and the crew, thank you for sharing what it truly means to be a hero. So different than the fantasy spandex 'heroes' of our popular culture."
"aharmas","10","11","21","6 November 2016"," Against All Odds
","Mel Gibson has made unforgettable films. When he brought back the Mayas during their civilization's last days, it was an incredible montage of sounds and landscapes. Here was a window into the past, fully complemented with a Mayan language soundtrack. He did a much more and controversial portrayal of the days leading to Christ's death. People complained about the violence in his films, and he's not to disappoint his audience with his new entry, a tribute to the heroism of a soldier who refused to carry a weapon, even to protect the members of his battalion but who had no qualms about risking his life to save others.<br/><br/>Our hero is introduced as a very agreeable and ultra charming member of a community who has been exposed to the ravages of war before. His immediate family is traumatized by what the father saw while he was in the service, and because of events in his home, he chooses to dedicate his life to peace and to help others. Eventually he must confront what society expects of him, and he becomes the target of prejudice and the beliefs of others. Soon, he clears his name, only to find himself in the nightmarish world of war.<br/><br/>Gibson puts together a sensational and more violent, realistic view of battle. There's just enough gore to upset you, but the display of explosions, shootings, and attacks shows little restraint. The tension and the horrors are all there, and one can't stop looking at nastiness and illogical nature of war.<br/><br/>Now it's only time to wait and see the accolades that are coming to the team who put it together, and like ""Mad Max"" last year, the team has shown us that magic can still happen at the movies, with a solid source, great storytelling, and direction of the best type."
"jdonalds-5","10","11","21","6 November 2016"," By far the best infantry WWII movie ever
","Wow! I can't say enough about this movie and how well it was done. Mel Gibson managed to tell this true story in the best way it could have been told, with superb direction (and I can be easily critical of direction), superb cinematography, great acting, and a good story board.<br/><br/>The battle for Okinawa was brutal. Over 100,000 died in that action. The Japanese soldiers were overwhelming at times, and ruthless in their battle action. Tens of thousands of American soldiers died there. It is wonderful that the action and story of Desmond Doss has been brought to the surface and exposed to millions. He was a true hero.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate the brutality of war, shown in a very realistic way, then the rest of this movie will be amazing for you to watch. I am a big WWII movie fan (of which there are many hundreds if not thousands). I tend to mostly enjoy the movies that involve equipment and machines, but for an infantry based movie this one simply can not be beat. It's a 10 on my list and I don't give out many 10s.<br/><br/>I know Spielberg has made many popular movies including Saving Private Ryan which is exactly in the same genre as Hacksaw Ridge, but I almost always find something lacking in Spielberg's productions (Schindler's List being the one exception). Not so here in Mel Gibson's project which sets a new bar for direction. It is as real as it gets."

I heard grown men sobbing through that silence.<br/><br/>Having grown up in Lynchburg I knew Doss's story well but the movie made it come to life. It's a lengthy movie but you really feel like they could've told so much more yet you leave w/an amazing respect for Doss and appreciation for the brutality of war.

Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. This is great movie hero ever.<br/><br/>While growing up near Lynchburg, Virginia, a young Desmond Doss nearly kills his younger brother Hal. After that incident, Desmond Doss swear to god, will not kill human. Years later, Doss takes a man injured by a car to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They enter into a relationship and Doss tells her of his desire to do medical work.<br/><br/>At the outbreak of World War II, Doss is motivated to enlist in the Army. His father, a troubled World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts.<br/><br/>Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but fail. <br/><br/>They complete basic training and are released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Dorothy visits Doss in jail and tries to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial, Doss pleads guilty but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.<br/><br/>Doss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division. In the initial fight, both sides sustain heavy losses. Meanwhile, Doss successfully saves several soldiers, including those with severe injuries. The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed and many Americans, including Howell and several of Doss' squad mates, are injured and left on the battlefield. After Smitty, who is Doss buddy, is dead, Doss hears the cries of the dying soldiers and decides to run back into the carnage. He starts carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff's edge and rappelling them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell and the two finally escape Hacksaw under enemy fire. Doss rescue totally 75 soldier include Japanese soldier.<br/><br/>Captain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his miraculous efforts, and that they will not launch the next attack without him. Despite the next day being Doss' Sabbath day, he joins his fellow soldiers after finishing his prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle and Japan surrendered the battle. Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss descends the cliff, clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him.<br/><br/>After rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, Doss is awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman.

","Ten years has fleetingly passed since Mel Gibson's last directorial outing APOCALYPTO (2006), HACKSAW RIDGE is his fifth feature in the director chair, just debuted in Venice, out of competition. It is a WWII drama about the US war hero Desmond T. Doss (Garfield), who is, quoting the film's tagline, one of the greatest heroes in America History never fired a bullet, is it an undisguised retort to Clint Eastwood's trigger-happy American SNIPER (2014)?<br/><br/>Desmond's persuasion of refusal to kill people is ingrained by his religious upbringing and cemented by one childhood incident when he accidentally injured his brother during a tussle. In peace time, it is a precept without any question for every citizen to follow suit, but, not during wartime when massive killing obviously becomes a default means pumped up by jingoism and triggered by human's violent nature.<br/><br/>Instead of being a conscientious objector, Desmond volunteers to join the army as many young men of his time, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, even though his father Tom Doss (Weaving, strikingly upstages his co-stars with searing potency) is a WWI veteran and has been traumatized by his encounter with savagery ever since. and doesn't think Desmond's ideology can find a toehold in the army. But Desmond has his own plan, galvanized by his romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Palmer), he decides to enlist as a medic, to save lives instead of taking them, so that he doesn't need to relinquish his principle.<br/><br/>As one can imagine, his singularity is regarded as an unthinkable defiance in the eyes of his peers and his senior officials in the boot camp, he is picked on, verbally abused, beaten up, even subjected to imprisonment, simply because he refuses to touch a rifle or any lethal weapon. Against all odds, Desmond sticks to his guns, but it is Tom who pulls the strings, to seek permission to allow his son entering the battlefield without a weapon, which singles him out as the most conflicting character in a film suffused with one-note display of military discipline and war heroes.<br/><br/>The next thing is the real deal, the close-combat between USA and Japan on the Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Gibson doesn't refrain from bombarding his spectators with rousing spectacle where death and injuries escalating exponentially in both warring parties, bullets-flying, blood-spurting, limbs-flapping, hell couldn't be worse than that. After the failed attempt to take over the ridge, which costs US army grave casualties, Desmond, lucky enough to be alive-and-kicking at that point, receives an epiphany from God. He plunges himself into the combat zone again rather than retreating with his troop, taking advantage of the night time, under the eyelid of Japanese army, he begins to drag those injured soldiers one by one to the edge of the cliff and send them down to the ground in rappel, in one night, he heroically saves over 75 lives of his comrades (some Japanese too) and miraculously survives from enemy's scouting, which immediately revitalizes the dwindling esprit de corps, in the subsequent attack, they triumphantly conquers the ridge, Desmond is wounded by an explosion, but it is not lethal, later he is awarded the Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The movie sends his anti-war message lucidly with its no-holds-barred delineation of the visceral cruelty in the front-line and valiantly advocates Desmond's peace-loving philosophy which makes wonder in the face of extreme adversity. Andrew Garfield gives a commendable impression as the wide-eyed hero, gangly, unsophisticated, dogged in his belief, fearless when he is doing the right thing, the only gripe is that he seems to more like a poshly shoehorned exemplar of individual heroism, than a complex personage survived from the ordeal of war. Another gnawing fact is Mel Gibson's politically problematic treatment of the enemy side - cannon fodder plus emotionless killing machine, which fails to bestow this engaging war movie a discerning conscience, especially when a blatant white-flag hoax is intentionally orchestrated to underline the rival's duplicitous nature, it indeed boomerangs and undercuts the empathy of this hagiography. Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster, but if we want a pièce de résistance with enduring impact, in all likelihood, he might not be the one we can bank on."

","Wow I just watched this movie the other day and it was Insane. I will start with the story which is about Pfc. Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don't know their history. The story is executed perfectly in the roughly 2hr and 15min movie. The first half shows his life and boot camp and the second half the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is based on a true story as well which makes it that much more grounded. The acting is tremendously Superb. I mean Andrew Garfield killed it lol. No pun intended. I know some people don't like him but he was great at portraying a convicted individual who's beliefs were being attacked. The other three standouts were Capt. Glover played by Sam Worthington and Sgt. Howell played by Vince Vaughn and finally Tom Doss played by Hugo Weaving. They all were Impeccable in their acting. The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie."
"Ramascreen","10","10","19","3 November 2016"," Powerful! A remarkable film about a remarkable true story.
","Whatever opinions you may have of Mel Gibson, the man did say some terrible things in the past, but one thing we can't get over is the fact that he's a master filmmaker. HACKSAW RIDGE is a powerful depiction of pure-hearted heroism. A remarkable film about an remarkable true story you can't believe actually happened. And with his compelling performance, Andrew Garfield has placed himself among some of the greatest actors of all time.<br/><br/>Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was Seventh-Day Adventist, a faithful Christian. But when WWII happened, he couldn't sit idly by while his fellow brothers went out to fight. Not believing in killing, Doss refused to take up arms and instead chose to serve as Army medic. This personal decision caused tension in his unit, but ultimately the army allowed him to go into hell fire without a single weapon to protect him. There at the Battle of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles of WWII, Doss ended up saving the lives of many of his fellow soldiers resulting in him being the first conscientious objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>In this day and age when ignorant folks like Trump loudly and proudly describe masculinity as marginalizing the others and oppressing the powerless, stories like Desmond Doss reminds us what it truly means to be courageous. That's what I love about this is that it turns the notion that if you don't kill, then you're a coward, over on its head. It's a miracle if you think about it, Doss risked his life in the midst of a battlefield to pull his fellow soldiers one by one to safety, a story that remarkable deserves well-crafted film and that's what HACKSAW RIDGE gives us.<br/><br/>Excellent performances by all the actors involved in this film, almost all of them are not even actual Americans and yet you can't tell difference when you see them on the screen because they embody the essence and they serve the story with immense respect. That transition from this beautiful landscape of home and romance into an awful place where bodies mangled everywhere, that itself will evoke heart-wrenching emotions. Of course, this is a Mel Gibson movie, so don't expect any less than hard R, the man doesn't shy away from cinematic violence, so brace yourself for intense prolonged graphic war sequences and grisly images, just as the rating itself says, it will get you to the core. Much bloodier war sequences than ""Saving Private Ryan."" But I think that is necessary because in order to do Doss' story justice, you can't sugarcoat or soften what have clearly been described in war records about those fateful days.<br/><br/>In his portrayal of Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield approaches it like the good guys' good guy, so convincingly that by the end of this film, even if you're not much a man of faith, you're going to say, 'I want what that guy has.' There's something that's so Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart about Andrew Garfield in this film. This is his most mature, most perfect performance yet.<br/><br/>Overall, you don't have to be a Christian to fully appreciate this film, Mel Gibson himself had said that this is a love story, a man's love for his fellow man. So if you come at it from that perspective, you'll still be able to embrace it too, because Doss' story needs to be told and shared from one generation to the next and HACKSAW RIDGE is a great way of going about it.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

","Mel Gibson does it again, proving himself once again to be one of Hollywood's best directors. Andrew Garfield brings a compelling Desmond Doss and Gibson rightly centers him in the majority of the film. I've seen reviews that bristle at the gruesome violence and temper that with the ""war is hell"" statement, but even Vince Vaughn said they had to reduce the violence not for audience acceptance, but rather that Doss's exemplary live-saving efforts would otherwise almost be beyond human comprehension. This film is an outstanding testament to and recognition of a rare man who had the both the courage to not let his Christian convictions be compromised while earnestly supporting his country without regard for his own life."

","Can I just say, ""WOW""! This movie will go down as my favorite war movie of all time. I know people will say, ""What about Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now"". This movie had elements from all war movies,, but what made it different was the war-hero was a bad-ass without shooting one bullet. I have to say that Mel Gibson is back and better than ever! The way he told this story and filmed it was phenomenal. Definite Oscar Nom, if not win. And Andrew Garfield. He went from a Marvel teen actor to a definite Oscar winner. His performance was breathtaking. But one of the biggest surprises in this movie had to be Vince Vaughn. I mean the casting people couldn't have picked a better person for this role and you would have never expected it. He was just the right amount of comic relief you needed and at the same time he played a very realistic sergeant.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie took the war movie genre to a whole new level!"

","Wow, this movie was very very good. At first I had my doubts about watching it, as when I saw the trailer, it seemed to be a too heavy movie for me. But as I said above, since there was not a lot of new interesting movie during this weekend (the other one was a horror movie which most likely I would be watching by myself sometime later), I really did not regret watching this one. It has everything from touching scenes, powerful moments, cool special effects, good make up effects, nice sound effects & music, and wonderful performances from the main characters. <br/><br/>My wife and I really enjoyed the movie and I think unanimously the audience (which was almost full house by the way), were amazed at this one and some of them even clapped their hands after it was finished. Despite around half of the movie was a little bit dramatic, with some romance and the other half was about the war, we really did not feel the movie too long even though its running time was 2 hrs 11 minutes. And surprisingly, the movie that I saw was fully without cut scenes. <br/><br/>Please be reminded though that the war scenes here were very brutal. Mel Gibson as the director did not make the war to be with elegant action scenes. They were totally what I believe a war would have been like. The scenes were gruesome and I really think that this is not a suitable movie for kids. So I would be surprised if parents would bring their children to watch this (which did not happen when I watched this one). The romantic scenes between Desmond and Dorothy was brief but nice and they seemed to have a believable chemistry.<br/><br/>The movie also has so many morale messages and I think each one of us would have our own impression. My wife was truly inspired with the scene of Desmond's confusion of what he was supposed to do in the war when the answer came to him in such a manner. While I myself was amazed of how strong Desmond can stand for his beliefs even with so many challenges were thrown at him. Even though this was a war drama movie, it also has some few funny moments. My most memorable scene was during the first training of Desmond and his fellow infantry unit led by Sergeant Howell. Those were priceless scenes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think I am running out of praises to this movie. I understand that the movie got a 10 minute standing ovation after it was screened in the 73rd Venice Film Festival and it was widely considered as an Oscar worthy movie. I think that you can just simply go to the cinema and watch it. <br/><br/>For my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

","The acting was more convincing than any war movie I have ever seen, and it was pretty accurate with the facts of Desmond Doss, except that according to those were there, they say that is was far more harrowing than the movie depicts, particularly when Desmond set up the net to hang down from the cliff with two others. That this is a true movie, well, it had all of us on the edge of our seats, the movie depicts the horror and terror of war more accurately than any this war buff has ever seen.

","Mel Gibson has put together a great bunch of (mainly Australian) actors who bring their characters to life. Andrew Garfield does an amazing portrayal of Desmond Dos, and full marks have to go to Vince Vaughn who makes a brilliant sergeant.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is very similar to Sergeant York, except that Desmond Dos won't touch a gun. We can only marvel at his strength of convictions. <br/><br/>Given that war films are a dime a dozen, and the initial barrack room scene has been done to death, the initial barrack room scene in this movie is original and novel. It is also quite funny.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie provides many examples of Dos' courage. A courage that most of us can only wonder at. Here is a man who is prepared to go into battle unarmed, with the sole aim of saving lives.<br/><br/>Unlike in We Were Soldiers, Mr Gibson seems to have kept a lot closer to the facts, although he still put in his customary bayonet charge near the end.<br/><br/>Showing the actual interview with Desmond Dos at the end was the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>I was very surprised to read in Wiki that Dos did many more heroic deeds than those displayed in the movie, and that he was wounded three times.<br/><br/>A true hero and a great film."

","Only a few films in the world exist would make me watch them over and over again. In 1995, Mel Gibson directed Braveheart and this piece work has done so well that we continue to celebrate this movie today. Movies based on the true story have enormous power and theme with feelings and emotions subject matter touches real lives therefore, it is only right the director would want to show to the audience the real story to be close as possible to the reality. Director Mel Gibson has shown his excellent technique & unique work again in what I call a Masterpiece which is: The Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>I watched Hacksaw Ridge for the first time and I had no idea what the film is about, the only information I had that it was based on the actual events. I thought about another boring war movie where most of the scenes are taken on the battlefield. Surprisingly, after the first minutes of the film, I was interested in the music composition, amazing story adaptation, pictures, etc. The film made such an impression on me that I started to be curious who is responsible for directing and an excellent acting performance. He could not have handle a real story of the medic Desmond T. Doss any better as shown in this movie. With its realistic scenes and great acting by Andrew Garfield playing the main role, it engages the viewer into the reality, romance, war, drama, faith and strong willpower. I recommend to every viewer, this film carries a strong message for all of us."
"phd_travel","10","9","17","20 January 2017"," A remarkable hero and a remarkable movie
","This is the best large scale war movie in years. The screenplay by Robert Schenkkan is emotionally charged and involving. The direction by Mel Gibson is superb. The battle sequences is second to none. Scary and not confusing at all. This movie is a must watch. <br/><br/>The first part shows the childhood and character shaping events of Desmond Doss. It may seem slow to those eager for a typical war movie but his unique personality is what made him different and such a unique hero. His alcoholic father and other reasons why he abhorred violence are made clear. His romance is unlike some movies not annoying at all. Teresa Palmer makes a believable and warm love interest. She reminds of a more salt of the earth K Stew - really purty. His training and the opposition he faced not carrying a gun seems a little too much. Makes you more amazed why he still wanted to fight at all. All this gets a lot of sympathy for the main character emotionally like most Mel Gibson's movies you are 100% behind the hero.<br/><br/>Then the battle begins. That ridge looks pretty daunting. I know it wasn't possible to film in actual locations since the location in Okinawa is very much built over. But the ridge doesn't look like the landscape of Okinawa I guess because it was filmed in Australia. But that doesn't detract much from the terrific battle sequences that are scary and some of the best ever filmed. After the first main battle is over then the heroics of Desmond start and they are just so unbelievable it has to be a true story. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is right doing the hillbilly thing well and then the unlikely hero even better. He is perfect for the role. It helps to have recognizable supporting cast like Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey so you can remember who is who when they are fighting.<br/><br/>This is a movie that will leave you spent. If Mel's name didn't carry with it the unfortunate associations with his tirades it ought to bag all the awards."

","I just saw Hacksaw Ridge and thought it was a great movie. The story was well told, the actors did it justice and the battle scenes were the best I've seen. It gave a frightening view of how war really is hell. The word ""hero"" is used too lightly today, usually for multi million dollar earning sports stars...but these soldiers were the real thing. Mel Gibson has made a worthy tribute not just to the main character, but to all the brave guys who endured and sacrificed so much so that we can sit in our homes with the freedom to speak our minds. While I don't agree with the anti-Semitic views that Mel Gibson uttered when he was being arrested, I feel he has done his penance and shouldn't be ostracized by the Academy....and I bet there are quite a few among Hollywood's actors who have similar unacceptable views about Jewish people, gay people, anyone who is not white etc etc....but they are careful not to let it slip in public. Hacksaw Ridge deserves to win multiple Oscars and it would be a travesty if it doesn't do so."

Being brought up on a diet of the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Superman, etc where the hero steadfastly fights for justice for all, I do love stories about courageous people and especially ones where the good guys win. Hacksaw Ridge tells just such a story and most wonderfully it is true. Doss goes through his own personal battle of holding on to what he believes no matter the treatment he receives from both his fellow soldiers as well as the army commanders. He could have so easily given in but was determined to find a way of helping others, something he achieves in spades. But it is also a movie that reveals the courage of all the soldiers who fight in wars. How did these men find the guts to scale that cliff and face the barrage of bullets they knew were coming, how does anyone do that? Wonderfully acted and filmed. I admit to having grave fears about Garfield being capable of portraying Doss but wow he pulled it off so very well.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Why doesn't every high school student learn about Desmond Doss in History class? Beyond that, why isn't Desmond Doss profiled in every Psychology and Philosophy class? It's inexplicable that more Americans aren't familiar with his story, much less failing to honor his legacy with a well deserved tribute. Fortunately director Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and screenwriters Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) and Robert Schenkkan (""The Pacific"") bring us a spirited look at this under-appreciated American war hero.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Desmond Doss and perfectly embodies the conviction and dedication of this extraordinary (not hyperbole in this case) man. See, Desmond Doss was one of the first conscientious objectors in the U.S. Army. His religious beliefs (Seventh Day Adventist) prohibited him from using a weapon or killing another person  two things that don't go over well with fellow soldiers or commanding officers. Yet, Doss was committed to serving his country as a medic and saving lives, rather than taking them.<br/><br/>Unbelievable may be the best description even though his story is absolutely true. Credited with saving the lives of at least 75 wounded soldiers, Doss and his fellow soldiers are depicted in the film fighting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge  a topographical challenge punctuated by the need to climb a rope wall in order to scale the face of the cliff. Their reward was facing thousands of Japanese hiding in tunnels and bunkers, waiting patiently to kill in mass. There will be no spoilers here on the courageous actions of Doss  you should see for yourself.<br/><br/>The early part of the film features a heart-warming first love story involving Desmond Doss and Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer, The Choice). Watching young love bloom is precious and provides a stark contrast to the battle scenes. The two make a lovely couple and we can't help but root for them. Once Doss hits basic training, we find Vince Vaughn in the role of Sergeant Howell, Sam Worthington (failing to hide his Aussie accent) as Captain Glover, and Luke Bracey (Point Break, 2015) as Smitty, one of the soldiers who initially has no interest in serving with Doss. The Army Psychologist is played by Richard Roxburgh, whom movies lovers will recognize as The Duke from Moulin Rouge! (2001).<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes involve Desmond's parents played by screen vets Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Both are excellent in roles requiring very different and extreme emotional moments. It's a credit to Gibson's filmmaking expertise that he is able to add depth to all aspects – family turmoil, a classic love story, the brutality of war, and the deep religious convictions. There are a few moments of ""artistic license"" and some of the CGI is inconsistent and even over-produced at times, but the intensity of the battle scenes rival that of Saving Private Ryan and the landing at Omaha Beach. It's a passionate piece of filmmaking centered on a most passionate man. You may disagree with much of what Mel Gibson has said and done in his personal life (and I hope you do), but as a film director he has earned much respect. And speaking of respect  Desmond Doss. Enough said."
"SimonJack","9","5","8","24 October 2017"," Rare film these days of a hero of the past
","With more than 600 reviewer comments in October 2017, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" doesn't need any more reviews. But, I should weigh in on a couple of points – about the film and its reception. <br/><br/>First, the film. I congratulate Mel Gibson for tackling historic subjects in his films. We have far too little of that in the 21st century, yet there is so much modern society can learn from the past. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't seem very interested in telling the stories of heroes and heroics of saints and sinners. In this case, a little known hero, Desmond Doss, is the first conscientious objector in U.S. history to receive the Medal of Honor. Gibson took a 2004 documentary and made an outstanding film about a true hero. <br/><br/>My bone to pick with the film is its Computer-generated Imagery. I realize it's nearly impossible in the 21st century to make a war film set just about anywhere during World War II. The places just aren't there to shoot anymore. Nor is there sufficient remaining equipment, machines, vehicles and other materials of the time and period. So, for much of the shelling and action of this film, CGI was necessary. It wouldn't have been so noticeably CGI if Mel Gibson hadn't want to be so graphic with bullets ripping through bodies, legs being blown off, etc. There is so much of that in this film, and it appears so crisp and clear as to be unbelievable, unreal. Our human eyes don't see things most of the time nearly as sharp and clearly defined as CGI presents them. <br/><br/>I might have given this a pass except for a few scenes that were so clearly phony. Body parts or other objects from explosions are flung into the air in all directions. Several instances are so obvious drawn or created images with flames coming off of them as they fly rather slowly through the air. It's clear to me that the technical and creative people don't have CGI down pat or perfected yet. There's just too much of this in the film that one can't help be aware of it, so that knocks the film down from 10 stars to nine. <br/><br/>The second point related to the film is the Academy Awards and other 2017 recognition paid by the members of the film industry. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss was an Army medic who served in the Pacific theater during World War II. The full story of his heroism is much more impressive even than this film shows. Andrew Garfield gives a tremendous performance as Doss. This is truly great acting – which the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA awards are supposed to recognize. I haven't seen all of the movies with the nominees for best actor, but I did see most. I can't imagine what politics or other things may be at play. That Garfield didn't win the best actor is a true shame on all of the industry groups. <br/><br/>I have nothing against Casey Affleck, but his role in ""Manchester by the Sea"" had the least demands for acting of any of the nominees. It can't hold a candle to Garfield's performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Again, Hollywood and the industry seem to thrive more on personal popularity, looks or some other criteria."
"lachlan399","8","5","8","10 June 2017"," A truly moving film
","This movie was very different from any other typical war movie. The bravery and stupidity shown by the main character (Andrew Garfield) was remarkably moving, with running into a war-zone with no weapon of any sort to defend himself. Instead of weapons only having a medical kit and fierce determination to save every life he could. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for the clichè and very slow start to the movie where he found love before going to war, I would have given this movie a 9 or 10. In saying this, it was a huge step up for Andrew's acting career in comparison to mediocre movies like Amazing Spiderman 1 & 2.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Hacksaw Ridge, it truly is another Mel Gibson masterpiece. Just try not to be deterred from the slow start as it will have you on the edge of your seat by the end and close to tears."

","I recently gave ""The Pacific,"" a modern treatment of the Pacific Theater by Tom Hanks a two-star rating for his poor portrayal of our troops during WW2. Like many modern treatments, they highlight the lowest level of language and behaviour.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson did an excellent job of avoiding the seedy trash talk and sexual content so many others make as their focus. He also highlighted the Christian faith of the main character, doing so in an honorable way. The gore of battle was a little too graphic for me, and made it not viewable by my younger children.

"Paulyreviews","8","5","8","26 February 2017"," Paolo's movie picks on Hacksaw Ridge
","After the great success with Bravehart, The Passion of Christ and Apocalypto, Mel Gibson makes a great comeback with Hacksaw Ridge. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) enlists in the army during the American invasion of Japan ( World War II). However for his strong ethical and religious convictions he decides to do so without shooting (without ever handling a rifle), and after being vilified by all his comrades during the prep phase, will act as the doctor in the assault line of Hacksaw Ridge, on the coast of the island of Okinawa. Desmond Doss is a historical figure and is the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor from the American government. Fortunately (I hope I wont be bashed for this) the film does not become a tribute to the US Army, an exaltation of the war and its heroes. The battle scenes (stunning) are not only visually violent, but they're psychologically gut wrenching and portray the horrors in a sublime way. Very good interpretations by the entire cast. If this is your genre then it's a MUST SEE. Score: 8"
"cosmo_tiger","8","5","8","25 February 2017"," This is a fantastic movie that I highly recommend and I can see why it's up for Best Picture, but not at Private Ryan level.
","""I don't know how I'm gonna live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe."" Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) has joined the Army. He wishes, more than anything, to serve his country in battle by becoming an Army medic. When his intentions to not carry a rifle are announced his entire company sees him as a coward and is put up for Court Marshall. After fighting the charge with everything he has Doss is allowed to serve, and becomes the first soldier in history to receive the Medal of Honorall without firing a single shot. This is a wonderful movie. The fact that it's true really helps the message and enjoyment of it, not to mention the acting by Garfield. This is a story that needed to be told, especially in today's climate and one that is worth watching, and must be seen. All that said I don't think this movie quite gets to the level of Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers, but it is still one of the better war movies I have ever seen. The emotion and story of this one is what really makes it great and worth seeing. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that I highly recommend and I can easily see why it's up for Best Picture, but on the other hand I would be surprised if it actually won. Great movie, but not at Private Ryan level. I give this an A-."

"rblenheim","10","5","8","22 February 2017"," Mel Gibson merges a vision of the hell of war and great human heroism, and it's a masterpiece!
","I had about as much interest in seeing a new film by Mel Gibson as I had in submitting to a root canal, but I found ""Hacksaw Ridge"" a complete revelation and one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Gibson has had a scattered directorial career since winning the Oscar in 1995 for his second film: the entertaining if overrated ""Braveheart"". In the following two decades he managed to direct only the sadistic and overwrought ""Passion of the Christ"" in 2004 and his mystical visionary work, ""Apocalypto"" in 2006. And now, after a ten year hiatus, he's given us what seems likely to remain his crowning achievement, the deeply-felt true story of World War II army medic Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), the conscientious objector who earned the Medal of Honor by saving dozens of his fellow soldiers in the Battle of Okinawa while refusing to even hold a weapon. Although the violence in this film is the most explicit and shocking of any war film ever made (it truly makes the opening battle at Omaha Beach in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" a playground fistfight by comparison), in context it's never gratuitous or offensive. The horrendous battle scenes never drive viewers out of the theater for two reasons, both important cinematic principles. First, in the film's first half Gibson gets viewers so emotionally involved with the main character, particularly with the relationship with his father (Hugo Weaving) as well as with the woman he loves (Teresa Palmer), audiences will easily accept the subsequent scenes of hell by caring so much. Secondly, Gibson portrays the battle scenes like great frescoes -- with bloodied, limbless bodies exploding and flying about within moving tapestries like peripheral details within a Bosch triptych. What makes this production more astonishing is that ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was an independent film produced on a relatively low budget, most of its battle scenes having been shot in New South Wales, Australia in an area not much larger than a football field.<br/><br/>A noteworthy success on every technical level possible, with marvelous performances by the entire cast (most notably Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington), Gibson's achievement here is impossible to overrate. He has made not only one of the finest war films ever made, but also a cinematic chronicle that contrasts the bloodiest and most brutal acts of man's inhumanity to man with a profoundly moving, moralistic act of civilized human behavior amidst the worst hell of the human experience. This is a film not to miss."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","20","46","19 November 2016"," Do not praise this boring film with your shallow patriotism
","I think Andrew Garfield might be the worst candidate who we could deem as an actor. I've watched every film he played as the leading character, including he masked and covered under a Spiderman suit. Yet every film I saw I just got the same feeling of wrong cast in a wrong movie. This guy as an actor to play so many different roles but no matter what, he just showed himself as a young guy who never could keep his mouth closed tightly enough but always mindlessly half opened with his lower lip further out than his upper lip, a guy with a abnormal long crane-like long and thin neck and a thick but not likable hairs on his head. He always gave off a nerdy and dumb expression no matter what he played. All of these shortcomings didn't fade or transform better when he grew older. There's no way that I could convince myself to believe any character he played but a stronger certainty of wrong casting jobs again and again.<br/><br/>The whole screenplay just looks hollow, shallow and stereotyped. A trick that have been used thousand times to patch up a got-nothing-tell story, a popular and trendy way to advertise a sales pitch that this is a serious movie based on ""True Event"" or ""True Character"". But once these laughable words were used, only two things could immediately assured: A) There actually nothing to tell, i.e., No Beef, B) A certainty of a lousy movie.<br/><br/>So this format we got here is like this: Two kid brothers growing up in a dirt poor family with a retired soldier father, a do-nothing drunk and a non-caring fatherhood; with an opposite loving and care mother, also a loyal church goer. The brother almost killed his kid brother during a playful fight in front of their parents when it became out-of-control. Then this brother repented himself by facing a Christian Bible picture on the wall, focusing on those hollow ""Thou shalt not kill"" dogma. And then that biblical crap became his one and only belief and faith that he later carried with it into Army boot camp. Then again, since the screenplay got actually nothing too much to say, a large segment of this film was forcefully to describe how this guy with such unpractical and anti-American valued Patriotism ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" firm belief and principle to survive in the training camp. Again, more already used hundred times formula was borrowed again: A loud mouthed, always yelling and screaming Sergent and a bunch of tight-arsed high ranking officers, a beating, an almost being kicked out or even court-marshaled scene, a strong protest of his right as a qualified soldier who never wanted to hold a rifle to aim and kill then ultimate enemy, the Japanese soldiers. Then blah, blah and blah. Fighting scenes, his suddenly found unbelievable valor to save his brother-in-arms again and again in the battle field as a medic. And of course, casting a beautiful actress as his love, an eye-candy for the unfortunate viewers to ensure some possibility of increasing the box office....Supporting this hollow film with annoying patriotic background music...happily married and stayed together until his wife's early demise....Then of course, old faces in retrospection (a must) showed up on the screen in the final to certify that this is a true story.<br/><br/>What we got here is just like branded powdered milk formula for your babies with an image of a not-quite-so-young-now funny face guy with thin and long neck and always mindlessly open mouth. Drink this milk, it's good for your health and your continued growth of your blind Patriotism."

","I was looking forward to this feel-good American, WWII hero story directed by Mel Gibson. Spoiler: it was filmed in New South Wales, Australia which immediately dropped my potential ranking down a star from the git-go. <br/><br/>I have as much 'Passion' as the next guy, but the first 'homie' HOUR of movie produced so many smiley faces I thought I was in a Disney Family movie.<br/><br/>Finally we are off to 1940s WWII Army boot camp and now I'm in a Lewis & Martin WWII training film. Vince Vaughn's 'drill sergeant' act belonged in an Abbott & Costello film. IF ANY American was in charge of U.S. military authenticity for the training scenes, they were drinking too many schooners of Fosters. I wouldn't cross the street with Vaughn's character, let alone go into battle with him!<br/><br/>Battle scenes: what can be said. The realism was 'Private Ryan' great, but how many disemboweled scenes are necessary? The dialogue, well get out the tissues again. Honest to Gosh I heard Sergeant Howell say, ""..cover me.."" as he was RETREATING. Battle dialogue was straight out of 1960s TV show 'COMBAT'.<br/><br/>Military authenticity is lacking at the weirdest times in this movie as if the director was hoping no one would notice.

"joshteggert","9","8","15","27 February 2017"," An incredibly shot war film telling an irresistibly immersive story
","Despite Mel Gibson's ongoing controversy in the Hollywood limelight, his directional skills remain as tactless as his breakthrough back in 1995 with Braveheart, despite the 10-year gap between this and his last directing feature. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a true spectacle to behold, wonderfully exciting in the action pieces and fantastically entrancing in the quieter moments, ultimately conjugating to form this modern classic war film: emotional, gritty and stunning, achieving successes that haven't been truly fulfilled since Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan', almost 20 years ago.<br/><br/>The plots follow the life of Desmond Doss and his determination to serve as a part of the army during World War 2, whilst also being a conscientious objector. He is sent to Fort Jackson to train with the 77th Infantry Division, who are assigned to the island of Okinawa, a potentially crucial space of land in the Americans battle against the Japanese. Doss' inner struggle with the convictions of his beliefs is suitably portrayed by the remarkably similar looking Andrew Garfield, who is establishing himself as a high rising talent, venturing further from his youthful popular appeal into challenging new prospects, and in this instance, producing a heart-warming and captivating performance as the film's lead.<br/><br/>He is supported by a tremendous collection of esteemed actors (notably very few females here though), and the characters are individually distinctive. One of particular interest is Vince Vaughn, who plays Sergeant Howell, the brutal army Sergeant in charge of Doss' training. Known for his comedic roles throughout the 2000s, Vaughn has recently endeavoured to do more serious roles to differentiate from his very hit and miss comedy career. He displays his ability with persistence, jockeying his hardcore acting with also being the most comedic aspect of the film, and pulls it off tremendously. Furthermore, the fact that Hugo Weaving didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Doss's father, Tom, is bewildering. With an emotional and scarring past, Tom Doss is proficiently portrayed by Weaving who is consistently enigmatic when on screen, an absolute scene-stealer in every one he is in, and extremely enticing to watch.<br/><br/>But it is the cinematography that makes 'Hacksaw Ridge' an excellent war movie. The serenity, yet mundanity, of Doss' home town of Lynchburg, juxtaposed by spectacular scenes of battle between the Americans and the Japanese, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is very much a tale of two halves, each as interesting and gripping as the other. Gibson sustains tension throughout in many different formats, whether that be through family collisions, military attitudes towards Doss or conflict on the battlefield, there is always something to be enticed about. It is, however, let down by certain moments where the situation is overdramatised, with situations contrasted too often, resulting in moments of mixed impact, where the outcome should have been resolute.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is an exceptional biopic that places a bold stamp on the war genre, and is undeniably a great accomplishment in directing, acting and cinematography."

","Watchable but don't expect Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan<br/><br/>A lot of clichés and over the top behavior about a conscientious objector.

"Prismark10","6","8","15","22 January 2017"," Saved by Private Doss
","If you see the trailers of this film it does not even to tell you who made this film. Instead you are told that it is from the Oscar winning director of Braveheart. It shows how much the Mel Gibson name is mud in some quarters.<br/><br/>This is the first English language film directed by Gibson since Braveheart which was released in 1995. It is also notable that this film was made in Gibson's adopted homeland of Australia, the country his father relocated to in order that his older children would not be drafted to the Vietnam war. The film features many notable Australian actors.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge based on true events tells the story of army medic Desmond Doss who refused to hold a gun in battle but saves the lives of many of his comrades.<br/><br/>The opening of the film is more hackneyed ridge than hacksaw. Doss father is an alcoholic who also seems to be suffering shell shock from The Great War, Desmond as a boy nearly kills his brother and then he vows to stick to the commandment 'thou shalt not kill.' The older Desmond (Andrew Garfield) finds romance with a nurse but after Pearl Harbour enlists to join the army but because of his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. At basic training Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) does the usual clichéd spiel of getting the raw recruits battle ready. Gibson is in on the joke as he has Garfield grinning throughout it all. <br/><br/>Doss excels in his training but becomes an outcast when he refuses to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays as he is a Seventh-day Adventist. After Howell and his superiors fail to get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Howell turns his fellow soldiers against him by making Doss out to be a coward.<br/><br/>The film comes to life in the Battle of Okinawa. Gibson delivers a gory, violent fuelled, blood, guts and rats battle sequence where Doss goes about saving the lives of the injured soldiers. Doss considers whether this is his true purpose and why he is here.<br/><br/>However despite the battle action being well staged, it has to be remembered that Spielberg got here almost twenty years ago in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The film really suffers from a corny beginning and some parts of the script is pedestrian with the romance part certainly being cringe inducing. It is the battle segments that belatedly save the film but even then some of that gets silly such as one soldier holds a dead body as a shield in one arm, walks and fires a gun with the other or where Doss drags Howell in a makeshift sledge while Howells fires off his rounds."

","In honour of remembrance day, I went and watched ""Hacksaw Ridge"" at the theatre Friday night with some friends. <br/><br/>I thought it was going to be good, but that's an understatement; <br/><br/>WOW what a movie!<br/><br/>It's my 2nd favourite movie of the year hands down, and so fitting for what's going on in our world today.<br/><br/>There are so many levels to it that I was able to connect with and apply to my own life which I seem to do from any thing I watch or read these days. <br/><br/>With never having served in the Canadian military, I truly can never fully understand or appreciate what men and woman have to go thru in war. I have the utmost respect for any human willing to lay their life on the line for their country and communities, military/police/fire fighters etc. <br/><br/>Even though there are many things that greatly saddens me within these institutions, especially the taking of human life, as I believe all life is precious; no one deserves to have their life taken too soon. I do believe in justice and I believe the best system we can have here for that, is some type of prison system where the person has lost their freedom to do what they want. Maybe for more severe crimes more sever prisons....Siberia/The Arctic spring to mind. haha<br/><br/>But it saddens me that so many people will disrespect and burn their countries flag without having a healthy perspective of what their fellow countrymen go thru in trying to serve and protect the best way they know how, even if it is misguided at times. Sure we got good and bad soldiers, cops etc, but we should never blame all for evil of some. There is a reason the divorce rate is the highest amongst marriages that involve those who server in military or some form of police. The trauma and things they have to see, do and go thru, it can easily break your mind/heart. In the USA, 20-22 vets commit suicide every day, so these are serious issues.<br/><br/>We are a broken world filled with angry people and thats what we see and feel throughout history. And you especially see that anger in war and where those who are supposed to serve and protect you are the very ones who are hurting and abusing you. But like the movie illustrates, you can coward and blame others or you can do your best to fight for whats right, even when you feel the whole world is against you.<br/><br/>What is the answer to all that? <br/><br/>For me it's walking in my faith, and that was one of the most amazing theme's of Hacksaw Ridge. How no matter the obstacle, how serious, life and death the situation was, he relied on his faith and it got him threw it; even though sometimes it wasn't till the last second! He didn't blame others for the problems of the world, he just wanted to serve and save lives the best way he knew how. <br/><br/>He lead by example even though he took the beatings the world threw at him from his dad, his own military, to the Japanese, all who wanted to hurt him and even kill him. By leading by example, others wanted to now come up to his level instead of him coming down to theirs. You see this near the end of the movie in the most amazing way.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert...so don't read any further if you are going to go see it, but to see his fellow soldiers wait on going up the ridge for the next assault, because they saw the protection and blessing that God had on his life, they wanted his prayers because it was a miracle what he did the night before!<br/><br/>Before that day, they had assault after assault and failed miserably, with endless dead bodies and a demoralised people. After his prayers, well the American army finally took Hacksaw Ridge. It reminds so much of the old Testament and when God walked with Israel and they succeeded in their battles and when they didn't, their enemies won the battle. <br/><br/>James 5:16...... and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.<br/><br/>One person can always make a difference, and one person walking with God can change the world! <br/><br/>By his faith, he walked the walk, loved and served and what happened......GOD SHOWED UP!<br/><br/>GO WATCH THE MOVIE, honour our vets and get some perspective on what God can do when you put your faith in His ways instead of mans ways.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2-1hz1juBI"

","I now have a new leader in the clubhouse for BEST PICTURE OF 2016 - HACKSAW RIDGE.<br/><br/>From the Director of BRAVEHEART (more on that later), HACKSAW RIDGE tells the true story of Desmond Doss, the first Conscientous Objector to win the Medal of Honor when he saved 75 men from certain death on Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa during WWII<br/><br/>This film is divided into 3 parts.  The first focuses on Doss at home before the war, falling in love and dealing with an alcoholic father who is fighting his own demons from his experience in WW1, the second is your typical bootcamp scene where his platoon-mates and drill sargent must come to terms with Doss' Conscientous Objector status, and finally, the last part focuses on the experience on Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>The opening 3rd of the film is fairly pedestrian, it introduces us to the Doss character and the reasons for his stand on never touching a gun.  It would not have been successful if it were not for the work of Hugo Weaving as Doss' father.  He is absolutely terrific, and almost unrecognizable, as the worn down alchoholic who is still suffering PTSD from his experiences in WW1.<br/><br/>The 2nd part of the film is a typical bootcamp scene and all of Doss' barrack-mates are pretty generic, I wish the director would have attempted to make them a bit more different, for when we get into the battle scene, when they are all wearing the same battle fatigues and are covered with mud, it is hard to determine who is who.  Vince Vaughn is an interesting choice as the drill sargent who comes to understand Doss.  He is not your typical drill sargent and underplays the role - something I would not have thought that Vaughn is capable of - I credit ""the director of Braveheart"".<br/><br/>But the showpiece of this film is the last 3rd - the battle of Hacksaw Ridge.  This part of the movie ""out-Private Ryan's"" the D- Day scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the best filming of a WWII battle scene ever.  The director does not flinch away from the violence and tension of this scene and when Doss starts saving troops one by one and goes back ""for just one more"", I was on the edge of my seat.  It was truly moving and uplifting - a series of scenes not to be missed - but NOT for the squeamish.<br/><br/>Up to this point, I have not mentioned the performance of the actor playing Doss nor the director, let me do so here.  First, Andrew Garfield (THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN) is terrific as Doss, again, underplaying his role and showing a strength of soul throughout the film.  I was a bit disturbed by his Sourthern Accent, but - at the end of the film - they show an interview with the real Doss and, darn it, Garfield nails the accent of the real man, so cut him some slack when you see this film, folks.<br/><br/>Also, you will need to cut some slack to the director - Mel Gibson - he is, not surprisingly, omitted from all publicity from this film - and rightfully so - for his off-screen behavior.  If folks knew that this was a Mel Gibson film, they would be turned off and not go see it and that is too bad as this is a well directed film that tells an uplifting story that should be viewed by folks.  Say what you will about Gibson off-screen, but in this film, he is a heckuva director.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"jacabiya","10","8","15","10 November 2016"," A big round of applause for Desmond Doss and Mel Gibson!
","This is a remarkable film, that shoots right to the top of best war films in cinema history. The story of Desmond Doss is a compelling one which needed to be told cinematically, and Gibson was the right man for this. The first hour has many virtues, but also problems: Doss' mistreatment seems to lack (comparisons with Full Metal Jacket are inevitable) and the court martial hearing does not ring true. But once they move to Okinawa, what follows is a technical tour de force, with realistic, gruesome battle scenes, extremely well and clearly directed and photographed action, and with an impressive emotional and transcendental punch to boost, which will make you stand up and applaud at the end. I don't see Gibson glorifying war while condemning it, I see him as a true artist, with a view of the history of mankind as war and violence, presenting life in all its hellish reality, and a hero pursuing a higher aim amid the brutality and personal challenge. This film should gather Oscar nominations for best picture, direction, actor in a leading role, script, cinematography, production design and sound, at least. I am particularly happy for Gibson, who survived his own personal trial, and is now back, and in better form than ever."
"CJFouraki","9","8","15","9 November 2016"," Gibson delivers
","I've always found Mel Gibson a reliable actor/director and this film just furthers my opinion of him. I'm not a fan of war movies. I think they're good, but except for some truly unique and unconventional war films, I don't regard them too highly. This true story film peaked my interests when I first saw the trailer for it and found out Gibson was directing it. I am glad to say that Gibson hasn't lost his touch for directing brilliant films since his last endeavor ten years ago with the absolutely awesome film, Apocalypto.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge starts out with setting up characters and doesn't exactly throw you into the action, but gives you a brief glimpse of what is to come. We are introduced to Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield, a man who's actions and thoughts have been affected by his family and God. I didn't think Andrew Garfield could lead a film like this but I have to say, he did really well, much better than expected, and I think he really captured the essence and character of the real life Desmond Doss. We're given his background, the major events that influenced him, his love life and the relationship he has with his family. The other most notable performance within this setup act of the film came from Hugo Weaving, who gave quite the performance of a veteran soldier, psychologically damaged and barely able to cope with normal life. It's quite emotional and is definitely a performance that stands out. Everyone really played their roles well, bringing the characters to life - I had no problems with the performances as they all felt authentic.<br/><br/>Doss eventually joins the army where his beliefs conflict with the teachings of the army, and obviously there are problems. Vince Vaughn was quite the entertaining character to watch, filling the role of a typical loud-mouthed, offensive Sergeant - and he really seemed to be enjoying the role which is great to see. We're introduced to the other members of the squad, each with their unique quirks and characteristics just like most other war films. As before, everyone acts their part well and performances are great.<br/><br/>Now we get to the war. This is a really vibrant film, filled with really bold splashes of colour, quite different to the expected cold steel filter you'd expect to see from a WW2 film. It really helps make the film visually stunning, especially with the action scenes. The lead-up to the actual battle is great. You see these fresh soldiers entering the battlefield with courage and arrogance, and it slowly dies as they see the trucks of dead bodies and blank looks of soldiers that had survived previous battles. It really helps show the trauma these men went through fighting the relentless and skilled Japanese army. The climb up the cliff face helps further build atmosphere and when finally on the battlefield, the tension is almost unbearable. Then the battle kicks off and boy does it kick off. This is where I say something controversial. The war scenes in this film, are equal to, if not better than the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. It is loud, overwhelming, absolutely brutal (this is a Gibson film we're talking about), expertly shot and visually stunning. There are some shots in these battles that absolutely stunned me because of how well done they were. Everything from filming shootouts to brutal fist fights was expertly done, with such a fine attention to detail shown within each shot - it really hearkens back to the skill Gibson showed when he shot the huge battle scenes in Braveheart. It also shows how much of a hero Desmond Doss is, the situations he put himself in without a weapon to drag men off the battlefield - which adds another level of gore due to a lot of shots with legless or arm-less soldiers.<br/><br/>The film really portrays Doss as the hero he was, really showing his courage and bravery, driven by faith to do what he did. It's actually quite unbelievable, but when researched, is actually quite accurate to actual events - there's just a rearrangement of events and exclusion of others to create a more concise and focused war film about what I may think to be the greatest war hero the US army has ever had. This is undeniably a great story and I'm surprised it took this long for it to be picked up and made into a film. I'm glad that it was Gibson that did it because the man has a natural talent for showing mankind at its worst and its best at the same time. <br/><br/>Now, here's my one major gripe with the movie. It gets a little too preachy at times. By that, I mean you're gonna hear a lot about God in this movie. A lot. It makes sense due to the context of the time and the characters, but it feels a little forced at points in dialogue. Hearing the real life Doss at the end of the film proves he's very religious but it can feel a little overdone at points.<br/><br/>Overall, in a year of nothing, this is a brilliant film to hopefully start out a season of other great films. It's visually stunning, well performed and tells a great, unique, war story. Gibson has proved himself again and I look forward to his future projects. Check this out and give it the love it deserves.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I made it to the multiplex over the weekend, and was blown away by this movie -- THIS is exactly what the movie-going experience is all about. After a ten-year hiatus since 2006's awesome ""Apocalypto"", Mel Gibson directs this true story of WWII American Army medic, Desmond Doss (played by ""The Amazing Spider-man"" himself, Andrew Garfield). He served during the Battle of Okinawa as a ""conscientious objector"", or as he put it more fittingly, ""conscientious contributor"". Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving give in-depth performances as his parents, as do Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington. Do yourself a big favor, and SEE THIS MOVIE!!"
"cultfilmfan","10","8","15","5 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge
","Mel Gibson's new directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, is not only one of the best war movies of recent years (some are saying the best since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which I would agree with), but it is also a rare film of courage, standing true to what one believes in and is ultimately an excellent and encouraging story of one man's Christian faith and the decision to go to war as a medic and yet refuse to carry a gun, or use or deploy any acts of violence whatsoever based on his beliefs. Our main character Desmond Doss, is brought up in a home where there is a fair bit of dysfunction largely based on the father's difficulty with what was then horrific memories and reflections of the first world war in which he served and which now causes him much pain and sorrow leading him to use alcohol as a means of trying to heal his wounds in what would today be considered as post traumatic stress disorder. While there is fighting and arguments among the Doss household, Desmond does cling to his Christian faith and even as an adult carries those beliefs with him even while enlisting to go to war. Desmond's idea is to be a war medic and save lives instead of killing others as he considered himself to be a conscientious objector and was totally opposed to violence and killing based on his strong Christian beliefs. Desmond while at boot camp and training to go to war is often made fun of verbally and also attacked physically for what the other soon to be soldiers did not understand and took to be an act of cowardice and oh how Desmond would prove them wrong. Desmond was certainly persecuted for his beliefs and his faith, but the absolutely amazing thing is that he never denounced his faith, or wanted to give up and he kept persevering even though it brought about condemnation and laughs and jeers from others. This is not giving any spoilers away, but Desmond does make it to the war and through praying and keeping true to the word of God as well as obeying the fellow soldiers and ultimately having the outlook of loving your neighbour as yourself he does far more than any of his fellow soldiers thinks he is capable of and truly proves himself to be a hero not only as a soldier and medic, but also as a true Christian soldier and one who placed God first and foremost in his life and would not disobey on the battlefield, or more importantly to the God who saw him through these personal and physical battles and would ultimately see him not only rewarded for his faith and devotion, but also Desmond truly becomes a wonderful example to his fellow soldiers and those in command of what a great Christian witness he is and one that the other soldiers because of his example that they would not soon forget. The film while very violent at times especially in it's second half should not stop viewers from seeing and embracing this inspiring and truly inspirational film and true story. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong and ultimately giving God the true and total glory that he deserves through Desmond's wonderful example and act of courage and faith. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. There were some scenes that were so realistic that there were certainly times I jumped out of my seat in pure terror and other scenes were I was so deeply engrossed into the film and it's story as well. I hope that the R rating and the more graphic violence does not keep people away, but instead that people give this film a chance and be totally encouraged and yet blown away by the sheer power and yet beautiful nature of this amazing film. I hope that those who have written Mel Gibson off for comments he made ten years ago, can look past that and judge the man's art and not the man himself because he truly made a masterpiece with this film and it not only stands as one of this year's finest films, but also shows that good movies can still be made these days and I hope this film takes off and not only inspires, but truly shows what a Hollywood production can still do in the proper hands and that they can still achieve greatness. One of this year's best films."
"Screen_Blitz","8","8","15","7 November 2016"," Mel Gibson's testament on war pacifism packs a punch, and not without the grisly portrayal of war
","There are very few directors out there who portray the dark side of religion and war as powerfully as Mel Gibson. Looking back at the critically acclaimed 'Braveheart' and the highly controversial 'Passion of The Christ', Gibson's depictions of violence clashing with spirituality has proved to be far more effective than contrived; and this World War II biopic centering on the true story of a soldier driven by his firm spirituality to the take a different path in active combat instead of being a man carrying a gun in the midst of the bloodshed. His path is not to take the lives of others with the use of bullets, but save them. What could have been just your average faith-based drama feeling like a clichéd religious sermon ends up being a powerful testament of war pacifism and a man's challenge against the tyranny that targets his religious ideology. The film tells the true story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (played by Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (played by Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector. During boot camp training, he faces causes displeasure in his drill sergeant (played by Vince Vaughn) when he refuses to touch a gun due to his religious beliefs. But when his platoon is deployed on the battlefield in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond proves to be more worthy as a soldier than many believe when saves over 50 wounded soldiers -- and doesn't even fire a single shot.<br/><br/>One of the biggest ironies is how Mel Gibson cohesively makes a case of pacifism through an unflinchingly brutal portrayal of the horrors of war, and the story of how lead character Desmond Doss must face the violent nature of active combat that greatly conflicts with his religious beliefs. The first half of the film introduces Desmond as a young man who embraces his spirituality, while forced to deal with abusive upbringing by his father Tom who feels scarred by his son when he decides along his Howard (Desmond's brother) to enlist in the war, recounting his harrowing experience in World War I that costed the lives of his friends. Along the way, we are then introduced to hot-shot nurse Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) who Desmond quickly forms a relationship and provides some sweet moments of levity and connection for Desmond when he out overseas on the battlefields, though the depiction of their romance is a bit hokey and somewhat awkward during the first half-hour. Ultimately, the first hour is primarily about establishing Desmond's pacifism and the cruel nature in which he endures when he makes himself the center of ridicule by his officers and fellow comrades who view of his refusal of abandoning his firmly held conviction against fighting as an act of cowardly, which is gracefully brought together in the boot camp training sequences in the fashion of 'Full Metal Jacket'.<br/><br/>Most of Mel Gibson's directing style shines through not only the performance aspect, but the incredibly realistic (and horrifyingly graphic) combat sequences. Shot with quality cinematography by Simon Duggan, the second half pulls viewers into the muggy heat of the Japanese battlefields as we watch the soldiers trudge the muddy fields little with decapitated bodies, dismembered corpses, dead soldiers rotting and getting fed off from rats; and the gruesome scenery firmly sets the tone for some of the most graphic and astoundingly authentic battle sequences since 'Saving Private Ryan'. If you recall the heart-wrenching Omaha Beach invasion in the opening scene, the battle sequences are here feel nothing short of an extension to this. With limbs blown off, bodies disemboweled, and heads torn apart; these combat sequences portray the hellish reality of active combat, and does so without feeling gratuitous or exploitative. Along with Mel Gibson's execution of war are some unexpected surprises that arrive from the performance department. One of which is Andrew Garfield as the lead Desmond Doss in a powerful performance that expands upon his ingenious talent compared to his ill-fated outing in the 'Spiderman' reboot franchise. Vince Vaughn, an actor slowly fading away from his series of dull comedies , delivers an R. Lee Ermey treatment in his role as the ruthless and intimidating drill sergeant. Though a little clumsy in some scenes, he manages pull off the rare feat of escaping into a sincere performance.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and deeply gripping testament on its lead subject's war pacifism, and marks a highly admirable directorial return for Mel Gibson. This film is certainly no cinematic landmark in the war genre, but it stands strong as one of the most profound films of the year. If this film manages to garner some Oscar nominations, it shouldn't much of a surprise."

"dave-mcclain","9","8","15","4 November 2016"," Truth in advertising - ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"".
","Have you ever been misunderstood? Maybe you just failed to communicate your thoughts effectively. Maybe you said or did something that cast doubt on your true intentions. Or maybe others just ascribed to you negative motives of people they've known in the past – and failed to judge you based on your own actions. We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone – ever – for any reason – even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is until they went into battle with him. Desmond's struggle to live out his principles, in spite of what others thought, and through the horrors of war, is the story of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (R, 2:11).<br/><br/>As a child, Desmond (Darcy Bryce) developed a strong religious faith – and a strong aversion to violence. He and his brother physically fought each other often. One of those times, Desmond hit his brother with a brick, nearly killing him. Desmond's father, Tom (Hugo Weaving) used to beat his boys, and sometimes got physical with their mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). Tom himself was a shell of a man who never shook memories of the violence he saw as a soldier in World War I, constantly visiting the graves of his friends who died in that war. All of this had a profound effect on Desmond in his formative years.<br/><br/>The adult Desmond (Golden Globe nominee Andrew Garfield) not only wants to avoid doing what he believes God prohibits, but he wants to do good things to help others. After saving the life of an accident victim by applying a tourniquet – and meeting a pretty local nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) – he develops a strong desire to study medicine. Even as he courts Dorothy, he feels drawn to do his part in the war – as an Army medic. As he says when defending his belief in non-violence, ""With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together."" Desmond may avoid violence, but violence sure finds him – and sooner than he expected. His drill instructor, Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn), and his company commander, Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington), greet Desmond's convictions with frustration. His fellow trainees, especially people like Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), express their feelings towards him by attacking him in the barracks. When Cpt. Glover's boss, Col. Stelzer (Richard Roxburgh) gives Desmond a direct order to pick up a weapon and he refuses, the young recruit finds himself facing the possibility of an Army court martial – and maybe prison time.<br/><br/>Eventually, Cpl. Desmond Doss and his company find themselves arriving on the Japanese island of Okinawa in the closing months of the war. Now less than 400 miles from mainland Japan, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the war – with some of the highest casualty rates. Doss' company is tasked with driving the Japanese soldiers off of Hacksaw Ridge – an area of land 400 feet above the beach. To accomplish their mission, the troops had to climb up a rocky cliff face using only a rope ladder – and then face well-entrenched Japanese forces which had vowed to fight to the death. Doss and his company charge straight toward danger. Not everyone would survive, but those who did, were Doss' responsibility – a mission for which he repeatedly put his life on the line.<br/><br/>I often find reviewers' comments in a movie's advertising to be overblown but not in this case. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The battle scenes in this film are even more graphic and intense than the scenes of D-Day in ""Ryan"", and features the most realistic Pacific Theater action since 2006's ""Flags of Our Fathers"". But like those other two, this film is more a story about the men who fought the war than the battles themselves. This is a bio-pic, so there's plenty of character development. It's a story about principles and courage, so there's plenty of struggle and heroism. And, as I said in my first paragraph, this is a story about misperceptions and, in the end, understanding and mutual respect, which contains lessons for all of us. This is a touching human story and an unflinching look at the horrors of war and the value of different kinds of heroism. ""A"""
"parleon-thedon","10","8","15","4 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge - review: A Gruesome Hallmark Movie
","Hacksaw Ridge is a great movie. The performances are superb. The directing is skillful. The storyline is handled with care, craftsmanship, and attention to detail. Nothing goes unnoticed here. Every little detail is gutted and then hung out to dry like a dead pig. This movie will grip you and then forcefully hold your eyelids open. If you want to see something intense, heartfelt, genuine, and meaningful, then hold onto your seats because this will take you on a ride. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's performance was breathtaking. Vince Vaughn's performance was exceptional. At first, I thought that Mr. Vaughn would throw me off because I thought he looked odd being there. I've seen Vince Vaughn movies, and I don't take him that seriously when it comes to dramatic. Mel Gibson (the director) knows how to use his actors to the best of their abilities. Vaughn's performance was dynamic; his introduction was funny, but yet it was also serious. Mel Gibson played on Vaughn's strengths and skillfully crafted him as a character. Vince Vaughn's scenes really stood out in this movie. Teresa Palmer played her part with bravado. I was impressed by her performance because she could cry on cue. Palmer's character was firm and she stood her ground. Hugo Weaving stood out the most to me during the entire movie. His performance was gripping, mesmerizing, and he deserves an Academy Award. <br/><br/>At times, the movie felt extremely cheesy. Picture a Hallmark movie but with gruesome violence, and that's what Hacksaw Ridge is. I couldn't stand the cheesiness for a while, but I grew to accept it because the interpersonal and internal dynamics from some of the characters were gripping.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson knows how to craft a movie, and his sense of direction guided this along. At times the movie seemed bloated or exaggerated, for example, the war scenes seemed like they went on far too long, but there was a point within its context. You could say everything in here appeared to be glorified, but I could call that attention to detail. War is not pretty, war hurts, and this movie is as close as I ever want to get to it.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed Hacksaw Ridge, and I could say that it's now one of my favorite movies from 2016. If you want to see a Hallmark movie with gruesome violence, then sit back and strap up, and prepare yourself because I think this will surprise you. Audiences are in for a real treat with this one.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A+"

We seldom recommend a film to our friends let alone everyone but this is one of those rare cases where we can and do.

"tyleramato-28680","8","8","15","4 November 2016"," Welcome back, Mel
","Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with this war epic based on the true life story of Private Desmond Doss, who served in the Army as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa during World War ll...he also happened to be a pacifist, someone unwilling to partake in violence due to his religious beliefs, which there is plenty of in the climate of war therefore facing tremense odds not in his favor, more so than the men who carry their weapons into battle. I've been a big fan of Mel Gibson's work despite the lows of his career, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception. One of the biggest strengths of Mel Gibson's direction is that he doesn't shy away from depicting violence in his films, and with this film he shouldn't, war is one of if not the ugliest thing to exist in the history of mankind, war SHOULD be gory, it SHOULD feel like you're watching a horror movie. Andrew Garfield is very good as Private Desmond Doss, he perfectly portrayed the good hearted nature of his character, and his accent for the most part wasn't too distracting, the film also stars Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughn, and Sam Worthington, they too give very good performances in the movie, but most surprisingly of all we also see ""Point Break"" remake star Luke Bracey EASILY giving the best performance of his young career. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a roaring return for Mel Gibson in the director's chair, masterfully delivering this brutal yet uplifting tale of one man's battle against the tremendous odds stacked against him and his brothers in arms."
"rgkarim","9","8","15","3 November 2016"," Gibson doesn't Hack On Hacksaw Ridge
","American entertainment, most of us know it's all about the extremes these days (extreme crudeness, extreme drama, extreme stupidity). Well tonight an extreme director, Mel Gibson, takes a shot at making a movie that might defy the simplistic trend of most cinema is today. Tonight a buddy and I hit the theaters to check out Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama that pegs the life of a rare officer position (the combat medic). Will this interesting spin fit well in the library of battle based films, or has Gibson gone off the deep end. Let's get going<br/><br/>LIKES:  Action Packed  Balances faith with honor  Inspirational  Fantastic effects  Good characters<br/><br/>Yeah, I have a lot of likes and it starts with the action this movie has to offer. Hacksaw Ridge can be described as the pacific campaign of Saving Private Ryan, with plenty of explosions, bullets, and flamethrowers to light up the silver screen. You'll be cringing as all hell breaks loose in high definition sound and incredible special (not cheesy) effects that will drag you into the depths of battle. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat watching your hero tear through the scarred land, jumping through the carnage to take down a bunker. Like realistic portrayals of war, this is the film for you. But Hacksaw ridge isn't just about soldiers getting dismembered or barbecued. No it's a tale meant to inspire people to believe in their values, defy the odds, and yes help people without killing them. Gibson and his team have designed emotionally packed scenes where the cinematography alongside the stunning orchestral work bestows the honor of our soldiers. The dialogue also preaches the message Doss' story is designed to tell, much of which involves faith being tested against tradition. Sometimes it got a bit cheesy with the blatant, overdramatic deliveries, but it fit so well into the film it really didn't faze me. Regardless, both patriots and religious zealots will love the balance of faith with duty, and have a character you latch onto. As for the cast, well Hacksaw Ridge has a little something for everyone to latch onto. Doss is the picture of a perfect, good spirited southerner, complete with hick like accent (thank you Hollywood stereotype). His morals, loyalty, determination, and overall nice guy attitude are qualities that many will find endearing. Too much of a good two shoes? Well then go for the gung ho Yankee who wields a gun like Rambo named Smitty. His character is all about the action, the adrenaline, and the war hero pride you love to see in these epics. Still too serious, then throw in Vince Vaughn as a sergeant who has action, comedy, and a bit of compassion to round out the cast. The company has strong heroes to lead the charge, amidst the extras whose names you might forget. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Slow to take off/A bit rushed  Characters lost in the carnage<br/><br/>Hard to find fault in this movie, as Gibson and company did so well making this epic war drama. However, there were a few things my buddy and I found a little limiting. The main thing was how long it took the movie to take off. Sure we have to have an origin story and build up how are character had his coming to Jesus moment (a rogue brick to his brother's head). Despite how good they did with this, it doesn't help that it took a while for Hacksaw Ridge to take off. The first thirty minutes in particular are rushed relationships with his parents and girl, which although establishes Doss' life, drags at times as you wait for the training to begin. In addition, some of these arks get dropped into the background, left to simmer until the ending when the campaign is over. This was especially true for some of the soldiers, who after a five-minute introduction are dropped into a sea of extras almost never to be seen again. Doss and a few other troop members will get much of the screen time, while others will stand out only by looks before violently flopping on the desolate wasteland of the ridge. You would think a little more involvement after taking the time to name them, but no not the case. In addition, some of the romantic and family dynamics are dropped like a bad grenade, only to be tied up at the end of the show. Outside of these small flaws, the only other thing we agreed on was some random additions of Japanese customs, which while accurate was kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best modern war movies I've seenperiod. The nice spin on the protagonist being a pacifist drops a whole new light on the war theater and provided a character who was deeper than the barrel of a rifle. Doss' story is certainly inspiring, and it's nice to see a movie where both faith and honor can work in tandem without being dragged out and dull (Unbreakable). Yes it does take time to get stoked, but once the spark ignites, it shines in suspenseful, well-shot delight. Of note, this movie isn't for the faint of heart. Weak constitutions may get sick, or have nightmares depending on how mutilated, bloody bodies affect you (PLEASE DON'T TAKE SMALL KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM). I strongly encourage a theater visit to this movie, perhaps a couple of times if you've got the cash. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Biography/Drama/Romance: 9.0<br/><br/>Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0"

","I don't know where to begin, this review wont go in depth. Excellent movie; some of the most chaotic, true-to-life depiction of combat I have ever seen. While I had heard of Desmond Doss before in history books, I have infinitely more appreciation now for such a great human being as him, and those like him everywhere. This truly will be a classic war movie, if not already. The movie is so well put-together and heart-wrenching... compared to other modern WW2 movies (FURY, Flags of our Fathers) this movie is on par with them, if not on top in terms of screen writing, cinematography, acting, etc. (SPR still takes the cake though for best war movie, although it might be getting to the point where its place in the genre is being challenged by movies like Hacksaw Ridge) I'd recommend it to everyone"

As well as you could for a movie of this sort. It shows that even in the face of extreme difficulty, you can stand to your principles and still do your job. Not letting your principles affect your interactions with others and vice versa. A fact lost in a lot of people today who want to force their principles on others. <br/><br/>But back to the movie. I think the acting was well done and the casting was done correctly as well. There was some survivors of this battle at the end and they cast the actors appropriately in my opinion. This will be another hit movie. <br/><br/>There were only a view plot holes that I noticed, but they probably wanted to shorten the movie a little bit. Still well done though and worth watching."

Its a story about perseverance and faith, but the faith aspect is told in an expertly subtle way."

","I watched this movie with literally no idea what it was about, who was in it, or who directed it. I just read the first few lines of a couple of Netflix reviews, not enough for spoilers, but enough to get the impression that this might be a pretty special movie.<br/><br/>It was.<br/><br/>I was captivated from beginning to end. I don't think I even blinked. This is truly an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, with every aspect of its technical production a work of art, and every performance solid, nuanced, and truthful.<br/><br/>Some way into the bucolic, beautifully evocative first half, I began to notice that several of the actors were Australian, and wondered briefly if it might be an Aussie director at the helm. But then I was swept away again, and didn't think about anything else until midway through the second half, during one of the many prolonged (and exquisitely realised) battle scenes, when the thought popped in to my head that this was perhaps the best sound design I'd ever heard in a movie. And then I was swept away again.<br/><br/>I had no idea that it was directed by Mel Gibson until the end credits. And to be honest, I'd almost forgotten that he even existed. I had long been a fan of his work, and was particularly enamoured of Braveheart, which I considered one of the greatest historical epics I'd ever seen.<br/><br/>But after his much publicised bad behaviour, including drunk-driving (which I find inexcusable) and rampant anti-Semitism (which I find intolerable), plus his apparent decision to focus on pushing an aggressively right-wing Christian agenda on and off the screen, I decided to unofficially boycott all things Gibson-related - a decision echoed by Hollywood, where he was blacklisted for the best part of 10 years. And I promptly forgot all about him.<br/><br/>So when I reached the end credits of my new favourite movie and discovered that Gibson was, once again, the master director responsible for my awe and elation, I had somewhat mixed feelings.<br/><br/>Gibson is, inarguably and undoubtedly, one of the best directors in the business, and he's a pretty fine actor too. I just wish it was easier to like and admire him as a person. I know that much of my opinion is based on media reports and tabloid brainwashing, and God knows I despise all of those people far more than I dislike Mr Gibson. But he has admitted to saying the things he said, and doing the things he did. However, I note (upon researching his Wikipedia entry) that he has also done a lot of philanthropic stuff too, so I guess he's trying to balance things out. I think I'll follow Hollywood's lead and give him a second chance. He's certainly talented enough to deserve that much.<br/><br/>And Hacksaw Ridge is really a masterpiece of filmmaking."

"eddiecatone","7","4","6","7 August 2017"," Mel Gibson sticks to his guns
","""A single man, driven by faith endures all possible torments without giving up hope."" I think this works quite well for most of Mel Gibson's films from ""Braveheart"" (1995) to ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004) and the brilliant ""Apocalypto"" (2006). ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception telling the story of another man of faith and determination, a man who ""sticked to his guns"" however this idiom sounds particularly ironic in this case because the man in question, corporal and U.S army medic Desmond Doss achieved military glory while being a conscientious objector that refused to carry or even touch a gun or any other weapon.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is structured like many army and war films. The warm prewar life (here however haunted by a complex relationship with Mr.Doss Sr.) Second act is the obligatory Boot Camp scene with the always enjoyable routine barrack inspection and training chin deep in the mud. Third (and fourth) act is the lengthy battle chapter in which Gibson almost revels in a gory dance of torn limbs and fire and smoke pyrotechnics. What makes the difference is Doss, the atypical hero, lanky and a bit goofy, but whose courage is not simply innate but fuelled by his compassion his sense of duty and his unflattering faith. If you think about it this definition works for most of Mel Gibson's films."

The movie shows how during his training, Doss got treated like crap for saying that he didn't want to carry weapon, but then he saved a large number of people on the battlefield. And believe me, there are some intense depictions of the battlefield.<br/><br/>It IS a little weird knowing that Mel Gibson directed this, considering what he said about World War II. Gibson won't be able to live that down, so the most that he can hope to do is make good movies. He did here. It's a fine look not only at this particular battle, but at how Doss's moral dilemmas informed his actions on the battlefield.

Fortunately for America, in Real Life Wayne's wide yellow streak prevented his Unconstitutional Fascist Ideals from directly contaminating Our Real Heroes, such as the pacifist Doss. Without making a fist, let alone firing a shot or throwing a grenade, Doss broke the spirit of Japan's Suicide Squad on Okinawa by combating the Japanese Death Eater Culture with America's Vibrant Life Spirit. Director Gibson makes the case with HACKSAW that the current Millennial Generation is unlikely to produce enough stalwarts like Doss to win the next World War. Therefore, by picturing nearly naked Japanese soldiers using the White Flag of Surrender to launch a grenade attack against the Americans AFTER targeting U.S. medics and savagely executing dozens of helpless U.S. wounded guys, Gibson is implicitly endorsing Leader Trump's Plan to nuke Syria, Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, and, probably, Japan again for good measure. This will allow Fortess America to get rid of our aging H-Bomb inventory in order to make room for Trump's new generation of Peace-Making Bombs.

"howboutthisone_huh","5","12","26","14 December 2016"," extraordinary story, stupid movie
","This movie is typical of what Hollywood produces about wars, and particularly what mel Gibson is involved in. The story is very poorly directed. If it wasn't for the subject matter, a movie like this would likely get panned. Mr. Doss was driven by his strong personal and religious convictions which the movie failed miserably to really explain deeply. Many parts of his story were told as if you were being tutored as school children. Are we all dumbing down? All movies based on a true story take some liberties with the facts in order to convey the story. I wouldn't have an issue if the story stayed true to Mr. Doss but instead it's boring and punctuated with cliché war threads. Interesting story, poor film making. For comparison watch ""paths to glory"", a film made over 50 years ago but light years ahead of this atrocity. Also, I strongly recommend watching the documentary produced about Mr. Doss with interviews of the men that he served with. On the other hand if you like special effects, blowing things up and watching body parts being torn apart, this is your movie; there's plenty of that. What it doesn't have is a script or a director who can tell Mr. Doss's story the way it should be told. It doesn't have a production designer who understands the historical period. And the whole thing looks like it was shot with video and converted to film. Lot of action in front of the camera, not so much behind the camera."

It may not be in the same level as those movies are, but it's in there. You cannot close Hacksaw Ridge out of the conversation when you talk about the best war movies of all time.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is in my eyes the best war movie ever and probably will always be. Full Metal Jacket in the other hand has a lot of other things that make it incredible. Hacksaw Ridge has a little bit of both that those incredible movies have.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn surprised me in this movie. Since he did not suck as bad as i first thought he would.

"comps-784-38265","9","6","11","23 January 2017"," Out does saving Private Ryan by being an understated true story
","A lot of reviewers are critical comparing Hacksaw Ridge unfavorably to Saving Private Ryan. As if Hacksaw Ridge copied Spielberg's epic masterpiece. That somehow Saving Private Ryan is more 'authentic'. <br/><br/>First of: Saving Private Ryan is an 'instant' classic war film from a master film maker. However, it is a work of fiction, based on real events (the D-Day landings) <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is A TRUE STORY. Not Hollywood BS 'Based on a true story' Hacksaw Ridge is a TRUE STORY (google Desmond Doss and look at clips on youtube e.g.after the war on TV show 'this is your life') <br/><br/>Others are criticizing of the film as unbelievable e.g. why didn't the Japanese cut the cargo nets up the cliffs? <br/><br/>Probably because they would get shot. Japanese tactics were defence in depth - cause maximum casualties on the attacking Americans. Again google it - the cargo net was therefor real. Not made up by Hollywood. Because this is a TRUE STORY. Moan over. <br/><br/>______________________________________________________________ Having just got home from the cinema i'm giving this a 9/10. Previously saving Private Ryan was my favourite war film, but now takes second place to Hacksaw Ridge. <br/><br/>A true story which, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, in many respects the film understates the heroism of Desmond Doss. Apparently Mel Gibson was concerned being totally accurate may make the film 'unbelievable' (despite being factual). Ironic, most film makers will depict nonsense and expect us to believe it. Gibson has to 'tone down' the facts to make it believable. <br/><br/>Doss is a conscientious objector, having grown up with an alcoholic father who beats his wife and the young Desmond and his brother. Doss deeply religious refuses to bear arms but wants to serve his country as a medic. <br/><br/>Despite efforts to make him quit the army (including beatings) and threatening a court martial for failing to obey orders (carry a rifle) and being derided as a coward. Doss does eventually make it to the blood bath that was Okinawa as a medic. <br/><br/>Historical background: American losses taking Okinawa were so severe that this played a part in the decision to use the atomic bomb rather than risk large scale casualties of invading mainland Japan. <br/><br/>Taking Okinawa Japan lost more than 77,000 soldiers and the Allies suffered more than 65,000 casualties—including 14,000 dead.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are shockingly realistic and gory. Similar to those of the series 'War in the Pacific' . You really get the sense of close quarter 'meat grinder' combat hell. <br/><br/>Doss, through all the carnage, again and again, goes back to treat and retrieve wounded soldiers. Praying to God - ""just one more"" . <br/><br/>Doss himself estimated he saved fifty but other witnesses said more like one hundred men he saved. It was agreed to split the difference at seventy five. <br/><br/>Doss is wounded and sent home. Although his wounding and actions after being wounded are even more heroic that those depicted in the film. <br/><br/>This is a long film of some 139 minutes but I was enthralled throughout. The time past in an instant - a tribute to Gibson as a master story teller. <br/><br/>Highly recommended film - easily a classic cinematic masterpiece 9/10<br/><br/>p.s. Saving Private Ryan does not have copyright on incidents that are witnessed during intense large scale infantry combat. <br/><br/>E.g. Desperate soldiers arming mortars and lobbing them by hand. Soldiers getting near miss in helmet (then getting shot anyway). Incidents like this happened across the theatres of war. Not just in Saving Private Ryan. (A work of fiction that utilized many first hand combat accounts)"
"marcin_kukuczka","9","6","11","17 January 2017"," Rich in Message, Rich in Meaning, Rich in Mel Gibson's Style
","Can you do something crazy? Can you endure the pain of being mocked and feel determined to go your way? No matter if you hesitate with the answer or not, here is a film you really should see. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson with his great comeback after 10 years is far from 'attentive exhibitionism' and from the very start, he calls our attention to the hero of his story who managed to put a little bit of the world tearing itself apart back together."" Yes, unique story rich in meaning and message where the inner world of the director seems to correspond to the inner world of the protagonist, Desmond Doss, as Robin Collin pointed out a story of an outcast finding redemption through superhuman levels of suffering."" <br/><br/>PROTAGONIST. Matt Zoller Seitz in his review on the film memorably observed that HACKSAW RIDGE is the movie which is actually 'at war with itself.' Following this track of argumentation, we can say that Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) embodies that contradiction. His inner convictions, his upbringing place him at war with the world around, arouse incredible dilemmas in him. The fight of the inside that he undertakes from the start is captivating. As a son of a desperate WWI veteran Tom (Hugo Weaving) who himself openly expresses bitterness of war and disappointment that arises from serving his country, Desmond fights with the haunting presence of his father's psyche within himself (though he cannot win completely) and develops his own convictions based on Faith and God's commandments, namely: Thou shalt not kill"" The picture of Cain killing Abel that hangs in his house (also mentioned in Frances Doss's book) imprints a powerful trace in his memory. Innocent, genuine, physically weak but spiritually strong, he goes to serve the country. How? Without any weapon but medical stuff to protect life. In short, you remain a great human being even if you are placed, either by coincidence or some destined fate, in the worst hell imaginable. But what a way to the top.Consider mainstay aspect of climbing.<br/><br/>WRONG JUDGMENTS: A young man who initially evolves mockery rather than respect and rejection rather than acceptation personifies wrong judgments that people rush to indoctrinate and later find themselves in rather shameful finale. Mel Gibson, when taking about his film in one of the interviews, memorably stated that he himself wonders if he could have that much faith that would enable him to crawl into a battle, to enemy fire without the weapon just to save other people's lives."" What could drive this young man to handle that? Perhaps, one scene may sheds light on this aspect of courage that, as the film follows, absorbs us. After Smitty, his friend dies on Hacksaw Ridge and all meaning seems to have lost all meaning, Desmond asks God What is it you want of me?"" That scene most powerfully speaks to mind and soul: the profound and humble question of his existence is directed to God. Andrew Garfield does a splendid job as Desmond portraying his courage combined with seemingly retreating position, his openness to help combined with delusively reclusive solitude. Another powerful moments that Garfield handles with exceptional skill are the scenes when he justifies his convictions. The reactions around him are mesmerizing.We clearly see this clash between what the world could truly be and what the world actually is like depending on whether more and more people look deep down to their conscience. Seitz nicely mentions this saying that they can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty.""<br/><br/>OTHER CAST: Mel Gibson's film can really boast wonderful cast that make the story vivid and place it within a nicely framed whole. The one that first comes to mind is Vince Vaughn, excellent in the role of Captain Howell. Mel Gibson states clearly in one interview that he inhabits the character"" and Robbie Collin labels his performance as his most roundly appealing"" in at least a decade. He is brute to those boys but not without reason; he trains them and prepares them to the worst horror they will experience. Yet, as others, he is too absorbed by wrong judgments. Luke Bracey is very memorable as Smitty, a character who develops a profound relationship with the protagonist though, at first, he feels the superiority of his own looks and skills.<br/><br/>TERESA PALMER: As much as the second half of the movie emphasizes the Okinawa events and is, undeniably, a war movie, the majority of its first part is a love story. The beautiful Dorothy that Desmond meets by chance in hospital having saved a man's life after the automobile accident, is one of the most powerful and pure depictions of a woman in film. Gibson refer to her warmth. Their scenes (Dorothy and Desmond's) though naive at certain moments, are the most pleasant, innocent scenes between a man and a woman. She does a wonderful job in the film not resorting to sweetness yet simultaneously, not losing pure appeal. The scenes echo Gibson's style as well, particularly the moment they climb the rock and kiss Kudos to cinematographer Simon Duggan. The psychological aspect is striking here...Desmond does his best, at the same time struggling not to be like his father.<br/><br/>'Mel Gibson managed to make a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put the test in an arena of violent conflict' (Peter Travers). HACKSAW RIDGE is another great gift for cinema of today. In times when war is raging in many places of the world and talks of peace seem to be mere words in vain, such a hero speaks to our Times. Don't give up to do something crazy for the world if you are with God and SAVE human life NOT KILL."
"Michael Kenmore","8","6","11","27 December 2016"," Better than overrated & schmaltzy Saving Private Ryan; depicts true heroism & visceral carnage
","Awaiting Director Mel Gibson's return since the astonishingly hyper-real thriller Apocalypto, which was one of the best movies of the 2000 decade, I came to the movies on the day after Christmas, just when this movie might depart from the first-run theatre too soon. <br/><br/>Needless to say, my reaction was that of astonishment, to some extent, in seeing the visceral horrors of the 'unimaginable' carnage of combat and atrocity, that indeed force the viewers to question mortality and that war is indeed Hell. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is a spectacular war movie, that should compliment the varying classic wartime movies like All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket. <br/><br/>However, due to the moderate budget that had to be funded by the sources outside the Hollywood system that basically blackballed Mr. Gibson following the scandals that are best left unmentioned, the unfortunate outcome is that the visual effect/FX looks dodgy in some combat scenes, that detract from the immersive realism of the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Especially, in the gut-wrenching and nauseatingly visceral portrayal in this movie, the particularly ferocious battle between the American infantry and the relentlessly brutal and ruthless Imperial Japanese infantry on the southernmost Japanese-held island of Okinawa in the duration of World War 2, that was precipitated by Japan's unwise decision to attack Pearl Harbor, likely as a reaction to President Franklin's oil embargo and blockade that antagonized the Japanese to commit to total war, much to their regret given the Americans' fearsome and retributive resolve.<br/><br/>I would go on the record to state that Hacksaw Ridge, despite some dodgy CGI effects of combat violence and gore that was, understandably enough, due to the moderately low budget in financing outside the unforgiving Hollywood movie studio system, accurately and unflinchingly depicts the horrors of carnage in the protracted battles, especially against the fanatically determined and heartless Japanese infantry. <br/><br/>I have had read the history books on the horrors of war and occupation, such as Imperial Japan's brutal occupations of China, Korea and the Philippines as well as the accounts of the battles, notably the famous photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima and what led to that moment. My father is an amateur historian of WWII Pacific Theater who interviewed the ancient surviving American soldiers of this theater, who spoke very negatively about the Japanese soldier that seem demonic and inhumane, which is true. <br/><br/>With Hacksaw Ridge, through Mel Gibson's brilliant but otherwise almost imperfect (i.e. melodramatic scenes meant for establishing characters in order to explain the motivation -- especially why the humble yet unrelentingly non-conformist Christian protagonist chose to enlist only to be subject to violent bullying and hazing trying to force him to change his inexorably pacifist belief when he only wanted to serve as the mere combat medic) direction to show us how horrible the war truly is, it forces us to confront our mortality as well as ask ourselves the existential questions such as nihilism and suffering.<br/><br/>This movie, for the first time in a long time (not even recent other violent and horror movies would bother me), made me queasy and aghast at the grand vision of carnage that infers the absolute inhumanity to one another, that invoked the philosophical questions of mortality.<br/><br/>In many ways, Hacksaw Ridge is, in terms of pacing, storytelling, characterization and visual portrayal, the better movie than Spielberg's absurdly sentimental and turgid propaganda Saving Private Ryan, that went downhill after the opening battle sequence that was well-done in depicting the carnage on the massive Allied invasion of Normandy on D- Day.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Hacksaw Ridge touches upon the utmost courage in face of adversity that include despicable bullying for holding firm to the pacifist belief in genuine religious principle, unbelievable heroism and absolute carnage, whereas Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is merely philosophical that, while almost well-made (fantastically ethereal cinematography by the twice-Oscar-winning cinematographer of ""Braveheart"" John Toll) and well-meaning, was frustratingly esoteric, almost maddeningly inert, and apparently naive. <br/><br/>Ergo, Hacksaw Ridge is certainly dissimilar to the aforementioned films Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, noting my complaints about these movies with their inherent flaws. <br/><br/>Indeed, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the finest war-centered movies made to date, with all the right filmmaking and competent storytelling components that accentuates the true horror of war, with Mr. Gibson's insistence to show us that war is really hell, and that we the people should be thankful that the Allied soldiers fought valiantly for our freedom and liberty.<br/><br/>I am the descendant of the grandfathers on both of my parents' side. I am the grandson of the former captain-ranked bomber pilot in the European Theater and the former Navy sailor in the Pacific Theater. My father and I saw this movie when we finally had the time to go to the movies, since he and I were busy with our jobs & other obligations. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge impressed us to poignancy, knowing that the horrific portrayal of carnage is exactly why our ancestors fought the unspeakable evil, especially the Imperial Japanese with their terrible love of violence and rape and so on, yet vigorously denied by the ultra right-wing nationalists in Japan. <br/><br/>The Allied forces sacrificed their lives and limbs to ""save"" the civilization, and for that we must be grateful to them, including my grandfathers, so that we never have to experience the appalling horrors under the occupation by the despicable invading enemy. <br/><br/>A grand comeback for Mel Gibson in redemption as the superbly proved auteur, since Apocalytpo and this film are the visually astonishing, compelling and unapologetically unflinching movies that depicts the morally tenacious and appalling human conditions in the duality of good and evil, with the latter film that portrays the doubtlessly truthful adage to its most effective extent: ""War is Hell.""<br/><br/>3 1/2 stars out of 4"

","Hacksaw Ridge is an excellent movie,it tells the story of Desmond Doss,a real hero who had done more than any man on the battlefied could had done.For me this movie was more than great,I think that it doesn't exist a word to describe how this movie was,the story was great,the actors were great and when you look at Desmond Doss,when he joined the army,after he refused to carry a weapon and after the beating he went through(he was beaten by his own comrades because he refused to carry a gun) and when everybody else left the battlefield and he continued to stay to help the other by himself,after all those thing you would think that it's impossible to see a person like him to do what he did.Again,this movie was and it will remain(for me) one of the greatest movies based on a true story as well as one of the greates war movies because this movie really showed the true face of a war(more precisely the true face of the World War II) and I would definitely recommend to watch it,not to mention that I'm sure this movie will get an Oscar."
"Geff","10","6","11","17 November 2016"," One of the best of the WWII film genre. Amazing.
","Hacksaw Ridge: I just saw it and had to write. I left the theatre in a deeply moved state. The film about America's only CO to win The Medal of Honor for heroism in combat is stunning in its realism and depiction of the horrors of the South Pacific Campaign in WWII. The story is true, and at the end of the film the real main character addresses some of the film's content. The special effects are incredible to behold, and the thunderous roar of the battleships' big guns is only topped by the barrage of huge explosions on Hacksaw Ridge. I was additionally attached to the film's content b/c my own father fought in three similar battles in the South Pacific in WWII. He never spoke of it. I only found out after his death in 2010 that he was awarded six medals during WWII and fought and survived three of the most savage battles in the war against Japan: Anguar Island, Peleliu, and Luzon. The film brings it all to you , and I realized that this is what my quiet, peaceful, unassuming father had kept to himself all my life. It is a film that you will never forget; congrats to Mel Gibson on another directorial success. It's a must-see."
"LloydBayer","8","6","11","14 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge is brutal yet one of the best war films in a long time.
","It's been ten years since Mel Gibson made those alleged anti-Semitic remarks. That's about the same time Gibson has been looking for work as a director in Hollywood. But hypothetically speaking, if Gibson were to throw down the gauntlet against the likes of Spielberg, this is how one would imagine him doing it.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is not only Gibson's best film since Braveheart, it is also the best war film since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. As an actor and a director, Gibson's symbiosis with cinema has almost always been about self-sacrifice and patriotism. In that tradition, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most moving films on heroism and the second reason why this film is a must-see. Despite countless films on World War II, this is an original yet true story that has never been told before. Comprising of an ensemble cast, the film opens over the vistas of Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia, where we are first introduced to Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the estranged relationship with his alcoholic and WWI veteran father Tom (Hugo Weaving). It's a pivotal part of the story that would ultimately determine the decisions Doss would make after enlisting in the war. This is also where Doss falls head over heels for local nurse Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) and promises to marry her as soon as he returns. All this feels a little clichéd, and given the setting, a bit like the love story in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>The next part is the boot camp segment and essentially where the narrative kicks in some humour, ala R. Lee Ermy styled commanding officer played by Vince Vaughn. Doss is immediately branded a coward for refusing to touch a rifle. Not even platoon Captain Glover's (Sam Worthington) discriminatory threats will smudge Doss' belief in never taking a life. This only means that Doss must work harder and disprove his CO's ranting that ""a unit is only as strong as its weakest member"". As an unlikely soldier, what Doss manages to do during the rest of the film is absolutely incredible but not before Gibson is let loose with a ravenous appetite for violence. <br/><br/>We've seen what Gibson did to the character of Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, and going by that reputation, this should come as a fair warning for the queasy that there is no shortage of gore, guts, and severed limbs in this film. In taking the fight to blood soaked trenches in Okinawa, it suddenly dawns on the audience how and why the word 'Hacksaw' was coined in Japanese territory. Even so, carnage although graphic is somehow poetic and a first for Gibson. That's largely due to the seasoned cast and the attention given when they are introduced, resulting in ample reason to root for them. Led by the charismatic Garfield, each character is sympathetic, brave and sometimes even funny which gives Gibson's broad strokes an emotional undertone when we see them getting picked off before knowing what hit them. <br/><br/>Many will tout this film as Mel Gibson's comeback vehicle. While this may be partly true, the film in its entirety is a well-crafted ode to selfless courage infused with reverence for divinity. For what has mostly been a bad year in cinema, 2016 seems to be sprouting, albeit late in the year but closer to Oscar season, with films devoted to real life heroes. Sully was one of them. If Desmond Doss was eventually venerated with the Congressional medal of Honour and all without firing a single bullet, Hacksaw Ridge could prove to be Gibson's atonement in as much as his return to form."

","Didn't go in with high expectations as I am not a fan of war movies. I went because my husband wished to see it. I had heard it was bloody which was true in part. The battle scenes are confronting but I suspect quite realistic. How any soldier retained sanity after WW11 is a mystery. This movie engaged me from the beginning. Andrew Garfield played the role perfectly capturing a sense of strength, confusion and dignity mixed up with boyish charm. He was a fully rounded real person that perhaps confounds one but the strength of his conviction is compelling. This is a true story of a real hero. I was left in awe of his humbleness yet greatness. This is the sort of person we should hold up to our kids to emulate, rather than a Kardashian and their ilk. It was great to see so many Australian actors in the various cameo and supporting roles. All did a stellar job except perhaps Sam Worthington's American accent which kept slipping. Vincent Vaughan has such presence. I enjoyed his performance greatly. Kudos to Mel Gibson in bringing us yet another morality tale of such quality. Another man struggling to retain his convictions against a punishing establishment . Finely crafted. Well worth watching."
"blanbrn","8","6","11","4 November 2016"," Courage and being brave becoming a hero in a different way.
","Plenty of movies are made about war and a lot has been written about War War II especially, this picture directed by Mel Gibson called ""Hacksaw Ridge"" looks at a different kind of hero from the time period. It's the true story of Desmond Doss(in a strong performance from Andrew Garfield)a medic and self proclaimed pacifist who won a Medal of Honor without ever even using a weapon. And this film is in detail showing the rural life that Desmond lived in Virginia growing up. As he becomes a man he has a pure romance with a young nurse all while maintaining his faith in Sunday, and after going in service to fight in Okinawa, Japan Desmond and others experience hell on the battlefield as this film is very graphic with bullets, blood, bombings, and partial body parts of death all caused by war. Thru it all it takes extra courage for this man who went a different path of being brave to become a hero to be remembered. Really this picture makes one feel the glory of courage with red, white, and blue honor as it's thru love and compassion of others that made Doss a man who will be remembered as the greatest helper never to have packed a weapon."

","Mel Gibson is BACK. Yes, the Oscar-Winning Legend makes a thumping return as a Director after a 10-year hiatus with 'Hacksaw Ridge'. Gibson looms large on celluloid & gives Andrew Garfield a chance to prove his mighty talent.<br/><br/>'Hacksaw Ridge' captures the inspiring & heartbreaking World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American Pacificist combat medic who was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, who refused to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty.<br/><br/>Desmond Doss was a man of conviction & relentless humanity. He chose to save lives, rather than taking any. Set in a time when humanity was at its lowest (War is never a thing of pride for any of us), Doss's journey comes across so strong & faith based, it totally blew my mind.<br/><br/>'Hacksaw Ridge' is fabulously directed Gibson. He's in top-form & deserves complete credit for choosing to make a film upon a real-life hero. Gibson deserves an Oscar-Nomination & hopefully Hollywood will nominate him this year. Simon Duggan's Cinematography captures Doss's courageous journey & the brutality of war, expertly. John Gilbert's Editing is perfect. Art & Costume Design are good. War-Sequences are fantastically choreographed. Rupert Gregson-Williams' Score is brilliant. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for vie top-honors. As Desmmond Doss, Andrew is at his most sensitive & affecting. He lives the part of a true hero, with undeniable conviction & emerges a big winner. He's sensational & is sure to get his long-due Oscar Nomination for Best Actor! Vince Vaughn is a hoot as the Sergeant. Sam Worthington is in form after a long time. Luke Bracey is first-rate. Hugo Weaving is ever-impressive. Teresa Palmer & Rachel Griffiths are good. Others great support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Hacksaw Ridge' Is A Masterpiece! It salutes Desmond Doss's unforgettable life, in a film, that is inspiring & thoroughly arresting. Don't Miss It."

","I watched this movie last night & it simply blew me away from start to finish. I just couldn't take my eye's away from the screen as I laughed, & I cried.<br/><br/>Before I start this review, I have to mention that i am a bit of a movie freak, so I take my movies very seriously, so you can believe me when I say that this to me is simply the greatest war movie that I have ever seen, or should I say, greatest anti-war movie that I have ever seen, as yes this is an anti-war movie, but it is also the most violent & gory anti-war movie you'll ever see as the movies battle scenes make the one's in 'Saving Private Ryan', look like play-school.<br/><br/>It's also quite astonishing to think that this movie is also based on a true story about a man that was a conscientious objector so joined the U.S army hoping to become a medic so that he wouldn't have to kill anyone, as he refused even to touch a gun, for which he was ridiculed & beaten by his own unit, but against all odds he then went on to save the lives of 75 (yes 75), badly wounded Conrad's single-handedly by lowering them (one by one), down a sheer cliff face, with only the aid of a single rope, & all the time being sniped at by the enemy.<br/><br/>'Andrew Garfield' does a sterling job in the roll of 'Desmond Doss' , the soldier in question, & 'Vince Vaughn' also gives a great performance as the hard nosed drill instructor (simular to the drill instructor in 'Full Metal Jacket'), but I have to say (for me), the best acting honour has to go to 'Hugo Weaving' (better known for playing Agent Smith in 'The Matrix' movies), who gives a very moving (& maybe, Oscar winning performance), as Desmond's father.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned at the start of this review that I take my movies very seriously & that's perhaps why my favourite movie has remained the same since 1975's all-time classic 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', which was winner of no less then 5 Oscars, including best picture, but after having now seen this movie I have to question which is my favourite movie of the 2 as 'Hacksaw Ridge' is simply an astonishing achievement in film making.﻿"

They were very careful about making everything look authentic right down to the buttons on the uniforms. This is the story of a true hero, and I don't want to spoil it for you.

"Ziya90","5","9","19","10 December 2016"," A brutal film with an important subject matter, but also it feels like a dated war melodrama with poor dramatization
","Hacksaw Ridge shows the brutal and sorrowful side of war, it is a must see especially for the audience who loves the genre, but it falls too short, because it works like a dated war melodrama with some brutal and bloody battle scenes which has only shocking effect. Hacksaw Ridge is like ""We Were Soldiers"" with a better quality, better theme and higher budget. <br/><br/>I believe that a war movie doesn't have to be ""anti- war"" to be great. For example, Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is not an anti war movie, it is a military operation movie, but I think it is a masterpiece. I have the same opinions for some other movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates and I enjoyed movies such as Fury, The Lone Survivor (flawed, but a solid survival action) However, Hacksaw Ridge fails too short.<br/><br/>I didn't find the first half compelling or a great story introduction. You don't care about the main protagonist as you did for William Wallace for example. Honestly, I didn't enjoy what most people did for the prologue, so I did find it little boring. Maybe, because I'd expected a movie like The Fury. An intense war drama with some great moments and set pieces with an interesting character gallery. Many people praise what Gibson did for the movie, especially visual effects, set pieces and battle scenes, but I think it was not point of the film, also it was not that impressive or special. There is not such a rule that more brutal it becomes, greater it gets. <br/><br/>I was not at the edge of my seat during the battle scenes most of the time as I didn't really feel the despair of the characters and their dilemmas when they face with it. For example, in the movie Papillon, you feel every kind of pain as you are there with them or you are one of them! so the storytelling in this movie was not powerful enough to carry its subject matter. <br/><br/>Many people praise Andrew Garfield, I am in the minority again, but I think it was a mistake. He has some haters maybe, but I think Shia Labeouf would play the character better. Maybe, Garfield has a talent of his own, but he is not that gifted to play such a character. The real star of the movie was Vince Vaughn as the commander, nobody else!<br/><br/>The battle scenes has some shocking effects, but no more than that. The dramatic tension and humanism factor are poor. Some parts in the army before going to war are not realistic as it should be. As for Mel Gibson, I don't care about what other people think or say about him, but I am a fan of his movies. He is one of the best stars of his time like Bruce Willis. Hacksaw Ridge is his weakest movie so far as director. Maybe, he tried to make an old school and romantic, also gritty war drama, but there was nothing new and the movie itself was dated. <br/><br/>This is not a subject which I am sensitive in movies, but the depiction and portrayal of Japans in this movie made me little annoyed. In the movie, Japanese soldiers are like evil forces, different from Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima. Why? <br/><br/>What makes this film worthy is its subject and conflict. Hacksaw Ridge lacks the tragic nature of Braveheart. Mel Gibson's masterpiece is still Braveheart. If you look for an epic anti war movie like Platoon, you'll get disappointed. If you look for a stylish war/action drama like Fury, you'll get disappointed. If you look for an artistic journey like The Hurt Locker, you'll be disappointed anyway. However, what you want is to learn about history by watching the revival of the events or watching a technically good war drama with some matters, this film is a good choice for you."
"szadhik","2","22","57","8 November 2016"," complete waste
","I've to tell you I left the movie before the end. We were forced to watch the war. The movie was very light in the inception. We expected a comedy type movie when Vincent Vaugh appeared first, conversely the movie turned out to be a complete blood bath. When war started, I worried that when it will stop.I completely could not resist the war and left it. Also one guy has automatic rifle on one hand and he is holding a dead torso of other man. You do not see this sort of action even in Bollywood movie. The very first opening was a disaster with ships bombarding the fire and bombs. You can do animation however too much animation simply kills. Instead of a full bloodbath, the movie could be made a war comedy as it was difficult to be serious and the main character still cannot lead the movie. Hope we'll not have to see this sort of movie often however this movie started to get good votes. The war scene was unnecessary. At one point it was not clear whether I was watching a X Box game or a movie. The movie timing simply dragged on without any substance."

"buzzkill-28812","10","7","14","21 December 2016"," Emotional and Impactful
","Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most impactful war movies of the year. I am a fan of war movies to start, but this movie brings great things to the genre. The story is full of morals that will move everyone in a way. The main story follows a conscientious objector as he joins the army during World War II to make a difference with his fellow soldiers, even if that means he does not prefer to kill. His challenges include his fellow soldiers and officers who do not take him seriously as he must prove himself that he is just as determined to make a difference. Throughout the movie, he is motivated by God as the driving force for his volunteering into the army and his Christian morals that stop him from holding a weapon. I am an atheist, and this story moved me by his faith. I can respect a person's religion if it for a good cause, and his faith in the movie pushes him fight for what he believes in and in the end, enables him to save dozens of soldiers without firing a shot. He kept pushing himself to save as many soldiers as he could. The visuals in the movie are stunning and as gory as Saving Private Ryan, which I appreciate, because it really emphasizes the struggle and hell soldiers have gone through and can make us appreciate their sacrifices more. We cannot sugar coat war, because war is hell and we need to be presented with the challenges they face, especially the soldiers from the great wars. This movie is emotional and impactful and highlights the strength and preference humans have in them when they are motivated by a cause they truly believe in. Hacksaw Ridge, is my favorite movie of 2016."
"gochumanz","10","7","14","11 December 2016"," Best war movie I have ever seen.
","Oh my goodness Mel Gibson. I hated you for the racist and crude comments you have said but now I forgive you. This is the best war movie I have ever seen in my life. This rivals Saving Private Ryan and in my opinion, tops Saving Private Ryan mainly due to masterful acting and directing.<br/><br/>Lets first talk about the acting. Andrew Garfield, you deserve an Oscar. You truly do. Vince Vaughn, you made an excellent comeback. Hugo Weaving, you also proved to be a very great and caring character that I love. Teresa Palmer, another great movie under your belt. I really can not elaborate as I will be heading into spoiler territory. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson shot this movie very old school. All the shots seem like it is from the 1980s. That is not a bad thing as it really does set the tone of this movie. Everything to the color pallet to the dialogue really feels very natural and almost made me feel like I was eavesdropping into a legit conversation. This is because of great script-writing and acting by the amazing Andrew Garfield! Andrew Garfield really does make me feel like I was in the 1940s. He truly does set the tone for the time and I was extremely invested. <br/><br/>WOW I never knew about this story and I am damn happy I now know. This story really did make me feel like I am a pussy. Not to mention that this movie has extreme religious undertones that is NOT shoved in your face. I hate religion and if I can stand it in this movie and even make me appreciate religion, then that is saying a lot. The plot really does advance kind of fast. That is a good thing as it is a fast paced movie. This movie will never let you from its grasp and it will show you the horrors of war. Other reviewers say that this movie is to bloody and Michael Bay like. I call those reviewers wrong in every way. They show you how war is like. Michael Bay just puts explosions in there for no reason and could do without the explosions. However Hacksaw Ridge every explosion is needed. They put explosions into the background for authenticity and atmosphere building and it CAN NOT do without it. <br/><br/>Only cons of this movie is some slow-mo shots. They shot the scene in normal 24 fps and made it slow-mo after the movie was over. Making the 1 specific scene kind of weird and laggy. However this lasted maybe 1 second max and did not bother me one bit. I only recognized this on my 3rd viewing."
"jtindahouse","10","7","14","22 November 2016"," Perfection
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is the kind of film you don't even have to think about what you're going to rate it, it's simply a '10', no questions asked. This is unquestionably the best film I have seen so far in 2016 and incidentally the only '10' I have given out this year. I went in expecting it to be good, I had heard good things, and it still managed to top my expectations and blow me away. That's a sure sign of quality. Films you expect to be good going in have a lot tougher time impressing you than films you have no high hopes for obviously, so 'Hacksaw Ridge' must be a hell of a film. Another sign of quality is when the run time flies by. At 139 minutes, this is a long film by modern standards. However, the time just evaporates and when the credits roll you can't believe it's already over.<br/><br/>So what makes it so good? Let's start with Mel Gibson's direction, it's impeccable. The pacing, the story, the characters, the action, it's all handled absolutely masterfully and just blends together perfectly to make such a nice viewing experience. The tone of the film is very heavy at times, particularly in the second half. The action is absolutely chaotic and yet somehow Gibson manages to make it all extremely easy to follow and keep track of everything that is going on. He also holds nothing back. It's almost unbearably gruesome at times and yet it's so good it's almost like he's sitting in the seat behind you, forcing your head still and making you watch.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield in the lead role was mind-blowing. He made me genuinely care for the character and sold me in every scene. The other person who blew me away was Vince Vaughn. I wasn't sure going in exactly what I was going to get from him. After his first scene though I finally understood his casting, and it was perfect. In a very similar role to R. Lee Ermey's in 'Full Metal jacket' Vaughn makes us laugh, but never at the expense of his character. We still respect him with our utmost sincerity, and you can tell the characters do as well. Again, we also care immensely for the outcome of his character. In that respect he was probably better than Ermey, but Ermey still topped him in terms of the verbal onslaught he unleashes on the soldiers.<br/><br/>There's literally no aspect of the film I can think to criticise. It's as close to perfection as films generally come. I would advise you to come along prepared for a very moving film, both emotionally and visually. There are some very heavy moments, but if you're game, they all add to the incredibly high quality of the film."

Sometimes you see truly fantastic films, and sometimes you see something that is timeless films, that have a certain aura and quality - and yes, this is without a doubt such an instant classic. If you have a heart you'll love this film, simple as that. It doesn't matter if you are so smart enough that you can figure things out along the way...duuh! Movies is really about feelings, what ever they may be, and this film makes the audience feel. A lot! At the Cinema Theatre I visited grown men were crying, women were crying and I also had to fight the tears (already early on) - and that was even way before the gruesome battle scenes have started! It felt like 3 good movies in one great! <br/><br/>If I have to compare with other movies, it's like a mix of Forrest Gump meeting Saving Private Ryan. Kind of. But still not at all. <br/><br/>This true story of Desmond Doss is amazing! Director Mel Gibson tells it so straight forward it reminds of an old time classic in the style of old Hollywood but with todays effects. It could have been done by perhaps Howard Hawks, Frank Capra, John Ford, Michael Curtiz, John Huston, but with his own masters eye. Mel Gibson is a wise storyteller here, very impressing piece of work. He knows he doesn't have to add things to it - in fact he holds back! No scene is longer than necessary, it's always to the point. The acting is very good and the music is perfect, not too much not too little. It's a better film than his other masterpiece Braveheart and that should tell you something! I really hope this one also wins an Oscar for Best Picture because it simply is such an Oscar worthy film! By far, if you ask me, it's one of the best films ever made! I've seen about 10 000 Movies - and this masterpiece makes it to my personal Top 50 of all time! It's so strong, so gripping, so emotional and a fascinating true story about humanity and the true WWII hero Desmond Doss! It's not another typical war movie, it's a life story that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster! I simply can't find the right words to describe it, so I just recommend everyone to see this as soon as you can! <br/><br/>Cinema Theatres were made for these kinds of fantastic films!"

The story as a whole throughout the entire movie was amazing as well. The beginning of the movie was really good and then it just got better and better as I kept watching this play out, it was incredible. I walked out speechless at first as to decide about what I truly thought of it, because it was all so much to take in. After a lot of thought though, it finally came to me that this is one of my favorite movies, and I will remember it forever, for it was truly incredible and it couldn't be better than how it is now, excellent work Mel Gibson."

","In my own opinion it was a phenomenal movie which left me almost in tears in the cinema, it really got to my emotions and i really felt for the men in the movie, each actor really played their character and did a wonderful job at showing the conditions and emotions of warfare. There were a lot of moments i had to look away as it almost got to much, it isn't over censored which really helps show how bad some situations were. There is a lot of scenes with significant amount of gore which is good as a lot of war movies don't do this and it does help contribute to getting the full experience of war and what they dealt with and how they suffered. I would re- watch it without a doubt and definitely a movie i will be getting when it's released. I would say easily my new favourite movie. Andrew Garfield did a brilliant job of portraying his character and his belief of morals and values."
"antoinedb2001","10","7","14","13 November 2016"," a film that understands the brutality of war
","Hacksaw Ridge is a film directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, and Hugo Weaving. It is about a young soldier named Desmond Doss who is a young man enlisting into the army by saving lives instead of taking them at the battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge. this film is as passionate about it's characters and it's source material as it does about it's violence. that's how good it is.<br/><br/>after you are immediately drawn into the film, it takes you back to when he was little to when he signed up for war. each moment of this film just loves to pull you into the story which makes you feel present in every situation that Doss comes across. it feels real and raw and worthy of praise. this is a film that not only can show how much of an effect that war can have on a human being but, it shows war, blood, death, ad all the violence you in saving private Ryan times a billion. <br/><br/>the war in this movie is gritty and you will leave the theater shocked at what you saw. limbs are flying everywhere, guts are exploding from stomachs, blood is everywhere, bodies are left to rot in dirt and ash. you feel as if every time a gun is fired, death comes immediately after. it's incredibly brutal, and effective, and painful to look at. when someone is shot you feel as if they're getting shot at. it's very effective and you will watch every explosion on screen without breathing just like the soldiers did in this movie. it's intense. <br/><br/>the characters are characters that you will grow attached to. Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss pulls off an Oscar Worthy performance as the man that saved 75 lives on that field. every emotion coming from him is real and it's emotional. you want him to make it out alive and you want him to succeed. every time he saves a life, your fists will pump in the air. Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell is another Oscar Worthy Performance that shows a ton of humanity into all the spit he brings to each soldier's face as he screams at them. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the alcoholic and abusive father that needs to deal with a troubling past, and Teresa Palmer whom I've never been a fan off pulls a great performance as Desmond's wife. Mel Gibson got really talented people to play the parts he has handed out and it shows.<br/><br/>This movie is an incredible war film of faith, heart, humanity, and Violence and what it can do mentally to people. Mel Gibson has really outdone himself and I will be happy to see him be recognized as a great director once again."

"zkonedog","9","4","7","24 February 2017"," A Different (And Much-Needed) Kind Of War Movie
","War is usually synonymous with death and loss...especially at the movies. Stories abound about individuals ""doing what needs to be done"", which usually involves quite violent, brutal acts in the name of country and duty. There is nothing wrong with those types of movies (as war truly is Hell), but Mel Gibson proves in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" that the story of war can also include men of peace.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" tells the story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a young man who volunteers to serve in WWII. He faces once pretty severe obstacle, however...the fact that he will not pick up a weapon (a combination of being a 7th Day Adventist and some past childhood experiences). After a fight just to be allowed to serve, Doss finally joins up as a medic on Okinawa, participating in the brutal ""Hacksaw Ridge"" campaign. Without a weapon of any kind, Doss continually runs into battle to save as many men as possible.<br/><br/>There is just something about the story of Desmond Doss that will resonate with most audiences. He had a battle just to serve, then a more literal battle in Okinawa. You have to respect an individual who manages to serve his country but still remain true to his own personal beliefs. Doss walks a fine line, to be sure, but his courage and fortitude stand out in the end.<br/><br/>It helps that Andrew Garfield is basically perfect casting for this type of film. Once Garfield stops screwing around with teen/Spidey roles, I could see him really establishing a serious acting presence. He combines boyish innocence with stern resolve (when needed).<br/><br/>Another thing to note about ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is that, much like Gibson's earlier ""Passion of the Christ"", the violence of the real world isn't shied away from whatsoever. The war scenes here are brutal, but aren't overdone. In fact, I felt like the movie did a better job than perhaps any I've ever seen of portraying the sheer terror of the battlefield. I was legitimately unsettled on a number of occasions.<br/><br/>Perhaps the highest praise I can give to ""Hacksaw Ridge"", however, is that by the end I was trying to hold back tears...and not succeeding. Doss's story is such an emotional one, and is portrayed perfectly as such, that it excellently stirs emotions. It's a story that needed to be told, and director Gibson was more than up to the task."

There is not much detail on the night of which Doss was left ""alone"" on the ridge, that is highly unlikely, not with Japanese soldiers scouting the area. Maybe Mel should spend more time and provide more details or make it less dramatic. It needs more explanation on why he turned to a ""conscientious objector"".

"MovieAddict2016","8","9","21","5 November 2016"," Gibson has made a superb war film. Even Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington are great in this!
","Say what you will about Mel Gibson - because much can be said and much has been said - but at the end of the day, he is an undeniably talented filmmaker. Even his most flawed films, like ""The Passion,"" are ambitious and hard to ignore. He isn't someone who rests on his laurels or takes paycheck gigs, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is imprinted with as much of his DNA as a filmmaker as any of his other movies.<br/><br/>Combining the visceral nature (as well as the literal viscera) of ""Apocalypto"" and ""Passion"" with the grandeur storytelling of ""Braveheart,"" this true story is without a doubt a movie riddled with issues: the first half, though compelling and with fine performances, does at times border on the sentimentally hamstringed and predictable.<br/><br/>And yet it works, mostly because of the performances and the direction. I read a review stating that everyone in this film was miscast; I couldn't disagree more -- this is a fine example of how perfect a cast can be. Andrew Garfield is exceptional and deserves an Oscar nomination. Teresa Palmer does the best she can with a relatively one-note love interest; she manages to actually make the character stand out more than on paper.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving gives perhaps the finest performance of his career, another award-worthy supporting turn as Desmond's father. But the real surprises here are the straight-to-video actors who usually seem devoid of charisma: Sam Worthington does career-best work here, while Luke Bracey, the nobody actor from the ""Point Break"" remake that no one asked for, is memorable as a stoic soldier whose skepticism of Desmond gradually evolves as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the revelation of Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant, who already ranks up there with R. Lee Ermey (if that sounds hyperbolic, it really is that fine of a performance). After his failed comeback with True Detective's miserable second season, and bomb after comedy bomb, it's nice to see him returning to his roots as a character actor. He's simply great here.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this is likely to be overlooked at awards season simply given Gibson's baggage and the unfortunate shadow it casts over his work, but my hope is that voters will be able to see past that and approach the film on its own terms. It features some of the most gruesome and unforgettable war scenes ever captured on film, and yet none of it seems particularly excessive or undeserved: to really appreciate the sacrifice and the heroism that the real Desmond displayed in battle, you almost have to be thrown right into the worst of it to be able to place it in a proper context. This is not ""Enemy at the Gates"" or ""Behind Enemy Lines."" Mel Gibson has made one of the best war films of all time, and he, Garfield and at least two of his supporting actors all deserve recognition for this come Oscar season."

Thus, its morally good under God to kill as many Japanese soldiers as possible. Instead of saving Japanese lives, he should've slashed their throats or jammed live grenades down their pants.

In Hacksaw Ridge, director Mel Gibson builds a generic war story around Doss's bravery that seems to celebrate the spectacle of brutality with a slow motion ballet like carnage opening and subsequent excess of bloodletting.<br/><br/>Seventh Day Adventist Doss is drafted into the Army but refuses to carry a weapon, volunteering instead to serve as a medic.

","It's been a long hard road back, but with Hacksaw Ridge the long ridiculed and often ostracised Mel Gibson has once more announced himself to the movie world with a unique and affecting war film that is arguably the best of its kind since Saving Private Ryan stormed the beaches in 1998. <br/><br/>In the process of his fight back to redemption, Gibson who has long been a powerful storyteller, has also created one of the most fully formed and impressive Australian films of all time with Hacksaw Ridge providing us with an impressive and on form cast, a stunningly captured film that features some of the most intense battle scenes conducted on film and a real life central figure that well and truly deserves the airtime he gets in this movie. <br/><br/>More than likely inspired by his own faiths and beliefs, Gibson has in the story of war medic Desmond Doss (played here by Andrew Garfield, in the best form his been in since his breakthrough Boy A), a man who refused against all the odds to hold a weapon during the war thanks to his firm stance against taking a human life, found a character that brings out the best in the filmmaker and with a strong initial set up of Doss, followed by a gruelling time at boot camp and a blood filled campaign in Okinawa that provides this war epic with a heart and soul that makes it an experience that can be enthralling for viewers of all shapes and sizes. <br/><br/>The enthralling nature of Hacksaw Ridge stems from its focus on not being a simple war story, it's all at once an affecting tale of love, an examination of one's stance to remain true to what they believe in and an ear shattering, nerve rattling depiction of war and while the middle section of Gibson's film lingers on slightly too long and a repetitive nature of events threatens to derail the tales great opening and incoming spectacle, Gibson and his troops that includes an awards worthy supporting turn from Huge Weaving as Doss's alcoholic father, Vince Vaughan's likable army sergeant and another turn from Teresa Palmer that suggests she's very much verging on becoming Australia's next big thing, make sure that Hacksaw Ridge never allows itself to dip below anything but a fantastic overall production.<br/><br/>It's not for the faint of heart and many may find the war scenes within Hacksaw Ridge to authentic to bear but this is a film that showcases many of the best elements of Gibson as a filmmaker and in telling a worthy real life story, Gibson has announced himself once more to an industry that could've easily been done with him and this impressive film is a likely contender at the upcoming awards season, bringing about the recognition that Gibson's past failings have once and for all been forgotten about. <br/><br/>4 rope burns out of 5"
"khang_tran","9","6","13","7 November 2016"," Mel Gibson makes his triumphant return after a decade long hiatus!
","With Hacksaw Ridge, Mel Gibson tells us the untold story of Desmond Doss, a ""conscientious collaborator"" who fought as a soldier at the battle of Okinawa during WWII without ever touching a rifle. Functioning as a medic and motivated by his strong belief in Christianity, he saved the lives of over 75 people during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>The whole movie is carried by Andrew Garfield's performance and he doesn't disappoint, as he gives the best performance of his career in Hacksaw Ridge. He brings us a soft spoken, earnest and strong willed Desmond and the actor gives his all throughout the movie, both emotionally and physically. Theresa Palmer has delightful chemistry with Garfield as his love interest and gives the courtship scenes a charming old-fashioned feel. We also get excellent performances from surprising supporting actors, such as Vince Vaughn. The usually comedic actor gives an effective dramatic performance as a drill instructor and infuses his witty humor during the boot camp scenes. Sam Worthington also gives a surprisingly good performance as Doss' cynical superior officer. Both these actors aren't specifically known for their acting prowess, but both do their characters justice in this movie. The standout supporting actor was Hugo Weaving, as Desmond's father who is a veteran-turned-angry drunk. Weaving gives the man an intense and vicious persona, and with little small tics, makes you believe the man has been through immense pain and loss.<br/><br/>However, the real star of the movie is Mel Gibson. He may have been under extreme scrutiny for the past decade for his personal behavior, but the man knows how to direct a film. He truly wants to do Desmond's story justice and gives us a look into his upbringing, which led to his strong beliefs and principles. Eventually, this makes his determined moral decision-making more convincing, which is the result of great storytelling from the director. The whole movie is competently written and paced, but its flow does halt a bit during the courtroom scene. Here, Desmond has to appear in front of a military court to defend his actions during boot camp, and I found it to be rather clunky and abruptly slow compared to the rest of the film. Yet, when Garfield's monologue starts afterwards, I'm right back into the movie and completely invested into this character. This builds up to the eventual battle scenes in Okinawa and where the movie really separates itself from any movie I've seen before.<br/><br/>The incredible sound editing and production design really make you feel like you're in a war zone! Loud explosions, combined with gory images, makes it feel like hell. Gibson films these battle scenes exquisitely, with quick and crisp editing, making you feel anxious and chaotic, without ever being confused about what's happening. The camera-work by Simon Duggon is equally impressive, giving us horrifying, as well as, awe-inspiring imagery on the battlefield. Some reviewers have been highly critical of the excessive use of gore, but I'm inclined to say that it was effectively used to convey the terrors of war. Eventually, this makes Desmond's acts even more heroic and remarkable during such distressing times. <br/><br/>The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams is terrific, varying between nerve-wracking tones during the quiet pauses between battles, then turning to a beautiful heroic melody for our main character. As for any qualms, I'd have loved to see a bit more of Theresa Palmer's character near the end of the film. Also, one particular scene shows Doss being lowered down from a stretcher with a Bible in his hand, which Gibson decides to shoot in such a Messiah-like way, that it felt like rather overkill in pushing a religious theme onto his audience.<br/><br/>All in all, Hacksaw Ridge is a sublime war film and shows that Gibson has not lost his touch in filmmaking. He delivers us excellent storytelling and terrific acting performances from his cast, making Hacksaw Ridge a must-see this year. Afterwards, when you see the real-life footage and realize that this was a real man's story, it will leave you speechless."

","This movie is a painfully average picture filled with great battle scenes. The acting is fine. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the drunk a**hole dad and everyone else is passable (except maybe those cringy child actors who cant fake a hit to save their lives). The lighting is horrible. It's painfully obvious that every non-battle scene has a sh*tty looking bright filter put on top of them all, which really makes no sense. Why would you make the film seem so fake when all the battlefield scenes are made to seem extremely realistic? Let's not forget how cheesy the story is too. It's the clichéd awkward boy meets cute girl, they fall in love, and then their plot is completely dropped from the story just like every single other subplot in the film. The film makes a huge jump from our hero surviving the threat of getting court martialed by the meany military men to straight into battle. I mean I was thankful that we got to finally leave the godawful bootcamp sequence(which basically is a much worse version of Full Metal Jacket's bootcamp complete with Vince Vaugn doing the most unconvincing job of a drill instructor I think I have ever seen in a big budget movie) but the jump completely slices out every part of the story that it had just created and never reintroduces them back into the movie. Now compare the clichéd beginning of this movie (as well as the clichéd ""super patriot"" ending) to the visceral and brutal battle scenes. It's as if this movie has two different directors. One is the real Mel Gibson, who basically sh*ts blood, guts, and mutilation on the screen for an incredible hour, and the other is Mel Gibson who lost his testicles and uses cable. Basically the film boils down to this (if I haven't already made this blatantly obvious). Battle scenes (besides the terrible CGI boats and cannons)= good. Dialogue, characters, and the beginning and end of the film = bad. Overall the film isn't as terrible as I am making it sound, but lets end this circle jerk of calling this the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. This movie isn't even the best war movie of the past few years. If you want to see what this movie should have been go watch The Pacific. 6/10 don't waste your money unless you just really love war movies."

","Hacksaw Ridge is another addition to Hollywood's growing portfolio of World War Two movies that have shows us some of the best and worst things humanity has to offer. In Ridge's case it's one of the best: Desmond Doss has become one of history's great 'conscientious objectors' of violence in war. He saved many lives during the Second World War, and he's still considered a hero by those he saved and those he loved. His exploits during the Battle of Okinawa proved a turning point in pacifistic participation in modern warfare, and this movie essentially spills blood around the character. He's in the war but refuses to take part in any of the killings. It's like he's a timid though incredibly brave specter amidst all the horror.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is well-done, though it does suffer from Gibson's lack of any remote development in the villains (in this case the Japanese are portrayed as nearly mute extremists who ALWAYS look angry; we NEVER see the civilians of Okinawa who were killed by the Japanese during the fight) that BraveHeart suffered from. I understand getting the point of a story across, but do it JUST a bit less xenophobic Mel.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is one of Australia's best of 2016 and is a must see.

The film is biopic of Desmond Doss and not so much a story of Hacksaw Ridge. We only get his biographical background. The working title was ""The Conscientious Objector"" but war films market better. There is a teaser in the beginning and then the movie looks at the events that shaped Desmond's life and how a conscientious objector comes to serve in the army.

","When WWII, Desmond T. Doss decided to be an army medic but because of his belief, he doesn't use gun even on the battlefield. As a medic, he fights for his mate without any weapon.<br/><br/>This film is based on the record of Desmond T. Doss who is the first conscientious objector who received Medal of Honor. He rescued a lot of US soldiers from battlefield of Hacksaw Ridge. I don't know how terrible real war is and how famous he is in the U.S. but I understand why he is a hero obviously. On this film, the battle scenes ware shot very ruthlessly but because of that, his kindness could be seen remarkably. Before I watched this, I think of heroes in the war as the people who kill enemy soldier or destroy enemy facilities most, but he is a completely opposite hero.<br/><br/>This is the good film absolutely, but I think Doss's life scenes before going to Okinawa are long. Scenes of setup lead audiences to understand his personality but important scenes of this film are the scenes of Ridge, so long setup may make audiences bored.<br/><br/>Some reviews say this film is not real, but I think this is a film so it doesn't have to be real accurately and the scenes of Ridge is enough to tell how ruthless war is. This film is literally worth watching."

","A wonderful story, but overwrought and clumsy in a way that its real-life character doesn't deserve. The movie captures a dubious trick of being both overly melodramatic and emotionally unengaging. Andrew Garfield is the best thing about the movie: human, flawed and heroic in ways that feel very true to life. Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths do very good work too. Sadly, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to their performances. Doss' platoon-mates are poorly realized and unmemorable; we struggled to keep track of who was supposed to be who. The battle scenes are over-the-top orgies of mud, blood, flame, and suffering, with no rhythm or sense of moving action. This blunt force trauma builds until the final shot, which is hamfisted and groan-worthy. Only the coda, delivering interviews with the actual participants, brings the movie to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. I understand why people would want this to be a better movie than it is, but how Gibson received a Best Director nomination is beyond me, and must be a victory for politics over sense."
"garciaanahit","10","3","5","27 March 2017"," Amazing Masterpiece
","From the director of ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", Mel Gibson brings us another phenomenal and realistic movie based on the true story of the American War hero, Desmond T. Doss. Released on November 4th of 2016, Hacksaw Ridge was nominated for six Oscar Awards and ranked third best on opening weekend. This biographical war and drama film described the American war hero's experience in the battle of Okinawa of World War II. Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a Pacifist, found it tough to stay true to his religion as a Seventh-day Adventist Christian and serve his country simultaneously vowing never to touch a combat weapon. It was his belief to save lives and not take them away after he had met a nurse who soon became his wife as he was required to enlist for the war. Facing the consequences and punishments by both his family and the sergeants of camp, he declared the right to serve in the army without weapons under religious belief and saved seventy-five of his wounded men alone from the fire of war. He soon was known as the first conscientious objector to become a combat medic. With over $158 million made worldwide, it continues to be one of the most critically acclaimed movies up to date.<br/><br/>The story development, soundtrack music, actor selection and acting abilities, special effects, and general visual display were the things I usually look for in a movie. This film however, completely fulfilled the expectations I look for in a film. At first, I didn't find it interesting because it was a war film but, after a little research it automatically drew me in with high expectations. This movie surprised me all throughout with stunning performances and the created the ability to appreciate the hard work that it took to finally make it a master piece. I loved every aspect of the movie and it would definitely be one of the movies I would love to own. I think it deserved more prizes than it has received or nominated for up to present day. I would recommend it to those that like a little gore and realistic feel in a movie all based on a true story. Overall, I would give this movie a perfect score."

","I went to see this movie with a group of friends as I'm not one for war films, gratuitous violence or horror, but I wanted to see this as I'd seen the reviews based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond Doss in WW2. Well, all I can say is that this film was nothing short of inspiring. Yes it was violent, but to be honest the gory war scenes were necessary in order to give the viewer an idea of what Desmond Doss went through, the true atrocity of war, and a mans courage to serve when everything and everyone was against him. British actor Andrew Garfield gave an outstanding performance with a pretty much flawless American accent. Vince Vaughn was a surprise casting as Desmond's CO but gave a brilliant performance with his usual comedic delivery. I particularly liked the line when he asked one of the rookies how long he'd been dead!<br/><br/>All I can say is that this film justly deserved its 2 Oscars and Mel Gibson should have been given the Lazarus award for resurrecting his career too<br/><br/>Highly recommend"

What shines through the most in this film heart, the triumphant glory we normally see reserved for sports films. While Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington pleasantly surprised me, Garfield's performance really carried the picture. The story builds without dragging, despite the fact that we don't even get to Okinawa until more than halfway through.

I really fell for the heroic theme and I thought this could maybe be another great experience like the good old work of Mel, like in Brave heart.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that I am not religious. Since Mel made the movie The Passion of the Christ, I am having difficulties enjoying his work. It was the way he used all the gore in this movie, to make the point how great Jesus was. For me this and the apparent missionary rationale of Mel behind this movie was just too much.<br/><br/>Now for this movie I thought, this could be an impressive one, let's give Mel another chance.<br/><br/>The first minute of the movie starts with narrative about the holey Lord, and I knew I made a mistake going to this movie. Then the movie takes just too long! I did like the romantic atmosphere etc, but the part before Japan could be have been done with 30 minutes less.<br/><br/>The parts in Japan I liked better. It was tense and impressive. Again big attempts to show a lot of gore. Camera work of the gore really resembled with ""The Passion of the Christ, too much in the face. I liked it much better how it was done in eg Band of Brothers, and Saving Private Ryan. The shots with him showering in slow motion rinsing off all blood, and him flying in the sky on the stretcher, for me also failed completely in a attempt to grab the audience emotionally.<br/><br/>I give the movie still a 6, because liked the actors and their role playing a lot and I like the story. I just think that another director would have done a much better job. Better to leave these themes to eg Clint Eastwood."

I feel like I saw a totally different movie. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, the battle scenes were fine, but not realistic or emotionally effective. There's a scene where a soldier picks up a limbless torso and uses it as a shield with one hand, as he's running and firing a large assault rifle. Another scene has Desmond dragging a wounded soldier across the battlefield on a sheet as the man mows down scores of enemy soldiers. Seems more like something from a John Wick or Rambo movie if you ask me. The acting is good, nothing special, Garfield seems to lose his accent in a few scenes, Vince Vaughn is great as always but sort of out of place here. It's much more of a Hollywood action flick than a serious war film. I didn't hate it, but I'm utterly confused at all the praise it's getting."

The rest is just a mix of poor dialogues, gory war scenes that fail to deliver, and idiotic CGI. I think this should have been a documentary, so that we could have really appreciate Doss's words without the poorly written stuff surrounding it. Besides, kung-fu with grenades? C'mon...

"Mobithailand","10","4","8","24 February 2017"," You will be ""shocked and awed"" and come out feeling a little better than when you went in.
","I'll get this review in just ahead of the Oscar awards, as it deserves my support – not that it will make one iota of difference. Of all the films I have seen recently which are nominated for best picture, in my humble opinion, only ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and ""Manchester by the Sea"" are worthy contenders. <br/><br/>""Hell or High Water"" is a good movie but not deserving of Best Picture. ""Arrival"" starts OK-ish but deteriorates into rubbish. La La Land is rubbish throughout. I gave up on ""Fences"", for while it is a worthy subject and brilliantly acted, it's a stage play – not a movie. ""Moonlight"" is good but is not the finished article, and I haven't seen ""Lion"" or ""Hidden Figures"", so I can't comment.<br/><br/>Back to ""Hacksaw Ridge"", which is beautifully directed by Mel Gibson. Gibson has been through purgatory, quite rightly, for his rabid anti-Semitic comments and other sociopathic meltdowns. But the academy has judged him on his artistic achievements and put his misdeeds to one side - which is how it should be.<br/><br/>I wonder if they would have been quite so understanding if Mr. Gibson had declared himself a Trump supporter? In the eyes of Hollywood, you can be a racist, and a wife abuser, but not a Republican. <br/><br/>I digress.<br/><br/>I doubt that Hacksaw Ridge is the war movie most of us expected to see when we sit down to watch it. As a genre, I am not keen on war movies, although there have been some pretty good ones, such as ""Platoon"", ""Saving private Ryan"" and ""Good Morning Vietnam."" <br/><br/>To these, I would definitely add Hacksaw Ridge. It is the true story of Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who decides to enlist in WW2 because he wants to be a medic and save lives.<br/><br/>We first meet the adult Desmond at his home in Virginia where he saves the life of a man in a road accident which leads him to meet his future wife at the local hospital.<br/><br/>After signing up, his troubles start when he has to go through basic training and he refuses to carry a gun. He is court-martialed and is at the point of being sentenced to years in a military jail when he is granted a last minute reprieve and is allowed to continue his training and go to the war front - without a gun.<br/><br/>The action switches to Hacksaw Ridge, the taking of which will presage the collapse of Okinawa and the ending of the war against the Japanese.<br/><br/>At first derided by his fellow soldiers due to his refusal to bear arms, Desmond is thrust into the front lines of a murderous battle, where many of his comrades are killed or mortally wounded.<br/><br/>The US army is obliged to retreat from the ridge, leaving their wounded behind for the Japanese to kill and mutilate at their leisure.<br/><br/>But they hadn't reckoned on Desmond Doss, who returns to the battlefield time and time again, and under the noses of the Japanese, he succeeds in single-handedly rescuing 75 casualties from certain death. <br/><br/>In later skirmishes on the ridge, he performs more unbelievably heroic rescues, before becoming seriously wounded after he kicks a grenade away to save his comrades from the explosion.<br/><br/>There is much more to this story, and you don' have to be a lover of war movies to appreciate this deeply moving tale. It is actually an anti-war movie because it shows you what war is really all about, stripped of romantic and heroic notions. It shows up close the manner in which war wreaks terrible consequences on the participants – of both sides.<br/><br/>To say that Andrew Garfield is utterly brilliant in the role of Desmond Doss is an understatement, and nobody was more surprised than me to discover he was an Englishman, so convincing is his accent. <br/><br/>There are no bad actors in this movie – From Teresa Palmer, who plays the nurse who becomes Doss's wife, to all the myriad actors who played the members of his family and his comrades (and enemies) in the military.<br/><br/>Gibson has used all his consummate skill and vast experience to show us the horrors of war and what true heroism is all about. We applaud this gallant soldier who was the first man to receive the Medal of Honor – America's highest award for bravery - without ever firing a shot. <br/><br/>We could do with few more like Desmond Doss today. What a wonderful example of simple humanity in these times of unspeakable violence, hedonism and such manic selfishness and self-love that is slowly destroying our cherished beliefs and even civilization itself.<br/><br/>Oscar for Best Actor? It really is impossible to choose between Andrew Garfield and Casey Affleck for the best actor award, (although Affleck will get it), and as far as the Best Picture is concerned, I think maybe ""Hacksaw"" just has the edge over ""Manchester"", but I'm sure that the rubbishy ""La La Land"" will get it.<br/><br/>Go see Hacksaw Ridge – you will be ""shocked and awed"" and come out feeling a little better than when you went in."
"tomgillespie2002","8","4","8","23 February 2017"," A fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the director's own personal plight.
","Whatever your opinion is of Mel Gibson, the once-Hollywood A-lister turned exile following that infamous drunken rant at the police back in 2006, it's unlikely that any other living director could have told the tender and bloody story of World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Doss with quite the same mixture of visceral horror and religious bent. There have been a myriad of movies recounting the acts of heroism and barbarism that occurred during the conflict, but most fail to stand out or tell their tale in a way that is unique. Gibson has defied his (understandable) haters and crafted a fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the actor/director's own personal plight.<br/><br/>Essentially a movie of two parts, both in terms of tone and quality, screenwriters Robert Schenkkan (HBO's The Pacific) and Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) take the conventional biopic route by going way back to Doss's childhood living with his mother (Rachel Griffiths) and abusive, alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving) in Virginia. He is raised a Seventh-day Adventist and works in the local church, and as he eventually grows into Andrew Garfield, starts to romance the pretty girl who will later become his wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). These early scenes have a corny gloss to them, like watching a big- budget Lifetime movie with a slightly better script. While the incredibly cute romance between the couple is beautifully played by the two main leads, the movie doesn't really get going until Doss follows his brother in volunteering to fight against the Japanese.<br/><br/>Undeterred by his restrictive religious beliefs, which forbid him to even touch a gun, Doss hopes to do his part by working as a medic. He first must go through boot camp, where he quickly finds himself in hot water with his drill instructor Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) when revealing himself to be a conscientious objector. Rejecting a ticket home by way of psychiatric discharge, Doss becomes an outcast in his unit and is bullied by his fellow recruits. A stint in army jail and a trial ensues before Doss is eventually allowed to rejoin his squad before they are shipped off to the Pacific. It is during the Battle of Okinawa, and more specifically the mission to secure Maeda Escarpment - nicknamed 'Hacksaw Ridge' - that Doss will prove his worth, while the unrelenting horror of war explodes around him.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with Gibson's previous work will know what to expect: No punches are pulled in the truly horrific battle scene, which lasts for pretty much the entire second half. Doss rushes somewhat elegantly through exploding heads and young men holding their own guts, as a seemingly endless wave of Japanese screamers lunge at them with rifles and swords. To call this the most disturbing depiction of war would be untrue (Elem Klimov's Come and See will forever hold that title), but it's damn near close. Though the splatter is relentless, it also manages to wear you down psychologically, so you can almost feel the weight of every bullet- ridden body Doss manages to drag to safety. Garfield is terrific, managing to charm with a near-permanent goofy grin that makes it seem like Doss knows and is comfortable with exactly what life expects of him. Somewhat surprisingly, so is Vaughn, who injects what I expected would be a clichéd boot camp montage with some laugh-out-loud humour. Bravo then, and welcome back Mel (haven't we forgiven actors for much worse?)."

I know it's a war movie but I didn't need or want to see that many guts splayed across the screen on a frequent basis, instead a couple of brief scenes would have conveyed the horror of war compellingly.

"knoxfan2008","4","4","8","20 February 2017"," Decent flick, Great leads. Terrible choice of CGI
","War movies need to be violent, they need to show the brutality and suffering one faces in a war zone. However, at the beginning of the first battle in 'Hacksaw Ridge', we see 2 men shot through the faces with CGI bullets, their heads explode, and it honestly looks like a scene from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The war scenes would have been 10 times more effective if Gibson and his crew eliminated the use of Computer generated blood and gore. Every time a CGI blood burst was on screen, I was taken out of the film. It looked like a cartoon, which is a shame, because there are also scenes where stunt-people have clearly been set aflame and the production utilises truly realistic practical gore. <br/><br/>Besides this complaint, the film is entertaining and keeps your attention. I am by no means religious, and the trailers for this film looked preachy and corny. Yet by the end of this film I felt nothing but admiration and genuine respect for Doss and his accomplishments. <br/><br/>The first half of this film is almost as corny as a lifetime film, yet the acting by Garfield, Palmer and Weaving is so pitch-perfect, that I couldn't help but get sucked in to their personal conflicts. Garfield and Palmers relationship in any other film would be sickly sweet, but they are so believable and likable it somehow is the best element in the movie. Where the film loses points is in it's supporting cast, primarily the bland, uninteresting soldier characters who even in their most emotional scenes, are dull and forgettable. Vaughn is miscast as the Sergeant, and Sam Worthington's US accent kept slipping. There were several green-screen shots, especially towards the beginning, where the boys were on top of the rock ledge, that were embarrassingly obvious, and the acting by the kids was not much better. <br/><br/>While this film was certainly entertaining, it doesn't get anywhere near the heights of war classics like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Paths of Glory"" or even ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Jarhead"". If I had to choose a contemporary war film 'Hacksaw Ridge' was equal to, it would coincidentally be Gibson's ""We Were Soldiers"", both are entertaining and have some shocking scenes, but neither have the impact a truly good movie has. <br/><br/>All-in-all, Hacksaw Ridge is an entertaining film. It is as if Hallmark hired Mel Gibson to make a lifetime movie. I like Gibson as a director, but 'Hacksaw' does not reach the thrilling heights of ""Apocalypto"", or the quotability and memorability of ""Braveheart"". <br/><br/>Give it a watch, but don't expect a modern masterpiece. The current ranking on IMDb is bafflingly over-the-top"

The much hyped war scenes are a true indication of the horror of war but are filmed at times like an action movie. I don't think I saw a single soldier reload a gun and ammo just never ran out. The cinematography also had a TV feel to it. ( A noticeable quality of films shot in Australia portraying other countries) I wasn't aware of Hacksaw Ridge from previous war movies or Docos but I have one massive plot problem that was made worse by the end scenes. When the Japanese were shooting down from the top of the ridge..At what point did they not just cut the ropes to prevent the US army climbing back up??? This movie is cliché at best and every stereotype for the Japanese is on display. the scene where the Commander commits suicide before having his head chopped off was like a scene from a John Woo film!! it is a terrible scene and offered nothing to the film. I am glad that this story has been told..It is amazing, but just doesn't resonate the way it should. In fact I found myself thinking it was closer to "" Pearl Harbor"" than ""Saving Private Ryan"".

And speaking of that, the blood and effects of the squirting blood seems bad made.<br/><br/>The second impression of this movie is this: Mel Gibson has as the director done an marvellous job in creating an atmosphere of easy going, calm, straight forward, pleasant and honesty. Well done! I am embracing it at the fullest! I love the way the casting team has worked on making roles for the army. Vince Vaughn as an sergeant? Well, Mel Gibson makes it trustworthy, in some way or another.<br/><br/>48 minutes into the motion picture: Sergeant: What the hell are you saying, Doss? You bruise half your body sleeping? Desmond Doss: I...I sleep pretty hard...<br/><br/>We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy. So...did they meet Rosanna...or did they just wait to hold the line, Toto?<br/><br/>One mans belief (based on what may) can fuel an entire world... and this movie is a true story.<br/><br/>I clapped my hands at the end. I cried a couple of times. What a triumph! In his Braveheart, the hero dies. In Hacksaw Ridge, the hero lives. He did triumph about 20 years later... will he do the same at the Academy Awards, Mr. Mel Gibson?<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Amazing scenery. Amazing sound. Amazing visuals. This is type A of professional movie making. - The actors : Andrew Garfield, amongst others. Mel Gibson took them higher than Hacksaw Ridge. - Entertainment : When the movie where finished, I realized that over two hours passed. It felt like 20 minutes. That is entertainment. - Age : 18, due to war and extreme gore due to injuries<br/><br/>8,3 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)"

"wittkecmission","10","4","8","30 January 2017"," The Angel
","First of all, I love Mel Gibson as a director. Not as a celebrity or as a wife-beater, but as an artist. Two of his films, Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, have both become instant favorites of mine. It's been 10 years since his last film, Apocalypto (which I haven't seen yet). When I heard he made a new film, I was hooked immediately. I suppose the main reason I love Gibson's directing style is because he gets really intimate with the content and characters of his films, close-ups and all. When I saw Hacksaw Ridge in a nearly-empty theater, my expectations were exceeded. The intensity of the battle scenes, and I cannot believe I'm saying this, rival those of Saving Private Ryan. During those scenes, the whole theater rumbled like an earthquake with the sounds of gunshots, flying bullets, mortars, grenades, and earth- shattering explosions. The gore was not in the least bit hidden or sugar coated. There was blood, bones, and limbless bodies galore! Because that's the way the Battle of Okinawa really was. Surprisingly, I wouldn't call the violence gratuitous but I know that other people would. Even casted B-movie actors Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington couldn't bring this film down. The only thing that I genuinely condemn about the movie was the portrayal of the Japanese soldiers, who were portrayed as a mix of savages and zombies. It's definitely an American propaganda film, but even so, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING."
"commonacquaintance","9","4","8","30 January 2017"," Up there with the greats
","Going to watch this film I didn't exactly know what to expect, I knew it was a war film but I didn't know just how realistic it would be. The battle scenes are long and gruesome and you have a sense of being thrown right in the middle. Not only that but there is some seriously good story telling and the acting is superb. There is so much emotion put in to this and some scenes are lighter when they need to be and it gives overall a very good balance of pace, action and storytelling. Andrew Garfield is very convincing and Mel Gibson has overall directed one of the all time great war films.<br/><br/>Whatever you go to the cinema for, you wont be disappointed with this."
"rctguy75","10","4","8","30 January 2017"," One of the Greatest War Movies of all time!
","Cinema has always been defined by the war films. Whether it'd be World War I, World War II, Vietnam, or even more modern battles, the war film has always ruled the academy awards. Several war films, such as: Patton, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, and the Hurt Locker have all won best picture. Hacksaw Ridge is promising to continue that trend with an amazing movie that can absolutely win the best picture award.<br/><br/>Some of the greatest war films are: Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, The Hurt Locker, All Quiet on the Western Front, and Fury. Hacksaw Ridge has easily supplanted itself into that list. Mel Gibson gives us an amazing experience that is almost on par with his previous work, Braveheart.<br/><br/>The story of Hacksaw Ridge is the true story of Desmond T. Doss. Like most young men of the early 1940s, he wants to volunteer to serve his country in the now escalating World War II. However, due to his religious beliefs, Doss cannot touch a gun. Because of this, he is immediately deemed a coward, and is treated with great prejudice. However, thanks to the efforts of his father, Doss is allowed to go into battle without a single weapon to protect himself. Doss is sent to Okinawa, and he is forced to save as many as he can without a weapon. The story of Hacksaw Ridge is basically divided into two halves, with the first half being about his life, dealing with his adversity while also simultaneously finding the love of his life. The second half of the film is Doss on the front lines of the battle, saving lives while his comrades try to achieve victory. The story is very well done and does not seem to be slow.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are some of the best in any war film. Andrew Garfield gives the performance of his life as Desmond T. Doss, and makes us truly want to cheer for him. Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington also give fantastic performances, and both give the audience some very memorable quotes. All the supporting characters are great, giving this film, in my opinion, a perfect cast.<br/><br/>One of the most memorizing aspects of this film is the brutal war scenes that take up the entire second half of the film. This film does not advertise war as great, it truly makes us believe that war is unbearable. The war scenes are brutal, violent, and amazingly shot. These are the most disturbing war scenes since the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson did a very commendable job at making these scenes both realistic and violent.<br/><br/>To sum up this review, Hacksaw Ridge, in my opinion, is the best movie of 2016. With a perfect cast, great story and fantastic cinematography, Hacksaw Ridge has supplanted itself as one of the greatest war movies of all time. In my opinion, on par with Saving Private Ryan and Platoon (which are my two favorite war movies). Hacksaw Ridge, absolutely gets a 10/10!!!"

","Hacksaw Ridge is yet another proof that Mel Gibson is a great director, Hacksaw Ridge is top 5 best war movies of that century, the movie resembles quite Full Metal Jacket from Stanley Kubrick, who has 2 act, totally different, the first shows the Doss's life, his relationship with his family, his training and his passion for the doctor Dorothy, Andrew Garfield makes perhaps his best acting career (I have not yet watched Silence), it impressed me, I always found him a middle-aged actor, Vince Vaugh is very well, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Luce Bracey, Hugh Weaving and etc, the rest of the cast is very competent, the script unfortunately is not perfect, has many problems, has very dialogues Mel Gibson bloody portrays the horror of the war, and he is very good at doing it (Braveheart is proof of this, blood battles and Very well done), the soundtrack is good, the rhythm is very good, it has incredible scenes, I really enjoyed the final scene, and the construction of Desmond in the movie is great, Hacksaw Ridge is undoubtedly one of the best Oscar movies, and If winning will not be unfair, Mel Gibson has to make more war movie. Note 9.4"
"abouhelier-r","10","4","8","29 January 2017"," Hacksaw Ridge #OscarNoms
","I am so glad to see Mel Gibson back to directing movies because ever since The Man Without a Face he has made many very good movies, among which my favourite has to be Braveheart, being an incredible film as well as Apocalypto, which is just as good. This time around, at the heart of this cinematic cyclone is a more conventional character study; of a man torn by his need to serve in a fight against Japan and a strict moral code that prevents him from taking life. Though, once on the battlefield the complexities of his moral fall away, replaced by the simple maths of saving lives. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield, former Spidey, is so good at being an optimist in life, he has this infectious smile, he seems to be such a sweet guy and you really root for his character. Garfield is the warm anchor the film needs. Between this film and Silence, two contrasting tales of faith in an unforgiving world, any memories of the sad end to his web-slinging days should be well and truly banished. Teresa Palmer gives also the best performance of her entire career, as a nurse who Desmond meets, they get to know each other and their relationship is genuinely sweet and charming. <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is in this movie and stole every scene he's in, as an aggressive motor mouth drill instructor. That casting choice is a reminder that Vince Vaughn is obviously very funny, but he also has some dramatic arcs. Moreover, Hugo Weaving gives one of the best performances in this film and I am so happy to see him again. I haven't seen him in a movie in a long time. He is always great, as his legendary roles can attest: Smith, Elrond, Red Skull or in V for Vendetta; this is what we love him for. In this film, he gives such a harden and emotionally powerful performance, as a man who has to deal with alcoholism. I am blown away by his work here. <br/><br/>The slow-burn promise of the film's opening acts pays off in a fierce focus on characters we have come to know, from all of the above to Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey. Biblical themes resonate and Doss's faith and certainties are tested in the movie's second act, a shift happens from home-baked heaven to the purgatory of military training. Mel Gibson and his scribes: Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan's grip on a familiar material is firm; their images, motifs and structures lend purpose to a potentially cheesy material. <br/><br/>The combat sequences, set on a blasted, blood-soaked Okinawan ridge in 1945, are filmed in Viscera Vision - they blaze and roar with the expression of pure violence. At some point, Mel Gibson leads us up a cliff and into a Bosch-ian nightmare. Between the mud, splayed bodies, bullet-pierced tin hats and torsos used as shields; the Battle of Okinawa pulverises. War has been hell in movies before, this is worse. What is impressive here, is how Gibson pushes his direction beyond the exploitative possibilities of raising hell. <br/><br/>The war scenes are brutally realistic and you can see that nothing has been held back and they are very well done and not romanticised at all. This happened. This sucked and this is the story of a man who tried to do something good. This is effectively shocking. Finally, you don't need to be a religious person to appreciate the movie. It addresses strong perspective for the character but you don't need to be religious to appreciate the spirit of this film, and the eternal truth that Human spirit is the most powerful thing you can have.<br/><br/>Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned story that Mel Gibson mainlines with bleeding-edge craft and technique - he has lost little of his knack for spectacle and has proved once again that he is a master behind the camera."
"icoshimo","9","4","8","25 January 2017"," There is no limit of the human courage.
","Mel Gibson had been criticized by the press so bad, and still he prove that he is a brilliant director. I believe that this film is and will be his ""perl"". <br/><br/>Nowadays the war films becomes more like an action movies, especially these ones that are fictional. They are more concentrated in special effects and are less focused on the story. Hacksaw Ridge prove that professional movie making is still alive. It proves that the story and the feelings it gives are and always will be more important that the actual effects. This movie shows the horror of the war, and it show it as close as possible it can be.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield without a doubt was the perfect choice for this act. He did absolutely flawlessly. His talent is way way better developed than his act in spider-man and if he continue in that way he will get recognition on award season.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was good too, but their roles are just that ...supportive and they did it well.<br/><br/>It's still only January and Gibson raise the bar so high that i doubt some one will make better war movie, or even movie that touch your hearth like he did."
"theshiptons","10","4","8","19 January 2017"," Touching and important document of history
","Something as relevant to the horror of war and how in a time of war men find the will to move beyond their own fragility is what is displayed here. in 2017 the people who fought in WW2 are now dwindling away like the last snows of winter. they are old, tired and mostly forgotten. the selfless act of enlistment in this war something most of us can not imagine. To be part of a fight that was in all intent to the bitter demise of all those involved is something we in general will never know. War is not something that needs to be glorified. War is about sacrifice, of life, will and spirit. it was something amazing to see a story about someone who chose to hold on to his spirit and beliefs and still sacrifice for his fellow men. men don't start wars but unfortunately they are the ones who have to finish them.<br/><br/>this movie is Mel Gibson's gift to the bravery of the men who fought in this war. he treated the subject of those that have strong beliefs but still choose to be part of a course of action that at its core seeks peace. the direction and flow of story is intense and drew me in, I felt the emotion and the events from Desmond Doss's past that made him who he was. speaking of the character of Desmond Doss portrayed by Andrew Garfield who has well and truly shaken off that Spider-Man image I had of him. it Spider-Man was an awful film and did him no favors. this film though should at least see him with a academy award nomination as well as best pic and Mel for director."

","While growing up in Lynchburg, Virginia during the Great Depression, young Desmond Doss nearly kills his brother Hal, hitting him with a brick. This traumatizing experience, along with a talk from his religious mother, firmly reinforces his belief in the Fifth Commandment of the Old Testament. Years later, Doss saves a man who becomes injured by a car and while taking the man to hospital, is instantly smitten with a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They soon begin dating and fall in love, and Doss begins to learn about medicine from her work.<br/><br/>With the majority of his town, including his brother, enlisting in the Army to fight in World War II, Doss is motivated to sign up as well. His father, a troubled veteran from the First World War, is deeply upset as he expects to lose his sons just as he lost his boyhood friends. Because of his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. Before he leaves for training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage, and she accepts.<br/><br/>Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell, and while he excels physically, he immediately becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers when he refuses to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays, as he is a Seventh-day Adventist. After Howell and Captain Glover fail to get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Howell worsens Doss' conditions by putting him through grueling labor and turning his fellow soldiers against him by mistaking his beliefs for cowardice, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to disclose the identities of his attackers. He continues training"

","There is something unexplainable about seeing a person save another person's life, and No I don't mean seeing superman save the world or another generic hero save a child from a burning building. I'm talking about seeing a person, a real, living, breathing person save a life... Ever watched those YouTube videos of security cameras showing you how someone saved another person from death. It's a heart warming site that often leaves you tearing for a reason so hard to explain... Maybe it reminds us of how great we can actually be... Maybe it restores some of our faith in humanity. Either way, this film gives you this strange cathartic feeling. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss is a man of principle and virtue, and whether one agrees with his principles or not, it is impossible not to respect him for his commitment to those principles. This is what makes Desmond so real and relatable, his beliefs, his judgment, his own commitment to avoid any regretful action, and in his case it's the act of violence. Desmond shows the essence of purpose that most people feel is necessity in life. "" Please God, help me bring one more..."" <br/><br/>I don't usually discuss directing in my reviews, but it would be extremely unfair in this case. Mel Gibson is mostly known for his way of showing excessive blood and gore. While that is true, it is not what he does best in my opinion. What he does best is his showcasing of Valor and Bravery in a character. I have not seen any director that does it better. Desmond like William Wallace in Braveheart (1994) has that kind baffling bravery that leaves a mark in the viewer. <br/><br/>The War was shown in a very realistic way and straight from eyes of soldiers, ONLY the soldiers. There are no sequences of how the chain of command works for them to end up on Hacksaw Ridge. There are no sequences that even show the person on the ship, receiving coordinates. We only see the world from the eyes of these soldiers, specifically the POV Prvt. Doss. The chaos, the fear, the shock, the tears, the shattered hopes, and literally the shattered soldiers were all seen straight from the eyes of soldiers. I have to say, this is one of the most engaging, heart felt films I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"Laakbaar","9","4","8","27 December 2016"," ""My way to serve""
","This movie is the story of Desmond Doss, an American army medic who was a hero at the battle of Okinawa. This enjoyable, profound and well-crafted movie not only tells a great story, but also has important life lessons about war, courage, sacrifice,leadership, character and conviction.<br/><br/>We should be grateful that a movie like this can still be made in 2016. That there are still writers, directors and producers able and willing to do this. We're no longer used to going to films that hold out characters as role models. Yes, there is a religious element to it. But I'm not religious at all, and I felt the religious aspects of this were sensitively handled and not too overt. <br/><br/>I don't think it's inappropriate to be reminded now and again that we were once in a life-and-death struggle with some of our current allies. It is shocking now to see the intensity of it in one realistic battle scene after the other. Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis <br/><br/>What I didn't like about this film: (1) The recruit training scenes were not 100% realistic to me. (2) The director made it seem like Doss's c.o. status was unusual and affront to his officers, but of course they must have had a system for dealing with this not uncommon situation. (3) The battlefield carnage may be too realistic to some. (4) The Japanese side was not developed in any way, and I think they were almost caricaturized.<br/><br/>If you have children who can handle battlefield carnage, take them to see this inspiring film. Are there still young people of conviction out there? Is Mel Gibson's Desmond Doss a realistic role model for our jaded times? I think Andrew Garfield played the role well, and is someone that young people can identify with today. <br/><br/>I'm sure some people are going to be uncomfortable with seeing a movie like this made by a director who is wrongly perceived as a dumb*ss beefcake actor and as conservative, ultra-religious and racist. And yet regardless of what you believe about Gibson, there is no doubt that the man is a gifted craftsman. He is a great director who makes mind-blowing movies."

","#DevilsLordReviews 11. Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Director : Mel Gibson Genre : Drama,War,History Starring : Andrew Garfield,Vince Vaughn,Sam Worthington,Luke Bracey,Hugo Weaving,Teresa Palmer Another one of the most expected films this year for me since the time i saw its trailer and also the director - MEL Gibson. We all know he is a great actor and an awesome director as well from his previous films like Braveheart,Apocalypto,Passion of the Christ etc. The film shows the experiences of Desmond Doss an American army medic who served during the battle of Okinawa (WW2) who is a pacifist and a very religious man who refuses to carry a gun or any weapon and refuses to kill anyone,even then becoming the first person to receive Medal of Honor without firing a single shot. The film can be divided into two halves where first half shows the childhood and adolescence of Desmond and how he joins the US army as a medic and second half shows the brutality of war and how Desmond saves the lives of 75 army men single handedly and what he witnesses and experiences in the war forms the rest of movie. Movie mainly focuses on anti-war elements and really shows how brutal war can be.Mel Gibson who is known for portraying brutal scenes beautifully does it this time too and the way he blends brutality and faith is just awesome.Some scenes were really scary that even it shook me from my seat and i was like dammmnnnnnn!!!! Cinematography is really great and war scenes are just beautifully shot. Coming to performances,Andrew Garfield is the one we should mention first (ofcourse!!!) He became popular by doing The Amazing Spiderman and was well appreciated by all for portraying a teenage amateur spidey really well. This role was like a big opportunity for him to prove his acting skills,that its not just limited to that of a typical teenager role and he just nailed this role. He was really living as Desmond Doss i would say.His performance was so moving and touchy. A definite Oscar worthy performance from the guy.Vince Vaughn,Hugo Weaving,Teresa Palmer,Luke Bracey all gave great performances but the guy who surprised me was Sam Worthington. I never thought he was able to act this mature. It was really great to see him in such a mature and serious role and he really did well. So all in all a very well made war movie and probably one of the best action sequences we have got in the last few years too.Mel Gibson's direction,performances from the whole cast,breathtaking action scenes and cinematography all these makes this film a must watch movie this year and probably one of the best movies released this year.Where people who have killed 160 or more people are celebrated as heroes and movies are made on them,i think a guy like Desmond Doss who saved 75 lives and even tried to save some Japs,that too without even touching a weapon or firing a shot is the one who should be celebrated and declared as real hero (just my opinion).So don't miss out this awesome movie from theatres everyone. Its a must watch for all. Give it a try and you wont regret it. My Rating : 9/10"

","Battle depictions are always going to be gut crunching & emotionally disturbing whilst there is always that calm soothing subject to keep the platoon sewed, well this time it's in form of a godly medic in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 WWII. The incredible true story of Corporal Desmond Doss is genuinely heart wrecking and has been captured aesthetically on the big screen right from his uncustomary childhood to his admission into the B-Company breezing through a rather-fascinatingly presented love life. Mr Director strikes the right chord while sailing past the humanistic approach to ""hell of a battle"" churning out the triumphant as Spirit of an individual. Aptly titled as HACKSAW RIDGE, it's been supremely uplifted by it's cast & crew probably making it the Best Movie of 2016, even from the technical front. The movie climaxes with the clips of the real life soldiers expressing their grief and pain which might force out a drop of gratitude rolling down your cheek. Don't miss this masterpiece. 10/10"
"Manal1987","9","4","8","18 December 2016"," The Brutal Mel Gibson Is Back
","If you are reading this review you have probably seen The Passion of the Christ (2004) or at least heard of it and the controversy it stirred over the gruesome brutality Mel Gibson unabashedly portrays on screen. For obvious reasons, the film could not wear the ""true story"" badge that, 12 years later, Hacksaw Ridge (2016) proudly does. This time, Gibson takes his Christ to World War II to tell the modern-day miracle of American corporal Desmond Doss, a religious and peaceful young man who despite his refusal to bear arms or commit any act of violence, saves the lives of 75 soldiers in his division during the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>The film features an incredibly diverse cast; Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Rachel Griffiths, Luke Bracey and Vince Vaughn, all pushed to limits I never thought they would reach. Who would have thought that the sweet boy-next-door Peter Parker has been carrying so much unnoticed potential? He may not look like the real Desmond Doss at all, but his innocently childish face renders the purity of Doss's character, and his emotionally fierce performance conveys the vigor of his faith. However, the person whose presence is felt the most during the 140-minute-long movie is Mr. Gibson himself; his brutal and raw energy becomes the moving force behind every single shot. While watching the film, I caught myself unconsciously clenching my body in a fetus position as a way to fend off the violence on the screen. Gibson's violence is not the gory slaughterhouse kind that invests in feelings of disgust (that never gets me anyway); it is violence that brings our physical and human vulnerability to unprecedented proximity – he brutally invades the bubble of our reality to bring our insides out for everyone to see meaningless, absurd, and vicious as they are.<br/><br/>Although it has been described as a ""religious bomb,"" the way I see it, Hacksaw Ridge preaches faith not religion. I am well aware that Mel Gibson is an extremely religious individual, and I mean it dogmatically and aesthetically. Like it or not, you've got to respect him for his discipline as a director and his courageous indifference to Hollywood standards. In a time where miracles are ridiculed and our sole idea of heroes is sexy bodies in spandex suits whose superpowers are measured by how much damage they can inflict, Gibson shows us a real hero whose only superpower was his faith – a real hero who only wanted to save lives all lives!<br/><br/>For those who could not understand his message the first time, Gibson is saying it again, louder and in a much more mature voice: we need to jump into the very heart of violence to really understand the powerful nature of love."

","'HACKSAW RIDGE': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new war biopic set during WWII, and based on the life of Desmond Doss; the first conscientious objector, and American pacifist, to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The film was directed by Mel Gibson, and it's the first movie he's directed since 2006's 'APOCALYPTO'. It was written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving. It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also been a modest hit at the Box Office (costing just $45 million to make). I think it's one of the best war films I've ever seen!<br/><br/>Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) was raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, by a very religious mother (Griffiths). His father (Weaving) was an alcoholic, due to his negative experiences in the Great War. After almost killing his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero), while fighting when they were kids, Desmond becomes a very passionate believer in the Sixth Commandment. This becomes a severe problem when Desmond feels the need to serve his country, during World War II. After a great deal of harassment, and several obsessive attempts by his commanding officers (Worthington and Vaughn) to have him thrown out of the Army, Desmond goes on to save the lives of 75 fellow soldiers, as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa, and win the Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The movie has been praised by many critics as being the best war film since 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN', and I would agree; it's every bit as horrifically realistic, and violent, and it's also just as well made. I'm a big fan of Mel Gibson; as an actor and a director, but especially a director (and I've missed him over the last ten years). This film stands as one of his greatest; it's at least in the same league as 'BRAVEHEART' and 'THE PASSION OF THE Christ'. I'm also a fan of Andrew Garfield; he's my favorite Spider-Man, and I think he's a very talented and passionate actor. He's good in the lead, and Worthington, Vaughn and Weaving are all outstanding in supporting roles as well. What I most like about the film is it's message; it deals with a very passionate rebel outcast, who must do battle with nearly everyone else, and take on a lot of harassment, in order to stick up for his beliefs; and he does it beautifully. The movie is extremely moving, and breathtakingly beautiful; it's one of the year's very best!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30"

","In a year of many disappointing sequels, spin-offs, and reboots, Mel Gibson has come out of hiding to save the cinematic year with Hacksaw Ridge. I can honestly say that the only war movie that comes close to this one's quality and realism is Saving Private Ryan. Realistic, gripping, and even humorous at times, Hacksaw Ridge is filled with beautiful cinematography and scenery, and great acting, particularly from Garfield, Vaughn, and Weaving. Garfield should certainly be nominated for Best Actor, and both Vaughn and Weaving could potentially win in the Best Supporting Actor category. The film also tackles controversial and heavy themes admirably, and doesn't pander to its audience, which I appreciate. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it ends somewhat abruptly. I urge you to check out this cinematic achievement, and I certainly hope it wins big at the Oscars this year."

As we learn more and more about Desmond we are learning about his father and every scene that Tom Doss was in was stolen by him as he portrays a veteran that has seen unimaginable things which left mark on him. His perception and understanding was incredible but at the same time emotional and powerful. Then we lean more into Desmond and Dorothy and their love and caring for each other. As everyone in camp starts to realize what their life is with Desmond and his believes they are all unable to stop themselves form hurting him but his love and believes are so great that he forgives all. Just as everything couldn't get worse Tom Doss finally show how he cares and loves his son but also by his decision Desmond saved 75 men. Then war scenes came into first plan and they were absolutely staggering showing us what true horror and pain looks like. First sequence was about 15 minutes long and it was one of the most brutal war scenes every shown, with so many details and absolutely incredible directing throughout them. Next came the commitment combined with pain and struggle in his amazing saving of every wounded men despite threat that was always upon Desmond's neck and how he continued with pure will to push himself to limit. After that he was everybody's hero that they all need to keep pushing and just to give their best. Garfield played Desmond and he played it like it was his last, so much power and emotions made role of his career in this picture. Weaving as Tom Doss is one of the biggest surprises, giving an extraordinary performance as he is believable and shows us every little thing about his struggle. Mel's directing was as always on top and gave us once of the best pictures in 2016 with some incredibly violent and terrifying scenes, meaning many great things should come up by him in future. 4/4"

","With over 1000 movies seen in my life, this is by far the best I have seen in at least a decade. Great Movie!!! Absolutely worth seeing over and over again!!! Being in the military I never thought a man as a conscientious objector would ever receive a CMOH. WOW! I LOVE Non-fiction movies that teach people the ways of life and this movie fulfilled that. This movie, in a great many respects reminded me of Saving Private Ryan in its realism. I hope Mel keeps giving movies like this one for the world to see. Along with Passion of the Christ this movie ranks right up there. I don't think I will ever see better movies than what Mel has been putting out there lately. Keep it up please!!! In these dark times in our world we need more of such eye-opening films to show the reality to our ignorant selves. The sacrifices that have been made by such brave men of the past is shown, once again, by military members of World War 2. Thank You to all my fellow military members to whom I serve for your sacrifices so that we may have Freedom of choice and speech!!! Unfortunately the latter is what is destroying our country when it is used in political ways and is destroying the religion and traditions by which this country stands for. Great job Mel Gibson!!! Thank You Very Much!!!"
"RayCharles81","10","4","8","26 November 2016"," One of the most inspirational movies of the decade and the best film of the year
","Not since Saving Private Ryan has a war movie balanced mainstream appeal with the realism, brutality, and gruesomeness of the battlefield. With Private Ryan, it was D-day and the landing of Normandy beach, France. With Hacksaw Ridge, it's the battle of the escarpment in Okinawa, Japan. Both were pivotal, defining battles towards the end of World War II. <br/><br/>The final third of Hacksaw Ridge is pure hell and won't be for the faint of heart. But Mel Gibson knows this is war, and he did his research to make it as realistic as possible while still delivering fan service action scenes. A lofty score backs the action, pulling at the heart strings while these brave heroes sacrifice their lives for the freedom of their wives, children, and future children. Yes, it's a battle between good and evil, and a climactic scene toward the end powerfully juxtaposes the doctrine of the axis leading to suicide-by-sword of their commander with the hero's bible as the ally forces take command of the ridge. Beliefs here matter. <br/><br/>This is a far contrast from the first half of the film, which shows the main character and hero, Desmond Doss' more innocent and peaceful upbringing and courtship of his future wife. Although Doss is raised in a relatively normal southern rural community as a 7th day Adventist, his religious faith, his dad is an alcoholic who struggles with his demons from serving in World War I. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge draws the line between heaven and hell, peace and war. In both, love is the glue that holds things together and wins battles. Love wins wars. Doss, according to his faith and convictions, chooses not to fight fire with fire, and in doing so, he may get wounded and burnt, but he manages to save his soul and about 75 of his fellow brothers and soldiers in one of the most brutal and unforgiving bloodbaths of the second world war. As a true real life hero, he is given the medal of honor, becoming the first conscientious objector to ever do so, by Harry S. Truman. <br/><br/>This movie will move you to tears and will go down as one of the most inspirational and uplifting movies of the decade. While it has its moments of let downs here and there throughout the script (it wasn't written by Gibson, who does superb directing in it) which some people will criticize, many people will label it a masterpiece. It's such a great story to anyone open to receiving it. <br/><br/>With strong faith and a good soul, one can be subjected to the depths (and heights) of hell, battle-scarred, bloodied, and broken, and still come out and return whole. Desmond Doss, a real life war hero who saved 75 wounded men without ever firing a gun or resorting to violence, did just that."

I can't believe such a story like this exists and I'm hoping for a few Oscar nominations as well. Powerful movie. Powerful story. Powerful actors. Powerful directing.

","""Hacksaw Ridge"" is an extremely realistic and well-made World War 2 movie. Mr. Garfield sparkles as Desmond Doss, with the real-life's characters sweet earnestness and simple, religious convictions. The rest of the cast does well, too. Vince Vaughn is a convincingly tough Army sergeant. The battle field scenes are horrific and brutal. It is incredible that our fathers and grandfathers went through such horrors. Mr. Gibson brings it all back with a great directing touch and outstanding cinematography. As an Army veteran, I wanted to see the movie. I have enjoyed all of Mel Gibson's movies, though I would never want to see ""Passion of the Christ"" again. Now that he is back, I am hoping Mel continues to direct more outstanding movies like ""Hacksaw Ridge""."
"littleging12","9","4","8","19 November 2016"," One of the Most Inspiring Movies of all Time
","Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ) marks his ten year absence from cinema with this extraordinary fact-based war film Hacksaw Ridge. The film is a welcome return to form for Mel Gibson whose directorial efforts have been non-existent as of late largely due to controversy. Gibson expertly crafts some of the most immersive, visceral, and gut-wrenchingly intense war scenes since Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, while also telling the incredibly inspiring story of one man's challenge to stay true to his convictions while becoming an unlikely hero in the process.<br/><br/>The first half of the film chronicles the struggles, tribulations, and trials of a real-life pacifist named Desmond T. Doss (played by Andrew Garfield). Doss joins the army to aid in the war effort after the massacre at Pearl Harbor. Though Doss condemns violence, will not touch a gun, and tries to become a medic as opposed to fighting. He endures vicious beatings from his comrades, animosity from his commanding officers, and unjust charges brought against him for not going along with basic rifle training and the violence that will inevitably follow. He later becomes court-martialed for his alleged defiance of a commanding officer and then thrown in prison. After his trial, the army finally gives into his wishes and sends him into battle without the need to bear arms. <br/><br/>Doss's whole struggle is the epitome of conviction as he stands up for what he believes in no matter the cost. Doss's conflict was very well portrayed, offered some compelling drama and the fact that this all actually happened made it even more credible. Though the first half of the film had some minor hiccups with the cliché love story, the questionable military ethics displayed by the commanding officers (such as soliciting Doss to quit the army with a draft in effect) and finally by some campy dialogue which throughout its length does not feature one single f-word given the grittiness and cruelty known to be present in army boot camps and on the battlefields.<br/><br/>Following Doss's struggle at home, the story quickly jumps into the battle of Okinawa. The war scenes are absolutely relentless in its depiction of warfare. It offers some incredible intensity and masterfully choreographed battle scenes. Mel Gibson thrusts the viewer right into the action just as effectively as Steven Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan. The viewer feels the shock of every explosion, every bullet zipping past the soldiers' heads, and every man bellowing in pain. It is simply beautiful chaos.<br/><br/>Though what helps evoke humanity in the awful savagery depicted in the war scenes is Private Doss. Private Doss risks his own life multiple times to save the lives of others. When everyone else retreated, he stayed behind to save many people including some of the enemy soldiers all without firing a single shot. Doss reflects a Christ-like figure by the light shining on his back, by helping a blind man see, and also by washing off all the blood and dirt on him metaphorical to the Baptism of Jesus. Just like Jesus, Doss saved many people and also stood for what was right even if it lead to incarceration or death. Gibson told Doss's story with accuracy, grace, grit, and tremendous technical skill all without being excessively sentimental, preachy with Christianity, or overly glamorous with the war scenes.<br/><br/>Private Doss was portrayed fantastically by Andrew Garfield whose work may warrant an Oscar nomination. The casting was surprisingly great as it featured many actors normally typecast for roles almost the opposite they played in this film for example: Vince Vaughn as an intimidating yet wise-cracking drill sergeant, Hugo Weaving as an abusive yet regretful father, and Andrew Garfield himself from a comic book hero to a real life one. Everyone in the film did a great job at personifying their characters and breaking down their own previous stereotypes.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is the most harrowing, terrifying and visceral war film since Saving Private Ryan, while being the most triumphant, inspirational and feel-good movie since Rocky or even Rudy. Mel Gibson has marked a comeback with this film and hopefully he keeps making pictures as urgent as this. The film definitely deserves Oscar attention come award season."
"SelinaKyle3636","10","4","8","18 November 2016"," Absolutely moving.
","I've seen this movie twice in theaters already and can't wait to see it again. This movie is totally immersive, the combat scenes make you feel like you're really there. I have a whole new respect for Andrew Garfield because now that I've seen it, I couldn't picture anyone else in this role. You can tell he took a lot of pride in his depiction of Doss.Vince Vaughn was also really good in his role which was a surprise since he sticks to comedy most of the time. It was also a different shift of focus for a WWII film since most cover the fighting that took place in Germany. I think being from Lynchburg, VA myself allows me to feel extra pride in this story of a hero from my home town. If you haven't already, I can't recommend to see this movie enough."
"grawsas","10","4","8","16 November 2016"," True colors
","Here are so many opinions about this movie, but we all agree - it is worth every minute of our time. This movie will be enlisted between classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan and will be remembered for long. Here we see true story of hero who don't kill others for good and this pacifistic idea is not very common in movies. But around this pacifistic idea we see such cruelty, that we don't see in other war movies. A.Garfield fits perfectly for his role and even comedian V.Vaughn looks in his place (strange). We see religion point very often, maybe - too often for some people, but we see it not in maniacal way. Just strong and clear opinion with defending of it. Must see!"
"billynguyen","10","4","8","15 November 2016"," The story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who despite refusing to bear arms due to religious beliefs, becomes a WW2 medal of honor recipient.
","I really liked this movie. So much that I saw it twice! Desmond Doss was a true American hero who was misunderstood and abused at first (because they took his religious beliefs for cowardice), but who eventually became a WW2 hero. In the end, he earned not only the respect of his fellow soldiers, but also the medal of honor. What did he do? He single-handedly saved 75 of his wounded comrades after the orders to retreat were given. Whilst doing all this, he was totally unarmed (by choice), with enemy soldiers on patrol. It was funny because Sargeant Howell said ""do not count on pvt. doss to save you on the battlefield because he will be too busy wrestling with his conscience to help"" but it was later proved that when the orders came to retreat, he was the only one to come back and save Sgt. Howell and dozens of others. It was awesome when he had gained their respect in the end and Capt. Glover, who had ridiculed Doss so much and tried to kick him out of his unit said he was wrong about doss, and begged him for forgiveness and to join them on a Saturday assault even though he knew it was Doss' Sabbath day because the other soldiers wanted Doss beside them on the battlefield. Doss agreed and went back into battle. <br/><br/>Also, before all of his battle heroics, Desmond doss fell in love with a nurse at a local hospital named Dorothy schutte. Although he was awkward at first, he had the courage to pursue her and they eventually fell in love, and married. She was a major source of strength and support for him throughout the movie. (There is plenty of kissing, but no sex scene thankfully) The end credits said they would remain married for 50 years until she died in 1991, which was really sweet. This cute and heartwarming young romance was a stark contrast between the horrors of war that was yet to come, and I really liked it.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is really good! it depicts the heroics of a conscientious objector who chose to go into battle as a medic, while completely unarmed. It shows the comradery between soldiers, and even has lighthearted and happy moments back home with his sweetheart. A must see movie. Well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>PS: i could go on and on with more details, but I think this is enough."

"MattBrady099","7","4","8","14 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge - Movie Review
","LIFF30 2016 #3<br/><br/>""In peace, sons bury their fathers. In war, fathers bury their sons"".<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge may seem like another Oscar bait ""true story"" biopic that we get every couple of years. The trailers didn't help at all, as it made the film look corny and very award bait. But guys trust on this, it's nothing like that. There's nothing glamorous about this. When it was over, I left was speechless. This is such a great movie.<br/><br/>Say what you want about Mel Gibson controversial past and behavior, but I think we must judge the art, not the artist. This guy is an excellent director and a great actor. And you have no idea how glad I am seeing Mel back, as he is the most talented man in Hollywood right now. The most impressive part of Mel's directing in this movie (besides the battle scenes), is he's decision of an old version approach to the film making. The movie literally looks and feels like it was made around the 50's. Also how Gibson would let actors deliver the emotion of what their feeling and it could meant a lot of things that isn't just terrified. It could be happy, regret, or just thinking of home. And I got all of that. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is an actor that's been non-stop blowing me away recently. And he gives one hell of performance as Desmond Doss. I would say it's one of his best since ""The Social Network"". Even in the battle scenes I thought he was brilliant, as he had this scared, tired, but brave look to him. He's accent in the film I thought worked pretty well and wasn't distracting like I thought it would. The chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer was so charming and sweet that it didn't came of too corny. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving plays Desmond father in the movie and he was outstanding. Such a powerful and emotional heavy performance. Weaving is the type of actor that deserves so much respect. I mean, we all know him as Agent Smith, V, Megatron, Elrond, and Red Skull. But for him to give a small supporting performance as the alcoholic father who's dealing with conflicted within was quite moving. <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn was so good in this movie that I wish he would come back for dramatic roles, as I really did brought his performance in this. The comedic one lines were pure gold and it was very ""Full Metal Jacket"". But he isn't like that the whole movie. When he's serious in the movie, it actually works and doesn't feel out of place for the rest of the tone. <br/><br/>Now the battle scenes in the movie...wow, it's pretty rough and disturbing. It's right up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" for graphic and shocking depictions. What I always love in these type of War films is the loud sound, actors, and the camera work, which this movie nails at. I've heard some people say that the movie glorify's it's violence despite the theme of the movie being against violence. I honestly think these people have really missed the point here. All the battle scenes are depicted more as this horrible event than a flawless victory. <br/><br/>After the movie was over, everyone in the cinema started clapping. The last time that happened was when in saw ""Up"" back in 2009. While I never saw the point of clapping or booing at a movie, but for this occasion, I'll let it Slide. The ending was a very nice touch and pretty heartfelt to honor the soldiers that fought in the war. It was deserved. <br/><br/>I haven't got a lot of issues with the movie. But if had to pick, I would probably say that Sam Worthington Australia accent kept slipping in and out in a few scenes. And don't get me wrong, Worthington isn't bad in the movie, but he was pretty good. The same can go to some of cast (as most of them are Australia), but I can easily look past it as the actual performances were all great. <br/><br/>Overall rating: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is not perfect, but it positives really do weigh out it's flaws. It's the best War movie I've seen in awhile in terms of it's execution and pay off."
"fvlecmatic","9","4","8","11 November 2016"," If this story is true its extraordinary...
","I had big expectations from this movie and I have to say that it is really special. I knew that it would be violent as it was directed by Mel Gibson but the slow romantic warm up made me forget all about it. And that's why I think it is brilliant. It will just shock you and blow your mind when you ""experience"" war through this movie. It's almost insane. I have seen many war movies but this one is far the most realistic one. I also loved the fact that it is not trying to create cheap emotions but it stays real yet manages to be very powerful. It is definitely one of the best movies this year. It also has a very nice clear picture quality which should be definitely rewarded with an Oscar. If nothing else I at least hope Mel Gibson will direct more movies."

Pompous faces and pathetic conversations of characters to the sounds of violins and puffing piano + pathos. Absolutely stupid and unnecessary running of people and explosions at the beginning of the film to show effects. But everything is not natural, but it is an ill-conceived porridge. There is no authenticity. The film consists of typical templates and weak actors.

I don't say that in a joking way either. This script is easily one of the worst I've experienced. Vince Vaughn and Hugo Weaving seem out of place completely, especially when they speak. Vaughn seems out of place for his unfortunate type cast and Hugo Weaving seems like he was held back by something. <br/><br/>If you are religious (especially Christian) you'll probably love this film.<br/><br/>As someone who just wants a decent plot, script, and performance...

","I can only assume that the high ratings reflect a confusion between the story this movie attempts to tell, and the movie itself. Plus maybe some die-hard Gibson fans.<br/><br/>I thought much of the first half of the movie was too long and sometimes painfully slow. And yet, for all the screen time expended, not that much was accomplished. Yes, it established that his girl was pretty and sweet, his father tortured by personal demons, his mother warm and supportive. But not at a depth or complexity that justified the screen time. Even more painfully slow was his period with the rifle company. Yes, it established that they didn't like COs, but that was pretty much of a given, and 10 minutes in, hey, we got it already.<br/><br/>I think they missed an opportunity to explore the reason he wasn't courtmartialed. He got a note excusing him from prison? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie I found compelling was his efforts to get ""just one more"" throughout the night.<br/><br/>I'm a long way from a combat veteran, but I was left wondering if it were true, that no one taught WWII soldiers to fire from behind cover in a prone position, instead of standing up like targets on a shooting range.<br/><br/>I thought an opportunity was missed when he discovered the tunnels. Di they already know that they were there, or was that potentially a break-though piece of intel? Did he even tell anyone? <br/><br/>But the thing that left me truly gaping is that, all through that long night, NOT ONE SOLDIER on the ground felt compelled to climb to the top of the net to at least help lower the wounded. If that were really how it played out, I would have courtmartialed all of THEM. But it probably went quite differently.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie 5 stars, every single one of them for Andrew Garfield's performance, which was excellent, and carried the film. If I were rating only his performance, I'd rate it much higher."

"jrrussell","10","5","11","26 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge: A Philosophical Review
","The following is somewhat of a convoluted mix of review and philosophical examination of the movie and its themes.<br/><br/>Though the movie is about the brutality and ugliness of what humans can and did do to another, it is also a testament to the good they can also do. This movie and I think most ""war"" movies is not a celebration of war and doesn't seek to trivialize it (although a mere microcosm of the full scope of it, specifically WWII). At it's most basic level Hacksaw Ridge is a presentation of our base emotions (e.g. love, fear, pain, and hope). Everything that Desmond experiences in his life and especially during his service time comprises those emotions and much more.<br/><br/>I didn't see the movie glorifying war or pride or showing any particular point of view other than those held by Americans at that time. Some have said the explosions from the ships were exaggerated but that is kind of expected and didn't detract from the movie in my mind. The real strength of this movie was the presentation of Desmond and the life Andrew Garfield brought to the character. Desmond was human and maybe held to his convictions more than most at such a point in history. Would people have felt the same way about him had he saved fewer people or no people? Perhaps his family would have but doubtful for the rest of people. This is not to say that courage is always visible or evident without proof but it makes one wonder about how one becomes courageous. Was Desmond brave because of his upbringing and religion or in spite of it? I think it made him who he was but I don't believe religion is required for one to be brave because I believe it comes instead from empathy, compassion, and optimism. This review is not meant to answer his motives but that is the dialogue such a movie should create.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge was itself the personification of hell and no movie can truly capture the hell it was but we can be inspired by it and Desmond. He was seen as a hero but not because of what he didn't do. His actions were a testament to his bravery but that seems to have been because of his heart and the type of person he was as a result of his father's treatment and vowing to not hold a gun again with the chance to kill.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge shows us what it means to be human. The joy, pain, grief, hatred and all those things that go with growing up and going to war. That humanity can be stripped away and revealed at the same time. Whether there will be any less suffering from future conflict remains to be seen but the hope lies in there being more heroes like Desmond (as much as we should hope the need becomes unnecessary or not because of war)."
"austin0731","9","5","11","26 November 2016"," The power of belief
","Hacksaw Ridge is an amazing movie, one of the best films of the year. First of its depiction of war and its horrors was masterfully done, the war scenes were horrifically gory, the use of visual effects and makeup were to a degree of brilliance in these scenes. As we follow the protagonist through and through the battlefield the horrors we see just so brilliantly reflects the horrors of war, from the rats and maggots eating away the deteriorating bodies to the bodies with their internal organs out, it was like a scene from a horror movie, which makes it all the more powerful as we as audiences understand that this is in fact the 'truth of war'. It was very impactful, most importantly the atmosphere that the film sets up for the war scenes are truly indulging, through the use of smoke and special effects I really found myself sort of 'lost' in the horrors of this battle. Everything were presented in a very realist way, I remember quite vividly the scenes in which the men would just lift their heads and immediately get gunned down to their deaths or how many of the men dies almost instantaneously, this idea of how easily a life could be taken did leave a large impact on me.<br/><br/>Moving on to the actors, Andrew Garfield I believe gives one of the best performances from him ever, the way he portrays the character of Desmond Doss makes him such an inspirational figure, Throughout the film he never loses that sheepish grin,in contrast to his fellow comrades it is as if the war has not really left a toll on him. The way he still 'lives on' with that undefeated spirit of him was captured amazingly in Andrew Garfield's performance. It was a brilliant choice of casting Garfield, from his physique alone it would seem that he is perhaps lesser or weaker, which really helps emphasise on the character of Desmond, of how despite being weak his heart and grit may be stronger than any other. His spirit and firm belief in god is really fleshed out against his shortages in physical strength.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving also delivers a masterful performance, as an audience I could just see the internal conflict that is constantly seen on Weaving's face. The internal struggle was done so subtly, this is yet another brilliant entry from Weaving. Another brilliant performance which surprised me was from Vince Vaughn, it has been sometime since he has starred in a serious film and stepped away from comedy. In this film he was at times the comedic relief providing brilliant comedy one liners, but never dismiss his ability to act out those more emotional and serious scenes because in this movie Vince Vaughn really hits the ball out of the park on that side also. <br/><br/>Overall the moral of this film was a great one and way portrayed very well. The power of believing, this man, Desmond truly and wholeheartedly believes in his god and the thing about this movie is how belief can be so empowering. Even when others did not approve of or agree with the way he depicts the bible and god, he stuck with it and that firm belief guided him and allowed him to save all of those people at Hacksaw Ridge. This film isn't necessarily a film about Christianity or god but more of the idea of 'believing in something', towards the end of the film there was a scene in which the men refused to storm Hacksaw Ridge without Desmond, the men did not possess the same level of belief as Desmond towards god, but they believed in one thing: 'Desmond Doss' and in turn their belief in him brought victory at Hacksaw Ridge. So the most important thing that I personally got out of Hacksaw Ridge was the idea of how important believing is, hey, believing alone can't accomplish anything indeed but if you apply belief to action then you could really cause a large impact."
"rick-03350","10","5","11","24 November 2016"," One of my favorite movies that I have seen....
","Hacksaw Ridge Ridge is, according to the actual main Character Doss's son, very close to 100% factual. The main character is a very spiritual man from a spiritual family that takes ""Thy Shall Not Kill"" in the bible literally.He ends up in a very very real war. My hands were shaking and heart pounding for two hours of the 2 1/2 hours of the movie. The movie portrays well why so many American lost their lives in Okinawa (WWII).Doss was an incredible man. I think that he is the only Conscientious Objector to win a Purple Heart for bravery in battle and he didn't even carry a gun.<br/><br/>All of this aside, the movie is really about humanity and God's love for us in the face of horrific tragedy. It's a hard movie but yet beautiful. It's about values, commitment, respect and love for fellow humans as well.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful movie that I highly recommend."
"meeks2003","10","5","11","24 November 2016"," Excellent!
","I always can't wait next Gibsons movie and he thrills me every time it shows up. - Classy performance by Garfield, Wothington, Vaughn and the rest of the crew. - Perfectly recorded battle minutes with all the ugly moments that the front line of the battle contains. - Very pleasant romantic moments - A lot of emotions all the way from the beginning until the very end of the film. <br/><br/>It is unbelievable how meticulously and carefully Gibson develops every scene and the part of the movie. The time passed so quickly that I haven't even noticed that it came to the end. Well done Mel! Congratulations again!"
"jorganovicmladen","8","5","11","20 November 2016"," Mel is back, in style!!!!
","Hacksaw Ridge (2016) This is one of the best movies of the year, if not the best. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is not flawless, but Mel knows how to strike it, first in choosing a story, religious and patriotic, that really fits him. Then he knows how to create atmosphere so the whole movie looks somehow big, epic etc. Film is nicely put in two parts,first part is more of a drama and second part is war with drops of drama and thriller. Maybe the weakest part of the movie is that last sequence, that is generally low point of biography movies, when hero feels little unrealistic. Maybe I'm little bothered by Mel's one sided story, but that is a big plus also, he doesn't try to please audience, but himself. He was like that in Braveheart too. <br/><br/>When it comes to actors, role of Vince Vaugh as Sergent Howell was fantastic, he was bringing balance to the story and toning it down a little, which is good thing in this movie. Andrew Garfiled is good and he is developing in a very good actor. Teresa Palmer was great in her role of Doss' girlfriend, she and Garfield really shine together. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Very good war or anti-war movie depends how you see it, just a little weaker than already mentioned Bravheart, it's 9/10"
"heisenberg12","10","5","11","20 November 2016"," Gibson Delivers Again
","One thing I've noticed with skilled directors like Gibson and Eastwood is that they know how to carve out a story, making it complete. One of the basic things a story must have is a structured act one, two, and three, and a solid end, which any good director knows is incredibly important and an opportunity to put the finishing touches on their work. With that being said, it's amazing how many movies nowadays fail at basic structure. <br/><br/>Gibson delivers again with an unforgettable story about a hero who fought in the battle of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa Japan during World War II. Gibson's arsenal now includes powerhouse films like Braveheart, Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ, and now Hacksaw Ridge. <br/><br/>The movie begins effectively as a love story and backstory of Desmond Doss before transitioning into acts two (bootcamp) and act three (the battle of Hacksaw Ridge). The contrast between acts one and three is so stark, it feels like a completely different film for each. Love and war? This contrast was a little bothersome and the film does have some somewhat cheesy parts in the middle, so it's not perfect. But overall, it's an awesome movie and I really liked the ending. <br/><br/>It's really different. While the war scenes are what you's expect, some aspects of the movie are rare for a Hollywood picture. For one, most of the main actors, except for Garfield and Vaughn, are unknowns and from what I've read many are Australian. The ending was very different too, and that for me definitely worked great. And it just mixes in all these elements of faith, religion, war, and love all together in a way you don't often see. <br/><br/>While I enjoyed the whole film, I was leaning toward a respectable 7/10 through the first two-thirds, but after the way it ended and viewing it in its entirety, I really liked it and rate it an 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>Awesome movie and a must see. Possibly one of the best war movies of the last 20 years, but it's more than just a war movie. It's also a love story and inspirational. <br/><br/>This is the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Tehmeh","9","5","11","19 November 2016"," I'd say they don't make them like this anymore, but they just did.
","When ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was over, me and my friends left the theater impressed. We all felt that it was a product of good, old-fashioned film-making. You get that certain sense of melodrama, emotional pathos and familiarity with it - and none of it feels cynical, forced or meaningless. It's not a subtle movie, but it's a very effective one. I still have ""Arrival"" to watch, but so far ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is probably the best movie I've seen in 2016.<br/><br/>This movie is very familiar in what it shows, but unique in what it's telling you with these things. First and foremost it's the story Desmond Doss, his faith, his beliefs and eventually his heroics. I don't remember seeing a protagonist this likable in quite some time. Desmond Doss is almost naive and childish in what he thinks and how he acts. He's like that symbolic, well-meaning, innocent child inside us that most of us have buried somewhere in our hearts, making room for bitterness, hate and all kinds of crap that brings us down. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a man of faith, and you'll be hearing about his faith a lot. Mel Gibson will not downplay it at all, quite the opposite. Downplaying it would be doing a disservice to the now deceased Doss. If you normally get annoyed by such things, don't fret. This movie isn't judging anyone or pushing religion to anyone, it's just showing you one man's faith, and how it can possibly affect people around him too.<br/><br/>The structure of the movie is clearly divided in three parts, but you still feel like you're watching the same one story instead of three separate ones. The first part of the movie is setting up his character, and you get all the beautiful meadows, like if this was a Lassie-movie or something else totally innocent and pure. You get to see him grow up and fall in love. The middle part is about his struggles at the boot camp, and while you'd think you've seen it all in ""Full Metal Jacket"", here you'll find they're pushing for a different story with it, making it all worthwhile in this scenario. The last part is full-out war. While we saw shocking battles in ""Saving Private Ryan"" too, again the story of Doss (and what it means) requires the movie to shock us. And shock it does, because the violence is brutal and unforgiving. The first and last part are so different from each other, that when all the ugly violence of war kicks in, you feel like you're punched to the face. None of this is cynical, conflicting with the story or even exploitative. It works amazingly well with the story it's telling us. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is a great director, he hasn't lost his touch. Everything on the screen has a purpose, and while his movies aren't the most subtle think-pieces, they are extremely effective and often heartfelt. With a lesser storyteller many of the events and characters would feel like placeholders or cardboard cutouts, and while some of them might be superficially just that, all of it is elevated. Andrew Garfield in the lead role is excellent. He truly gives a heartfelt performance. So no worries, he is really good in it, as is Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn (surprise!) and just about everybody else. Even Sam Worthington is alright. Special mentions go to Teresa Palmer and Rachel Griffiths, who don't have much screen time, but their small roles are important and they do a good job. <br/><br/>The cinematography and visual expression of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is awesome. Expert camera-work, steady understanding of how a story can be told through visuals as well, not only through words. Many shots are so impressive that they will linger with me for a while, I'm sure of it. We also get a few beautiful shots with clear symbolic meanings to them, and most of them are very, very blunt - but somehow ""Hacksaw Ridge"" makes them work. They don't feel pretentious, and everything works so well together. Music is very good, often used, and extremely powerful when it needs to be (the string-heavy theme in the latter part of the movie still sticks with me). <br/><br/>There are elements in this film that can feel tacky and corny. There are the meadows when our protagonist is a child, there is the blunt symbolism, there are monologues/dialogues that are just a little bit too poetic and heavy. All of it tends to stick out at first, but for some reason none of it brings the movie down. In fact, the movie seems better because of them. It's like they took a lot of simple and heavy-handed things we've seen and heard before in movies to the point where they're clichÃ©s, but they made them work for the story. I guess all of it just adds to the charm of old-fashioned film-making that is very noticeable in this movie. <br/><br/>To summarize: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is great. It's old-fashioned, very sentimental and doesn't hold itself back whenever it wants to tell or show you something. All of it works in favor of the movie. Powerful story told in a powerful way. I would recommend this to anyone, especially for those who have been yearning a more personal touch to their war movies, or for people who normally don't enjoy war movies at all. And unlike many other war movies, you leave this film satisfied and inspired. It's weird but it's true. You don't feel beaten down, but instead you're feeling quite hopeful. That's how powerful it is."

Excellent graphics, an amazing cast; the story was top of the line all the way through it.<br/><br/>I had an interest in Hacksaw Ridge from the moment I saw the trailer and I can say the trailer is although amazing, the film is so much better. It started out pretty calm with a brilliant build up on character and back-line story, as things progressed it seem to continually get even stronger. It was complete action and on edge from that moment until then end, an amazing story (based on a true story) completely brought to life. Highly recommended!"
"monstermayhem32","8","5","11","6 November 2016"," Serving and fighting for what is right
","Andrew Garfield plays Desmond doss who is a seventh day Adventist which basically a way of saying he is a pacifist who refuses to use a weapon in war despite his willingness to serve his country. Desmond figures the best way to serve his country is to be a medic after meeting his love interest Dorothy and says something very touching that world seems so determined to tear itself apart with violence that feels that he wants to put part of it back together. Another saying that I feel was rather touching, was when Desmond mentioned while others would be taking lives, he would be saving it. Other aspects that his character deals with is how his beliefs differ from those of his fellow comrades and superiors who think it is foolish of him to want to serve in the military without using a weapon to defend himself despite his bravery, the backstory of Desmond father who served in the First World War war seeing the horrors of violence which turned him into a drunk and why Desmond refused to use a gun. I will say that I found this picture to be one of Mel Gibson finest works and hope he continues to impress."
"paul-allaer","8","5","11","6 November 2016"," ""One more! Help me get one more!""
","""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016 release; 131 min.) is ""a true story"", as we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and his incredible heroism in WWII. As the movie opens, we are right in the middle of the battle of Okinawa, with bodies flying left and right, and in slow-motion. We then shift back to ""Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia"", where we get to know your Desmond and his little brother, along with their deeply religious parents. One day, during a fight with his brother, Desmond hits in in the head with a stone, almost killing him. Then we go ""Fifteen Years Later"" , as America is getting ready for WWII. At this point we're 10-15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is directed by none other than Mel Gibson, making a return from 10 years in Hollywood wilderness. Gibson has been a pariah, and whether that is justified or not, I will leave to others to discuss. One thing is clear, though: the man knows how to make a movie. Here, he finds a combination that suits him just perfectly: religion and violence. The first part of the movie shows us what Doss as a conscientious objector had to endure simply to be able to serve his country, while the second part gives us the Battle of Okinawa in May '45. The parallels between this movie and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" are obvious. Beware, the battle scenes in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" are extensive, and leave nothing to the imagination, making this latest Gibson movie ""bloody good"". The heroism of Doss is nothing short of awe-inducing, and humbling. With each life saved, and running on fumes, Doss keeps praying ""one more! help me get one more!"", wow, just wow. How it is that this man's story hasn't been made into a movie sooner, I have no idea, but better late than never. At the very end of the movie there are a couple of clips, showing Doss accepting the Medal of Honor (the first conscientious objector to do so), and also being interviewed in 2003. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Doss. This movie feels like it was made in another era, and I mean that as a compliment. Kudos to Gibson and the overall production team for a job well done.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati, was pretty close to a sell-out. I think this movie is going to have long legs in the theater as word-of-mouth gets around about this ""Saving Private Ryan""-reminding and overall feel-good if tough WWII drama. If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you will not want to miss this, preferably in the theater as this is the type of epic movie that will lose some of its effectiveness on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"mattthaker","8","5","11","6 November 2016"," A Masterpiece, one of the best war films ever
","The scenes leading up to the initial confrontation of the two armies build suspense by effectively foreshadowing the ensuing carnage. The first battle scene is astounding. Most battle scenes convey a sense of realism; the characters with previous scenes in the movie are just as vulnerable to gunfire and explosions as the extras. The first half is mostly a portrait of Doss' character; the second half reenacts the conditions of the war at Hacksaw Ridge. The camera work is intelligent and the depiction of war violence is convincing. 8/10 The cast includes Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, and Hugo Weaving. Directed by Mel Gibson."

","Kudos to Mr.Gibson for making a stirring and heroic film about the incredible sacrifices of wartime medics in general and, more specifically, the amazing Mr. Doss during the WW II campaign on Okinawa. Andrew Garfield is fantastic in the lead role and the film pulls no punches with the harrowing and horrible ordeals of combat - and rightly so. The movie does get a little heavy-handed at times and the slow motion effects are slightly overdone, but these are minor quibbles. The special and visual effects are impressively done and the cast performs admirably. It all adds up to being one of the best films of the year."

The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud.<br/><br/>First half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.<br/><br/>As is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10"

","This is the 'Saving Private Ryan' of this decade. No it's not star studded like Ron Howard's film is but I think that makes 'Hacksaw Ridge' feel more authentic in a way. While I did enjoy all the major stars in 'Saving Private Ryan' I feel like a film made up of one big name star surrounded by a cast of lesser known actors and actresses let's my mind focus more on the story instead of the people playing the characters. I don't know, maybe that's just me.
I have never a biography or self biography of Desmond Daws or any official documents about the events of what happened at Hacksaw Ridge, so I don't know how true the entire movie is or if they changed any details to make the movie better, but I love this movie! It is a must watch if you love war movies. This has to be on your list of Memorial day or Veterans day movie marathon (if you do that kind if thing) I love turning on AMC or the History Channel and spending the majority of the day on Military Holidays watching war movies and thinking about my Relatives that Served in the Military. Now there is a lot of blood and guts so if your sensitive to that kind if thing, be prepared for that from the get go. There is a pretty sizable degree of Religious overtones so be ready for that too if you are a non Believer in GOD. I am a Baptist so I love the Christian message that the ending sends.

This happened to me, for example, I didn't really drink alcohol, but when I found a girl I liked, I started to drink some wine, not much though. Maybe the difference is that in my case love, one of the strongest emotions, made me change slightly, so it's hard to resist, while in his case there was no love, but he had his principles and his goals which were very important. Maybe that means he was even stronger than love because he had to leave his girl? In any case, that is absolutely incredible.
This guy reminds me a lot of me, except he's even stronger than me.<br/><br/>There is a lot of blood and violence in this movie, but I had the time to look away, so I didn't see too much gross things.<br/><br/>This movie was very emotional, and I had tears on my eyes and tension throughout the whole movie, not just here and there like it is in some movies. It was very interesting and thanks God for all he does.<br/><br/>It is interesting that in war people still save their faith in God and maybe even become stronger, even though you might think that seeing all these torn bodies, torn humans which look like simple organisms might make you think that there's no God, but it seems that's not the case. People's faith becomes even stronger in war. For example like everyone wanted Desmond to pray in the end.

"jrarichards","10","2","3","3 August 2018"," Amazing, magnificent, wonderful, harrowing, beautiful - choose your adjective!
","Mel Gibson has put together what is basically an Australian film, revealing in the extra materials that he is looking for heightened truth to achieve clarity. And indeed, everything here is writ large - from the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains (or convincing Australian substitutes thereof), to the awe-inspiring wonder and purity of the love interest in the film between Desmond Doss (as superbly played by Brit Andrew Garfield) and Dorothy Schutte (played with total commitment by a simply exquisite Teresa Palmer), to the spectacle of the drunken-aggressive-shellshocked apparently-hopeless WWI veteran that is Doss's father stepping back into uniform and pulling himself together to save his son from court-martial; and through to some of the strongest and most trully appalling battle scenes you have ever seen - in what is an amazing and shocking contrast with the earlier part of the film, if only a confirmation of the message about war Doss received from his broken father (here played wonderfully by Hugo Weaving). <br/><br/>And yet, as the credits approach and we see the real-life versions of the characters portrayed in the film, we know that truth is indeed being presented here, a truth that committed Christian Gibson is trying to tell us is also the truth of God - and 7th Day Adventist-conscientious objector Doss would certainly have no doubt about that; and he went to Okinawa refusing to fight or touch a weapon, yet determined to be with his comrades in the absolute heat of battle, and to save lives - which he did indeed do, again and again and again and again. <br/><br/>Seeing the recreation of the Hacksaw Ridge slaughter one might anticipate that literally nobody could get out alive, and - since not every battlefield was fortunate enough to have had its Desmond Doss - a further behind-the-scenes star of this film is of course the one called ""Enola Gay"" - somewhat sad (if inevitable) to think of that given the bravery and heroism in the midst of the slaughter, but slaughter it undoubtedly was. <br/><br/>Ultimately, intolerable slaughter.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the portrayal of Doss's military training is an uncomfortable one for the viewer, yet there are truly magnificent scenes when Officers, Sergeants and men first begin to get an inkling of the man of true, stubbornly steadfast conviction they are dealing with. The way the behaviour begins slightly to change in the direction of first admiration is immaculate acting in and of itself, most especially from Vince Vaughn as Sgt. Howell. Yes, really, this is that Vince Vaughn, and what he produces here is an absolute peak of achievement.<br/><br/>Once again, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" draws inspiration (potentially even divine inspiration) from its utterly amazing subject-matter. Perhaps it would indeed be difficult to make a bad film out of this story. But in the hands of Gibson, some really great actors and special effects guys absolutely going above and beyond anything you can think of, this film is a moving, awe-inspiring, shocking TRIUMPH. Required viewing, if far from easy to view!"

When you look at successful films, notice how they embrace multiple genres, even if it is brief. <br/><br/>This film is no different than those other greats. Acting, cinematography, sound, and story are all positive checks.<br/><br/>You begin watching this film and about 45 minutes through, it switches tones. The transition is brilliant. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson has been in hiding for this particular project and for good reason why. It feels like Gibson's directing pieces. Attention to details and gives you a look into the past and a time that was. <br/><br/>It's well rounded in multiple aspects and most importantly tells a great story. After all, aren't films supposed to be about story telling? Gibson has a knack for it. <br/><br/>OK! Let's stop blowing Gibson. Let's give props to the cast and crew that make this film possible. The cast does an A+ job and spideyman from the better of the Spiderman films, does a phenomenal job! That guy from the Lord of the Rings and The Matrix (Mr. Anderson) also plays the role perfectly. <br/><br/>It is such a well rounded film that I can't rate it lower than a 9! And that is high for me!<br/><br/>Watch the film! It feels like a two part film like Full Metal Jacket. You have before war and during war. Both are equally as entertaining!<br/><br/>With the films that are released now and the scores that are given so freely to make films not seem as bad as they are, this film definitely deserves at least a 9! But don't let me judge for you. Watch and rate yourself. Film often gets rated lower than TV series because of the total amount of time involved to develop characters and to twist a story, but this one provides enough to be a solid 9 with consideration for a 10."

","Yet again, Gibson returns from the shadows to make a great film.<br/><br/>Hollywood hates him for his tirades and crazy antics and religious views and crapping on Jews and other groups, but by God, even minorities and groups of people who might be offended by him, usually have to admit that he is extremely talented.<br/><br/>I've never watched one of his movies that he acted in or directed, that was disliked by many people. Everyone enjoys a Gibson flick. He takes that formula from Braveheart and The Patriot, and hits every note that audiences crave. <br/><br/>He knows how to package action, gore, love, God, and country into nearly every film he puts his name on. Hell, half of them aren't even historically accurate, but whether you like him personally or not, or agree with his views, Gibson makes incredibly good films. They may not even be accurate, but he knows the craft of film making well.<br/><br/>I watched an interview with him on extras from other DVDs, and he goes into his exposure to Spartacus and westerns as a kid, and how they influenced him to carefully craft his own works. Gibson knows how to make epic action films, and gripping dramas, and this one is no exception, even if it comes across as too patriotic or cheesy at times to those outside his personal sphere of comforts and worldviews."

","When I first went to go see this movie in theaters, I didn't have high expectations. I thought it was gonna be just another war movie with a bunch of noise. I was very wrong. First of all this movie is based on a true story and I am shocked I haven't heard of it till now. The flow of the story of the movie is perfect. I love how there is a great balance within the movie, like how it shows Desmond Doss's life before the war, and the romance story was spot on. A man, that lived for what he believe in, and held true to the convictions in his life. This movie is a true heroic film. Desmond Doss was a humble man, and demonstrated the greatest act of love, by sacrificing his life to save others on the battlefield. The music, acting, flow, plot, inspiration, and everything else couldn't have been done better. Love is the most powerful emotion or topic anyone can ever implement in a movie, and though this is a war movie, The story of love is ever so profound in this film. It is a MUST WATCH!"
"davideo-2","9","2","3","4 September 2017"," A daring and inspiring break from the conventional celebration of heroism
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>As World War 2 draws to a close, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) enlists in the military, much to the disdain of his embittered former vet father (Hugo Weaving.) However, he wishes to serve as a medic, and, owing to his religious principles, refuses to bear arms. Initially, he's dismissed as weak and spineless by his comrades and commanding officers, and is even made to serve some time in jail, but on the outbreak of the Battle of Okinawa, he comes to earn respect and admiration from his former deriders, as he risks his life to ferry injured men over enemy lines and to safety, saving many lives.<br/><br/>At a time in his career when he has more credibility behind the camera than in front of it, Mel Gibson has helmed this promising and inspiring tale, that was rich in potential for a big screen dramatisation. Essentially a turning on the head of all the traditional war-time yarns of righteous infliction and gung-ho machismo, this relays a story of incredulous truth, almost in the 'fact is stranger than fiction' league. And, thankfully, it hits all the right notes at just about all the right times.<br/><br/>For a wartime film, it spends surprisingly most of the first half focusing on the human drama unfolding at home and later in the army regiment, as Private Doss is tested for his beliefs by his peers and superiors, giving lead star Garfield the chance to display his dramatic range and capability, and he just about manages to carry the film perfectly. In the later stages, the horror and unrelenting impact of the battleground come terrifyingly to light, in a Saving Private Ryan style portrayal that is just as blood soaked and realistic as Spielberg's film.<br/><br/>Above all else, Gibson has delivered a searing examination of a different type of courage, measured in individual conviction of beliefs and an unwavering moral devotion to them, the sort that probably wouldn't have been appreciated as much in the days of John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart. ****"

","Plot; Based on the story of Desmond Doss, who volunteered for the U.S. Army during World War II despite his personal objections to violence and his refusal to kill or carry a weapon into combat.<br/><br/>Like an actual soldier, Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge hones its craft early on, but it earns its stripes in combat. The first half is important, setting up the circumstances that make us care when the bullets begin to fly, but in truth it's stuff that could've been directed by anyone. It's the second half that could only have been directed by Mel Gibson. Whatever the man's missteps and personal foibles over the years, he's proved himself to be a compelling filmmaker, and never more so than here. Putting us right in the thick of battle, Gibson makes you feel every explosion, hit and near-hit. It's visceral in the best sense of the word. He tiptoes the line between unflinching and excess at times, but never crosses it. What he accomplishes here with a $40 million dollar budget is nothing short of remarkable.<br/><br/>The cast is every bit the director's equal, with fine supporting performances from Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths and a powerhouse turn from Andrew Garfield, absolutely earning his Oscar nomination as Desmond Doss.<br/><br/>War films can be cliché, and there's certainly some of that here, but keeping the compass true north is that the heroics of Desmond Doss need no embellishment. Without carrying a weapon, he stumbled back time and time again into the thick of battle to rescue 75 men. It's the sort of thing that would be eye rolling to even the least cynical person if it weren't completely true. I'm pleased to say Gibson and company have given Doss a film worthy of his actions."
"msbreviews","9","2","3","6 August 2017"," Rating: A
","Wow. That's what I have to say about Hacksaw Ridge, one of the best war movies that I've seen in a long, long time ... Not only a great war film, but also a very profound, compelling and captivating story that turns into something even greater when I realize that it actually happened and that Doss actually is a national hero.<br/><br/>I want to start with Mel Gibson as a director: stick to it, sir! I know that his name isn't properly associated with good things nowadays, but this masterpiece of filmmaking has to change the way people in Hollywood currently look to this underrated director. I actually think he's one of the best directors regarding the near- perfect use of the camera on war-type action scenes and the way he depicts every aspect of the horror, fright and bloodiness that a war has (just check Braveheart). Oscar-worthy directing!<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield ... I'll just assume that the Amazing Spider-Man spoof was a misleading error and I'll absolve you from all that crap. Just stick to more serious and deep movies like this. Another Oscar nomination for Hacksaw Ridge, for sure! What felt a little cheesy at the beginning turned into such an inspiration later in the film, his inhuman belief carried not only himself, but the whole army through Okinawa and Garfield portrays that in such an emotional way ... What a performance!<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also really great: Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss) is a good surprise, I didn't expect him to be as good as he was, Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell) and Sam Worthington (Captain Glover) have performances even more surprising! Everyone is at their top, portraying characters based on real heroes seems to inspire them in a way that makes the actors motivate themselves to inspire us, the audience. They're all just great and believable!<br/><br/>It's a great movie, but I do have two minor issues with it, one with the first act and the other one with the last few minutes of the film. The first act's pacing is really slow and I totally understand that there are characters needing depth and personality, but I still think it's too long and that its not-so-smooth flow could've been far better. From the moment Doss goes to the training camp, that's when the film picks up and takes us to an awesome journey.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end (without spoiling anything of course) the film shows some interviews with the real Desmond Doss and some other real movie characters, as any true story film usually has. My problem is not with that, but with what the director actually decides to end the movie with (aka, before the interviews). Mel Gibson decides that a ""reading path"" is the best ending, but it felt like it ended the movie in a slightly abrupt way and without the characters that we just spent two hours with.<br/><br/>But that's nothing!<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best war films that I've seen probably since Saving Private Ryan (better than Black Hawk Down, in my opinion). Mel Gibson's directing skills are to praise infinitely and Andrew Garfield's emotional performance puts him as a front-runner for an Oscar together with his director. Inspiring story, frightening awesome war scenes, beautifully shot (excellent use of the camera) and a great supporting cast as well. A slow-paced first act and a slightly abrupt ""reading ending"" are nothing when we are discussing a 2h-long movie with such incredible characters.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

","I read the critic reviews before watching this movie and I could tell because it was a guy who based on his religious beliefs was a conscientious objector the critics did not like the main character had a religious undertone, that is their problem. This was actually an excellent movie and it wasn't about religion or war to me, it was a story of a man who wanted to do what he believed was the right thing for him based in what he believed which is all any of us can do. It is hard to say what you will do unless you have walked in someone's shoes, and this movie portrayed how there is more than one way to serve your country and still be true to yourself.<br/><br/>Having served in the military as a Chaplains assistant I met many who questioned their patriotism and their moral or religious beliefs when it comes to war. It is a question society can't answer it is one we each must answer and resolve for ourselves based on what we believe which is the essence of this film. <br/><br/>The acting and cinematography are excellent. This movie is definitely worth watching."
"moore-16811","8","2","3","28 July 2017"," Hacksaw Ridge, an interesting film that will move audiences
","Hacksaw Ridge is an exhilarating 2016 biopic period piece that is set during World War II. This film was directed by Mel Gibson and produced by William D. Johnson and earned Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Film Editing (won), Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing (won). Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) stars as Desmond Doss, an uncomplicated young man from Lynchburg, Virginia whom ends up saving the lives of approximately 75 men during the Battle on Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa Japanwithout ever having to utilize a weapon. This story is not just one that depicts the theme of combat and bravery, as Hacksaw Ridge is much more than a war movie, this film is also a tale of love—love for others, for one's faith, as well as the love for one's country. <br/><br/>While watching Hacksaw Ridge, viewers will gradually become increasingly familiar with Desmond Doss and those that are close to him. The nostalgic feeling that comes across when watching Doss and his brother Hal as rambunctious young boys enjoying activities like climbing in the woods; racing each other; and wrestling, doesn't last long because the audience begins to witness the tensions that are prevalent in the Doss family home. While working in his church Doss rushes to the aid of an injured man outside and transports the man to the hospital and in some ways his life changed, because it is there that he meets and falls in love with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) and realizes he wants to become a medic in the U.S Army. Despite his abusive and alcoholic, father Tom's (Hugo Weaving) objections, Desmond Doss enlists in the army to serve his country as a combat medic. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss's experiences in the army training camp are a test of his will to say the least. Under the command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), it is revealed to Doss's fellow troops that due to his beliefs as a Seventh Day Adventist and his position as a conscientious objector that Doss will not pick up a weapon. The other men in the troop are frustrated with Doss and his perspectives and consequently end up putting Doss through several emotional and physical acts of hazing. In addition to the trauma that Doss experiences from those in training with him, he also experiences difficulties from his commanding officers that result in further obstacles such as a court martial and imprisonment. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge utilizes multiple techniques such as motifs and lighting to convey the film's theme to audiences. Hacksaw Ridge begins with a quote from Isaiah 40:28-31; ""Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Neither faints nor is weary. His understand is unreachable. He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might, He increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utter fall. But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint"". Doss can also be heard stating ""While everyone else will be taking life I'll be saving it"" and ""I don't know how I can live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe"". These statements, along with many other comments and actions allow the film to perpetuate the film's theme of spirituality and a never-ending dedication to one's faith. Hacksaw Ridge also relies on the technique of lighting to exhibit the film's theme. When the movie begins viewers are watching scenes in darker sepia-like tones, and these tones begin to diminish when Desmond Doss evolves into a young man and enters the military. Later in the film when Doss goes to Hacksaw Ridge the lighting tones become darker and more infused. The lighting techniques here demonstrate how Desmond Doss's dispirited experiences while witnessing and being subjected to abuse as a child and the perils of Hacksaw Ridge placed him in uncomfortable situations and tested his faith—furthermore, this special utilization of lighting shows how Doss may have been happier in the middle of the film when he was in love and working on things that were important to him like enlisting in the army and becoming a combat medic. Although this film contains multiple themes, the theme that is consistent throughout the plot line is that one that is spiritual. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, and I think this has a lot to do with both of the films being more than just a war movie—they are war movies with a difference. Both Hacksaw Ridge and Saving Private Ryan drop their viewers in the midst of war; however, they both convey the story of peaceful men dedicated to their country and a greater cause. The theme of these two films hit home with with viewers because the lead characters are driven by great valor; the love for their families, and their country—these films truly push ahead with a bullet to the chest in more ways than one. <br/><br/>If you're into period pieces, love stories, biopics, war movies, action films; or just in the mood for an interesting story to watch, then you just may enjoy Hacksaw Ridge."
"OllieSuave-007","10","2","3","27 July 2017"," Outstanding war movie from Mel Gibson!
","This is intense and gripping film about a man named Desmond Doss who wants to enlist in the U.S. Army as a combat medic, but refuses the requirement to bare arms due to his religious and pacifist views. As a result, he becomes a conscientious objector and joins his fellow soldiers behind enemy lines at the gruesome Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>This film explicitly depicts the trials and obstacles Doss went through during his refusal to pick up a firearm, from being tormented by his fellow soldiers to being court-martialed by his superiors. This plot line was depicted with much drama and suspense, which grabs at your attention and was very exciting to watch. This served as a good lead-in to the powerful war-scenes, depicted with bloodshed, fallen comrades, fierce battles and edge-of-your-seat adrenaline. It certainly gives you a gripping feeling as you see the opposing sides fight, and the parts showing the fallen were very emotional; I especially liked the part where a soldier, after getting both of his legs blown off, pleaded with Doss not to leave him on the battlefield, telling him that he has kids.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's direction made this a fast-paced movie with nonstop suspense and drama, with a good dose of humor and action mixed in. The acting was superb - with every character relating well to the audience. The ups and downs relationships Doss had with his soldiers and superiors throughout the story were well-developed, and the heroic acts of sacrifice and selfless acts of rescue were touching.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of war movies due to the gruesome and distressing nature of them; however, I can say this movie is very well made with its historical context and strong message of faith, humility and selflessness. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>Grade A"

But Against all odds, Prvt Doss, as a medic for the US Army, did serve his country. He did it honorably, earning the respect and gratitude from his superiors and the men he served along with and did it without the use of firearms.<br/><br/>With God by his side, a Bible in his pocket and his loving wife waiting at home, he not only evaded the enemy in difficult terrain, called Hakuso Ridge, he saved many US soldiers lives including a couple of Japanese soldiers. earning him the congressional medal of honor."
"Floated2","9","2","3","21 July 2017"," Based on true events lives up to the hype
","Hacksaw Ridge isn't simply dramatic licence. Directed by Mel Gibson, this film is based very closely on a true story, which is about a conscientious objector who joined the army but refused to fight or even touch a firearm, enduring the scorn and physical bullying of his fellow soldiers before shocking them all with an astonishing feat of bravery during the WWII battle of Okinawa in the summer of 1945. <br/><br/>Having no knowledge of the initial true events, one had very little expectations and could not critic based on the reality of the film's depicts. In this respect, the film is very much of two halves. The first is rather quaint, almost like a Hallmark film in its sentimentality. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is a fervently religious family man and a disappointment to his alcoholic First World War veteran father.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge gets better as the film progresses where in the first half, it is more of an introduction to the characters and the motives, then once Doss is enrolled into the war, the energy level and everything appears to elevate. Featuring some of the greater battle scenes in war films, where they did not hold back in some gruesome violence and depiction is another reason as to why this film is as gripping and engaging. <br/><br/>Very well directed and stylish looking that it makes it all more than worth the experience. Having received several Oscar nominations, it is understand as to why, especially for best director for Mel Gibson and best leading performance for Andrew Garfeild. Hacksaw Ridge is undoubtedly a very strong film and perhaps a future classic war drama."

I had a little trouble seeing Vaughan as an army sergeant but he pulls it off and the film flows at a decent pace. <br/><br/>The war scenes when they go over Hacksaw are brutal and explosive, I was gripped. <br/><br/>A must see this film."

","Love him, or hate him, there is no denying Mel Gibson is an artist when it comes to directing movies. Like Tom Brady, you can hate him, but you cannot deny he is one of the greatest of all-time. Hacksaw Ridge is no exception. This movie is fantastic from start to finish. It's a shame Mel Gibson's past haunts him (for right or wrong), because we need his movies. This movie may have also revitalized Andrew Garfield's career, because after two mediocre Spider-man movies, I was afraid he would drift off into irrelevance. The acting, writing, and directing were all phenomenal, but a characteristic that is often over-looked is cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is incredible. The battle scenes in this are also amazing. I never been in war, but if it is anything like this movie it is truly hell on earth. Mel Gibson has never been hesitant when it comes to brutality and gore, and this movie is no different. I felt like I almost needed to take cover behind my couch watching this, as bullets were going to fly out of the TV. There are also some truly suspenseful moments as well. This movie is an A+, best war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"", and I felt many aspects in this film surpassed it. Whether you think Hollywood should forgive Mel or not, that's another debate, but it's a fact that this man is one of the most talented movie makers out there. Hacksaw Ridge is raw evidence of this."
"christophershobris","10","2","3","3 July 2017"," An Emotionally Powerful Film
","This film blew me away in all the right ways. I admit I cried a few...well more then a few times. What sells it for me is the superb acting by 4 people in particular. Andrew Garfield was outstanding, a completely different role and a real showcase of skill compared to the disappointing Amazing Spider-Man series. He portrays Doss beautifully in a way I think he would approve of. Watching him go through the struggles to become what he is and staying true to who you are and what you believe was what made me quite emotional throughout. Vince Vaughn, goodness what a surprise. He needs to be in more roles like this rather than the stale, run-of-the-mill comedies he often stars in. This is an entirely different Vince Vaughn that we rarely get to see. I was at first legitimately intimidated by his performance in a good way. As the film went on you see he's not a bad guy. As a whole Vaughn does a great job portraying such a complex character, that I thought he would never be able to pull off, I'm glad to say, he surprised me. Sam Worthington, going from the cocky but respectable Jake Sully in Avatar, to this powerful performance. He isn't in the much but when he is it is a delight to see. And lastly, Hugo Weaving, again like Worthington he isn't in it much, but he adds some mustard to this spicy film, and is different from what we are use to. Not make-up riven, just classic and wonderful on-screen acting. The film as a whole is beautifully done and Mel Gibson shows he can direct. Say what you will about the man, but he can direct. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is heartwarming, and the on-screen action is riveting. What else is their to say, I loved this film, and teaches self-worth in a way no other film has done. That's why it gets a perfect score, great film! Now to grade: Acting: A+ Music: A, Effects: A, Directing: A+, Story/Plot: A+. Overall: A+"

","Amazing film, from a brilliant cinematography, to an incredible reflection of emotions. Everything about this film is incredible, my only critique is very gory and the production did not hold back, but on the other hand this helps to created a realsistic depiction of real world events, and the nature of war. The message of this film was also really pertinent, staying true to or values and morals, even in times of hardship. Love is also a strong theme. All rounded top class film"

","In the midst of World War 2 young man, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is prepared to give his all for his men, without touching a gun.<br/><br/>This movie surprised me, it was a breath of fresh air. Going in this movie you must understand that it's brutal and savage, it depicts war at it's fullest and not just the physical pain but emotional too. We follow Desmond a real life war hero who follow the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"". We see him struggle to get a girl and finally to be one of the brave warriors who will fight at Hacksaw Ridge. He undergoes brutal training and even becoming and outcast among his fellow soldiers. The scenes depicted here are hearth-breaking and hard to watch. The movie is excellently shot, with great visual effects and beautiful angles. Cinematography was breath taking and the acting was phenomenal. Andrew Garfield surprised me greatly, he brought so much power to this character and I must say I liked him better here then in Silence. Mel Gibson gives so much to this movie, he let's these actors express themselves, the emotion is dripping from the movie. Hugo Weaving...I have not seen him in a long time and he left me speechless, I was taken in this so much. Teresa Palmer was also really good, maybe one of the best performances of her carrier. The war itself is almost horror like, the way it's shot and depicted is scary. You can feel the tension in every scene, I was on edge the whole movie. This is one of the best films last year, if you haven't watched it go and give it a try, If you like war movies or drama movies in general you will love this one."

","Seeing and experiencing films such as HACKSAW RIDGE during Memorial Day is a strong reminder of the honor we owe to the men and women who have fought to protect us. Though wars continue, around the globe and within our strife-ridden country, the horror of war is ever present, but the courage and sacrifice veterans have made and continue to make deserve our honor.<br/><br/>HACKSAW RIDGE is a very fine film about the battle of WW II on Okinawa as written for the screen by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight and direct with great sensitivity by Mel Gibson. This, as we all know, is a true story of a young conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce/Andrew Garfield) who entered training for WW II having had a terrifying experience as a child with his brother Hal (Roman Guerriero/Nathaniel Buzolic), enduring the PTSD alcoholic father (a brilliant performance from Hugo Weaving), growing up as a 7th Day Adventist, and how he adjusts to military life in training, nears court marshal because of his refusal to carry a gun, and ends up in Okinawa where unarmed he save the lives of 75 fellow GIs. Thankfully the script allows the first half of the film show the character development of Desmond, introducing the men in his company (Luke Pegler, Luke Bracey, Nico Cortez, Farass Dirani, Jim Robison, Goran D. Klet, Damien Thomlinson, Sam Worthington, a brilliant Vince Vaughan, and more), and Desmond's love interest (Teresa Palmer) and his mother (Rachel Griffiths).<br/><br/>The fighting action is brilliantly depicted and well photographed by Simon Duggan – and of course directed by Gibson. Rupert Gregson-Williams supplies the very appropriate musical score. The film is violent to watch: war is violent to watch. The message of Desmond Doss's honor is underlined by images at the end of the film. This is a very fine film – particularly on Memorial Day."

"iquine","8","2","3","18 May 2017"," Unique WWII Story
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>I've seen many a war movie and the core of this story is original. This is about a man who enlists in the army yet refuses to fire or touch a firearm. He nobly just wants to be a medic. For a movie with a main character who is anti-violence, this movie is awfully bloody and highly graphic. I had to avert my eyes multiple times. As a comparison, I didn't bat an eye during Apocalypse Now nor Private Ryan. Hacksaw Ridge is, as you guessed it, a tall ridge. A mammoth cliff ridge on the edge of water. US troops approaching below and the Japanese hold the high ground. There is a cargo net the soldiers must scale to get up there. Whether this is a flaw in the movie, it is a true story, or a true flaw by the Japanese, why didn't the Japanese just cut the cargo net down.? Without giving too much away, a long battle ensues. The gun-less main character, dubbed the ""conscientious objector"", performs many heroics during the battle. Overestimated everyone that mocked his integrity during basic training. Overall, it is a high quality production with much more bloody gore than really needed. Vince Vaughn as a drill instructor initially took me out of the movie flow but he actually settled in nicely but he was still Vince Vaughn. The movie also had its share of ubiquitous war movie and romance scenes but it was fairly unique for the genre and highlighted American patriotism."

It's screenplay and scenario are perfect and ""fresh"", but there are two other things that made ""hacksaw ridge"" so good in my opinion : firstly the deep and complete character development and secondly the excellent acting performance from Andrew Garfield ( something that I wasn't really expecting , to be honest ).

"kitsuneiyama","10","2","3","14 April 2017"," A Work of Art that Somehow avoided the Clichés
","It was bloody.<br/><br/>It was violent.<br/><br/>And it's the best Christian movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It starts out with a southern, Virginian boy climbing up a cliff with his brother. It's sweet and innocent and normal. Five minutes later, he almost kills his brother. Throughout this, it's revealed through easy dialogue that the boys' father is a drunk. Skip forward fifteen years, and the boy is now a full grown man. He falls in love with a nurse while he tries to further his own medical knowledge. Just as the movie turns into a cliché, he leaves her and enters training. The catch- he cannot touch a rifle. He suffers, obviously. Bullied and beaten, he still stays. And he goes to the front. It's a bloody, heart wrenching place.<br/><br/>Unlike most war movies, it doesn't focus on politics. It is not a hateful movie. It's not about race or superiority. It's about him somehow surviving and saving seventy something people over the course of a few days. It's through sheer willpower and God. They mention maybe one verse from the bible. There are no scenes where he tries to evangelize to people.<br/><br/>But the message is just as strong and clear.<br/><br/>God can do great things. <br/><br/>Even if you aren't Christian, I still say you should watch it. It shows an amazing story of a soldier, who looked beyond race and life. He saved men, even Japanese! It's shocking and it's striking, macabre images compelling a strong story that is not diminished or brushed over with frustrating characters or irritable clichés. It's a bright star in the world of puddling movies. I will admit, the romance with him and his fiancé is a bit cliché. But it balances out with the bleak reality of war. It is not an honorable place. It is a place that should not exist. It's a glorified killing ground that hurts many. <br/><br/>But he still stays. And he saves. <br/><br/>And that, is something I have never seen."

","""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a very inspirational and gripping war film directed by Mel Gibson. It shows what strong faith and staying true to what you believe can do. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is is a WWII Army Medic who serves in the Battle of Okinawa but refuses to carry a weapon because of his faith. He faces many challenges because of his faith even before he hits the battlefield. This makes for very interesting story. Along with a great story-line, this film is filled with action, drama, and a great cast. With Vince Vaughn playing the role of Sgt. Howell, Hugo Weaving playing the part of Tom Doss, and Andrew Garfield playing the part of Desmond Doss, the cast was just about perfect. In the end, this film is very inspirational and I encourage anyone to see it but if you like good war films, especially historical ones, I highly recommend this one."
"wispershot","Null","2","3","11 February 2017"," mixed reception
","So i just watched this movie last night. After 'We were soldiers' which was very historically accurate except for the glorious charge ending. I got the impression that this was going to be another historically accurate movie. Nothing can be further from the truth. I watched this movie with a buddy of mine and we both had the feeling of 'ooh right that guy is gonna die', 'what the hell is this call of duty?'. The only 2 parts that are accurate to a certain degree is the trail, but he was not saved by a letter from his father and the suppressing fire when attacking the pillbox. I am really struggling to understand why this movie has such positive reviews.This movie was 10 years in the making and it feels pretty bland. Americans shooting down entire Jap squads FROM THE HIP. Spider nerd kicking back grenades. There is even a scene where Vince Vaungh is being pulled on a blanket shooting back at enemies (call of duty anybody). I think the only reason this movie is getting positive scores is because it portrays certain American values to the limit. So thing that never happened: - Okinawa was not their first battle: guys are seen throwing grenades like a 2 year veteran; this would have worked if they showed their previous missions in Gaum and Leyte. - Doss by this point was already accepted by the soldiers: movies shows this as a grinding process of being accepted. - He was not saved by a magical letter from his father - This movie does show in a special way what shrapnel does to people - Movie does not show what Doss did the following days ( read about in on Wikipedia) just shows him saving a lot of people in one time(apparently this was done by Gibson as not to confuse people?) - Soldiers except for the ones that he did really save feel like disposable men All in all i only found 2 parts of the movie as previously mentioned that are partly accurate ( he does pray to help me get one more) Apparently this movie got a 10 min standing ovation at the end. At the end of the movie me and my buddy were already looking trough the internet trying to find if this movie was by any means accurate. That being said. I have mayor respect for all personnel that served and continue to do so. thank you for your service. This movie just left me with a pretty mixed feeling. I think if you're not a American you will look at this movie with different eyes than the America F*** yeah feeling this movie gives you."

The main character could have chosen not to enlist but his love for his country and his belief in God was a conviction at its best combination since we must admit it was a miracle he was able so save so many lives.

Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor, really deserved a movie like this. The teaching, the excellent shots and the emotions the movie leaves us, are fabulous.

","Some people are complaining that this movie is a load of liberal bull crap, but I think they misunderstood.

If he had predicted that he would end up on the battlefield, I think he may not have made this promise.

Andrew Garfield is surprisingly convincing as Doss, with Sam Worthington at his best as Captain Clover, among others. It takes a little time to get a hold of the plot but once you do, it matures with minor aberrations and does justice to the story. Mel Gibson helms the plot well and cinematography is realistic and keeps you hooked you to the scenes. The background score is not great, but gives adequate support to the film.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","1","1","8 March 2019"," A brutal look at the true cost of being a conscientious objector during war.
","For many years, Mel Gibson has been at the center of controversies and other unwelcome attention-grabbing incidents. While this normally kills any actor's chances of reviving their careers, Gibson has instead managed to remain somewhat unscathed by retreating into his other skill: directing. As we've seen from some of his other directorial efforts, he is skilled behind the lens, even if many themes remain the same. From Braveheart (1995) to The Passion of the Christ (2004), Gibson has a tendency to be pretty brutal in the imagery he brings to the screen. Granted, this is partly due to the semi-factual source material.<br/><br/>In his latest work after a long hiatus, Gibson brings us the brutality that is World War II. Hacksaw Ridge takes some time to get to its emotional center, but the unfortunate side effect of this is a series of characters that feel almost comical in their exaggerations. From Andrew Garfield's goofily grinning Desmond T. Doss to Hugo Weaving's alcoholic Tom Doss, the reality of war easily sets in once Desmond is allowed to deploy to the Pacific theatre and ""fight"" with his fellow man, attempting to do what no one else is willing to: save more lives than he ends.<br/><br/>The brutality of Hacksaw Ridge is clearly portrayed by Gibson's directing, most of the time being a bit over the top. Partly because everything in this film seemed overly exaggerated, it's almost hard to take it very seriously. Sure, the religious themes intertwined with the duty of going to war were an interesting combination and the real-life story of this human savior was inspiring; but at the end of the day, the other aspects of the film seemed to lessen these impacts.<br/><br/>A brutal look at the true cost of being a conscientious objector during war, I give Hacksaw Ridge 3.5 stars out of 5."
"TheDreadedChampion2019","7","1","1","8 March 2019"," Gibson gets the job done in his first English language film since BRAVEHEART
","Mel Gibson returns with HACKSAW RIDGE. It tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a man who refused to even touch a weapon, who despite this, volunteered to serve as a medic in WWII and saved the lives of 75 to 100 men at Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Japan. He won the medal of honor and the deep respect of all his brothers in arms. It's a very moving and inspiring story, perfectly tailored to the sensibilities of Gibson as a filmmaker. In this film, He revisits the themes that we have come to know in each of his works. As with Braveheart, and Passion before it, HACKSAW RIDGE is a sacrificial love story. One man's love is tested and perfected through great suffering. Through the violence he finds redemption...Its obvious Mel Gibson is trying to reach that same audience that responded so strongly to The Passion. The violence is there, the biblical imagery is there, the higher spiritual plane is there, it's all there. Yet even though it gets the job done, it is certainly not a flawless film and doesn't quite reach the artistic peaks of his last two efforts...My biggest issue with this movie is how it doesn't try to break the mold with the characterizations. All of Desmond's fellow soldiers are stock characters. You have the funny drill sergeant. The guy with the New York accent. The guy with the funny nickname. You never really get to know these characters. They're just cliches. Another thing was with the war scenes, which are actually the highlight of the film. Yet, stylistically, it's admittedly a little strange with all the guys constantly flying through the air, i'ts a little over the top. Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers were prime examples of gritty, realistic, and involving WW2 films. And they had real characters with nuance and personality. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring true story with some brutal and well-directed war sequences, but with a lot of cliches. Now even though the movie works within the confines of conventions we've seen, it still manages to move you, which is what matters most. So overall I recommend it. I would've liked a little more grit and nuance with the characters but I Think with the audience they were trying to reach, the choices they made are somewhat understandable."

"johnyskar","9","1","1","24 November 2018"," A Unique Point of View at War
","Before i watched the movie i was hesitating because i expected another probably boring War Movie, that is because we get so many of them that it's hard for some to stand out and shine as great and not just decent. Now this one is something different. First half is not even about the battlefield but the preparation for it and the weird character in Private Doss who has his own beliefs and principals. Less or more, most of us can relate by comparing them with our own in any subject or way.<br/><br/>You have your typical bullying from the tough guys, the struggles and obstacles so he will quit but his will to contribute is admirable to the point i find it somewhat questionable while he is building a life with the girl he loves and the refusal to grab a weapon may be respected but not having a way to defend yourself in the battlefield is on the edge of becoming stupidity instead of fulfilling a promise.<br/><br/>Second half starts with a blast very fast and is action packed and presents the war for what it is. Raw, Gory and cruel. Between all that Desmond is acting as a guardian angel for his men, even for some of the opponents. Just being a good person. He is nothing less of a hero, and while watching i was wondering if it is based on a real life story since i didn't research the movie just remembered it as a name and from the oscars list. To confirm my thoughts, the ending and the real life clips make me respect and admire this man even more.<br/><br/>I think all actors delivered nicely and Vince Vaughn was great in such a serious role. Palmer's Dorothy was also a nice and understandable person very sympathetic to the viewer. Good job from all parts included with great scenes, hard to watch images and realistic backgrounds and combat interactions.

With many powerful death scenes and attention to detail in it's recreation of the 40's as well as various makeups and stunt coordination through it's many battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, haunting war movie that shows the tragedy and danger of war, but also hope in an unlikely hero who is a medic on the battlefield and also savior without firing a single shot!"
"anselmdaniel","8","1","1","17 May 2018"," Enthralling war story
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss as a pacifist Marine medic in the Pacific Theater of World War 2. The story completely follows Desmond Doss' story as a teenager to the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge creates a compelling story for the audience to follow. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss magnificently. As a character that abstains from violence, Andrew Garfield displays that division in Desmond Doss well. The story also gives hints to the damage The Great War had done to Desmond Doss' father played by Hugo Weaving. Its scenes such as these that elevate the movie above being a typical war movie. The division between Doss and the rest of the marines in boot-camp is interesting to watch. One could understand why the marines believed Doss to be dead-weight in the company. It was relieving to watch them realize that courage takes many forms than only active battle.<br/><br/>The war scenes in the movie do not hold much back. This movie absolutely earns its R rating with the high level of violence depicted in the Battle of Okinawa. Many of the brutal Japanese tactics can be seen in the movie with the directing capturing a lot of the terrible deaths in the movie. The movie's gore can be too much to handle for some but anyone looking for an authentic depiction should watch this movie.<br/><br/>There are some strange choices in this movie with the reason I am speculating to help the narrative. During boot-camp, the drill sergeant is one of Doss' critics. It seemed that he would only be a drill instructor, but he joins the men in battle which does not appear to make sense. I thought military drill instructors do not join the troops into battle.<br/><br/>The movie in general is well directed and well edited. The movie uses its effects with great use in how many scenes the audience cannot tell immediately that it is computer generated.<br/><br/>Overall Hacksaw Ridge is not only a good war movie, but a great movie. One should watch it to appreciate the real life story of Desmond Doss.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","1","16 May 2018"," Mel Gibson returns to his directing skills in a deeply inspiring war epic.
","Desmond Doss is an American hero that I wish I had heard of before seeing ""Hacksaw Ridge."" This deeply brave and loving patriot was a true Christian who believed in non-violence, therefore refusing to even touch a weapon during WW II, instead using his medical skills to help save wounded soldiers during battle. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a superbly crafted war epic with intense direction from Mel Gibson who crafts powerfully realistic war battles that rival any war film ever made besides maybe ""Saving Private Ryan."" The editing and visual effects of these disturbing spectacles in tremendous. Andrew Garfield, while clearly giving it his best in the lead performance, felt a little forced to me. His southern accent was a little too much and I feel that maybe he wasn't the right choice to lead this film. Despite this, he gives a decent performance and leads the film well. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is powerful in these sense that it's deeply inspiring and shines a light on one of the few beautiful stories during the brutal war on Japanese soil. This is a terrific American film about a hero who doesn't get enough recognition as he deserves in the American public life."
"neil-476","9","1","1","15 May 2018"," First rate true story
","Desmond Doss joins the US Army after Pearl Harbour, but refuses to touch guns. But he sees combat in Okinawa as a medic, and perhaps he isn't the coward his fellow recruits assumed he was.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson directs this dramatisation of Desmond Doss' early life and army experiences, culminating in his experiences at Okinawa. These turn out to be utterly extraordinary, except that the real-life Doss and some of his contemporaries appear at the end of the film to drive home that this is actually all true.<br/><br/>The first section of the film shows Doss' troubled home life (with a superb performance by Hugo Weaving as his war-torn disciplinarian father), followed by boot camp and the opprobrium he attracts as a conscientious objector, leading to a Court Martial, where salvation comes from an unexpected direction. Though lengthy, it always engages. <br/><br/>Among the extensive supporting cast, I would single out a luminously lovely Teresa Palmer as Doss' love interest, and Vince Vaughan as boot camp Sergeant Howell, showing that he actually can act. <br/><br/>But Andrew Garfield simply IS the gentle but steely Desmond Doss in a performance which blends gentleness and strength with religious conviction and a joy for life. Garfield has always been good, but here is a performance of genuine stature.<br/><br/>The combat sequences which occupy the final third of the film show what a good director Gibson is, especially with action. They give a very strong impression - feeling, even - of what it must have been like to have death screaming down at you without any idea that it would ever abate. This section is often schockingly graphic: think Saving Private Ryan, only more so. And like, I guess, reality, the shock begins to wear off and all that's left is violence, weariness, and grief at the loss of friends.<br/><br/>While being clearly anti-war, this is also done entertainingly well, a contradiction which concerns me somewhat. But before the ""war as entertainment"" vs ""anti-war message"" battle breaks into fisticuffs, Doss' achievements start to come to the fore, and mightily overpower everything else.<br/><br/>Though strong in content and, perhaps, containing elements which mirror Gibson's own rocky road in recent years, this is an excellent and worthwhile film."
"deloudelouvain","9","1","1","12 May 2018"," One of the best war movies ever.
","This movie deserves it's high rating totally. I'm just flabbergasted when I read reviews from people that score it the lowest possible. How the hell can you score this movie with a one? Seriously, are those people ever satisfied? A one means to me that it is one of the worst movies you ever saw. So to me that means those reviewers barely watch any movies at all. Hacksaw Ridge is not only based on a true story, from a 'soldier' that clearly deserves a medal by going to war without touching a gun but by saving alot of lives. He deserves that medal more than any other soldier that had to kill for having the honor to receive a medal. Andrew Garfield did a wonderful job playing the character of Desmond Doss. In fact, as an atheist I hate everything about God and religion, but in this movie I looked passed it because the vision of Doss that you have to save people instead of killing them is a thing that can only applaud. Every war is stupid, and Mel Gibson did a great job to make this clear in this brilliant movie. With sometimes very hard to watch scenes, but it was a cruel war so you should show those atrocities to make everyone understand what war really is. The whole cast of Hacksaw Bridge did a great job, from actors to editors, it's just one of the better war movies I ever saw. Deep respect for Desmond Doss, and that comes from a guy that would never go to a war, not from cowardness but from believing wars are just a tool from the so-called 'powerful' to control the world."

","My father was a WWll veteran who was wounded in the line of duty and received military honors when he died. There's no doubt in my mind he would have loved this epic war flick. I, on the other hand, hardly ever watch these type movies. Basically, I avoid them, at least to some degree. Maybe it's the blood and gore. This film had more than its fair share of it - so be warned. <br/><br/>This is an epic biographical sketch of Desmond Doss, a man who saved the lives of other soldiers and was the first to receive Medals of Honor while at the same time refusing to carry a weapon in combat.<br/><br/>Enough cannot be said of the entire cast and crew behind this film. Hacksaw Ridge is probably the finest war movie there is."

The movie just shows fantastic footage from an actual real-life event. It's dark, violent, romantic, all in one. Garfield has started his career to a long road that leads to huge success, and he deserves all the praise that this movie can get.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are stunning; Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast that made Mel Gibson's smash hit just so incredible to watch. <br/><br/>The story is wonderfull.

It's real and it's gore but war is real and these men fought the hard fight and it frustrates me when critics sit behind their computers and tear movies like this apart. <br/><br/>This movie has the stomach to pack a punch to the audience and it's one of the few war movies that really leaves you speachless at the end. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson has done an amazing job and we are so lucky to be able to see what the men and women went through for us."

","The action was true to form as a Mel Gibson directed film. From the research I have done looks like a fairly accurate representation of what happened. The usual Hollywood exaggeration aside many true to life stories. There are a large number of 10 star ratings and a number of 1 star reviews. This always amazes me that you can have that disparity. Then I realized the10 star ratings were those who were truly moved by the movie.while the 1 star ratings were those that thought the movie should somehow be a documentary with real footage exclusively. One genius self proclaimed vet of multiple wars had a problem with the cargo net used to ascend the ridge being in his view as not at all plausible. Well turns out there are photos of the real Doss on the ridge with, wait for it,,,,, a cargo net, albeit not near as high as the movie cliff.<br/><br/>This was a great movie for those of the Christian faith and a very good movie for those that like action and heroism in a war setting. The acting was very strong, directing, pace and back stories were also good. I try and use reviews and trailers to pick what I watch. It is becoming more difficult to do when you have reviewers that either had no clue what movie they were about to see or believe they somehow have their own story that is so much better.
Hard to believe that a winner of 2 Oscars is a 1 star movie.(not my rating ..others)"
"ElPresidenteObamame","8","1","1","24 January 2018"," Good movie with a flawed script
","Honestly, I've never seen such a hard sell of so many overtly cornball moments. Although the movie makes efforts to convince I was rolling my eyes throughout the first part of the film, in particular anytime Desmond Doss talked about why he refused to carry a weapon or was seen quietly contemplating his bible. These aww-shucks moments were too numerous when coupled with the overly saccharine love story. I was left perplexed by the first part of the movie to be honest, it was basically Leave It To Beaver levels of 1950's white male delusions coupled with off the wall christian cult blathering. BUT just when I was ready to give up on the movie they start killing each other, and by they I mean Japanese and American soldiers, which really makes it all worth watching. And frankly this is what Mel Gibson is good at, depicting violence in all its cinematic glory. <br/><br/>As far as the style and quality of the filmmaking, considering mostly the visual aspects, I found it interesting. It was a great though not super great movie in this regard. I would say that it was very fluid and artistically done, but very fake as well. This is like a happy memory of a time you pretty much forgot everything else about. <br/><br/>All in all I was entertained by it in different ways."

I, as is my way, will not say too much about the plot, but suffice to say, though it is a bit of a slow burner, by the end i felt exhausted and in floods of tears.<br/><br/>I am sure there were many heroic deeds done at the time, but to see what this young man did was amazing.<br/><br/>If you are in a mood for a grown-up movie, and can handle the graphic nature of war (very well depicted here), then you need to look no further than this very moving movie."

","This could easily have become an edgy kind of war movie. However, I feel that this is personally one of the best movies since Saving Private Ryan. And yes I know thats a big statement. We get the in-depth characters that we need and it give me chills down the spine to watch Weavings magnificent performance as a vet. It's thrilling, edgy and nothing but exciting to watch. Mel Gibson once again does fantastisc as a director and shows Hollywood that he is an excellent film maker!<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is brilliant and overall the entire cast is brilliant.

"Mr-Mingz","8","1","1","14 December 2017"," A great retelling of an inspiring story
","I was very impressed by the direction considering the large gap between productions Mel Gibson taken on and directed. I feel the screenplay really captured the atmosphere in a platoon you would expect from a soldier who doesn't want to carry firearms into battle.
I did feel that Andrew Garfield maybe wasn't the best choice for the role and I hadn't even heard of Pvt Doss before this. The lack of funding may have contributed to this and I guess the family members of the real Pvt Doss were happy enough so go figure.
Hugo Weaving however, was brilliant, and it took me to the middle point of the feature to realise it was Hugo Weaving.
The biggest surprise was seeing Vince Vaughn in a serious war movie...he makes a few jokes towards the latter half....but he actually pulls it off surprisingly well.
Sam Worthington brought nothing to his role and might aswell have not been there.
Being a thrilling, dramatic and story-telling war, I do feel we were not given enough character development for his fellow comrades besides the 10 minutes or so during his introduction to the platoon. I feel this is crucial in gripping war movies. The movie lasts longer than 2 hours as it is...but still.
The other thing that was missing was a lot more intensity. There were really 2 scenes or so which really had you on the edge of your seat yet the set design for the battlegrounds were created incredibly well so it was a shame not to make better use."
"grantss","8","1","1","14 December 2017"," Powerful drama
","The true story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who, at the Battle of Okinawa, won the Medal of Honor for his incredible bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. We see his upbringing and how this shaped his views, especially his religious view and anti-killing stance. We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army and trying to become a medic. Finally, we see the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>A very powerful story. Shows that bravery and heroism in wartime doesn't necessarily involve fighting, killing or even carrying a weapon. The fact that it is true makes it even more inspirational.<br/><br/>Not flawless though. The setup - Doss's childhood, WW2 civilian life and Army training are handled a bit clumsily at times. Certain event sequences feel a touch contrived, or lacking in detail, and some aspects seem TOO detailed. The Army's attempts to get rid of him seem overstated (though that might be just me watching the movie through a 21st century lens).<br/><br/>Moreover, there is a sense of predictability and inevitability about it all - you know how it's all going to turn out. You know he will get to Okinawa, and you want the movie to get to that part of his life as soon as possible. By that measurement, the setup was too long.<br/><br/>However, the clumsiness and duration of the setup is more than overcome by the intensity and grittiness of the action on Okinawa. I can't think of a longer, more sustained, more intense, piece of war action in cinema. Incredibly realistic, and graphic, with no empty bravado.<br/><br/>The scenes at the end close the loop well on what was set out in the first half of the movie. Quite an emotional ending.<br/><br/>Overall, well worth watching."

"mahirehman","10","1","1","27 November 2017"," Phenomenal - A Genuine Piece of History
","Hacksaw Ridge is by far the most visceral, raw and emotional piece of historical/drama film in portraying World War 1 & 2. It is one that is rare, unusual and makes you question the capacity of human compassion and consciousness. <br/><br/>By far the most talented and finest piece of acting (up-to-date) by Andrew Garfield, who plays Desmond Doss - a Conscientious Objector or 'Conscientious Co-operator'. Drawing to the middle and ending of the film Doss is seen to gain respect and honour for his selflessness and compassion, in comparison to his mistreatment and of him being ridiculed and beaten by his fellow soldiers during his training. The iconic line (and sequence) of 'Lord please, help me get one more'gives insight into the humanistic qualities of one man willing to fight and save others when hope seems lost.<br/><br/>The constant ambush of graphically violent scenes, illustrate the essence of the 'hell-on-Earth' environment during World War 1 & 2, whilst incorporating a balance of suspense and slight fear during a scene in which Desmond finds himself entering the tunnels in which the Japanese have occupied.<br/><br/>OVER DEFINITELY, A MUST WATCH."
"sudhakaranakhilan","8","1","1","24 November 2017"," Outstanding true event!
","HACKSAW RIDGE Mel Gibson<br/><br/>That was the moment when Desmond Doss pick up the gun in the last part of the movie, the audience just banged with the truth that he is not going to use it. Ya, that's true and we are also felt the righteousness in the climax of the movie were the medic Doss just hold the gun to save his superior not to encounter his enemies. It was an exceptional war film from the maestro of violence (at some point) and the veteran filmmaker of reality. That can be also seen in Brave Heart, Apocalypto, Passion of the Christ etc. were he just going through the utmost level of human emotions, basically his sufferings. He went across the unbelievable aspects of the real life happenings so that the viewer feels some sort of indifference because he (the audience) looks himself in that situation. There lies the success of a filmmaker and simultaneously that is the success of Mel Gibson as a director.<br/><br/>Based on a true event, Gibson has been going along with truthfulness of that real event with one hundred percent sincerity. Desmond Doss, a simple guy in looks and in the physical nature, a clean heart ed poor boy going through a beautiful love affair with Dorothy, a nurse. He appreciated everything around him, went above the hills look around it and howls like a wolf at the top like an immature man to show his happiness. Behind this happiness there lies some sort of unhappiness in his life, that's the family problem with his father and mother. But he forgets all those issues (look like that) and going through a life that he wanted to. His innocence is being the key element that portrays the peculiarity of his character and it can be seen at the military camp also. He doesn't want to cross his superior's orders but he follows his own decorum there, and that was his negligence to use guns. He was appointed as a medic there and the Performa completely ensure with the usage of guns to medics and all other medics do the same thing but Doss doesn't seems to accept the orders. He always carries a pocket Holy Bible with Dorothy's picture inside and always recites (in mind) the lines from the Bible. That divine book plays an important role here.<br/><br/>Second World War is highly demolishing and thrashing each and every human lives and broke out with the thunderous outcome and went up into a hardcore stage. It's the time to move on and the camp is ready to attack the Japanese army with full bound. They are reaching to the Hacksaw ridge were the battle or the attack is going to happen. And the one thing got to be surprise is Desmond Doss is in the US army side as a medic without carrying a gun with the permission of the superior because of the letter from his father which reveals his father was an army man in his early life. Here, we can see the utmost directing skill of Mel Gibson were audience might feel the attack is going on just in front of them. <br/><br/>The attack is the hardcore moment of the movie, divide into two or three sections of about 10-20 minutes, the war shook the audience with the sharpness of reality and adventurous mode blend with such the power of individuality. Yes of course, each and every army man were pointed with extreme focus that sort their (individual) sufferings always gets into attention. There lies the significance of Desmond Doss as a medic and a human being in the utmost level of war ambiance. He holds only medicines and pain killers with him and wandering around through the battlefield to provide medical assistance for the wounded soldiers. The moment of the movie came when the soldiers leave from the Hacksaw Ridge were the wounded soldiers remained there Doss alone stayed only with his own intention without knowing others and help others to get medical assistance and helps them to reach to the medical camp. Doss took a herculean task in that atmosphere of gun fires and grenade shells; he alone assumes the charge of a rescue mission operator. With that physical nature he helps all wounded soldiers to come down without considering about his own physical condition and the risk that he voluntarily taken. And their director deliberately goes with us the truth behind why Doss is not able or not in the mood to hold a gun. It was because of the family problem; were Doss fired his father's pistol towards (and a shook turns the pistol shifts around) him when he is in quarreling with his mother. That was the first and last time Doss hold a gun. When the pistol fires from his hand, his father doesn't understand what is happening and even Desmond too. There backdrops the innocence of Desmond and his strange behavior."

","I have to give credit to Mel Gibson. His work directing ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was exceptional - one of his best pieces of work, I'd say. This is a biographical movie, offering us the story of Desmond Doss, a Seventh Day Adventist and pacifist who nevertheless joined the US Army during World War II, serving as a medic and refusing to take up arms against the Japanese - as he says in the movie, he joined to save lives and not to take them. Andrew Garfield took on the role of Doss and did well with it. I was also impressed with Teresa Palmer as Doss's wife Dorothy. The cast as a whole was not chock full of superstars, but it was solid.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a long account of Doss's backstory. I often find backstories overdone and find myself wanting to get on with the meat of the story. Not so here. I enjoyed the backstory and found myself thinking that Gibson got perhaps a bit too focused on the very graphic and gory depictions of the Battle of Okinawa at the expense of Doss's life. So, to be honest, I was a bit disappointed that much of Doss's backstory was fictional - he was raised by his parents as a Seventh Day Adventist and pacifist, but a lot of him homelife and his courting of Dorothy was apparently not accurate - unfortunate, because the depiction of his courting of Dorothy included one of the best pick up lines imaginable!<br/><br/>Doss's introduction to military life was portrayed in a way I found believable. As a pacifist who refused to bear arms He had to fight for acceptance among his comrades. The movie doesn't offer a full account of Doss's military service. He had served and been decorated for his service in Guam and the Philippines before Okinawa, but the story seems to imply that Okinawa was his introduction to the horror of war. And the movie did portray war as horrific. As I mentioned above, Gibson gave us a graphic and gory and blood-soaked look at the battlefield. It certainly made the point that there were ways for pacifists to serve their country courageously and honourably. To be honest, I found that almost too much.<br/><br/>Closing with some footage of the real Doss and his comrades, this movie, while taking liberty with Doss's early years, was both moving and inspirational.

"jamesrupert2014","8","1","1","5 September 2017"," Excellent biographical war picture
","Even if a few liberties were taken with Desmond Doss's life story to make the story more 'romantic' (Doss did not miss his wedding), 'redemptory' (his father didn't produce a letter from a general 'in the nick of time' to save his son from a court-martial), and 'dramatic' (Doss had seen combat and had been cited for valour before the Battle for Okinawa), ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is still a great movie about a fascinating historical personage. The battle scenes seem realistic: chaotic, noisy, and gruesome (but I have no military experience with which to judge). The first half of the film is a bit slow, yet I was surprised that there were no scenes of his medic training (the sudden jump from the court martial to Okinawa was unexpected). Politics and perspectives change, and some people may be upset at the portrayal of the Japanese soldiers and the religious message underlying Doss's heroics, never-the-less, this is a well-made, exciting, inspiring and worthwhile film."

","Superb film dealing with a conscientious objector becoming a war hero. No, it's not Gary Cooper in Sergeant York, but rather newcomer Andrew Garfield who gave a gut wrenching well-deserved Oscar nominated performance.<br/><br/>From a dysfunctional family, he meets the love of his life and with the advent of World War 11, he wishes to serve as a medic but didn't realize the abuse and harassment he was in for when he went into the army and refused to touch a gun.<br/><br/>We see military brass ready to condemn him, but yet we see sympathy for him, especially by the sergeant he later almost saved at Okinawa.<br/><br/>Pulling the wounded survivors off the mountain was certainly a fete to be remembered.

","No one should be surprised that Mel Gibson is a great director. Honestly, haven't you seen ""Braveheart"", ""Passion of Christ"" or ""Apocalypto""? Sadly this fact was long forgotten, due to the private escalations of Gibson and his absence both in front and behind the camera. I always thought this was a pity. I wonder what movies we missed, but who knows.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, I enjoyed every aspect of ""Hacksaw Ridge"". The religious aspect did not bother me at all as I expected when I saw the trailers. I don't get, why this movie wasn't running in theaters in my hometown. The only movies that i liked and shared this strange fact are ""The Fall"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"".<br/><br/>All war scenes were fast, brutal and without any logic of who or how someone gets killed. I loved that. Only ""Black Hawk Down"" showed a similar chaotic depiction of battles without distracting the audience. The story was believable and heartbreaking. The movie also wasn't political, neither the Americans where too brave or good nor the Japanese too cowardly or evil.

"Ben_Cap","5","9","25","10 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge Falls Short of Expectations
","I want to start by being honest, I don't really like most war movies and especially the ones that have come out in recent years. Too often do war movies glorify the subject and I think that betrays what war movies inherently should be. War is bad, it is probably one of if not the most difficult things a human can go through and to see it made into something to sell movie tickets aggravates me. Hacksaw Ridge does not necessarily have this problem but it sure is chock full of other problems.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge tells the story of Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield, who despite being a conscientious objector becomes an American combat medic in WWII. Doss believes that the Sixth Commandment(Thou shalt not kill) should be observed at all times, but feels that he cannot sit home while his fellow countrymen fight for his country. Doss, no matter the quality of the movie based on him is a true American hero through and through. He is a fantastic display of courage in the face of hell and again no opinion of any movie can change that.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is probably most popularly known for its director Mel Gibson. It marks his return to directing after a 10 year absence. I don't want so say the poor direction of the movie is because of his long lay off but I know Mel can do better than this. The movie moves slowly and most of the first half of the movie is incredibly cornball. I could count maybe 2 impressive camera shots in this movie but for the overwhelming majority of the movie it is lackluster. The movie obviously has a strong religious message but Mr. Gibson feels the need to shove it in your face every chance he gets.<br/><br/>While the cast is pretty good, there are some serious miscasts here and some performances that just don't make sense. Andrew Garfield is solid in the lead role but that is about as good as it gets for the acting. Hugo Weaving as the father chews scenery and seems to have been missing for a few weeks. To be fair its not all his fault, his character is so poorly handled in the movie, he is shown to be a man going through some serious PTSD but fuels his sons anger. He seems to be a good father until they don't want him to be. Vince Vaughn is severely miscast. I really don't think this movie about such a serious subject needed a comedic actor in it, but then to turn in basically a full on comedic performance is puzzling.<br/><br/>There are so many more things that make this movie almost unwatchable, but at least the combat scenes make up for them somewhat. The tactics used by the soldiers in the movie don't seem exactly authentic but none the less if there was any enjoyment that I got from Hacksaw Ridge it was from them, not because of the bloodshed, but because they seemed to be the only well paced part of the movie. Gibson plays a fine line between blood lust and trying to show the horror or war and I think he falls more on the side of the latter. Even with that I cannot recommend this movie. If you enjoy WWII history or even just American military history you may get some things out of it all in all Hacksaw Ridge falls short of its lofty expectations."

","Seen Full Metal Jacket? Then you have seen the first half hour of this movie, just imagine Vince Vaughn doing a bad impression of the drill sergeant and you are there already. <br/><br/>Seen the trailer?

They aren't particularly deep or clever and while they provide a narrative for the story, you have seen it all in the trailer!<br/><br/>Seen the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan? Then you have seen the rest of this movie. Lots of gory violence, fire stunts, bits of people being blown apart, and general graphic carnage.<br/><br/>For all that Andrew Garfield is very good. The mass of Australian actors that make up the rest of the cast generally mask their accents well enough. The racist portrayal of the Japanese is almost forgivable given the context of the film. <br/><br/>Shouldn't be on the Oscar shortlist, but no surprise that a bit of Americanised propaganda got so many votes in the current climate of world politics."

HACKSAW RIDGE is that movie and from the outset it went out of its way to contradict anything I might have written recently <br/><br/>I find it impossible to separate Mel Gibson the film maker from Mel Gibson the human being . If nothing else movies directed by Gibson have their own unique voice but it's what the voice is saying that rattles my cage . From the outset Gibson nails his world view to the mast and this cinematic ship sinks under the weight of the message . You have a film opening with graphic images of war along with a voice-over about the strength of God . Do I have to point out here's an ugly irony watching this in the post 9/11 world ? But hey Gibson doesn't do irony <br/><br/>There is an interesting true life story at the centre of the film featuring Desmond T Doss , a pacifist who joined the US army despite being opposed to violence . Now unlike Doss I have never served on a frontline - but then neither has Gibson - so I'm not going to criticise someone who risked their life every moment of everyday in a war zone . He's a decorated hero . End of discussion . The problem is the story should have been told much better . The obstacles faced by Doss religious belief is constantly over done amongst the constant clichés .

It is not his fault, that the plot stinks..<br/><br/>the love story. I never thought i would say this about a war-movie but the best thing to see here is actually before the war starts.

I imagine Mel Gibson came across the actual story and thought ""well this is easy money"" and they just sat back and let the movie play out. such a shame.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story, which it stays true to. I will give it that. But i never thought I would say this about a war-movie, but the best thing about this film was the love-story.. And that is why it fails in my eyes."
"jonsefcik","8","5","12","8 November 2016"," Best movie I've seen in theaters so far in 2016.
","This movie is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a WW2 medic and conscientious objector who received the Medal of Honor for staying behind and retrieving 75 wounded soldiers from the battlefield. <br/><br/>This is the most brutally realistic WW2 movie since Saving Private Ryan. There's limbs being blown off leaving ragged stumps, compound fractures, all that good stuff. One little touch that I really liked was when it showed long-deceased corpses there were maggots all over the skulls and rats eating the bodies. That's something I've never seen before in a war film so I'm glad they included those details. <br/><br/>All the actors are surprisingly fantastic, from Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss to Vince Vaughn as the drill sergeant to Hugo Weaving as the father, there is not a single weak performance. <br/><br/>There have been many attempts to replicate the effectiveness of Saving Private Ryan, Fury comes to mind. None of those movies have the same effect since we don't care about the characters as much, but thankfully this movie wisely takes the time to develop its characters. The first half of the film largely focuses on Doss' moral dilemma of being a CO and the reactions of those around him.<br/><br/>Also, in Chris Stuckmann's review of this movie on Youtube, he mentions how there was one scene where the smoke clears and one of the characters says ""oh no, I lost my cover"" and one of the women in his theater covered her face and said ""oh no!"". I swear in my theater at that exact same moment, there was a woman who shouted ""oh my God!"" and covered her face. I guess you know you have a suspenseful scene when you get the exact same reaction out of the exact same scene.<br/><br/>Any problems I have with the movie are largely nitpicks. Some scenes felt a little rushed and others felt a little too long. I'm not sure how accurate the film was to the real events, but there was one scene in a tunnel which was the only scene that felt Hollywoodized in any way. Also at the end of the movie they show stock footage, and I personally feel it would've been more effective if it were placed at the beginning for a number of reasons I can't get into without spoiling some stuff. <br/><br/>These little things don't impact the core of the film too much though. This is an emotional, suspenseful, inspiring film, probably the best I saw in theaters this year, and I highly recommend you see it. Its not quite as good as Saving Private Ryan, but it comes pretty close. It might just be because I have a soft spot for WW2 movies, but I give Hacksaw Ridge a 9/10."
"jpozenel","6","4","9","30 March 2017"," Could have been a great movie
","If it hadn't been for the typical overdone battle scenes, this could have been a great movie and a tribute to the man it was about. Anyone who has had any kind of military training can see that the battle scenes were totally over the top and unrealistic. There didn't seem to be any kind of battle strategy. There were so many weapons that never have to be reloaded, and when they fire them, they almost never miss the target. Even fully automatic weapons being sprayed wildly never seem to miss. Go to a shooting range and see how many there can shoot anywhere near that good, and those are the ones that go there on a regular basis. If you've never been, see if you can rent a gun. You'll be surprised at how difficult it really is. Granted, a rifle is much more accurate than a pistol, but in the high stress of battle, it's not going to be like shooting at targets. People that believe this kind of ""action"" are the same ones that probably think that police can shoot the guns out of the bad guys hands. It's just impossible to shoot that rapidly with any kind of accuracy. This was a golden opportunity to make a really good movie about an important character in American history, but it missed the mark. Life is not a video game."
"sajungdahl","5","4","9","23 February 2017"," Not Quite Right
","Someone PLEASE tell Hollywood that guns have recoil!!!! As for the battle scenes, they were TV quality at best. In one scene a Marine picks up a severed torso for cover (from 6.5/7.7 arisakas LOL)and charges the Japanese lines while shoot a Browning automatic rifle with one hand, I actually started laughing. There is one scene where the hero pays handball and soccer with grenades, another good laugh. Sorry, found Hacksaw Ridge phony and in some parts just plain corny. I didn't need to look away from the bloody scenes since there was no feeling of realism whatsoever. Comparing Hacksaw Ridge with Saving Private Ryan is a complete injustice. Mr. Gibson needs to spend some time at a rifle range."
"dave118118","10","4","9","7 February 2017"," Madcap film making at its best
","Hacksaw Ridge - 10/10 I was completely blown away by this film. Not only is the true story that it is based on utterly jaw dropping but it is tailor made to be adapted to the big screen. Mel Gibson is the perfect vehicle to tell this remarkable story in a visceral, no holds barred manner. Filmed in under 60 days, this is a triumphant return to the directors chair for Mel.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is comparable to other great war movies such as Full Metal Jacket, where we start off at the boot camp and gradually progress to the 'hell on earth' of war. Gibson uses this structure to create a stark contrast between the light and the dark. The light being Desmond T. Doss's (Garfield) relationship with his girlfriend/wife being the light, the sequence on Hacksaw Ridge being the dark (or in this case the 'black').<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is at times, a bit too nice. It is plastered with bright colors, sunshine, picturesque scenery and its fair share of romance. This reflects against the personality of Doss brilliantly with his more than moral principles.<br/><br/>Whilst the majority of the first hour is a lot lighter than the rest of the film, it isn't without its gritty moments. Hugo Weaving puts in a solid performance as a drunk Veteran father who despite not having much screen time, has a fairly significant impact on the plot. We also have Vince Vaughan as a wise-cracking drill sergeant, who puts in a surprisingly capable performance (Into the Wild being one of few others).<br/><br/>The sequence on Hacksaw ridge is harrowing and then some. This is relentless, disturbing, shocking and does not hold back. It takes what was achieved at the opening of Saving Private Ryan and amps everything up a few levels. This is madcap movie making at its best. Gibson felt that it was important to try and show people exactly what these veterans went through. In fact, some things that reportedly happened on the ridge were cut out as it was felt that the audience would find them to be too unbelievable.<br/><br/>What Mr Doss went through that day is truly remarkable and this film demands to be seen by as wide an audience as possible. Some might find this film to be a little bit too patriotic and jingoistic, but that is almost unavoidable given the subject matter in question. How else do you portray an American hero without having a bit of flag waving? Perhaps some elements are slightly overcooked but a lot of that serves the purpose of amplifying the magnitude of Desmond T Doss's heroics.<br/><br/>A career best from Andrew Garfield although I haven't yet seen Silence which I am assured is equally impressive. Mel Gibson's follow up to Apocalypto was more than worth the wait."
"siulcrash","10","4","9","6 February 2017"," Visually Stunning
","The first thing I want to say about this movie its ""visually stunning"". The vision of every frame has been close to perfection on the photography aspect, then we have the amazing sound effects and the music that makes you feel totally immersed in the story, that I have to recognize it's great. I will recommend this movie to people who have watched ""Saving Private Ryan"" because it's a movie about valor, moral and principles and more important about the courage of doing the right thing in the right moment, if you like world war themed movies, this is the place to go to and enjoy the ride. Don't forget that what we are sawing happened in real life and it's based on a true history of a Man and his conviction to trust in God and to serve all humanity."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","8","4","9","27 January 2017"," Another Good Film by Mel Gibson
","Hacksaw Ridge is a really enjoyable but slightly cheesy film. It's split into two parts: the pre-war era when we get to know the characters, their upbringings and love interests, and the subsequent battle of Okinawa and Hacksaw Ridge, but it's only at the very end of the film that it truly gets going with Private Doss's amazing heroics, which were quite emotional to watch. Mel Gibson directed the finale very well.<br/><br/>It's a good addition to Mel Gibson's resume, but not quite his best picture because of its lack of grittiness (which is an odd thing to say considering the inclusion of extremely graphic scenes of dismembered limbs and spewing intestines). It was too awkward and self-conscious in places and could have done with less 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' fantastical heroics - being pulled along by the medic, on a blanket-on-wheels, fast enough to get away from the pursuing Japs, but steady enough to still rain down hell with a machine gun (even though his legs were riddled with bullets). Slightly ridiculous, and Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan this film is not, but it's still a good watch in a strangely gentleman-like way.<br/><br/>What Mel Gibson does really well is to paint the picture of the messiah, a true hero that everyone hates at first but comes to revere over time, and that's why I've rated this film an 8 instead of my initial 7, because of its stellar ending.<br/><br/>An enjoyable film which grabbed 95% of my attention, especially at the end. It's nice to learn new historical facts about WW2 battles and the people involved, so if you know nothing about Desmond Doss and his heroics, and enjoy war-time films with a dollop of moral pie, look up this film. Recommended."
"KineticSeoul","9","4","9","21 January 2017"," Incredible story about conviction, family and honor.
","This is a film about prejudice against sensitive men and their conviction. Which is thoroughly shown through the mistreatment of Desmond Doss. Who is a stand up guy that wanted to do good for his country by being a medic for the wounded soldiers in battle. The mistreatment came from Doss being a pacifist and for him sticking to his conviction not to kill but to save lives instead in battle by being a medic. Which leads to Doss facing hatred, trials and hazing from the other soldiers because they all think he won't be able to protect them in battle. This is based on a true story of conviction, family and honor. And it's directed very well from the build up to the convincing and engaging violent battle sequences for the second half. Andrew Garfield plays a lovable character as Desmond T. Doss. Garfield did a great job playing Desmond T. Doss as this dorky, lovable, kind and honorable guy. I am going to be very honest though, during the whole film he reminded me of Fix It Felix Jr. from ""Wreck-It Ralph"". As a matter of fact if Fix It Felix Jr. came to real life in human form it would be Andrew Garfield in this film. This is a powerful movie about a man standing up for his conviction at all cost. And the brutality of war and the incredible and inspirational will power a honorable man had when it came to saving lives. It's a film that I can highly recommend to just about anyone.<br/><br/>9/10"

"kovacevicmatija","10","4","9","30 November 2016"," Adventist opinion: Masterpiece that makes you tremble from both horror and wonder, as it inspires hope in a cynical world
","As a Seventh-day Adventist, I was extra-hyped about this movie from the very moment I heard Gibson working on it. Yet it exceeded all my expectations. We faith-people got used to our heroes being presented in minimized, exaggerated or convenient ways, while God they believed in is being put aside (sadly, Gifted Hands falls into this category with its ridiculous 'it's all in here/in your brain' catchphrase). This is not the case with Hacksaw Ridge. It takes the man Desmond Doss with all he was and lets him speak for himself. True, some of the family details were modified (e.g. Doss' real father was not that abusive and that incident with the gun happened with his brother instead of his wife; or, Doss didn't meet Dorothy in the hospital but in the church – perhaps their shared Adventist identity could've been exploited for an even more convincing narration), but the bulk of the movie is seeping with integrity towards Doss' story and character. Desmond Jr. himself told Mel Gibson he was amazed by how similar to his dad Garfield's impersonation was.<br/><br/>Artistically speaking, Hacksaw Ridge is hauntingly beautiful, starting with the opening scene, together with its catchy musical theme (that actually sounds very similar to a hymn of blessing we used to sing at the end of service in my church). Sound editing overall is, quite appropriately, ethereal and brutally real at the same time (one of the highlights for me was an artillery strike from the fleet). Narration proceeds brilliantly, with subtle messages an incautious viewer may not notice at first – but when noticed, they beautifully ingrain the movie's points. My three favorites among them: [**possible spoilers**] (1) Quickly seeing a wedding ring on Doss' finger before he goes to bed with Dorothy – emphasizing his integrity in every area of his faith. (2) At the beginning of the battle, a fellow medic tells Doss to just administer morphine to the soldier with blown legs and let him die; Doss considers this and decides not to listen – thus we see that he will work to save all lives, even those that everyone else had written off. (3) The most brilliant one: Doss shares his memories with Smitty about his dad beating him and his brother just because the sun had risen, implying it had no cause nor made any sense. Next scene, the sun rises over the battlefield; a few moments later, Japanese attack like crazy and a bloody battle ensues, implying war is just as senseless. A to-the-core anti-war moment. [**end of possible spoilers**].<br/><br/>Once the battle begins, the level of unexpected immersion into its horror is amazing. You have the feeling you are actually there with those guys. My heart was literally pounding and I was in trembling shock that this is actually happening, wanting to crawl a little deeper into my mental foxhole. I acquired a whole new appreciation and sympathy for the PTSD-stricken veterans. At the same time, it stripped the war of all redemptive-violence optimism and showed it like it really is – gruesome, inimical to the human dignity – something that leaves no real winners. I'm all with Gibson on the necessity of this realistically brutal depiction for the sake of making Doss' anomalous presence real and appreciable. As an Adventist, I don't believe in a place called Hell, but if there ever was one – it was on the battlefields like this. And into this hell comes one unshakable heavenly man whose one goal is to save ""one more"", no matter the cost to himself. Now, doesn't that sound familiar? There is hardly any more beautiful metaphor for what Christ did than this.<br/><br/>The transcending nature of Doss' character is nowhere shown better than [**spoiler**] in the scene where he treats the Japanese soldier without a bit of hesitation or contempt – that was such a cathartic moment after all that bloodshed between the brothers of the same human family [**end of spoiler**]. Such moments also make you tremble, but this time from wonder and gratitude that in the midst of that chaotic horror, a person could hold onto and share divine peace and love with everyone.<br/><br/>In the end, the film leaves you with a wonderful but dangerous feeling – a feeling that you have watched something so meaningful, real and unfeigned that it can provoke a change in your own life. The true and unfeigned nature of the movie and, frankly, of its crew and cast (Gibson, producers, screenwriters, Garfield, Palmer everyone just seem to really resonate with the story), also tends to make a lot of other movies feel suddenly shallow. In many ways, the film is a game changer. The crew was extra careful to tell the story like it was, sensitive to the input of Doss' family, friends and church. You can see an unprecedented level of accountability and humility. Yet this didn't prevent the film to end up a masterpiece. It is a Doss among the movies – being different in a good way and giving hope that it's possible to stand for what you believe. Perhaps the best conclusion I could give here are Garfield's own words: ""It's a very hard thing to stay true to oneself and one's convictions in the culture we're in right now. Yet it's those people who shape the change that a culture needs, by standing strong in the midst of terrible storms."" If this movie helps one person to stand strong for what is right in a terrible storm, it has accomplished wonders.<br/><br/>Matija Kovacevic"

The actor and his family life prior to joining the war was as if vert true of a distorted ex army man's life. Very much realistic. No wonder this movie was rated so high. No other movie received such high ratings all year. If you like war movies then you must see this one.

"CANpatbuck3664","8","4","9","11 November 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge Tells an Extraordinary Story With Some Great Strengths and A Couple of Glaring Weakness
","I went to go see Hacksaw Ridge with a couple of friends largely because of the really positive word-of-mouth surrounding it. Some people didn't want to go see it because Mel Gibson was directing. I get that, the guy hasn't exactly been an inspiring force lately and I in no way support what he's been advocating for. But you try to separate the art from the artist and the previews looked good with some beautiful period recreation and some unconventional casting choices. I'm happy I went and saw it although I didn't think it was perfect.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is a man with a strong code. He believes in the war effort against Japan and Nazi Germany but he believes even more strongly in the Bible and his interpretation of it is that it is wrong to take life even in war. He made it through life with his abusive alcoholic father Tom Doss (Hugo Weaving) and has recently met the love of his life Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). But he signs up to go to war and is treated like a coward by his company Sargent Howell (Vince Vaughn) his Cpt., Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington) and the other soldiers in the company. He has to go through military court but he gets permission to ship out with the rest of the group to go fight the Japanese in Okinawa. <br/><br/>I want to start with the actual story of Desmond Doss. It's an amazing tale of heroism and it absolutely deserved its own movie. I would congratulate the creative team for telling his story in such a visceral yet compassionate way. He's not perfect and what the army puts him through in his training is brutal. It could have been more violent or vulgar and I'm glad the movie didn't go that way. It underscores how strong his conviction was and how his commitment to serve was amazing in his own unique way. I'll get into how I thought the movie was a little too sentimental later but they're very respectful to their hero and I appreciated that.<br/><br/>The next thing to talk about are the absolutely amazing war action scenes. I thought they were the best I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. People are blown up, burned alive and gunned down horribly. The movie doesn't glorify the violence though, it treats it like it should be treated, as humanity destroying. Every second your flinching or wincing because the movie plants you right in the centre of it and although its hard to watch, Mel Gibson sure knows how to film a big epic like this. Hacksaw Ridge is worth seeing just for those moments.<br/><br/>I'll talk about Andrew Garfield a little later but this movie also features some great supporting performances. Teresa Palmer is on a roll lately, I really liked her in Lights Out and she builds on that with a great job in this. She's a good mix of sweet and earnest and she's memorable in what could have been a throwaway part. I couldn't believe how good Vince Vaughn was. He really steals the show, he's his funny self but he also really turns on the dramatic chops. I hope he gets more roles like this. This was also a pleasant return to form for Sam Worthington. He's not an Oscar calibre actor but he gets a bad rap and when you give him good material, he does good work. Hugo Weaving also has a nice turn. His character really drives home that PTSD existed even back then and while you don't like his character, you can't help but respect his performance. Luke Bracey was also solid, his character is a little clichéd but he was decent.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie but for me there were 2 points where the movie couldn't get out of its own way. The first and biggest problem is that a lot of the dialogue is really cringe worthy. There were so many times during the movie that the actors would open their mouths and completely kill the movie's momentum with super hokey stuff. It was a buzzkill and it was too bad. The other is that I thought Andrew Garfield laid it on a little thick. I don't want to blame him too much with that dialogue but he's so golly-gee innocent at the beginning that he's hard to take seriously. He does get better as the movie goes along though so take that criticism with a little salt.<br/><br/>This movie would have been a 9 or possibly even higher if I didn't have those problems. The movie is beautiful, engaging and you don't want to miss any of the action. I just couldn't get past those couple stumbling blocks. I would still recommend this highly, maybe you won't have such a big problem with those things. If you're interested in a good war movie, check this out."
"kluseba","9","4","9","10 November 2016"," The greatest anti-war movie of the last five years
","''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a superbly crafted anti-war movie and easily the best movie of its kind since the release of the South Korean war epic ''My Way'' five years earlier. This movie is based upon true events and tells the story of Seventh-day Adventist Desmond Thomas Doss who enlists in the Army to take part in the Second World War to defend his country but refuses to carry a gun due to his religious beliefs and negative experiences with his violent father who is a war veteran. In the beginning, Doss is bullied, criticized and rejected because of his convictions but he ends up gaining the respect of his brothers in arms during the crucial Battle of Okinawa where he saves the lives of seventy-five soldiers as a medic.<br/><br/>The movie can basically be divided into three parts. The first part introduces Desmond Thomas Doss' life in Lynchburg, Virginia. It shows us how he almost killed his brother as a child because his fighting was encouraged by his broken, brutal and depressive father who is a war veteran of the First World War. It also shows us how his father abused of his wife and almost shot her. Desmond Thomas Doss had to fight his father to protect his mother and swore to never touch a gun again. It also shows us how he fell in love with a local nurse called Dorothy Schutte that he would later on marry. This part of the movie shows us a caring, peaceful and smart young man with clear and strong convictions.<br/><br/>The second part of the film shows us how Desmond Thomas Doss enlists in the army. Initially, he convinces with good results during his training and gets along with most of his brothers in arms. It's only when he openly refuses to carry a gun that he gets rejected by his brothers in arms who are encouraged not to trust him or follow his actions by their superiors. Desmond Thomas Doss gets bullied both mentally and physically by his brothers in arms and has to face some time in prison as well as a trial for disobeying the orders of his superiors. In the end, the charges against him are dropped when a former commanding officer and brother in arms of his father states that Doss' refusal to carry a firearm is protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. This part of the movie shows us an authentic, honest and persevering individual that holds onto his beliefs despite all the hardship he endures.<br/><br/>The third part of the movie takes places during the Battle of Okinawa at a place nicknamed Hacksaw Ridge. Doss' and his brothers in arms must take down the strategically placed Japanese forces atop a cliff. The battle turns out to be pitiless, long and brutal as losses are heavy on both sides. At night, Doss is the only non-injured American who remains on the battlefield to save as many injured soldiers as he can all by himself despite Japanese soldiers occupying the territory. This part of the movie shows us a brave, selfless and strong medic who risks his own life to save as many brothers in arms as possible.<br/><br/>Aside of the inspiring story of a selfless medic, this movie convinces on many levels. The acting is authentic and emotional. Especially the main character portrayed by Andrew Garfield has a lot of sympathetic charisma. His father and war veteran portrayed by Hugo Weaving shows us a torn character who is brutal and depressive on one side but also honest and determined to help his son during his trial no matter what. Another great character is the main character's wife Dorothy Schutte played by Teresa Palmer who convinces as a selfless, faithful and elegant young woman who loves her husband for all the right reasons. <br/><br/>Aside the extraordinary acting, one must point out the movie's epic cinematography. The costumes and settings are authentic and unpolished. The last third of the movie shows us quite brutal, graphic and gripping battle scenes that truly show us the horrors of war. These scenes are not gratuitous, melodramatic or overwhelming, they are just as close to reality as it gets. These intense scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. Another element I liked is the balance between wide shots to capture the horrors on the battlefield and the close-up to capture the emotions on the faces of the injured soldiers in the last forty-five minutes or so of the movie.<br/><br/>To keep it short, ''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a memorable anti-war movie that convinces with an unusual, epic and detailed story line, outstanding acting performances and gorgeous cinematography. It's one of the best war movies in recent memory and also an outstanding drama at the same time. The only reason why this movie didn't get the highest rating is the fact that it focuses a little bit too much on the religious views of the main character. I'm aware of the fact that these beliefs are incredibly important to the main character but the movie felt a little bit repetitive, overwhelming and melodramatic concerning these elements that almost felt like religious propaganda at certain points."
"denis888","7","3","6","26 February 2017"," Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven
","Mel Gibson is a very good film director, and a very fine actor, although not without failures or errors on his way. His resume is fairly spectacular, and here he touches upon a very delicate and a very serious subject - the conflict between religious beliefs and military duties. Desmond Doss was a very famous Seventh Day Adventist who took part in Battle Of Okinawa and due to his belief never took up a rifle and never killed anyone, but he saved as many as 100 lives of wounded soldiers and officers. The film is about this modest and brave man, who spared no effort to save his comrades. Was the film a success? Well, with all the coming Oscar nods, and with Mel Gibson and a stellar cast behind, this is very tough to be very critical. Let's say this - the movie is good, but not awesome, good but not perfect. This is not Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, for sure. Why? Well, there are some almost cringe-worthy pathetic scenes, that awake all the worst clichés of Hollywood, the battle scenes are impressive but hardly anything but already many times repeated gruesome bloody things. The slower part of the movie is often boring and too slow, and the main actor, well he is OK, but sorry, not higher than just average. This is a good film that must be seen at least once."

And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.<br/><br/>What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn.

"andrewpardee","9","3","6","22 February 2017"," A purple heart recipient with a heart of gold
","In his first work since Apocalypto Mel Gibson takes an unpopular story matched with an unpopular hero to show that you cannot win a battle until you have won the one inside of you. Growing off of his themes of the beauty that can occur in chaos he provides his most vivid, real, yet most out of this world story to date. Stemming off of past films Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Hacksaw Ridge provides a glimpse of how morals can thrive in a world with immorality. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield stars as Desmond Doss, a seemingly normal young man from Lynchburg Virginia who is born into unlikely circumstances. His father, a World War I veteran, is troubled by not only PTSD and alcoholism, but also his actions that come from them. Growing up Desmond sees the effects of violence and it not only shapes his life, but shapes many lives to come. World War II, the Japanese strike Pearl Harbor killing 2,403 brothers, friends, and loved ones. The country begins scrapping for anyone they can get in this desperate time. Despite their father's beliefs, Desmond, and his younger brother Harold, decide they cannot stay complacent, but have to enlist and ""fight"" for what they believe in. <br/><br/>Quicker than the attack on Pearl Harbor, Desmond's enlistment takes a turn for the worse. He refuses to carry a weapon referencing the commandment ""Thou shall not kill"" as his cornerstone. A soldier without a gun? In a kill or be killed savage environment, Desmond does not back down. At boot camp, he is beaten before he even joins the battle. Harassed, ridiculed, and dehumanized by his fellow soldiers, his future and his worth on the battlefield looks grim. Striving to be a doctor, the path he has now chosen is not in his comfort zone and is looked down upon by his father, who does not want his sons to witness the hell he went through. Although Desmond does not have the means to pay for medical school, he decides to risk paying the ultimate price and puts his life on the line to save the people who want him gone just as much as the enemy.<br/><br/>From explosive cinematics that gave it a three dimensional feel, to extensive character development that made me feel emotions that I have not felt in years, this movie grabbed my attention from round one. I am going to pull the trigger and say this movie was nothing short of exceptional. The moment the battalion charged the ridge, I felt my body go numb. From hair standing up to minutes without blinking the engrossing tale engulfed me emotionally and physically. The shots were so intimate and personal that I felt I was standing in that group myself. The producing was so masterful that the climax seemed never ending and the underlying themes served as a constant reminder of the loss that happened on more than just the battlefield. When the music cut out, the sound died, and good men took the final fall. That is when I was spoken to, when nothing was said at all."
"mark-durfor","9","3","6","21 February 2017"," Gibson's Triumphant Return in Hacksaw Ridge
","Hacksaw Ridge is the story of an Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who was the first to ever receive the Medal of Honor for bravery without having fired a single shot. His father Tom (Hugo Weaving) fought in World War I and it took its toll on Tom who turned to drinking and was often violent with his family. It was his father's violence that prompted Desmond to commit to the Scripture's command that ""Thou shalt not kill."" He refused to even pick up a gun. Things got even tougher for Tom when both of his sons enlisted in the army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor launching the United States into World War II.<br/><br/>Desmond did not get along with his superiors in boot camp due to his opposition to guns and killing. Refusing to train on Saturdays as it is the Sabbath, didn't earn him any popularity points with his fellow trainees either. Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) made his training as hellish as possible and Desmond was beaten in his barracks by the other soldiers who viewed his conscientious objections as cowardice. But Desmond did not give up their names when asked who attacked him. He took everything they threw at him and persevered. The day the squad was released from training, Desmond was arrested for his insubordination making him miss his own wedding day. Only the testimony of his father saved him from a court martial.<br/><br/>Desmond's stand against killing continued in Okinawa, Japan as he refused to take up a weapon against the enemy, even though he believed their cause was just. Instead, he regularly risked his own life, unarmed, to aid his wounded brothers away from the front lines to get medical attention. In all, Desmond rescued over 75 men without ever firing a shot.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge marks Mel Gibson's return to the Director's chair after a ten year hiatus after Apocalypto in 2006 and The Passion of the Christ in 2004. Hacksaw Ridge has been nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Picture of the Year, Best Leading Actor (Andrew Garfield) and Best Director (Mel Gibson). Gibson 2 for 2 in Oscar wins, both for Braveheart in 1996 that earned him the Best Picture of the Year and Best Director. Hacksaw Ridge is another installment in brutally graphic, tragically realistic, touching and character-driven movies in Gibson's repertoire. I was concerned about Andrew Garfield in this role. He started gaining major recognition with his role in The Social Network in 2010 followed by a reprized role as Peter Parker / Spider-man in two Spider-man movies. But this is quite a different role for Garfield and he more than rose to the occasion. In fact, his performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination (Casey Affleck won for Best Actor in a Drama) and an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I was also concerned about Vince Vaughn in this very heavy movie. I love him in his comedies, but he failed to impress in the second season of True Detective. Granted, everyone failed to impress in that series follow-up, but particularly Vaughn who wasn't very convincing in his dramatic role. While he was more than adequate in this role, he still proved to be the dimmest star shining in a sea of brightly burning suns. Vaughn will never be mentioned alongside the greats like R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, Louis Gosset Jr. in An Officer and a Gentleman, or Christopher Walken in Biloxi Blues. <br/><br/>That being said, early comments on the film, the notoriety of Gibson's previous works and the preview made me very optimistic for Hacksaw Ridge, so I gave it an anticipatory 4.0 Star Prediction. And I'm going to stick with it giving it a solid 4.0 Stars. It really had everything. It started with a tragic family story torn apart by alcohol and violence. It had a beautiful love story that was so pure and sweet. It made you love and support Desmond in boot camp and feel for him as his fellow soldiers attacked him. It ended with a brutal, graphic, realistic war reenactment. That is one of Gibson's specialties: graphic violence that isn't just for the sake of being bloody, but rather because that's what actually happened. And that's how you look at it. You don't ask, ""Why did that movie have to be so violent?"" Instead, you realize just how violent the war was and that makes Desmond's heroics just that much more incredible. Hacksaw Ridge was well worth the money in the theatre, definitely worth the 6 nominations, and a contender for a spot in my home collection. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"

","Based on the true story of Private Desmond Doss who single-handedly saved dozens of U.S. soldiers on Okinawa in a place nicknamed ""Hacksaw Ridge""all without using a weapon.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays Doss, a Seventh Day Adventist who has made a vow not to kill nor handle a gun, yet volunteers to join the Army during WW II to serve his country in a way that doesn't conflict with his religion, i.e. he will be a combat medic and save the lives of his fellow soldiers. Basic training in the U.S. Army becomes a nightmare for Garfield because his Conscientious Objector status makes his unit think that he is a coward, and that Garfield will just stand by as his comrades get attacked by the enemy. For his refusal to pick up a weapon during training, Garfield is ostracized, beaten, and court-martialed. But with Garfield's faith and inner strength, and the help of his fiancée and his father, Garfield's C.O. status is upheld and allowed to finish his training. The bloody battles in Okinawa await.<br/><br/>It is in combat that all soldiers are ultimately tested; and Garfield proves his worth in every way when the bullets fly, charging in when a soldier cries ""medic!"" despite the dangers all around. As the men in his company fall from their wounds, Garfield is there to help save their lives; but with only a helmet for protection, how long can Garfield survive the enemy's onslaught before he is killed? <br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is the scene when Garfield's Company reaches the Ridge and sees the landscape before them: torn bodies of soldiers everywhere, black sand, sharp rocks, trees splintered by the shelling, and smoke that hides the Japanese soldiers that are waiting for the Americans to walk into the killzone.<br/><br/>Taking second place for my memorable moments of this movie is the scene when Vince Vaughn (playing a Sergeant in Garfield's squad/platoon) addresses the new recruits for the first time. One recruit is completely naked, but Vaughn ignores him and instead hurls insults at other soldiers who are more presentable. It's a fine example of comedic writing.<br/><br/>Director Mel Gibson did an excellent job with ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" taking his time to tell the background story of Garfield's character to show us why he believes in what he believes. And once we are on board with what this humble, C.O. is all about, the second half of the movie throws him into the meat grinder, where the audience will see what the man is truly made of.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

There are some scenes that are far reaching and quite brutal; this coming from someone that has been desensitized to almost everything. What I enjoyed most about Hacksaw Ridge is that in a time where our freedom was at the highest risk of loss; regardless of beliefs, race, color or creed, Americans had to come together to fight for what makes our country great, or at least laid the framework to greatness. Trying not to pull at any political strings in respect to democratic views from all sides...I digress. <br/><br/>Overall, an incredible story of standing for one's personal beliefs, leaning on a higher power and serving their country while challenging what and how it means to serve.

"taryllsbaker","9","3","6","29 January 2017"," One of the most carefully crafted war films I've ever experienced.
","Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Milo Gibson, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. <br/><br/>Based on the incredible true story, WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.<br/><br/>It's taken me a while to digest Mel Gibson's brutal epic Hacksaw Ridge, roaring with fire and an undying courage shown in Garfield's deeply rooted portrayal of Desmond T. Doss, but at this point after sitting on time for a moment, I can safely say that this is one of most carefully crafted war films I have ever had the pleasure to, in some ways, endure.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's performance in this film is bitterly convincing, gripping the viewer with a biting display of emotion shown within the conscientious objector. A background of Doss' life is shown within the first 20 minutes, which aids his character and helps the viewer connect with his many decisions that occur during the heavily textured battle, leading to saving 75 lives on the front line. Not only does Garfield provide an emotional core, he goes through all kinds of hell, crawling between the gruesome display of the fallen and wounded.<br/><br/>It would be all for nothing, however, without Gibson's skillful direction. He and cinematographer Simon Duggan capture the Art, Special Effects and Stunt department's hard work with eyes of an eagle, utilising smart camera set-ups that assist the unravelling chaos and destruction unfolding around the cast. <br/><br/>The supporting cast of Luke Bracey, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn are truly wonderful. Each individual provides a delightful back-and-fourth between themselves and Garfield. Vaughn breaks from his comedic persona (almost entirely) and shines light on a new side to his acting abilities. Many of his scenes are smartly written and engaging, whilst finding the perfect time to improvise his lines, adding a much-needed comic relief. Hugo Weaving is incredible in one of his best roles yet. Delivering a powerhouse performance that ties with Garfield's, showcasing several layers of hate, sadness and regret, detailed beautifully in his fine acting.<br/><br/>Original music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is satisfactory, though missing something of great importance; distraught emotion. It's great at filling the gaps with heroic themes, but I never felt moved by the score in any huge way. In the final moments of the film I do admit to have felt hopeful and 'pumped' but I thought the score had an absence of fear and angst. This could be due to Gibson's direction though, as ultimately the director has the final say. However, I believe the space is filled with an impeccably thorough bed of sound, expertly created by the Sound Department and adeptly mixed and edited, earning 2 Academy Award nominations. <br/><br/>The battle sequences are intricate and complex, captured beautifully in-camera and driven by highly intense and scary situations that spring up out of nowhere. It's a tough experience to get through, but it's undeniably well put together, seriously powerful and absolutely worth it.<br/><br/>Verdict; Hacksaw Ridge is riveting and bathed in gore, however, underneath the brutality is a fine true story of survival and heroism.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge, 9/10."

Although he was a contentious objector, he also wanted to serve his country and to save lives, and so joined the military to become a field medic. The first half of the film explores his childhood and family dynamics. The 16 year flashback explain where his strict religious beliefs and attitude to (not) killing came from. Unfortunately his attitude were at odds with standard military protocol, and since he would not kill (he would not even touch a gun) this leads us into the second half of the film.<br/><br/>The second half describes how his attitude put him in conflict with his senior officers and the rest of the platoon, his basic training was particularly tough, with frequent beatings and a potential court martial. The second half also follows the intense war scenes at Hacksaw Ridge (Okinawa), this was particularly important since taking the Ridge could completely change the dynamics of WW2. <br/><br/>It's difficult to believe the film is a cert. 15, as the battle scenes are absolutely intense and brutal with bodies cut in half and legs blown apart. (Must have only just scrapped a 15). <br/><br/>Desmond Doss never fired a gun but is officially credited with saving 75 injured comrades single handedly, he never gave up on his faith or his beliefs. <br/><br/>Stay until the end credits to see a vintage interview with the actual Desmond Doss and other significant characters who were portrayed.

Private Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) and his legacy of refusing to own a weapon in battle is an amazing story-line to build a movie upon. The flashbacks to his troubled and violent past filled with berserk behavior which lead to his close relationship with God, were an excellent addition to understanding the intricate life of Doss. Garfields performance overshadowed everyone else's in this movie by providing a complicated character facing an even more complicated and outlandish consequence for refusing to touch a weapon. <br/><br/>Doss's relationship with his wife (Teresa Palmer)and others is the main negative aspect of this film. His cliché early relationships with other soldiers can be overlooked by the development of the relationships later on when rescuing those who persecuted him. <br/><br/>The emotional slow motion shooting and gory effects comparable to that of Saving Provate Ryan's D-Day opening sequence, allow for the audience to truly take heart to all that the soldiers went through.

Reminded of the antiviolence account of Cain and Abel, Desmond Doss feels immediate remorse for what he committed against his brother, and vows never to get involved with violence again.<br/><br/>At a much older age, Desmond finds love with a local nurse who has seen soldiers return from World War II. Their romance from here is as sweet and believable as any man would remember his first relationship, complete with a blue jay feather to represent the delicacy of their love. It seems here like director Mel Gibson is returning to his old bags of tricks with the romantic plot of Braveheart, but the vulnerable Church-boy accent by main actor Andrew Garfield wins over both men and women.<br/><br/>These small personal touches set up exactly why we should care about the tragic events that happen later, proving exactly what Gibson most succeeds at as a director. He's not even afraid to put in some comic relief when it's time for Desmond to join the army, where one of the first soldiers he meets is a narcissistic bodybuilder who loves exercising in the nude (except when it's time for training). But once he opens up at Fort Jackson about being a pacifist, everything stops being funny. He won't even tie a noose knot without it coming out shaped more like a heart. The rest of the army found it completely unthinkable that a soldier was enlisting with no ambition to even touch a gun, so what happens from here is a multitude of mixed emotions and unclear answers.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge may seem at first like the typical war movie that resorts to the usual tropes, but experiencing the film proves how it does everything a gigantic leap further from the clichés. The drill sergeant, along with firing out his expected racist insults, also shows his compassionate side when necessary, and the war hero is not depicted as being purely in the right. Rather, he has one thing that's getting in the way of him serving graciously on the battlefield: his pride in his pacifism.<br/><br/>That is why on the day of the first battle at Okinawa, it takes a chaotic series of uncomfortably long warfare segments to put this man of God to the test. This recreation of real events show us how this underestimated unarmed soldier saved hundreds of lives just by sticking to the word of God. You'll be surprised even by how he treats the ""enemy"" that the army is sent to Hacksaw Ridge to destroy.<br/><br/>It's not every day a movie like this comes around: a movie that tells one of the most inspiring true stories to come out of the darkest period of man's history. While everyone else in this nation is concerned about unreliable self-righteous heroes like Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spider-Man, here is a hero who knows the importance of putting other lives ahead of his own, committing his service to unconditional love rather than destruction. Therefore, I encourage the instant-classic Hacksaw Ridge as immediate viewing to all, for the sake of our country and our definition of heroism."

","One of the best Dramatic Emotional movie this year (2016) if not the best. Mel Gibson comes back with a hell of a story and presented it to us in the best possible way with small budged compared with the great scenes he did and that is a great credit for him which proves that he is a great director.<br/><br/>I love to talk at first about Hugo Weaving which was tremendous and Vince Vaughn was great . Andrew Garfield did his best role so far in his career with a really great potentials. We also shouldn't forget Sam Worthington who was also unexpectedly good.<br/><br/>By watching this movie you are watching a master piece that was about to reach ""Saving Private Ryan"" and did a truly respectable try.<br/><br/>And ""Please god, help me get one more"" My rating is 9.5/10"
"vinodspm","10","3","6","18 December 2016"," Authentic WWII experience with a different perception of WAR
","Well this is one of the movies which does not fail to give you goosebumps and you will sure leave the theater with a heavy heart. There are many WWII movies but this one sure is worth a watch and tops my list alongside with Saving Private Ryan & Full Metal Jacket. The movie is based on real life War Combat Medic's hero the late CPL.Desmond Thomas Doss. Basically to summarize what is stunning about this movie I want to break it down in to three parts (Narration/Screenplay/Direction, Cinematography, Action and Acting)<br/><br/>Direction / Screenplay: Mel Gibson has surly done his homework and it is evident that he is put his heart and soul into retaining the real essence of a real lift story, the movie starts of slow like a mellow drama and slowly builds its pace, the WAR scenes were so real and totally immersive (Not like Michael Bay style ;). I have a strong feeling this movie is going win many awards including the Academy. There are very few movies you see a unanimous applaud from the audience when the credits roll and this is sure was one of them. Where was Mel Gibson all these years? he has sure set a new standard and made a swashbuckling comeback so to say. This title is one you got to own the DVD/Bluray when it is out and watch it in the theaters.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The movie never failed to give the feel of the WWII era, the Dress, Army Uniform, Body language, lighting, dialog, vehicles, Weapons all were carefully crafted to give you the authentic WWII experience. From use of slow pan shots to switching between steady and POV cameras even from the mellow dramatic scenes to the action paced blood splashing scenes you will never be bored. The boot camp scenes and WAR scenes had a close resemblance to Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan but the overall story gives you a different perception of WAR altogether. There are many enjoyable moments in the movies from slow motion of shells popping out from M3 sub machine gun, carnage of Japs with M2 flamethrower, non-submission of PoW etc.. The night scenes were shots with some exceptional camera blocking techniques can't explain much just watch the movie you will understand. <br/><br/>Acting: Well this movie is going to be a milestone in Andrew Garfield's career. Mel Gibson has made use of Andrew's full potential. He has re-lived CPL.Doss in the movie and I hope he gets an Oscar. Also stunning performance by Teresa Palmer (Strangely I felt she resembled - Christine Stewart first cousin look alike if there was one ;) don't know why) & brief and subtle performance by Hugo Weaving.<br/><br/>Overall just go and watch this one don't miss you will not be disappointed for sure."
"atmjameel-1","10","3","6","14 December 2016"," Let all see it
","So much has been written and said of this film that anything more from me would be insignificant. Since its release I have looked at the Budget and been closely looking at earnings thus far (as I thought that initially it was unjustifiably weak) subsequently I wanted to see earnings break-even with Budget and go beyond to make sufficient money to do justice to the noble contribution the long list of about 35 producers. Following that its my humble suggestion to Mr. Mel Gibson and the producers that this film be made available free for viewing through channels like Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and so on, such that as many people as possible around the world see it and benefit from the message this amazing film carries. Also I suggest the film be dubbed in as many languages in the best way possible to be viewed by a wider audience world over. Oh & I mean Dubbed not subtitled as I find subtitles painfully difficult to catch-up with as they are a big distraction from the narration of any film. My suggestion is based on the fact that during 70's & 80's in India one film maker the respected Mr. Manoj Kumar used to make patriotic and social issues based films for whom the Govt of India would waive off the taxes so that as many people as possible can see the films and benefit from them. I sincerely hope my suggestion is looked into seriously!"
"christine_diane","10","3","6","11 December 2016"," Must see so we don't forget the horrors of war
","This is a great WWII movie and a must see. Until now, Saving Private Ryan, in my opinion, depicted the best WWII battle scene as the soldiers landed on Normandy. I now feel that the atrocities and realism of battle have been perfectly captured by Hacksaw Ridge. A part of this film that is not often captured in other war films is the traumatic reaction that the soldiers experience after battle, subtleties like weeping and shocked or sorrowful expressions even on the faces of the background characters. This along with the graphic nature of the kill scenes moved me emotionally, and I am unable to watch anything violent in nature right now as I have had my fill of human suffering for awhile. I think all high school students should watch this movie as a reminder that there was a time when 18 year old young adults were brave and self-sacrificing, a time before the self-absorbed, compliment-fishing selfie. After the movie ended, the audience clapped which is a rarity today. This film will stick with you, and perhaps you will have a conversation with yourself regarding the necessity of war."
"freedomfreak18","10","3","6","8 December 2016"," A thought-provoking movie about conviction.
","This is a great movie, both for its cinematography and its thought- provoking message. It portrays the true story of Private Desmond Doss, a medic in the Pacific Theater of World War Two. Doss, played by Andrew Garfield, is a determined young man, afraid of nothing, eager to do his part in fighting the war for a free world. <br/><br/>There is just one problem. Desmond Doss is a conscientious objector. <br/><br/>That means he will not take a man's life. In fact, he will not even touch a firearm. This is where the thought-provocation comes in. Desmond Doss portrays a man of conviction. He will not be swayed to do what he believes is wrong, even under incredible physical and psychological pressure to give up his convictions or get out of the military. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss challenges us to think about what we hold as conviction. What would we die for? What would we be willing to be beat and abused for? What truths do we hold as so essential that we refuse to negotiate them at all? <br/><br/>The question that naturally arises from Doss's story is the question of where he got his conviction. The movie portrays him as having a traumatic childhood experience as well as quoting the Bible, ""Thou shalt not kill."" This is an important question for Christians and non-Christians alike. Can the Bible be trusted to build convictions on? If not the Bible, what authority do we appeal to as the source of our convictions? It would serve us well to think through this question at length. <br/><br/>For Christians and non-Christians alike, consistency is held up as a virtuous trait. If Doss was appealing to the Bible for his conviction to not take up a gun and kill a fellow human, would he also follow the Bible's guidelines on other ethical issues, like sexuality? Apparently Mel Gibson knew this question would arise, so he made sure to catch Doss's wedding band when he is in the bedroom with Dorothy, indicating they become married before sleeping together. If we want to test the strength of an authority, consistency in following that authority is something to take into account. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss was a person of conviction. Are we?"
"wiseaker","10","3","6","8 December 2016"," Saving Private Ryan mixed with Chariots of Fire
","Mel Gibson did a wonderful job on this movie. I'm so glad to see him directing again. Hacksaw Ridge is a mix between Saving Private Ryan and chariots of Fire. Based on a true story the war footage is unbelievably realistic. The intensity of the battles fought and courage it took to fight them had me squirming in my seat. The faith of the hero in the story is nothing short of astounding. The romance facet of an innocent time long long was also very well done. It is the perfect Holiday movie. It is very inspiring and would be broadly appealing. I rarely see a movie twice in a theater but this is one I would in a New York minute."
"tavm","9","3","6","8 December 2016"," Hacksaw Ridge was a compelling take on the heroism of one Desmond Doss
","Watched this with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday, the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Desmond Doss was a conscience objector during World War II meaning he refused to carry a gun while in the Army. He eventually managed to save many of his fellow comrades during the battle of Okinawa by moving them to safety using the rope tricks he learned during basic training. If you're familiar with director Mel Gibson's graphic take on The Passion of the Christ, those battle scenes shouldn't surprise here nor how long it is being depicted. Still, there's also a nice romance between Desmond and Dorothy (Andrew Garfield and Teresa Palmer) in the beginning parts. Overall, me and my friend highly recommend Hacksaw Ridge."

","Heads up for terrible writing skills. First of all, no doubt this movie an an uplifting story spiritually. the directing of the movie makes it truly incredible but kind of hard to believe, so i raise my fedora to Mel Gibson the genius!. Sometimes people see violence and not feel a thing because they are used to watching it their whole life. But due to the very realistic acting, graphics & professional directing i felt very sad during war scenes. The movie has a great cast, Andrews acting was phenomenal & i didn't expect Vince Vaughn's character being so...um you'll know by then.

I've read other critics rag on the gore in this movie (as well as Gibson's other films), and I'm definitely not a fan of blood and gore, but this film had to be made this way. I believe Mel is brilliant, and not just with the war scenes. From beginning to end, Doss's life and journey and convictions amaze me. Getting to know the main character, and knowing this movie is based upon truth makes it more all the more incredible. The protagonist's internal conflict is real - and we see that. Great hero. Great movie. Great directing and acting by all the cast. I don't know movie terminology, but all involved in this film - excellent. Hacksaw Ridge is the real deal."
"DthepYEK","7","3","6","1 December 2016"," The best battle scene ever
","One word, legend. It was the movie with the best battle scenes I've watched so far. I have never watched another battle scene so realistic, so vibrant, so vibrant for so many people. Er Ryan has a famous landing stage. There's a better battle scene than him.<br/><br/>At first I have to say. The movie looks a bit like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Especially in terms of first and second half. The first part is not a severe psychology like FMJ. But it is similar in structure. It's more emotional and funny in places. But from the moment the second episode began, I was buried in the seat. I almost fell into the war.<br/><br/>A silence and a bullet. Here you hear the voice of the buzzer. After that, doomsday. The bullet is passing by the head. Human flesh is flying over. The man's brains are bursting. A few feet away the man has no legs. Bombs are flying in the back. That's what he was. A bullet. Nobody has any idea what's going on. Only the flying bullets, the blood and the rest of the human remains. I can go back to the cinema for that episode so I say. Just for that episode. And also whoever did the vocalization, give it to the man Oscar. Speaking is perfect in the real sense.<br/><br/>I guess the best of war movies in terms of visual and sound. There are other things missing, but get it. Acting is not very good overall. But in the father role, I love Hugo Weaving. The film has a little Forrest Gump, a little Saving Private Ryan, a little Full Metal Jacket and a little Paths of Glory. He's got something all the time. But in essence it's a movie of its own. Watch, watch. Good looking ..."
"themovieparadise","9","3","6","11 November 2016"," Phenomenal Movie With Brilliant Performances and Incredible Directing
","This is a phenomenal movie. Say what you will about Mel Gibson as a person, but he is a magnificent director. He navigates this complex and difficult story with ease, knowing the perfect ratio of character-driven moments to war-filled madness. The different aesthetic choices he made, in terms of the tone of the film and his approach to the different aspects of the movie, continue to prove his ability as a director. I'll get more into the war scenes later, but the way he chooses to showcase these sequences is masterful. Sure, we get tons of gory and bloody violence, but never does it feel glorified or for entertainment. It is purely to show the horrors of war and the madness that ensues on the battlefield, and Gibson walked that line perfectly. He also does fantastic things with the character of Desmond Doss, and how he uses other people's reactions to him to tell Desmond's story for him. Gibson easily could have had Desmond give us long, exposition-filled speeches about why he chooses not to kill, and we do get a couple of those, but only when they are absolutely necessary. Instead, Gibson utilizes supporting characters and the environment to paint the picture of why Desmond won't kill. It's a perfect example of show not tell, and I think it ultimately shows Gibson's mastery as a director..."
"jlj9675-1","9","3","6","16 November 2016"," good but loud
","I can safely say I'm glad I saw this film for the truly remarkable and awe-inspiring underlying story. However, it was extremely loud and gory in the battle scenes. I had to cover my ears and look down several times. But the humanitarianism of the central figure and how he came to influence and change the minds of his fellow soldiers was remarkable. I believe both the film and Andrew Garfield deserve Academy Awards. The cinematography of the rural scenes was very good but I was simply astounded during the battle scenes. They were so realistic that many folks in the theater were exclaiming and jumping every few seconds. I was caught up and fearful and often shed tears. It was a very emotional experience for me both in sadness and joy. It truly told a story of the horror of war and one man's effort to help no matter what. I was very moved and inspired to spread peace on earth in whatever way I can as an individual."

This made Pearl Harbor look like Gone With the Wind. Take away the so/so special effects, and over the top gore and you've got a B-Movie at best. <br/><br/>I like Vince Vaughn, but his attempt at channeling R. Lee Ermey's iconic Drill Sargent from Full Metal Jacket was just painful to watch. The scene with the blood in eyes was one of the worst scenes I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>I expected more from a Mel Gibson directed movie. He must be back on the sauce again."
"sonnybatson-57277","1","7","20","19 February 2018"," Is it really all that different...
","To ask others to kill for you as opposed to firing the weapon yourself. There were numerous instances in the movie which depicted a fellow soldier being required to kill in order to save the ""hero"". If anything, this decision to place the burden elsewhere seems less morally defensible. Hypocrisy at the very least."
"Quinoa1984","6","7","20","27 November 2016"," Born to Kill meets Peace.
","Do any of you fine people remember Full Metal Jacket? Pvt. Joker in Vietnam has a helmet that features the words ""BORN TO KILL"" on one part and right by it is a peace symbol. He is asked about it by a superior officer who finds it to be a sick joke, and Joker responds that it's part of the ""duality of man, the whole Jungian thing."" In that sense, Hacksaw Ridge is the most Jungian war movie ever made, and I'm not sure if that's entirely a great thing. It may be fascinating after the fact, that it could be a film that's worth talking about after it ends, but while watching it this dichotomy is bizarre. I think part of this too goes back to Francois Truffaut's quote about war movies, that it's very difficult, close to impossible, to make an anti-war film when the action itself makes war look like a bloody good action movie.<br/><br/>Platoon was one of the only films to be anti-war and have action in it that was well shot and executed. Hacksaw Ridge isn't that really. Its first half actually does, what I found, a decent and compellingly dramatic job of showing this guy Desmond Doss (sic) and how in his upbringing around a drunk PTSD'd father (a terrific Hugo Weaving) and nearly killing his brother (and, later on we learn, his father too in a fight), it's actually clear to see why he would embrace non-violence so strongly. Even if the guy never picked up a Bible in his life, his experiences inform his worldview, it's just that the word on killing- thou shalt not of course- extends to Doss in a way that is his total conviction. He even has a fairly sweet romance with a girl in the film and all that is fine; if anything the first half of the film, including a training sequence with Vince Vaughn in a role that reminds one how he can do dramatic work (and be funny while doing it), is engaging.<br/><br/>But that second half is where Gibson gets to let loose and get into being BLOODY MEL Gibson (ala Bloody Sam Peckinpah, though not anywhere near Peckinpah's real innovations in filming violence in such an eye and rhythm that revolutionized things, this doesn't do that). The battle scenes here could lay claim to being the most gruesome in the history of cinema - at the least somewhere Spielberg has to be going ""damn... that's a bit much"" - and maybe some of that is part of who Gibson is as a (sigh) artist, going back to Braveheart and on through Passion and Apocalypto, a man who seems as compelled to show ALL of the brutality the way that Doss was compelled to never pick up a gun, not once. And objectively, this action is intense and, maybe, in a few moments, exciting and intense as hell.<br/><br/>The message of this character can't help but contradict how this filmmaker sees war, and this dichotomy, again going back to that ""Born to Kill/Peace"" ideal, is taken a little too literally to the point where Mel's/Desmond's man Jesus is taken into account here. Another thing structurally is that Hacksaw Ridge feels its length over almost 2 1/2 hours the most in the final stretch, the last half hour, when Desmond becomes a superhero practically speaking (ironically Gibson in interviews has put down superhero movies of the modern era). Is it true that he saved 75 people at this battle? I take the movie at its word, but there comes a point where it makes its hero SO heroic that it strains credulity. I'm not talking about whether it was true in real life, I mean more-so in the scope of the film's interpretation of it. Not to mention, Gibson *does* indulge in the kind of violence that I have to wonder if the real Desmond Doss would recoil at, including showing a (I think) Japanese general committing Harakiri at the moment of realizing the battle really is over. Uh... okay! <br/><br/>If all you're looking for is a bloody, gory, maggots-all-in-the-corpses-and-there-are-the-rats-too action-war movie, then certainly it's inarguable Gibson delivers, and it's a step up in quality from the (I know I'm alone in this opinion I don't care) schlock that was his last film 10 years ago, Apocalypto. But that split between the hero's convictions, religious or otherwise, and how much this film basically revels in this brutality of the flesh, is hard to take. I felt exhausted by the end of this, for good and bad reasons. 6.5/10"
"allottdave","2","5","13","21 March 2017"," There have probably been worse films released this year, but I've not seen any of them.
","Remember before Private Ryan, when war films were all gung-ho, shooting from the hip, and an inspiring speech was the answer to everything? Hacksaw Ridge is a throwback to those dark days. It's like Mel watched Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers and liked some parts, but didn't really understand the whole, so just stole the best bits without realising that things only work as a whole. It's so stupid that it feels like you're watching a load of kids playing soldiers, it doesn't feel like a glimpse of war. And all that military jargon that was well researched and difficult to understand, like when they come under fire, ""Over there, those bunkers"", or when the sarge gets on the radio to give the enemy position, ""they're straight ahead."" These gems sandwiched between about a dozen ""cover my/his/their/our ass/asses"", and the rather poetic, ""let's go to work"". Just as an example of how gung-ho silly it is, when they take the ridge, about half way through, and then the next morning the Japs counter charge, and hundreds of them pour out of their tunnel network, all the soldiers, who were all laying relatively safely in artillery their holes, and other appropriate cover where they couldn't be shot, all jumped out of them to start shooting at the attackers. Why? Because it might look good on camera. Kids playing soldiers. And yeah, the bit where he carries the upper half of that blokes body with one hand while hip shooting dozen or so Japs with his infinite ammo BAR (in fairness there wasn't a single reload throughout the entire film (no wonder the Americans won the war, they used hax)) was barmy, I just wish I could say it was the silliest thing about the film.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn has a good try at a Sgt Hartman impression though, but it wasn't enough to save the most disrespectful, idiotic film I've seen in a long time. This film portrays WW2 as accurately as working class school life was portrayed in Grange Hill."
"vibetribeweb","3","4","10","12 April 2017"," It Never Ends!!
","This is just another war movie and there's nothing special about it except it attempts to create a ""peaceful war hero"" with its premise. They use a country boy from the South because that lends to the Bible-carrying character that they would have you believe wants to go to war but without a gun. Yeah....... That's what I said too. Ridiculous. We have the stereotypical drunk father and saintly mother for his parents as we've seen in countless other Hollywood narratives, but we are to feel sorry for his father because he too was in a war. That always makes it OK to beat your wife in American movies so the writers play that up to the best of their ability, which is not that impressive and frankly lacking in believability. What would an American warmongering movie be without a love story thrown in to attract the ladies, huh? I mean surely every guy who signs up for war has a beautiful woman waiting for him back home, right?! Well, this crap of a movie is no different, like I told you from the beginning. The hero always has to seem like a coward or at least a weakling until the bullets start flying and then he comes into his own as a courageous bad-ass with no fear. That's here too, in case you were wondering. It's filled with popular actors, American and otherwise, so you'll feel at home with the characters.<br/><br/>This and all other ridiculous American war movies are meant to make YOU want to go and ""serve"" your country with all of the pseudo-patriotic rhetoric that you can stand. It's a narrative needed in order to convince stupid 17 and 18 year olds to go across the oceans to another man's land and get blown to bits to make a few rich white men that own defense companies even richer. If you're white or a sympathizer of the white man's predicament, then you'll most likely want to see this to justify your own savage nature. But if you're a person of color whose people have been at the unpopular end of his bullets, you can safely skip this carnage-filled propaganda-based picture and simply know that when this type of movie is released, you can bet that another war generated by America is coming soon to a war theater NOT near you. ALL white nations will be using subterfuge and ""divide and conquer"" techniques to create fear of non-white peoples(""terrorists"") so that they can justify kicking out non-whites from their pathetic nations that love and adore violence so much. Since you can see violence EVERY night on whatever ""Law and Order""-type show is popular at the moment, I'd suggest saving your money and just watching the carnage on TV instead of buying this crap."

","First of all Mel Gibson welcome back, a simply brilliant piece of cinematography, from minute one until the very end it was completely captivating, portraying what is in truth a very courageous and inspiring true story. Andrew Garfield produces what in my opinion his greatest performance to date his performance as Desmond Doss was nothing short of brilliant his performance and Gibson's performance in directing this masterpiece gave the film not only the credit the truly inspirational story deserved but gave me and everyone a great movie to enjoy. The way the film builds as it goes along keeps you glued to the screen not only drawing you in with the action but the emotion of the film was something to behold and how a act of true courage can inspire a entire country. I must add Vince Vaughn was also brilliant in the film, I had only seen him in comedies before and I was more than impressed with his skills outside of the comedy genre. Definitely a film I will watch again and I recommend you go and watch."

","I watched this movie not really knowing what to expect and I did not even know Mel Gibson directed it (Loved Braveheart) but what a superb moving thought provoking movie.

The courage and determination of the main character was awe inspiring.<br/><br/>The movie told the story brilliantly with a good back story leading into the main action and what action it was. Reminded me of Saving Private Ryan and be warned it is very graphic and pulls no punches to show the horror of war.

"Figgy66-915-598470","10","3","7","8 February 2017"," A brilliant telling of our awful history
","8 February 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Hacksaw Ridge. Everyone should watch films like this. Everyone should share the horrors of war and realise what this world has gone through, what people do to each other and how futile it all is. As the years go on we still keep discovering stories that need to be told and this was definitely in that category. Desmond T Doss was a Seventh-Day Adventist and a CO, a Conscientious Objector, who felt it was his duty to join up not to fight, but to serve in another way. Following the Lord's commandment to the letter telling him thou shalt not kill, he refused to touch a gun, instead demanding he be allowed to go into battle as a medic. Meeting all kinds of resistance he stayed true to his faith and his beliefs and what followed was truly remarkable resulting in Doss becoming the first man in US history to be awarded the medal of honour having never fired a shot. Comparing this film to Saving Private Ryan does both films an injustice. Hacksaw Ridge, in no way detracts from the horror of Private Ryan, but stands out as one of those truly unmissable films. Directed by Mel Gibson, who has done an great job in bringing this tale of heroism to the screen, Hacksaw Ridge, before the bloodshed starts, is almost comedic at times and you find yourself grinning along with Andrew Garfield's infectious smile. Vince Vaughn did a pretty good job in his role as Sargent Howell,and Hugo Weaving was brilliant as Desmond's Father. This is a tale of our recent history, it needs to be told and it must never be forgotten, men like Doss and his beliefs alongside all our military both serving, retired and those no longer with us are the reason we go to work in normal jobs and live our normal lives. Well done!!!!"
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","7","5 February 2017"," Sticking to his guns by refusing to carry them...
","Patton said that no ""bastard"" ever won a war by dying for his country but by making the other poor, dumb bastard die. Well, that wraps it quite well, war is all about death, but to admit it is also to ignore that figures like Desmond Doss existed, and bringing his extraordinary story to the big screen is enough a reason to praise Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>And who would have thought that the 2017 line-up of Oscar-nominated directors would feature him? Oscar pundits expected many first-time nominees such as Chazelle, Jenkins, or Villeneneuve but if there ever was a spot to be occupied by a veteran, it belonged to either Scorsese or Eastwood. I'm glad Hollywood is a more forgiving place than we believed and that the members can see talent when it hit them in the face, to the point of rehabilitating ""Mad Mel"".<br/><br/>Because, there is no doubt that when you finish ""Hacksaw Ridge"", you know there's no director who depicts heart-pounding battle sequences and heart-breaking characters like he does. This is the stuff the Academy can't ignore because it has a superb (true) story, it is well acted and directed and has this 'heart' element that can wow any audience. Comparisons with ""Saving Private Ryan"" are inevitable, but I hold this film in higher consideration because Gibson already proved his talent when it came to handle battle sequences and violence in ""Braveheart"", three years before Spielberg.<br/><br/>But there is a more profound reason to admire ""Hacksaw Ridge"", while it portrays soldiers as heroes, it doesn't demonize the Japanese soldiers either, and we don't cheer at their demise. The movie is a humanistic masterpiece that transcends skin considerations, the fact that Doss also saves Japanese soldiers and that some can be seen committing acts of Bushido, prove that this is not a film about 'winning a war', but about not letting war defeat our humanity. Unfortunately, this aspect was overlooked, as marked by the seal of Gibson's infamy. Well, not only this is one hell of a film, but it is even better because you can tell it's from Gibson.<br/><br/>Desmond Doss was the conscience objector who saved more than seventy lives in one of Okinawa's bloodiest slaughters without ever carrying a rifle, which makes him a purely Gibsonian, so to speak, character, as a vulnerable man caught in existential conflicts but moving forward nonetheless, finding strength in a totally unshakable Christian faith. Maybe that's the sensitive nerve the movie hits, especially from a director whose Christianity was spoiled by a fallacious association with anti-Semitism. But the film isn't about Christian faith, but plain faith, and one driven by positive values. After all, even a non-religious person can admit that ""Thou Shall Not Kill"" is universally humanistic.<br/><br/>Desmond Doss belongs to that category of inspirational characters like Sir Thomas More or Frank Serpico; men who (maybe naively) believed in simple principles but never sold their soul out for the whole world, not even the call of duty. Doss refuses to carry a rifle, but not to go to the battle, as a medic, he won't kill people but save them. Andrew Garfield plays a character whose sweetness, sensibility and optimism contrast with the world he lives in, and he sort of gives you back a faith in humanity, severely undermined by this depressing year, and it tells you something about Gibson, he might seem to insist on violence, but it is always to emphasize the courage of the peaceful side.<br/><br/>Like War, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" reveals both the worst and the best of humanity. This is no nihilistic, apocalyptic movie, the horror in the war scenes is brutal and gory as you might expect and they certainly earned Gibson his directing nod, but overall, the film is about this humble, modest, slender, thin man who wasn't focused on the killing, but on the healing role he could play in the midst of this barbarity. Soldiers' goal is 'death to the enemy' but when they leave the battleground and there's no one to kill anymore, saving lives become the only possible option.<br/><br/>And this is the revelation, when Doss meets his destiny and transcends his condition, praying God, for nothing more than 'saving one more life', a powerful moment that echoes the 'I could have saved more' in ""Schindler's List"". It is quite an extraordinary achievement when the war scenes not only provide the most spectacular moments of the film, but also add to the depth of the characters, and the perception of Doss makes a 180° turn, as he goes from a coward to a living saint. The climax of the film is such a moving and emotional sequence that it redeems all the little flaws.<br/><br/>I wasn't that impressed by the beginning which was pretty sentimental, but I remember I had similar feelings with the first act of Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Still, the back story provided some interesting hints on Doss' pacifist nature, including the personality of Hugo Weaving as his father, a bitter and alcoholic Great War veteran who sealed Doss' defiance toward guns and Teresa Palmer, his understanding fiancée. And when the boot camp sequence kicks off, the film is enriched by the performances of Vince Vaughn as the sergeant, Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington, and then, the final act justifies why the film needed this seemingly conventional start.<br/><br/>Indeed, since when is conventionality a flaw when it comes to portray unconventional characters? Doss is perhaps one of the best revelations of 2016, if everyone respects the WW2 veterans for their courage, they'll admire Doss who made world a better place at a worst possible time. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is the testament to a man's extraordinary moral integrity and the miracle he accomplished ... and a director's unique talent, finally rehabilitated. Maybe an even more impressive miracle."

","Brilliant. <br/><br/>Make love not war .<br/><br/>""In peace sons bury their fathers , in war fathers bury their sons""<br/><br/>Not the film I was expecting at all . Having purposely not read reviews beforehand I was expecting a Hollywood war film saying we are American we are great and promoting the glory of war , glossing over alleged war crimes by the allies and just showing the enemy as evil without any balance portraying their enormous losses of some 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and half the civilian population of 300,000 died as opposed to 20,000 losses on the allied side in total during the three month battle for Okinawa. So I was not expecting to enjoy the film at all and the opening scene confirmed my fear. <br/><br/>However from then on the film took completely different twist. It was a Very sympathetic moral personal journey of the main protagonist sympathetically played by Andrew Garfield . Excellent supporting cast particularly Hugo Weaving as the father . <br/><br/>You grow to really admire Private Doss as do his colleagues eventually , his undoubted heroism shows that there is more than one way to be patriotic . I'm not going to go into more detail so as not spoil the plot but will just say this is a blood and guts war film for people who do not like war films as well as a war film for those who like action with a romantic twist to boot.<br/><br/>The set of Maeda escarpment was excellent and cinematography revolutionary in terms of Its realism and with some irony was similar to the battlefield of Gallipoli , a film that starred Mel Gibson the excellent director of Hacksaw Ridge . <br/><br/>The best three films of 2017 so far have ALL been based on true stories LION , SULLY and HACKSAW RIDGE <br/><br/>If like me you were thinking this wasn't your sort of film don't hesitate , go see it , only two films have surpassed this in 2017 and none of them were Lalaland !"

"searchanddestroy-1","Null","3","7","12 November 2016"," Passion of a soldier
","You can see a parallel with another feature made by Mel Gibson: PASSION OF THE Christ. Instead of Jesus, it is a soldier who is against violence and loves the human kind. You can't hate this movie which is the most powerful, bloody and brutal war movie ever made. A film besides which PRIVATE RYAN look like a Disneyland walk. Yes folks, a terrific piece of work. But... I highly prefer the two Clint Eastwood features from 2006 and 2007: FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and LETTERS FROM IWI JIMA. If you permit, I will explain why. Unlike Clint, who is the king of Hollywood, Mel Gibson must be very careful if he wants to get back into the industry through the main gate after ten years of ostracism because his behavior with booze and antisemitism talks. He can't make a film, a war movie, showing the American Army the same way Eastwood did. If you remember closely the 2006 and 2007 movies, they were not movies glorifying the GI's. Here, in the Gibson film, you see GIs killing Japanese soldiers who surrender, yes, but Japanese soldiers who also throw a hand grenade on the GIs. And in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, the GIs killed the Japs in cold blood, poor Jap soldiers without hand grenades... See what I mean? Clint Eastwood showed less bloody combat scenes, yes, but was closer to reality concerning the rest. There were not movies like this one which shows the war in its most terrifying and disgusting side, but on the other side, glorifies heroism. That disturbs me. You can't say to audiences war is bad and also say that heroism is good. <br/><br/>No, that's a very powerful movie, only a dumb could say the contrary, but I prefer the Eastwood two films and Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON. I persist and sign, I am dead sure that Gibson wants to get back into business and, why not, grabbing an Academy Awards and then proceed, resume his career with his VIKINGS film. That's my own opinion."
"charliesonnyray","9","3","7","12 November 2016"," A Great War Movie That Weaves Fact, Faith, & Fiction
","It's been a while since a good old fashion war movie came out but if it was all building up to Hacksaw then it was totally worth it. Let's be honest: almost every ""based on a true story"" film has some made up parts. If it were completely true then the movie would be pretty boring. But for Hacksaw Ridge, most of it did actually happen and I am a bit shocked it wasn't made into a film earlier. Desmond Dos is a naive southerner who decides to join World War 2 despite the fact that he despises violence. He simply wants to help a unit as a medic but he finds opposition along the way as many believe he is simply a coward. By the end of the film though, he proves himself worthy of the title ""hero"". Andrew Garfield does a wonderful job of playing Desmond as he brings a simple charm to the character. He is very likable and I experienced some of the same emotions he was going through in the film. When he was frustrated, I was frustrated. When he was happy, I was happy for him. It felt like I was actually watching this man's life and not just a movie based on it. The other actors do a great job as well especially Vincent Vaughn who manages to be both funny and dramatic at the same time. The one thing about this film that might hurt it is the violence. The first third of the film is shot very beautifully and looks like an ideal vision of that time period. But the last third is all on top of Hacksaw Ridge which is piled with dead bodies, intestines, rats, blood, decapitated heads, you name it they got it. It works in a story sense because they never portray war as a pretty or fun thing but the film is also filled with Christian themes. Box office wise those Christian messages might have helped the film but because of it's R rating I doubt any youth groups are going to be piling into vans to see it. Which is a shame since the film is honestly a great representation of holding onto your beliefs no matter how others maybe feel about them. Over all, Hacksaw Ridge is a great film with a well structured story, likable characters, beautiful direction and tons of events to keep you entertained."
"doctor_ledo","10","3","7","11 November 2016"," The Creative Mel Gibson Returns
","Desmond Doss with serious faithful sincerity and a ludicrous Southern accent, was the first conscientious objector in his words. It's a movie about a pacifist in wartime that wants to celebrate the subject's moral code while also reveling in the blood and guts of battle. It's a story of faith and humanity told by a man with, let's call them extremely suspect views. It's a movie that seeks to honor an honorable man, but does so at the expense of other honorable men. His father, a traumatized World War I veteran and violent alcoholic, beats Doss and his brother and mother, and Doss fears the same violence within himself. So he swears off guns and violence and clings tightly to his Bible. It's the first movie Gibson has directed since ""Apocalypto"" 10 years ago and i expect he will get Oscar for his directing.the only deficient thing But one surprise, given the drama of pacifism-versus-war that the movie has set up, is that there's never a single scene in which Desmond has to consider violating his principles and picking up a weapon in order to save himself or somebody else. A scene like that would have brought the two sides of ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" the violent and the pacifist — and, implicitly, the two sides of Mel Gibson — crashing together. But that would have been a different movie. One that, in the end, was a little less safe.Good movie and Bravo Great Mel Gibson."

"timdalton007","8","3","7","8 November 2016"," A Visceral, If At Times Clichéd, Piece Of Work
","Real life has always proved to be fruitful ground for filmmakers, dating right back to the beginnings of film. Stories set at times of war, especially those with a heroic angle, have been particular favorites. In a way, Mel Gibson's latest film Hacksaw Ridge follows in that tradition as it recounts the story of Desmond Doss who earned the U.S military's highest award for honor and bravery without ever firing a shot. It's a visceral and at times inspiring tale.<br/><br/>The film is anchored by its lead actor, British actor Andrew Garfield (best known for the title role in the two Amazing Spider-Man movies). Despite being British, Garfield plays the role of a young man coming from Appalachia exceedingly well right down to his accent. Garfield is the film's focus and he plays the various aspects of Doss well from young man in West Virginia to someone who goes on to do something truly incredible. In fact, Garfield's performance is superior to the material he sometimes has to work from but nevertheless remains an often effective and even moving performance.<br/><br/>Having said that, now seems a good moment to talk about the script from writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan. Bringing true stories to the screen is, as I said above, part and parcel of what Hollywood does. That a good deal of the actual events make their way to the screen is something that is commendable though the film's first half sees it engaging it a significant amount of hyperbole and cliché regarding Doss' life before the war as well as his treatment by his Army unit, including a court-martial sequence that is largely a work of fiction. That the film has a strong faith based message to it is clear, though not out of place given both its subject better and it being a real-life story. That the film tries to cite this as part of an ongoing 21st century political narrative of ""a war on Christians"" come across quite hollow and does the film no favors.<br/><br/>Indeed the film really finds its feet when it moves on to firmer territory: the Battle of Okinawa and the attempt to take the titular Hacksaw Ridge. Though it seems to condense things down to a single day and night, by and large this part of the film faithfully tells Doss' truly incredible efforts during one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific theater of war. Not that events needed much hyperbole because the facts alone are incredible enough. Gibson as director presents a visceral portrait of battle, one that is free of more traditional war film heroics but most certainly full of 'the fog of war' and which finds moments of absolute terror as well. For all the faults with the first half of the film, it's latter half makes for compelling viewing. <br/><br/>Though it isn't always easy viewing. This portion of the film is not for the faint of heart as Gibson, who showed he was not afraid of gore in his two earlier outings as director, used it to full effect here. Here though it is used in service of conveying an incredible real story from the comparative recent past and which helps to convey the magnitude of what Doss went through. It speaks to the skills of not Gibson as director but to the stunt, effects, and make-up teams in bring this harrowing vision to life.<br/><br/>Indeed from a purely production side of things, the film is solid. The production design and costumes do a very nice job of recreating America on the brink of and during the Second World War even before it gets to the battlefield. The cinematography of Simon Duggan is something to behold across the length of the film as it takes in not just the inherent natural beauty of Appalachia but half a world away to the bombed out island of Okinawa. It's also interesting that the film doesn't put much reliance on CGI effects or at least on all too apparent ones. The results make for a solid recreation of the era as well as a well produced film.<br/><br/>That phrase could very well sum up Hacksaw Ridge as a film. It's a well produced piece of work with a compelling and believable performance from its leading an. Though the film's first half often delves too far into the bags of hyperbole and cliché, the second half of the film becomes one of the most visceral and inspiring pieces of film-making in recent memory. it may not be a perfect film but it is definitely a good one that is more than worthy of viewing."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","4","11","4 February 2017"," Mel Gibson's near-triumphant come-back
","Not one of my favourite war films, like 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Paths of Glory', 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Apocalypse Now', but exceptionally well made and incredibly powerful.<br/><br/>It has been said about 'Hacksaw Ridge' that the second half is better than the first half, something that is agreed with by me. Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.<br/><br/>Just that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).<br/><br/>However this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).<br/><br/>Throughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.<br/><br/>For a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"svorva","7","4","11","21 November 2016"," Cheesy, Unquestionably Works
","You must give the movie a rating. No choice. Those little stars are the first thing everyone sees and for many the last. Today, that's not what I am worried about. My concern is I will look back, see all those pretty stars, and feel like a complete sucker.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is the true story of ""conscientious cooperator"" Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Doss felt compelled to follow his brother and countless others by serving in WWII, but his religious beliefs not only prevent him from killing, but even carrying arms. This causes friction within the 307th Infantry, where many believe his convictions violate the code that binds the unit. Doss remains indomitable despite persecution from all sides and is able to participate as a medic at the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>This story breaks a popular war movie paradigm. Hacksaw Ridge defies the natural pro/con label, even refuting the classic argument that all war films glorify violence by making it exciting. Doss is a hero because he refuses to let the war happen to him. This transcendence inspires his comrades. Many people like to reject war heroes, but Doss aspires to a higher notion: that one must always remain truth to oneself. On a more mechanical note, Hacksaw Ridge is beautifully shot. The combat scenes feel like half the film, but they are always vivid, intense, and uncompromisingly graphic. It is a spectacular break from recent superhero action. I have grown tired of your Wolverines and ilk eviscerating countless nameless without an ounce of blood or consequence. Combat in Hacksaw Ridge might over utilize slow motion and overly dramatic scenarios, but it was never unexciting.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is going to earn some comparisons to classics like Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan. This will be complete madness. Hacksaw Ridge, for all its qualities, is about as sophisticated and nuanced as American cheese on Ritz crackers. Desmond Doss is the Simple Man. A touch slow and awkward with women, but otherwise immaculate. Doss drops the smile once, when the army denies him a pass to attend his own wedding as an act of intimidation. Oh yeah, there is a female lead. She is blond, blue-eyed, and perfect. Their courtship is also perfect. The only grey character in the entire film is Doss' father (Hugo Weaving), but grey in a Hollywood way. He is a veteran of WWI who lost all his comrades and turned to drinking. Highly original. The unit itself is never really developed. There is one humorous scene when the crew first meet, but for the rest of the movie they are collective plot points. First they haze Doss, then they are won over, and finally they become the men he must save. The enemy are also surprisingly dehumanized in this increasingly politically correct world. The Japanese are evil, psychopathically violent, and exotic. Most notable is an act of Seppuku intercut with combat. Certainly dramatic, but equally derivative and exploitive. And despite all of my whining, Hacksaw Ridge unquestionably works. The story is not forced, as if it needs to be told. Desmond Doss is a hero. The war is beautiful and terrible. Each image of Doss scaling a ridge with his brother, his wife, his comrades, and the final shot, all work. Despite the cheesiness, Hacksaw is in a better class of war movies."

"Leofwine_draca","10","2","4","10 September 2017"," War movie masterwork
","Mel Gibson is a director with two masterpieces behind him - the superlative BRAVEHEART and the even better APOCALYPTO. Sadly, due to his ridiculous pillorying in the press and subsequent ostracising in Hollywood, he hasn't directed a film for a decade, but now he's back with HACKSAW RIDGE, the true story of a pacifist who joined the US army and took part in the Battle of Okinawa as a medic. The good news? Gibson hasn't lost his touch (of course), and this is his third masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story is traditional but keeps you watching via perfectly mannered performances and heartfelt storytelling. There's childhood experience followed by romance, and then training in the army. The first half of the film is something like a courtroom drama and it keeps you watching, but things don't get amazing until we move to the battle. The second half of the film is among the best war movie experiences I've ever had; the battle scenes are fast, brutal, incredibly realistic and expertly choreographed. They blow Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN out of the water and left me feeling exhausted at the end of them.<br/><br/>It says something about Gibson that he elicits such fine acting from his players. Andrew Garfield embodies the lead in every respect, Hugo Weaving convinces as his alcoholic father, and even Vince Vaughn is decent. Sam Worthington and Richard Roxburgh show up as superiors, but it's unknown actors like Luke Bracey who really shine. The film is gory and graphic and quite disturbing, and the build-up to the action frightened me in ways that few horror films do. There's sentiment here too, but it's never over the top or twee. Gibson should be proud of this exemplary achievement."
"bkoganbing","8","2","4","3 April 2017"," The 'using kind of religion'.
","I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. <br/><br/>Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn't sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.<br/><br/>Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan's country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the 'using kind of religion'. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold."
"TheJediWay9","9","2","4","8 March 2017"," ""Hacksaw Ridge"" Is A Return To Form From Mel Gibson, Showcasing The Bloodshed Of War
","""Hacksaw Ridge"" is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss, an American Army solider in World War II who, for various reasons, believed that though the war was justified he could not kill anyone and saved 75 men behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair for this film, and say what you want about him but he makes some damn good films. I was really excited for Hacksaw Ridge. Not only had I heard good things about it, but it won a couple of Oscars and Mel Gibson was directing. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see this one in the theaters but I wish I did.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a return to form for Mel Gibson, showcasing the life of Desmond Doss and providing a glimpse of the horrors and bloodshed of war.<br/><br/>What really worked in this movie was the acting. I wasn't a huge fan of Garfield as Spider-Man but this guy proved me wrong. He did a very good job as Desmond Doss, portraying him in a way where I think only he could pull this off. Vince Vaughn surprisingly doesn't play his usual Vince Vaughn self. He is very effective as an army sergeant and has some good timing with his comedic lines.<br/><br/>When the battle happens, it's brutal and that's ways been something that Gibson has done very well with. We know that WWII was not pleasant, and this battle certainly wasn't pleasant. The thing I like about it is that it doesn't give you time to digest it all. It throws you into the battle, right in the heat of things, and you aren't able to catch your breath. From here on out the film is intense. The battle of Hacksaw Ridge has to be one of the most intense battles in cinematic history. <br/><br/>One flaw I was the pacing. It took half the movie to get to what we really wanted to see. I understand you are setting up backstory and characters, but there had to be more to the battle. The battle just kind of ends on a low note. It felt strange. It was almost like there was a complete section of the film of that was cut out.<br/><br/>Overall, very solid and I am going to give ""Hacksaw Ridge"" an 8.9/10"
"saketkt","7","2","4","3 March 2017"," Hacksaw Ridge
","Lately, I had some free time, and I decided to spent it in my old way- binge watching. Hacksaw was on my list from the moment I saw the trailer. Add to it, I read good reviews in a daily. Andrew Garfield has a smirk on his face, that is annoying, during the entire length of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie is about a man who has this personal code of his. He wont fight, he wont do wrong, he wont hold a gun. Two incidents portrayed in this movie shaped him to be as he is today. With an attitude like that, Garfield is an outcast. He is different. America enters into war. Having a father who was a veteran in the war, Garfield should expect some cajoling to not join the army. But the euphoria gets him. He wants to serve. But he does not want to break his code. So he decides to enroll and serve as a medic. His visits to hospital fascinated him and yes he found Palmer. Garfield and his values make him an aberration. Nobody likes aberration. He is given tough time in training. Although sound, an army unit needs each and every member to follow orders and act consistently. It is as strong as its weakest member. But then again diversity does some good. It helps you think. Garfield is thrown into war, without his gun. He runs around battlefield saving soldiers in scores. He has his bible with a photo of beautiful Palmer which is a source of constant motivation and reminder to do good and get back home safely- not sure about the last part. Garfield is the first person to receive medal of honor without lifting a gun. It definitely motivates people to follow their heart. The problem comes when you think too much.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good movie. It was not boring. The war scenes are well shot and choreographed. And you have Vince Vaughan! A few scenes do send goosebumps....so i will recommend a watch.<br/><br/>My favorite moment is clichÃ©d, and it is the lowering of injured soldiers from the ridge by Garfield in face of grave danger-one man army. Reminds me of Rambo."

"majaho21","9","2","4","15 February 2017"," It has it all - a great film!!!
","At the moment when I watched the very first second of the trailer, I knew I had to watch this film. First, it was directed by Mel Gibson which was a great sign that it would to be a hit(although I still don't understand his talking-to-beaver role :) Then, it was based on a true heroic story and it has a lot of action. Since Mel Gibson is a master of directing war and action scenes, the film had a big chance of becoming as successful as Braveheart. In my opinion, they're equally good. *SPOILERS* What I liked about the film is that you can really relate to all the Doss's feelings. Andrew Garfield did a great job of expressing his inner self. The audience can feel every slightest change in his tone of voice and every look. When he is in love, you feel his joy. When they beat him in the barrack, you feel his pain. And you fear for his life when he's under fire. What I also like is the sense of true brotherhood between soldiers depicted in the film. They were afraid when they saw a cart of corpses - their fellow American soldiers. They knew that they could be next in just a few minutes or hours. So, they paid them respect, they took off their helmets and they bowed. There is a thin line between life and death at the battlefield. The structure of the film is interesting. It starts with a playful and romantic Desmond who starts to feel a duty to protect his homeland. Along the way he meets his future wife. The beginning is idyllic and colourful. Then the film shifts to the military green. Desmond knew that he had once made a promise and that he had to keep it at all cost - He Will take no lives - not even in the battlefield. Desmond grew up at this point and took the responsibility of protecting his fellow soldiers. The third part is action, action, action! The grayish, burnt land, bullets everywhere, exploding mines and grenades and amid all this craziness there is a man without a gun helping others and saving lives. It is hard to believe that this kind of a brave man ever existed. A true hero!"
"Reno-Rangan","8","2","4","14 February 2017"," On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.
","The film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.<br/><br/>It was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.<br/><br/>The story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.<br/><br/>He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.<br/><br/>He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"higherall7","8","0","0","13 May 2020"," AMAZING SPIDERMAN ON HACKSAW RIDGE!
","I knew of Andrew Garfield's prior portrayal as Peter Parker AKA Spiderman in the movie THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012). I thought this movie was a marvelous evolution to a more adult character dealing with similar themes.<br/><br/>What came to mind, perhaps oddly, while I was watching this movie, was the issue of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN Comic Book #4. How one could transition out of adolescence reading that, to this more adult version of earning the respect of one's peers without sacrificing one's principles or values. This film also made me flash briefly about THE LAST ANGRY MAN (1959) with Paul Muni, another work of the cinema about an individual who could stick to his ideals.<br/><br/>The meditations on the virtues of violence versus non-violence are presented with better balance than in the uber brutal THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004), and the ending is truly exhilarating. What makes it all the more astounding is its roots in fact. The characters all seemed like people I would know in the neighborhood, facing real life issues with the intensity of inner conflicts that sometimes boil over and explode.<br/><br/>There's no use beating around the bush about this; while I'm no particular fan of Sex and Violence in the narrative, Gibson's handling of the chaos and atrocities of war are the work of a master craftsman here. There is the sense of a growing rationale and aesthetic sensibility to his treatment of horrifics that tempts one to revisit APOCALYPTO (2006), and even THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. There is a well-reasoned exploration of the male ethic that demands consideration in HACKSAW RIDGE.<br/><br/>The movie is framed in the deliberations of social responsibility and romance. When it closes with the death defying heroics of an action hero, saving lives instead of taking them, it feels like the character study of Desmond Doss has come full circle to a satisfactory conclusion. Hugo Weaving shows a surprising range as the father Tom Doss, and the chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer as his love interest and future wife, Dorothy Shutte, is palpable and real. The rest of the ensemble of supporting characters is nearly seamless from Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell to Rachel Griffiths as Desmond's mother, Bertha, among all the others."
"Tom_the_Bomm","10","0","0","8 May 2020"," Underrated, Misunderstood
","Great movie. Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job once again. He surpasses the typical Hollywood garbage of recent years; this is how movies should be made.<br/><br/>One strange thing is that many seem to interpret this as a pacifist film. While it does have some of those elements, I would disagree. The film shows Desmond Doss's opinions, but it also shows the unique circumstances that brought them about. Him joining the war is shown as something good, and the fellow soldiers he saves are not shown as committing evil acts while they are killing. In fact, while war is shown as an evil, it is also shown that there is great nobility in the sacrifices the men make for their country and goodness. The pacifism of Desmond Doss is in no way preachy, and he makes no effort to force his views on others. His seems to be the moral side of pacifism, not an objective belief that all killing is evil, but a personal belief forbidding it; akin to the personal beliefs some hold against drinking alcohol.<br/><br/>My respect to the real Desmond Doss"

"CubsandCulture","10","0","0","9 February 2020"," The best film I have seen dealing with the liberty of conscience.
","This film reminds me of, of all things, a macho version of A Man for All Seasons. In my mind it isn't even primarily a war film but instead a legal (or philosophical) drama. Don't get me wrong there is a ton of war film elements to this film; of course Gibson crafts them to play out in an intense way. There's the requisite blood and guts to capture the horror of war. But the main thrust of the story is Doss's convictions around serving in the military while being a contentious objector.<br/><br/>Much like A Man for All Seasons the film contains several quasi-Socratic dialog scenes explicitly about Doss's views and his interlocutors trying to pin him down to something. I.e. one sequence concerns the army trying to kick him out under mental defect. No one is able to get Doss to change his mind and the scenes have a wonderful philosophical edge to them. It should be noted that one scene-the one in prison-seems to be consciously lifted from Seasons. In any case, the portrayal of Doss's views are engaging and finally moving. I also like that the script was smart enough to include a couple of story beats that raise the possibility that Doss's didn't meet his own standards perfectly. It helped the film avoid falling into the sanctification of Doss.<br/><br/>Probably the best aspect of this through is just how non-theoretical Doss treats his conviction to not bare arms. And just as importantly his conviction to serve as a medic. There's a couple of scenes involving intense emotional experiences between Doss and his family, especially his father. The resulting material ends up portraying Doss's convictions as post-moral theory (or premoral theory). They are merely something he *feels* deeply. The irony of the film being built around how to accommodate convictions *reasonably* while treating the convictions as something beyond reason is a deeply moving aspect of the whole enterprise. The film really does grapple with the weighty issues at the heart of Doss's story.<br/><br/>The film does not work with Garfield. He is simply wonderful in this. Real, sensuous, sincere, utterly convicted and above all *earnest* His performance is utterly moving and powerful and endearing. So much of the film is about Doss's inner life and you really get a deep sense of it despite all the other elements Garfield has to convey.<br/><br/>This is such a striking film and story. Gibson for all his faults does it justice."

","I like the fact that Mel developed a formative attitude in Australia, before he made it big time in the U.S. It seems that this secret grounding that Aussies have in their personalities, lingers in his psyche. So this is probably why it allows him to pull a rabbit out of a hat and hit a home run. One minute he gets remembered for running amok and the next minute he is lauded as a genius personified. Mel hits lots of home runs and that should not be underestimated when something has his name attached to it. I have nothing to say about the movie, as lots of others will tell you about it. I just want to add my two cents worth and say that if it is a movie made by Mel, I will watch it. Regardless of the subject matter I am always highly confident that Mel's movies will be good to great to perfect."

I remember playing call of duty 1 remember one part where there where not enough guns and the play was just given bullets n told to run behind some one with a gun so if he died i got a gun n had extra ammo we were just cannon fodder.

","The Second World War has been exposed for decades in the world of cinema, however, the quality films of the Second World War have been gradually declining with the passing of the years in these modern times. It was somewhat unexpected to know that a film with brutal combat sequences and a rather sensitive subject would come out and become one of the best films about the Second World War. Hacksaw Ridge is that sensational movie.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's direction is welcome with open arms; he manages to create a fantastic film with excellent performances, stellar script, fantastic cinematography and some exciting and intense combat scenes that give him all the merit of being able to consolidate as a good director. The movie is not just another action movie for the huge list; it is a fantasy war movie designed to present an emotional and realistic story about the harsh reality of combat, with or without weapons. As the film takes to the big screen the story of Desmond Ross, the first conscientious objector to receive a medal of honor in history. The film portrays his life shortly before World War II and the events that led him to win the medal of honor during combat. It is an intense, original film with fantastic scenes that are worth watching again and again. Undoubtedly a nice gift for those fans of the genre who have been waiting long enough for good movies within this category. Hacksaw Ridge is that worthy movie."

","10 years after the film '' Apocalypto '', Mel Gisbon comes back with a new master-piece entitled '' Hacksaw Ridge '', which is inspired by a true story of Desmond Doss. The young male-nurse wanted to go to fight on Okinawa's battlefield but he refused to commit the ultimate sin : to take the life of somebody.
During the first hour of the film, we focus on Desmond Doss's character, particulary his relation with his father, the fact he wants to engage for the war, his relationship and his life on Fort Jackson.
Then comes the second part of the film, we assist to incredible and more realistic scenes of the history of cinema.
This humanistic film is caracterized by the duality between the innocence and the faith of Desmond Doss. This duality is present from the beginning of the film, with and carefree Desmod and some clues which tell us that the forehead call is here. The cast is excellent and the actors's game is irreproachable : Teresa Palmer, Vincent Vaughn, Saw Worthington, Hugo Weaving. The character of Desmond is represented as a salvator heroes by his actions and convictions, but also his faith for humanity. 
The negative point of this movie is that the romance is too present for a film focalized on war.

","'Hacksaw Ridge' (sounds like a good horror movie!) is a World War II film that does an admirable job of spending almost half the film in America, before they even ship off to Japan to fight. This gives us plenty of time to meet Desmond Doss (Garfield) and his family and find out how/why he ticks. He decides he can't sit by why others go off to defend America, but he also conscientiously objects to killing another human, so can't use any weapons. Big moral dilemma and the film deals with it well. It also gives us time to care about some of the other characters in the unit, so we know who's who when the fighting starts.<br/><br/>It's kind of amazing Mel Gibson has only directed five films, considering two of them (Braveheart' and 'Apocalypto') are classics - with this film soon to join them. He could turn into the next Eastwood... He also knows his way around a war film, having been in 'Gallipoli', 'Air America' and 'We Were Soldiers', so it's no surprise 'Hacksaw Ridge' is handled expertly. It's nice to see him populate the film with quality Australian actors (it was filmed in Sydney) - Weaving as Doss' dad, Griffiths as his mum, Worthington as his Captain, Palmer as his girlfriend, Nable as a Lieutenant, Bracey as his nemesis and Roxburgh as the Colonel.<br/><br/>When they do arrive at Okinawa, Japan, obviously all hells breaks loose, with some great shots of the artillery explosions, then the chaos of bullets, grenades and blood - certainly no punches pulled when it comes to the body count or the gore shown. The scenes with Doss rescuing dozens of his injured comrades from the battlefield are astounding. Garfield really shines as Doss and it hits home how much of a hero he was - highlighting that there's always room for some good in the harsh world."
"gingerrdriley","5","5","16","11 December 2016"," This film is okay
","This film is unexceptional in many ways but I think exceeds in some areas.<br/><br/>The acting is fine. Andrew Garfield is good, though the character is not one which really gives him much room to display a whole lot of nuance given how simply he is written. There is nothing wrong with the character per say, just that it can be a little underdeveloped. Speaking of underdeveloped characters, the romantic interest in this film is completely bland and pointless. The girl that Andrew Garfield's character is with comes across more like a prop than an actual character and there was no sense that she had any other motivation besides serving the arc of the main character. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned everyone did fine and Hugo Weaving completely stole the show.<br/><br/>As far as the film making is concerned Mel Gibson is competent in most everything. There was a choice he made for the audio though which came across as a bit goofy. I understand the effect that it's meant to have on the scenes they're in, but they end up being executed in a way which sort of has an opposite effect. The one way in which Gibson really excels is in his portrayal of violence. It is frank and shocking. He really goes the extra mile to illustrate the horrors of the battlefield and given the arc of the main character it greatly compliments the war part of the film to show the consequences of war in gut wrenching detail. Overall though, I don't think that the stunning violence is really worth it to see this film in its entirety, and it might be best to either pass or if you do decide to watch it, skip any of the romance because those scenes are pretty much worthless and add nothing to the story."

","the movie seemed quite unfair to Japan, they were brave soldiers who fought for their country, so hearing that victory song along the scene were the US soldiers were fighting the Japs and killing them was just sad. If the director believed in ""not using the weapons"" the song would not seem so victorious when great men died fighting for their country, even if they eventually lost. Moreover, If The weapon did not exists in the US Army as what Doss wanted, HE would have died, because at the end the Japs followed him to the end of the ""cliff"" and were surprised by the numerous numbers of Soldiers fighting back with weapons and saving Doss. All in all, the movie was not interesting, he has childhood trauma, he grows up, serves in the army, he is a hero. All men who fought are heroes, It is not by the number of men saved, or killed, It is about sacrificing your life to save your country, whether you died of fever during your time in the army, or saved 100 men on duty. I therefore rate this movie a 6 for the awesome graphics."
"simonetti-33557","5","3","8","22 April 2017"," Mel Gibson shouldn't have taken so much creative freedom
","First of all, my review is not a reflect of Desmond Doss' actions, life, bravery or courage. He is unarguably a hero, a man who deserves our utmost respect, admiration and gratitude. <br/><br/>My review is about the movie, knowing the little I know about about Mr. Doss, and, having said that, this review IS a reflection of Mel Gibson as a (bad) director. <br/><br/>The first thing that came to my mind after watching the movie is: this is not how it happened at all. This movie is a fiction (loosely) based on a real character, who happens to be a MOH hero, because there are just too many inconsistencies with actual events. Those who have read about Desmond Doss will agree with me that: (a) some facts where exposed in wrong chronological order in the movie; (b) in real life, by the end of the battle for Hacksaw Ridge, Cpl. Doss was in terrible shape and his arm had been shattered by a Japanese sniper shot (he later lost a lung and five ribs due to injuries sustained during his tour); (c) many other events in the movie never took place (such as the military trial); and I could go on and on.<br/><br/>Why Mel Gibson did that is unknown, because the actual events that led to Cpl. Doss being shipped home before the end of the was where a lot more tragic and would (unfortunately) make a much better movie. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is an actor who I admire more often than not, but it seems that he was trying just too hard in this movie, and that made his portrayal of Cpl. Doss quite unrealistic."
"pinokiyo","5","3","8","23 February 2017"," Overrated. Prequel to Silence? Andrew Garfield plays EXACT religious role
","It's really odd Andrew Garfield stars in this film playing a passionate religious guy (and it also happens to be against the Japanese) - the same exact character/circumstance for him starring, and released the same time, as Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" film. <br/><br/>In the film ""Silence"", he refuses to step on the cross of Jesus. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", he refuses to hold a rifle because he does not believe in killing/ten commandment. In both films, he faces a dilemma on what he passionately believes can also cost the lives of others. <br/><br/>The true story is inspiring, but the film, when it comes to the production/presentation, it is more of a video game comedy, cliché, typical Hollywood making all over it. <br/><br/>This is definitely no ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", directed by Clint Eastwood, is a much more powerful production (his other film, ""American Sniper"" was horrible, though). I don't really care for war movies but ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" really was engaging. <br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is really on the same level as ""American Sniper"" - the ending presentation is even the same. The battle scenes are shot more like video games and it is overly dragging. They're both overrated films, honestly. <br/><br/>The CG effects are just plain awful. It seems like they hired a really poor special effects team or didn't have the budget for the Battleship Navy firing the missiles - it just looks like a video game CG and it looks so horrible/out-of- place. It would look so much better if they just go back to the old school life- like miniature models and fire actual explosives on it; that would honestly would look better and more believable... CG totally takes you out of the film. <br/><br/>I'm sure kids these days playing Call of Duty or whatever war game is out would watch this and think the battle scenes are ""cool"" and give the movie an immediate 10 rating.....<br/><br/>Personally, ever since ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down"", there hasn't really been a revolutionary cinematography of a war zone. <br/><br/>This film just doesn't have that authentic realism feel but more over-the-top (Vince Vaughn as a Sergeant) Hollywood presentation and just video-game cliché scenarios (kicking grenades/using dead body as a shield while machine gunning everyone). <br/><br/>It has a current rating of 8.3/10. This film is definitely not a 10. It's a 6 at best (I'm giving it a 5), only because the true story is rather touching. <br/><br/>The film is really cliché (show flashback of being a kid, meets girl/wife, starts out training in camp, go to battle.) and it really doesn't add anything new to war movies production wise or storytelling, other than that single plot point being a medic who doesn't want to fire a gun. <br/><br/>The whole camp scene in the beginning is a rather drag, that's been done better in ""Full Metal Jacket"". I know Vince Vaughn is added as a comedic element humor to the film, but it really takes away the seriousness of the film. <br/><br/>The whole subplot of his drunken father, the wife, it feels more like a TV episode that feels incomplete... the film just feels like not much really happened and feels rushed. The battle scenes drag on too long as well. <br/><br/>It's an OK war movie, but definitely not Oscar-worthy or to be considered one of the greatest war movies of all- time."

It seemed to try and be too much like Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon at many different points. It really didn't seem to be anything new, other than the insanely long action sequences that looked great, but also felt like a bit of a sensory overload.<br/><br/>Additionally, the dialogue was incredibly and unbelievably cheesy, mostly between Desmond and Dorothy. I just couldn't buy it. At first I couldn't take Vince Vaughn seriously simply because he's Vince Vaughn, but he grew on me as the film progressed. Either way the acting was all just OK, nothing notable. The main character I found to be really whiny and unlikable for the most part. Everything he said made me cringe.<br/><br/>Lastly, there were a few dream sequences the main character had that felt random and unfitting.

","After hearing so many glowing reviews I caught this yesterday and wasn't disappointed. Mel Gibson might be a bit of a dick, but we have missed him as a director. Here he is at his sentimental best, holding back no punches in his personal views and making a pretty good damned film to go with it. Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who still wanted to do his bit in WW2, and how he works during one of the wars bloodiest battles. I've never been a massive Andrew Garfield fan. Oh the boy can act, but he always has this look of someone who is hurt, pining for a lost love. He has always looked weak to me. In this he has grown up though. It's ironic that it takes a film where he won't hold a rifle to show that he is indeed a man, a telling tale for the world today. This is a film where everyone is just great, and it has a cast where that's the last thing you expect. Vince Vaughan is the rough and ready drill sergeant, with Sam Washington as the Captain in charge. Special mention needs to go to Theresa Palmer (so underrated, loving her more and more in everything she is in) and most of all Hugo Weaving, who may well garner an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a broken father. The film does tug on the heart strings and probably takes some of the truths with a pinch of salt but this is exactly the kind of film we need in today's political climate. It is directed with maturity and gusto. Mel is a director not afraid to get his hands dirty and when the action is needed, he is among st the best in a realistic portrayal."

If so, if wouldn't disappoint me a bit. <br/><br/>I was extremely impressed with Andrew Garfield's performance as Desmond Doss. He comes across as genuine to the character he played. The movie may have a few too much pyrotechnics during that battle scenes. But, on the other hand, I think they were necessary to make this real-life hero's actions come to life. And, the battle scenes are well-balanced with Doss's background story. I can only think of 2 other movies that portray Metal of Honor winners: To Hell and Back and Sergeant York. And, this movie compares favorably to those movies. The story rings true about a real World War II war hero who refused to carry a gun in battle- -ever."
"asifahsankhan","8","3","8","26 January 2017"," Mel Gibson Reaches Toward Redemption with a wounding and phenomenally effective Hacksaw Ridge
","Mel Gibson may not generally be a decent executive, but rather he's never a moronic one. His Hacksaw Ridge, is limit and viable, a photo vigilantly made for greatest impact: Whatever nuance it gets originates from its grapple execution by Andrew Garfield, who plays Desmond T. Doss, a genuine World War II trooper who—as a pacifist— declined to convey a weapon however whose boldness spared the lives of no less than 50 men in his unit amid the Battle of Okinawa. <br/><br/>What could have pulled in Mel Gibson to the tale of Desmond Doss, a man whose offbeat religious convictions made him an untouchable among his companions, yet who, once the framework had figured out how to grudgingly suit him, functioned ponders and spared souls through sheer drive of conviction? Desmond was a dedicated Seventh Day Adventist and radical who served as a US Army doctor at Okinawa, sparing 75 lives while never lifting a weapon – and the inquisitively perfect subject for what is verifiable and what's going to be seen as Gibson's rebound motion picture. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is an incredibly moving and wounding war film that hits you like a crude topside of hamburger in the face – a sort of essential shaded Guernica that twists on an extra large screen with a group. It is Gibson's first film as a Director since Apocalypto in 2006 – and, all the more appropriately, since a series of embarrassments and open disrespects detoxified his profession in the years that took after. <br/><br/>Its account of an untouchable discovering reclamation through superhuman levels of agony is unadulterated Gibson: you could even call it the third part of an informal set of three that likewise takes in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ (2004), with the exception of you sense Gibson will return in future to this story over and over, maybe as a result of a profound situated doubt it might likewise be his. <br/><br/>It likewise owes a critical obligation to Gallipoli (1981), the Peter Weir First World War epic in which Gibson won his first routine driving man part. In Hacksaw Ridge, that part is taken by Andrew Garfield, an on-screen character who has never struck me as remotely Gibson-like before – however here, his pushed-up hair, foolishly great looking components and nervous physicality sum, intentionally or something else, to a resemblance that is excessively uncanny, making it impossible to disregard. <br/><br/>The fundamental distinction is the voice, which Garfield makes high and mindful, nearly Forrest Gump-like. In connection to the hard world around him, Desmond is a man Topsy-turvey – in spite of the fact that the case of his beyond any doubt heart-ed confidence will bit by bit convey others around to his edge. <br/><br/>Not that the story was light on religiosity in any case, yet Gibson doesn't spell on Christian imagery, bringing stigmata-like injuries, a drop underneath the earth and a sun-haloed climb to his legend's close to home Passion on the field of fight. <br/><br/>War is hell-fire, yet through Hacksaw Ridge, Gibson figures out how to harrow it. There's great power in the blood."
"ctowyi","8","3","8","19 January 2017"," Mel Gibson is back! Incredibly satisfying movie. This is amazing cinema but not for the faint-hearted.
","This is blunt but absolutely effective, loud but quietly tender, derivative but fetchingly sincere, cheesy but earnest to the core. Mel Gibson didn't even try to be subtle with the themes - everything, including spilled bloody guts and other anatomy, is splashed on your full-alert consciousness. Heck! The movie has no shades of grey but yet he delivers with a true story so amazing that my heart swelled up like a balloon. This is one of the most harrowing war stories ever put on screen and it is definitely not for the faint-hearted. This one truly earns its M18 rating and it wears its crimson heart on its sleeve, a blood-soaked tribute to courage, patriotism and following one's principles in the face insurmountable odds. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson sure loves stories about men of faith getting their insides turned out. The irony of a man refusing to bear arms but yet wants to serve his country is right up his usual alley. For all its cloying melodrama, he got the casting absolutely right. Andrew Garfield is simply outstanding in the role of a conscientious ""cooperator"". His genial smile hiding a resounding resolve to adhere to his religious beliefs no matter what. Garfield manages to find the right balance of inner strength and vulnerability. His early scenes of being smitten by a nurse named Dorothy is heartwarmingly sincere. It is a credit to Garfield's moving portrayal that the romantic scenes don't feel manufactured. The movie takes its time to build Desmond's world so that we understand the soul-shattering decisions he would make later on. Elsewhere, Hugo Weaving as Desmond's father is especially potent and I will bet he gets a nomination at the Oscars. Vince Vaughn as Sgt Howell and Sam Worthington as Captain Glover are very effective too. <br/><br/>The film is neatly divided into two halves and it is in the second half we get the namesake money shots. I have always felt Saving Private Ryan is the benchmark for depicting the gut-churning reality of the frontline of war, but Hacksaw Ridge comes incredibly close in usurping it, losing out by a whisker. Gibson pulled zero punches here and we are treated to exploding human viscera in visceral and gory details. This almost crossed into the horror genre, but thankfully the first half pays its dividends here. In the midst of the mayhem and carnage, the human element in the stupidity of war is kept front and centre. Gibson has wring the source material for all it is worth and more. <br/><br/>This is an incredibly satisfying and thought provoking story. I have my doubts I can even hold on to my precepts and beliefs in the eye of a maelstrom, but it is such a great feeling to know it can be done by someone so scrawny and big-hearted like Desmond Doss. This feels like a blueprint for living one's life.<br/><br/>""Please Lord, please help me get one more. Help me get one more.""<br/><br/>Last night I slept with that line on repeat in my mind."

","Mel Gibson is a director who comes back every few years or so and just blows me away. In 2006, I was amazed by Apocalypto. I still watch that film from time to time because its so riveting, damning, and beautiful. When Hacksaw Ridge was announced I was excited. I tend to get very drawn into well made war films. I knew with Mel, I'd likely see and experience something that would be very worth the watch.<br/><br/>The film is about the real life story of Desmond T. Doss, an army medic who refused to hold a gun or fight the opposition during World War II in the Battle of Okinawa. His bravery, resolve, and willpower to save his fellow comrades makes for such an inspiring story, if projected successfully onto the screen. Andrew Garfield has had one hell of a year. To go from the lead in the atrocious Amazing Spider-Man films to starring in a Scorsese and Mel Gibson epic; its one hell of a leap. He's faultless in this. Doss is a kind hearted simple man whose passion is to help those who are in dire need of help.<br/><br/>We are first subjected to young Doss growing up in a rather abusive household. We get to see how Doss had become a pacifist and how he met the love of his life. There is nothing with what is seen here. Its arguably slow, however its sweet and takes you back to a love story from WWII. Its good stuff. The film just keeps getting better from here. We then see Doss during training and how his lifestyle causes his infantry to turn on him in hate and disgust. He overcomes adversity and finally gets to the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>Let me just tell you that Mel Gibson is an excellent visionary when it comes to depicting visceral action. Its completely necessary to show how a war truly is. Nothing is held back. Blood comes from everywhere, limbs fly off, guts are hanging out, heads are being blown off. Its intense but phenomenally shot. You are in the trenches experiencing the nightmare as it happens. Its the best show wartime action since Saving Private Ryan. I'm not going to lie, I came here for good war action sequences and was very impressed with what I saw.<br/><br/>Here's a film with a few many characters and honestly they are developed decently. This is Doss' story through and through but you love the connections with the people in his unit and how they all come around on him. Doss is a hero in its finest form. Its wonderful to witness his bravery and courage through a wonderfully shot, gripping, war epic. Mel Gibson hits the mark yet again.<br/><br/>8/10"

One massive letdown from this movie was the god awful cheesy script, with boring character conversations the audience wasn't able to identify strong relationships and vital character bonds, unfortunately this brought the movie from a solid 10/10 to a undeserved 8/10.

The confronting battle scenes are the most amazing I've ever seen, with bullets bouncing all of the place and the beautiful ""war zone"" atmosphere Mel Gibson brings the audience right into the action giving us an unforgettable experience that was so unique it gave me chills and goosebumps just from the sounds and visuals alone.

"Matt_Layden","8","3","8","3 January 2017"," Fear War.
","It's been over a decade since Mel Gibson has been in the director's chair. People have been anticipating his return for awhile now and this year he brings Hacksaw Ridge, a bloody tale about freedom and persecution.<br/><br/>Doss enlists into the army in the hopes of becoming a medic. During his training he is asked to pick a rifle and shoot a target, he refuses. His faith and trust in God deters him from ever holding a gun to kill a man. This does not make him popular with the men who must fight by his side. So why does he want to enlist in the war? He wants to save people and save people he does. Doss' heroics lead him to saving about 75 wounded men during the battle of Hacksaw Ridge, an astonishing and miraculous feat. <br/><br/>i walked away from the film with one thing on my mind. Thank God I never had to experience anything like that. Watching these characters go into battle, made me terrified for myself in that situation. Blindly firing across a barren wasteland, bodies scattered about the ground. Running directly into that gunfire....horrifying. No thank you. I don't have one tenth the courage those men had. Hacksaw Ridge is almost on the same savage and surreal level of the opening beach sequence from Saving Private Ryan. Some of the carnage is hard to watch as limbs are blown off, guts are falling out, people are set on fire. One particular sequence does seem to lean on the more ridiculous side, when an American soldier grabs the torso of a dead Japanese solider and uses it as a shield, as he runs through the battlefield. Some arguments are made that Gibson tends to favour the bloody violence and revel in it. I can see 'some' aspects of this (the aforementioned torso bit) but speak to people that were actually in war and they will tell you that it's pretty darn close to what happened. We don't have many people left who fought in these wars, so please, talk to those people. I wish I had spoken to my grandparents more often about their lives and their history. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is Doss, our lead here. He plays there role with a little bit of a Forrest Gump edge. He's innocent, plays dumb a little bit, but always seems to get the job done. He gets the girl, the respect of his allies and superiors and more. Yes, the road there was not an easy one and this is indeed a true story, but I felt the parallels there. He does a decent enough job, but nothing to really cheer about. I was more engaged with Vince Vaughn oddly enough. He does very well here in a non-comedic role. Hopefully he ventures in more dramatic roles in the near future. I feel people underestimate his dramatic roles and once he hit a streak with his comedy films he never seemed interested in going elsewhere. I hope this changes his mind. <br/><br/>The film can be broken down into three parts. Doss' life pre-war, Doss' life training for war and of course the actual war itself. The pre-war segment might be a tad slow for some, but everything Gibson shows us is perfectly arranged for the story and the character arcs. The film is really preachy as well, maybe a little too preachy. I understand that religion is the backbone to the story and the reason why we have a tale as astonishing as this, but with Gibson behind the camera, I felt like he upped it a tad. The juxtaposition of the peace belief by Doss with the violence of the war is a tough one to wrestle with. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is a great film from Gibson and I hope to see it get some recognition come awards season."
"paraguaijin","8","3","8","30 December 2016"," Andrew Garfield was the MVP
","An impeccable movie with all the war flick clichés they could include, from the CGI crimson spurt to the soldier punished to clean toilets. This movie is not suitable for the cynical: it's corny, heart touching and it teaches a lesson on courage, patriotism and true faith to one's principles. Great cinematography, great action choreography (kudos on using lots of physical effects, it felt very tasteful) and just the right shot framing; you'll find nothing revolutionary or new in this movie, like you did in Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line. However, i don't think that makes it a bad movie: if anything it felt like it was featured on the silver screen 50 years too late.<br/><br/>But man... Andrew Garfield as the 1940s nice southerner Christian hero... not does only he pulls it off, he kills it and he sells it. His chemistry with everyone, especially Teresa Palmer, was excellent. The support cast were no slackers as well, in spite of having sort of poor, tropey roles.<br/><br/>All in all this movie reeked of Oscar, and it might as well get some statues. Hopefully Garfield will get the recognition he deserves as the terrific actor he usually is."

","The true story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who, at the Battle of Okinawa, won the Medal of Honor for his incredible bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. We see his upbringing and how this shaped his views, especially his religious view and anti-killing stance. We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army and trying to become a medic. Finally, we see the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>A very powerful story. Shows that bravery and heroism in wartime doesn't necessarily involve fighting, killing or even carrying a weapon. The fact that it is true makes it even more inspirational. <br/><br/>Not flawless though. The setup - Doss's childhood, WW2 civilian life and Army training are handled a bit clumsily at times. Certain event sequences feel a touch contrived, or lacking in detail, and some aspects seem TOO detailed. The Army's attempts to get rid of him seem overstated (though that might be just me watching the movie through a 21st century lens).<br/><br/>Moreover, there is a sense of predictability and inevitability about it all - you know how it's all going to turn out. You know he will get to Okinawa, and you want the movie to get to that part of his life as soon as possible. By that measurement, the setup was too long.<br/><br/>However, the clumsiness and duration of the setup is more than overcome by the intensity and grittiness of the action on Okinawa. I can't think of a longer, more sustained, more intense, piece of war action in cinema. Incredibly realistic, and graphic, with no empty bravado. <br/><br/>The scenes at the end close the loop well on what was set out in the first half of the movie. Quite an emotional ending.<br/><br/>Overall, well worth watching."
"DVR_Brale","8","3","8","1 December 2016"," War movie which emphasizes virtues pertinent to our existence
","First and foremost, let me cut to the chase and say that Hacksaw Ridge deserves your attention if you like Saving Private Ryan for example. This movie, in contrast to David Ayers Fury, makes you dwell into real war horror. That means this movie is violent. And it's really, really violent. For those more squeamish among you all I can say is that you turn your head away from the screen from time to time. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is split into two parts. The fist one gives you a background story about main protagonist; his childhood, family, love, joining US military and troubles he encountered there because of his religious convictions. The second part realistically depicts battleground. There's a galore of close combat scenes so all of you who enjoy great camera work and like war movies are going to appreciate Gibson's effort to portray war as realistically as possible.<br/><br/>If you want to make the most out of this movie, I'd recommend you to keep in mind that Gibson is a Catholic. This I'm mentioning because religion is pertinent to the entire movie; to the first as well as to the second part. This is a history based war movie about highest ordained Conscientious Objector hero but it's ultimate goal is not war itself but the glory of God. For those of you who are Christians, Hacksaw Ridge is going to remind you that there is nothing God can't handle or is difficult for Him. Desmond Doss is a true hero ""without spandex"" but God even more if I may say so. I'm sure Desmond would disagree giving ALL the credits to God. <br/><br/>And last but not less important: take a look at the budget this movie had and production companies involved. There are no big names there and budget is pretty modest for a war movie. In an age where imaginary characters dressed in spandex set in imaginary world are admired and where God is almost never publicly mentioned, let alone praised, Gibson had the courage to finish a movie which emphasizes values pertinent to our existence: modesty, humbleness, sacrifice, courage, being caring with women and so on. Mel, thank you!"

","Went to the cinema to see this movie (while other went to see Arrival) and I was soon emerged in the entire cinematographic plot with a good emotional story, good unforgettable characters and a war scenery rarely seen before. Such detailed images of pain, suffering, death but also life, effort and all about helping the other. <br/><br/>One thing i didn't like (or liked less) was Vince Vaughn, i just don't think he has what it takes to play the general part. Just can't take him serious!<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield on the other hand surprised me completely, wasn't expecting such a performance from him.<br/><br/>The real verdict of Desmond Doss creates such a powerful message for all the viewers, it just doesn't go by unnoticed. <br/><br/>I recommend everyone to see this movie!"
"Eggsactlyso","6","4","13","24 December 2016"," Say hello to Marty Stu.
","I make a point to avoid reading hype and review before seeing a film and this case was no different.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater knowing absolutely nothing about the film, only that it was a WWII film and a Mel Gibson one.<br/><br/>It was an enjoyable film and I don't understand people giving it very low scores. But I also don't understand people giving this film a perfect score or really high scores. This film is far from perfect.<br/><br/>It has one thing to say and it says it over and over. There is no subtlety, no nuance, no depth. <br/><br/>As entertaining as this film is, the main character is a Marty Stu. People (rightly) call out every Mary Sue they see and it's only fair to call out this Gary Stu.<br/><br/>He is the strongest, fastest athlete in the whole crew. He can finish first in an obstacle course even if he's attacked in the middle of the course. He gets the hottest girl. He never lies. He never defends himself (even with his arms) when attacked. He doesn't even flinch. He's so brave. He's the perfect son, the perfect American, the perfect Christian, the perfect husband. He's also a vegetarian. The only flaw he is is that there's just one of him.<br/><br/>There are parts of this that are based on reality, but many aren't. Was he really the fastest and strongest? Doubt it. In real life his fiancée was not a nurse when they met. Father was not abusive. Doss never bricked anyone as a child nor did he almost kill his father with the gun. That never happened. Gibson just tried to win brownie points for Desmond intervening in a domestic abuse case. The real Doss Sr. was not abusive towards the mother nor the children. The actual fight was between the father and the uncle, but a fight between brothers with the mother stepping in doesn't get you as many points as a drunk husband beating his wife, threatening her with a gun and the son stopping it, saving his mum's life. The mother is the real hero in real life, but Gibson wants us to think she's the victim and Desmond is the hero, the superhero or Marty Stu.<br/><br/>The war scenes also have some major inaccuracies for something that is thoroughly researched. The bulletproof human shield was something from a video game, not a serious film. Bottomless magazine technology is something we're still researching today, but they apparently had it in the 40's. <br/><br/>The drill sergeant scene was funny, but out of place. The whole love at first sight is cheesy and that too felt out of place. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan, for example, is one consistent piece in mood and quality. This felt like pieces of Full Metal Jacket, the Notebook and and then some gory war film tacked together to make this into what it is. The moods are inconsistent.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film but would not watch it again."
"j-cameron94","5","3","9","19 March 2017"," It's just another war film.
","With the praise this film has received you'd think this is on par with with Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now as far as war films go.But Hacksaw Ridge is a far cry from those classics. As much as critics would like you to believe it, this is no reinvention of the war film genre, if anything this is a well-made film that despite it's intriguing plot setup, ends up being your average war picture.<br/><br/>The film is eerily similar to Full Metal Jacket (whose first half is one of the most effective showcases of the horrors of the military i've ever seen), but it never seems to hit on the same emotional level, far from it actually. It's blindingly obvious from these scenes who the ""important"" characters will be during actual brutal war segments. Of course the soldier who is most out-spoken against the main character is going to be one who bonds with him in a very unemotional scene during the battle before dying a very expected death.<br/><br/>You never feel connected to any of the characters in this film, with the exception of the main, and that is a big issue. It's clear that he will not die during this, and then everyone else just becomes background noise in the war. You have the regular shock and gore of your typical war film, but this film lacks any kind of deeper purpose beyond this.<br/><br/>It will never be as emotional as Saving Private Ryan. It will never be as captivating and metaphorical as Apocalypse Now. It will just go down as a nice little war film that your dad will enjoy. Nothing more and nothing less."
"matrixmistro","9","3","9","10 February 2017"," Best war film ever made
","This is Mel Gibson's best. Being a massive fan of all films this has to be one of my favourite films ever made. Gibson's directing shines through. He just knows how to make films like no one else, taking some very useful advice from Client Eastood when he directed Braveheart, he is just getting better and better. It is just a shame he started so late. The story hooked me from the start. It's a powerful film which makes you feel how unjust the world can be sometimes and how important it is to have values and principles in life. Sadly, as life goes on, it's harder to find in us humans.<br/><br/>Not putting La La Land down and loving the actors, I think it is a joke it got so much praise and awards and this film got nothing but a few nominations. I think maybe Gibson upset a few too many people in Hollywood with his comments because this film deserved a load of awards in my opinion. Maybe the next one Mel. I just hope you keep with it and look forward to the next one."
"pashleyfilms","7","3","9","12 January 2017"," The Mel Gibson Comeback Movie: Brutal, Hopeful And A Bit Weak
","Hacksaw Ridge is the violent, inspiring and audacious comeback film that Mel Gibson has needed for over a decade, and the end results have certainly paid off for him. Scoring many award wins and nominations, as well as critical acclaim, Gibson is back in the good graces of Hollywood after many personal controversies. And with this film, it is clear why: it's a biopic on someone who hasn't received the recognition deserved, features explosive war scenes, and has a great cast, but it is quite far from perfect.<br/><br/>Gibson's overall direction is mixed. The action scenes are where he shines brightest here, as the length and brutality of them harken back to a time where Gibson was one of Hollywoods best and most transgressive directors. However, the entire first half of the film is very much average, where the characters are being introduced and developed. The film occasionally delved into schmaltz, which ruined the flow of the film. <br/><br/>The writing of Hacksaw Ridge is also very average. The dialogue throughout the first half is nothing special, and the plot feels disorderly. The big climatic final is awkwardly written and directed, as if it could be removed from the film and have no real difference. Andrew Garfield gave a good performance, but his character, although based on a brave and truly awe-inspiring person, sometimes seemed like a punchline rather the heart and soul of the vicious film he was in.<br/><br/>The acting as a whole, like much else of the film, went for average or passable rather then go for great. The cast was splendid, and appeared to be having fun, but the acting wasn't great from any single person. The editing was poor in many of the earlier scenes, and the sound mix was murky at times, making it hard to hear dialogue. <br/><br/>But there was a lot to love about Hacksaw Ridge. Again, most of the second half (sans the final ten minutes) was amazing, with the war scenes continuously shocking and petrifying audiences for its long durations. Andrew Garfield always portrayed real life hero Desmond Doss' religion and beliefs with respect, even if sometimes it felt directed differently. And for all of its faults, it was a darn entertaining movie with enough humour spread throughout to not let the audience fall into a deep pessimistic pit of despair once leaving the theater.<br/><br/>If nothing more, Mel Gibson is back, and perhaps he will now get a bigger budget next time to truly take us back to his Braveheart days. Hacksaw Ridge is a good film that does a great job of exploring how a real person's ethical and spiritual beliefs were tested by World War II, even if the film did feel average in its earlier scenes.<br/><br/>3.5 / 5"

"kaustubh-rajnish","5","2","5","10 May 2018"," Overhyped Bad Cinema
","I went in with high hopes on this one. Mel Gibson generally has uncompromising vision of his movies and even if he is a racist it is important to note that he is a director of extreme talent. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Hacksaw Ridge is so unbelievably clichéd and trite that it is quite surprising that this cinema has multiple Oscar nominations and a 86% RT rating. 
Every year a good war movie has to come out of Hollywood (American Sniper, The Hurt Locker etc.) These are war movies with an undeniable American Jingoistic point of view but that has never diluted the fact that they are good movies from a filmmaking perspective. <br/><br/>Hacksaw, on the other hand, is just formulaic cinema. The War scenes are cartoonish, the love story is sleep inducing, the actions of the protagonist super hero like, the Japanese enemy one dimensional, the characters have bad dialogues, the acting mediocre. It does have its moments of entertainment but then so does the latest Ghostbusters. <br/><br/>In one particular scene, in the middle of a war zone our hero is splashed with slow motion gushes of water as his blood is washed off (a baptism scene to show he is no less than a saint). From where did all this water come from?? Well looks like Mel Gibson aint coming back. Three words: Overhyped Bad Cinema."
"BryGuySaysHi","6","2","5","29 September 2017"," Decent story, poor execution, laughable battle scenes
","The film is split into 3 parts: The romance/backstory, boot-camp, and the actual war. The romance part was the most cheesy thing I have seen. I get that it's hard to really encapsulate romance in short amount of time, but they could of at least done a little better. Still, the buildup was decent enough to keep my attention. The second part of the movie was probably the best part. I won't spoil too much, but there was a lot going on that made it interesting. I will say that this part was a little too religious for me, but I knew that going into the movie. Now on to the actual battle part of the movie, this is honestly the worst depiction of battle I have seen. I felt like I was watching a cartoon for some reason. The actual battle map is the most ridiculous thing ever as well. One rope ladder? Are you serious? None of it was believable. It had the potential to be something, but they went for the Hollywood glorification. This is laughable compared to the battles in Saving Private Ryan. There was one scene where the main character was pulling a character on some sort of make-shift sled and the injured soldier was shooting and mowed down like 5 people. Not realistic at all. There is no emotional involvement in this film because the scenes made it so cheesy."

"Miles-10","9","2","5","24 February 2017"," Emotional tribute to a man of principle
","Not a dry eye in my house while I watched ""Hacksaw Ridge"" alone. Desmond T. Doss was previously unknown to me, yet he was the real deal. Made me want to see the documentary about him. Evidently, the movie downplays the true story rather than displaying the usual Hollywood exaggeration. Moral of the story: You know your objection to handling guns is principled when you are willing to march into battle without one. Doss only touched a rifle to use it as a splint or part of a makeshift travois. (No indication, though, that he knew to empty the weapon before so using it!)<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is terrific. Obviously Andrew Garfield in the starring role, but also Teresa Palmer is fine in the kind of role that usually gets thrown away in a war movie (the hero's wife). Hugo Weaving deserves every award he can get for his role as the father, Tom Doss. Vince Vaughn is uncharacteristically understated as Sergeant Howell - even while saying lines that would make R. Lee Ermey jealous. <br/><br/>Sorry to be so provincially and patronizingly amazed at how so many Australians do believable American accents, but the average American movie-goer is probably not going to notice how few of the actors in this movie are Americans.

Mel Gibson was not a ""heavy"" actor in cinema, but apparently directing this film can not be matched too soon for a medium to large actor who becomes a director like him. A film that looks pretty pale note 10, even if is the existing maximum (1 to 10). Congratulations Mel Gibson and the entire team."
"Semisonic","7","2","5","21 February 2017"," War glamorized
","There's a certain charm about true stories adapted for cinema. Because, while the fiction lacks absolute constraints, giving the screenwriters more liberty and allowing for some laziness, true stories must remain true - and at the same time must be told captivatingly to keep you thrilled. Finding the right balance between the naked truth and the gloss of creative imagination to make the truth shine is a real art.<br/><br/>However, some true stories don't tell us much besides what happened, omitting the ""how"" part. Such stories are basically legends, no matter how ancient or contemporary. And in this case, it's up to the movie creators to recreate the how, often not based on bare facts but on their own perception. And that, in my opinion, is what happened to Hacksaw Ridge thanks to Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>Hollywood has made quite a few war movies, genres varying from dashing black humor like Inglorious Basterds to eerie surrealism like Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. Yet what Hacksaw Ridge reminded me of first was Malick's The Thin Red Line. Stylistically very unlike, both these movies still tell a story about the same war. And it only makes it more obvious how different are Malick's and Gibson's takes on that story.<br/><br/>Malick's war was a useless and ugly thing, a notion that fills everyone's minds, transcends the boundaries between people's personalities and unifies people on both sides of the front line. It's a stain that lies upon you no matter which side you fight for, and corrupts you from within, to the point when there's no good and evil anymore and everything is a single grey mess and everyone is an equal part of it.<br/><br/>But Gibson's vision is different. This man has been long known for his fascination with pain and violence, from the explicit focus on his own character's torture in Braveheart to the gory details of Jesus' fate in The Passion of the Christ. This man's obsession with showing pain and death on screen may raise questions about his morals or sanity, but at least he's being thorough and consistent with it.<br/><br/>And Hacksaw Ridge was yet another proof of that. With all the beautiful healthy faces put in the middle of the carnage of war, with blood, guts and brain pieces splashing out of gun wounds like little fountains, with cartridge cases ejected from rifles and machine guns like some confetti, Gibson creates a hymn to the war, as if it was a holy gift, cleansing the unworthy and leaving the pure intact. And in the middle of that hymn, is the figure of Desmond Doss, portrayed by Andrew Garfield in a way Saint Sebastian would be jealous of, with his face glowing with some perverse naivety and conscious righteousness. The hybrid erotism and holiness of Gibson's vision of Doss are further enforced by two landmark scenes of the film: the scene with Garfield alone on that ridge, pulling the ropes and letting them loose, with his lean figure against the dark smoky sky, sensualized to the point you'd rather expect from the likes of 50 Shades of Grey, and the scene of Doss slowly sliding down the ridge in a stretcher, with a strong parallel to some divine experience you simply can't help coming to think of.<br/><br/>Still, at the end of the day Hacksaw Ridge is a story of a real person who has performed an unbelievable feat in a middle of a true bloodbath, has done something that nobody ever expected of him. And that achievement is a fact that no director's vision could distort or negate. We'll never know for sure where the real Desmond Doss was taking his courage and strength from, and, to be honest, it's the kind of spiritual privacy a person is entitled to. But, private or not, I would still prefer the fact-based stories to follow their roots instead of becoming a victim of a storyteller's inflamed imagination. And while Hacksaw Ridge literally smells of Mel Gibson's own personal beliefs and tastes, apparently it's that rare case when the spirit of a story is so strong that, no matter how hard you twist it or bend it to your own will, it remains true to itself where it really matters."

"MrDHWong","9","2","5","20 February 2017"," Despite Gibson's chequered past, he is still capable of creating gripping and emotional movies
","Hacksaw Ridge is a war drama film starring Andrew Garfield and directed by Mel Gibson. To quote South Park; ""Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but the son-of-a-b***h knows story structure!"", and that is made very clear in his most recent directorial effort. This film proves that despite Gibson's chequered past, he is still capable of creating gripping and emotional movies.<br/><br/>The film depicts the true story of Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), a combat medic who because of his religious moral code, refused to use a weapon during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Despite initially being labelled as a coward by his fellow soldiers, Doss ends up saving several lives in the midst of the bloodshed.<br/><br/>As to be expected, director Mel Gibson does not hold back in his depiction of the carnage of war; bodies are shredded by bullets, heads are blown off, and soldiers are set on fire. However, due to the infrequency of the violence throughout the film (most of the violence takes place during the third act), it never feels glorified. Andrew Garfield gives possibly the performance of his career as Desmond T. Doss. From his scrawny appearance at the beginning to his courageous combat medic persona on the battlefield, Garfield always feels like he's giving it his all.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"
"theocharous_an","7","2","5","20 February 2017"," A great film about a true hero
","When confronted with the word ""hero"", different people picture different men in their minds. Some think of superheroes, some think of immensely strong and fearless soldiers and some think of remarkable generals and leaders. We seem to forget that the key aspects of a true hero are bravery and selflessness. Mel Gibson's first film in over a decade is the biography of such a hero, a man who wasn't particularly strong or skilled, but was ready to risk his life to save others. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring story based on true events although at times it seems too romanticized.<br/><br/>The story begins with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) childhood in Lynchbourg, Virginia. Desmond and his brother Hal grow up with their religious mother (Rachel Griffiths) and their troubled father (Hugo Weaving), an alcoholic who is still haunted by his WWI demons. When the United States entered WWII after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Desmund and his brother decide to enlist for the army as most people in their age did. Desmund joins the 77th division and starts his training, but has a hard time there as he refuses to even touch a gun. Killing another man, even in a war, is against his deep-rooted beliefs and his only purpose is to serve as a medic, saving people instead of killing them. The film then moves forward to 1945 and the battle of Okinawa where amidst a living hell, Desmund Doss saves numerous lives and shows what he's made of.<br/><br/>I had read and heard about how good this film was and since it was one of the most nodded in the Oscars I had high expectations. I have to say that watching the first part was quite disappointing. Everything about Desmond's life before he enlisted seemed too Hollywood-esque. He appears as the perfect man, even though he had a difficult childhood growing up with an alcoholic father (which is not true for the real Desmond Doss' father), he falls in love with first sight with a beautiful girl and after two days he makes her fall in love with him too. It's like the screen writer preferred to please the audience rather than telling the true story. Fortunately, there was Hugo Weaving's performance to redeem me. Such an underrated actor, I really felt that he should have got at least a nomination for this season's awards. Everything got better after Desmond goes to the training camp, but still I could see nothing great about the picture.<br/><br/>Much to the film's credit, I forgot everything when the battle scene started. The scene was breathtaking! The pace was excellent, the sound and directing kept me in the edge of my seat, the cinematography and costumes were perfect. I didn't know the historical details so I had no idea what the result would be and the film kept me guessing until the end sustaining suspense to the highest level. Desmond's heroic act was masterfully showcased and the footage in the end made for the perfect epilogue.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was very good in this film and the supporting cast was solid. It's a great return for Mel Gibson who got his first Academy Award nomination since 1996 when he won two Oscars for Braveheart. Although it's not the masterpiece some people had me believe, it's still makes for a great war film which can both affect you with its touching story and thrill you with astonishing action moments.<br/><br/>More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com"

"opra-27789","10","2","5","17 February 2017"," Brutally violent, intense but also warm and inspiring
","This film is just epic in so many ways.<br/><br/>First of all, it is based on a true story. To all people who like to complain about changes and adaptions to the rules of filmmaking, who are being made in such films: In Hacksaw Ridge the important true elements (acts of compassion, faith and wondrous strength) are not bent to adhere to the demands of a mainstream audience, they are depicted in the full glory in which they took place. What Desmond Doss did in reality is so inexplicable that it is hard to believe it happened. When Mel Gibson states that he felt he had to omit some elements of selflessness because people wouldn't believe it, that means something! <br/><br/>But now let's cut right down to the chase regarding the general quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Cinematography, music and performances are all excellent. Definitely watch this in cinema if you can. The battle scenes are smashing, gripping, loud and alarming. The dialogue is good and transports these characters well. The construction of the first half, which is calm and builds up to what inevitably has to follow later on the battlefield, is indispensable: Doss' past is important to understand why he acts like he does and what his beliefs are. The side characters, first and foremost his father (played excellently by Hugo Weaving), all contribute to the development of Desmond's character. In the second half, when stuff hits the fan, the audience is presented with what has to be expected in a Mel Gibson war movie: violence and death present on the big screen like they haven't been for a very long time. The feeling that everyone is vulnerable, everyone can be hit and die, is perfectly created. There are no exceptional characters who are safe and sound for no reason, everyone is on the edge of life and death. In addition to that, we are shown relentlessly, how fast a living young man can be turned into dead meat - the speed and mercilessness of modern, mechanized war is ever so present here.<br/><br/>Seeing how a man, who fights mainstream, refuses to kill in times of war, not only presents shallow beliefs, like many soldiers during that time, but a true faith in god, prevails, and finally earns the respect and love he deserves is simply uplifting.<br/><br/>Some critics say this movie shows jingoism but I strongly disagree. The United States of America are never exalted here. What is indeed exalted is faith and compassion. There are no Stars and Stripes, there are no patriotic speeches. What has happened in real life, the US winning this fight and Doss surviving so many attacks and injuries as well as saving so many lives, is correctly depicted here. Saying this is movie-style artificial pathos is simply not true. Even the (spoilerfree) scene with Doss being ""lifted"" into the sky, though undoubtedly using spiritual metaphorical language, does not feel out of place - if you consider what you have watched before that. It'd be wrong to pull scenes like these out of context and detach it from the film's morale.<br/><br/>Speaking of morale: <br/><br/>It's astounding how, even to this day, many people still don't get that saving a life costs more than taking one. <br/><br/>Doss faces the hardest challenge a man can face during wartime: follow the ever-existent stream of hate and anger which destroys not only the human body, but also the human soul, or go against it and fight it with love and commitment. <br/><br/>This is what makes this movie unique in its genre."
"thor2029","10","2","5","11 February 2017"," A wonderful movie full of emotions
","My opinion---<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"", is an extraordinary film and is in itself a marvel of its kind. Mel Gibson was able to showcase all his talent as a director with this masterpiece, as well for having exploited this true story of: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield who is Extraordinary and deserves the Oscar for the best The role of men), of his early youth, following all stages, becoming at one point in his life a conscientious objector until his involvement in the army until the end of his history. The Doss unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and sent to the Pacific War Theater to participate in the Battle of Okinawa. Mel Gibson was able to give a soul to his film, despite the harshness of the war scenes, they make us discover battle scenes extraordinary realism even so stunning, these scenes are incredible realism, I These scenes surpass the scenes of the Normandy landing of June 6, 1944, of the masterly film ""Saving Private Ryan"", that's saying a lot. This story is also full of humanity despite the fact that any war will always have its inhuman side of nature at its core. It is precisely Mel Gibson's strength that he was able to describe the story of this most simple hero who especially wanted not to flee his military responsibilities in the face of the war, despite his initial convictions as a non- Violence, and it was precisely here that was the paradox of his story, he just wanted to care for and save his comrades in arms, without being dependent on a weapon and having to kill. He wanted to be a soldier, but simply as a combat nurse. Mel Gibson also pointed out the union that end up having all the soldiers towards each other To this incredible story Mel Gibson has made humanity in inhuman situations, but that everything is real, because no war will ever be validated as necessary for humanity. In my life, I had never seen so much realism in battle scenes, I would have believed myself and experienced them every time, what a horror for all these soldiers in this hell, Wow, I Sigh again. Mel Gibson is really super good and he put a bar so high for this kind of film, that this time to exceed the height, I do not think it will happen one day. A film unheard of in all its history and history, that of an antihero of incredible modesty until the end of his life, for him the true heroes were all in military cemeteries. When we saw this film, it was in springs full of all the emotions and feelings that knew how to imbibe in us. I do not know what to do with one thing, it's the counselor, an unforgettable movie in every way."
"PyroSikTh","8","2","5","1 February 2017"," One of the Most Horrifying Depictions of War
","Hacksaw Ridge is a movie very neatly divided, and each section is better than the last. The first act is all introductions and character building. We meet a young Desmond Doss and his brother, including a near-fatal scuffle between them, sowing the seeds of Desmond's stubborn anti-violence stance. We establish that their father is an abusive drunk, haunted by the horrors of World War One. Desmond grows up, shows an early sense of heroism, and meets his beloved in a whirling romance, before he decides it's time he went and helped defend his country. This opening section is weak, to put it bluntly. It's kind of boring, very cheesy, and mirrors classic Hollywood quite a lot (and in more than just costumes and hair-styling). It has it's high points for sure, but I was almost ready to chuck this movie under the bus at this point. Hugo Weaving single-handedly manages to keep this act engaging. In the hands of a lesser actor, the role could've easily drifted into cliché abusive father tropes, but Weaving manages to tap into the trauma behind the abuse and make him a sympathetic figure. His breakdown at the table when Desmond's brother appears in military garb is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The second act shifts to the military training camp where Doss has to defend his anti- violence beliefs and convince his superiors not to force him out. This fight of faith is quite engaging to go through, and we get a real sense of who Desmond is, the lengths he will go to to stand for that, and the inner turmoil it creates for him. We also meet his comrades, including arsehole Smitty, pretty boy Hollywood, lassoing Tex, lanky Ghoul, and his various superiors. This is where the film picks up in entertainment value thanks in large part to Vince Vaughn's stern but comedic drill sergeant, but it doesn't entirely lose it's classics sheen of cheese, and is brought down a little by some cringe-worthy lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>But the third act, which really encompasses the second half of the movie, is when Hacksaw Ridge shows it's hand and goes balls-to-the-wall. This is when Doss and his company are dispatched to Okinawa and are tasked with taking the titular ridge from the Japanese and holding it for long enough to get a foothold on the island. From the very first moments that the men clamber over the top of the cliff-edge, the tone of the movie completely changes. The land is desolate and strewn in corpses and body parts. The tension is amped up to eleven as the men slowly traverse the unforgiving landscape. The movie shifts almost into the horror genre, with jump-scares and a whole heap of gore and injury detail, and the cheesy melodrama of the first two acts suddenly makes sense; getting the audience into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot state enough how unsettlingly gory the second half of this movie is. It doesn't hold back in it's depiction of war. The first time they reach the ridge, and they traverse the corpse-strewn landscape, we see everything from decapitated heads, maggot-infested corpses, intestines and other internal organs splayed over rocks and trees. We're put right into the men's shoes, as their happy existence is suddenly and utterly shattered by the realism of their situation. Then a half-dead torso sits up and screams and all hell breaks loose. Soldiers are literally torn apart by a hail of bullets, blood, bone, and organs litter the ground, grenades and mortars explode every which way. The rate at which the movie goes from cheesy melodrama to horrific realism is like flicking a switch.<br/><br/>It's only after this initial, harrowing assault on the ridge that the true purpose of the movie starts to rear it's head. As every surviving soldier retreats down the cliff edge back to safety, Doss is the only man who willingly remains on top, and he spends the better part of two days alone, retrieving and patching up injured soldiers left behind, and lowering them down to the beach below. He dodges detection by the Japanese at every turn, and uses every creative idea he has to make sure no-one else dies. He even helps patch up and save a few Japanese soldiers as well. The kicker is that all of this is entirely true, it happened. The real Doss saved over seventy-five soldiers in those two days alone. It's almost unbelievable, to the point where it must have been glorified or exaggerated in some way, but in fact Gibson actually cut out certain heroic acts fearing audiences wouldn't buy into them. Could Hacksaw Ridge really be the first movie based on a true story that actually had to dull down it's realism to make it more believable?!<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is definitely a movie I would recommend, despite it's opening shortcomings. It pains me to say it, but I'd have liked less backstory. Maybe start the story at the military training camp, and revisit his childhood and courting in flashbacks, or maybe just cut out the romance entirely (it's ultimately unimportant). Despite it's flaws at the beginning, the second half notches the movie up dramatically and completely flipped my opinion of the entire movie. It's a difficult watch, wrought with tension, adrenaline rushes, and disturbing imagery, but it really places you in the battle, and frames Desmond's heroism in an unparalleled way; even amongst all this horror, he never loses faith, he never loses courage, he never gives up and never quits. It's truly inspiring. I give Hacksaw Ridge a very good 8/10 (the second half is a solid 9, the first middling around a 6)."
"MajaWisenberger","6","2","5","7 February 2017"," Good movie, but with irresponsible narrative
","As this is my very first review, I am happy to start with Hacksaw Ridge. Although I thought I would watch another war movie, it did not disappoint me. It presents an original take on war, where a medic is risking his life to save his fellow comrades. The filming is done beautifully and the plot is easy to follow. In general, the movie was captivating and action-packed and I didn't catch myself scrolling Facebook at any point in time. The acting and special effects were also believable and held a high standard. <br/><br/>However, Hacksaw Ridge did not have that extra edge for me to give it a higher score. It did not change my opinion or make me ask more questions. As soon as I was done with the movie, I put on some laundry, ate dinner and went back to my normal life. Another reason for my lower score is the movie's narrative when it comes to war. I was personally not very fond of the ""us great Americans"" and ""them filthy Japanese"" that was presented in the movie. Although I am aware that a war movie will seldom depict two fighting nations singing kumbaya and drinking beer, I would have liked for this movie to have a more humane take on the Japanese part. Instead, the Japanese army was at some point in the movie faking its surrender, whereas the Americans were depicted really honest with their intentions and had a self-less hero medic. I do not believe that is how it goes down in war - both sides have tricks up their sleeves, which was just not presented in the movie. <br/><br/>In sum, I encourage you to watch Hacksaw Ridge as it is a good movie, but it will only fill two hours of your life, rather than remain in your memory for a while."
"drazsika-716-814820","7","2","5","5 February 2017"," Religious fanatics are NOT the good guys...
","The movie deals with a very unlikely true story - and does a good job. In my opinion not comparable to Private Ryan but nevertheless: good job. I'd give probably 8/10 for this.<br/><br/>The message however that this movie transmits is that the main character is a HERO and his behaviour might encourage people to follow his example.<br/><br/>I completely disagree with the message and liked the fact that the captain in the movie gave all normal, logical reasons to stop the actions of our ""hero"".<br/><br/>If you want to stop violence it's NOT the best way to heal soldiers so that they can kill more. Risking your life to save Japanese soldiers who are killed by his comrades soon is another reason to dislike the guy. If you want to help your comrades touch the gun you are given and finish basic training rather than risk prison for not obeying orders. 9 out of 10 guys like our hero probably never made it to the battlefield because of their fanaticism.<br/><br/>Bottom line: he's definitely not my hero but the movie is well-made and watchable once."
"steerpike_2002","7","2","5","1 February 2017"," Folksy mediocrity punctuated with exceptional battle scenes
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is a deeply split movie. On the one hand there are some of the most horrifying, frankly excellent depictions of battleground carnage ever put on film. Sadly on the other, much more heavily weighted hand, there is a deeply mediocre, folksy boy goes to war movie surrounding them.<br/><br/>Okay, so the bad points: Mel Gibson seems to have had the attitude when making this movie that maybe his audience hasn't seen any other war films and will happily sit through every scene from every war movie ever without yawning. So we get the scenes which show our young hero finding love before going off to war (check), a fierce but sensitive sergeant (check), the training scenes (check), yada yada yada. I can only think of one moment in the whole set-up, which lasts for a good hour twenty, where Gibson used a little subtlety to transition over a beat in the movie. Our hero, Private Doss, admires his wedding ring momentarily before talking to his new wife. This little moment spares us the need of a wedding scene and moves us closer to the pay-off, the film that Gibson actually wants to show us and that we actually want to see. The movie desperately needed more moments like this. Sure, the scenes are all made competently, but there's an insufferable lack of originality for such a long set-up.<br/><br/>Exacerbating this mediocrity is the corny dialogue. Actually, corny isn't a strong enough word to describe just how 'gee shucks, mister' folksy, porch rocking chair hayseed the characters in this movie are. Now I'm not mocking 1940s Virginia, mostly because I just don't buy that this is what it was like. The dialogue is just plain bad and reveals a key reason why 'Apocalypto' is Gibson's best film.<br/><br/>The cast are fine, with only one or two stand-out performances, notably from Hugo Weaving as the alcoholic father (check!) and Luke Bracey as the training ground foe turned battlefield friend (check!).<br/><br/>Okay, so we finally get to Okinawa and the movie begins. The build-up to the battle is over-the-top but effective and by the time the first bullet is fired, the tension is unbearable. The battle itself is a film-making masterclass of war action. The first engagement with the Japanese in particular brilliantly balances the desire to convey the frenetic pace and chaos of the battle with the need for it to be coherent for the audience. The battle is fast and terrifying, but the editing allows us to take it in and follow the narrative of the action. This is no easy achievement and makes editor John Gilbert perhaps the only Oscar nominee from 'Hacksaw Ridge' to deserve the prize.<br/><br/>It's in these scenes that we become re-acquainted with the man who made 'Apocalypto', that ceaselessly energetic, kinetic movie. When his characters move, rather than talk, Gibson is capable of genuinely entrancing sequences of film, in the same league as the likes of Sam Peckinpah or George Miller.<br/><br/>It's a real shame that most of this movie is not these battle scenes, which are in stark contrast to the majority of the run time. It would be great if Mel Gibson could deliver us another tightly managed action epic like 'Apocalypto'. The best parts of this film, which are enough to lift the whole out of mere mediocrity, show that it was not a fluke."
"coreyjdenford","8","2","5","26 January 2017"," Explosive heroism
","This review of Hacksaw Ridge is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>As an actor Mel Gibson has gained a fair few roles to get him slightly noticed since his alleged racist tirade seven years ago but they are nothing to praise it was very difficult for him to get his name on another Hollywood production since some studios wouldn't hire him. But since his stunning Best Picture winning debut Braveheart Gibson isn't stupid as he knows exactly what he is doing behind the camera, over the years his films have not just made him a director to watch he's become the director to cherish. Its been 11 years since his last shot behind the camera with 2006s Apocalypto, but it's fair to say that the Australian, earned that time off as his fourth film Hacksaw Ridge seems to be the thing that every Gibson fan was looking for. This fourth shot walks the tightrope without any sort of wobbling the film; it may even lead to Oscars.<br/><br/>We first meet the film's centre character Desmond Doss, as a young boy living a happy yet troubled life with his older brother, his mother and his abusive father (Hugo Weaving) who constantly teaches him the differences between rights and wrongs, it's later in this opening that we see what his father is doing to him. Then the film shifts 15 years to a more grown up Desmond, whose troubled young life seems to only be a memory that has left him, it's here that we see he first instance of his heroism when he saves a misfortunate soul. He meets with Dorothy Schutte who happens to be the best catch in town; they form a relationship together using his charm. Though Desmond gets the idea that he wants to join the war which is when the message comes clear that his father doesn't want him to end his life so soon as he tells him about his story of World War I of how he lost all his friends, when he finally says with tearful eyes ""I lost all my friends, I don't want to lose my sons as well"" but Desmond is determined that he will come back home unscathed. <br/><br/>He decides to go through as a combat medic; he refuses to hold a rifle as he is against violence but when it comes to heroism he shines. The second act when he starts his training it doesn't take itself too seriously as there is moment that is very funny as the drill Sergeant (Vince Vaughn) gives all his men new hilarious nicknames and gives us a few zingers, but it's not horrendously misplaced. Desmond spends most of his time as the army's punching bag he is constantly beaten up arrested for his beliefs yet his determination doesn't whither which is when we see his full strength. The opening of the second half is when Gibson's vision truly comes to life as we veer into the battlements of Okinawa, Japan (filmed in Australia) like his three previous films there was always a moment when the violence would keep its this film does essentially the same thing. Doss and his teammates are engulfed by a cascade of bullets, a huge body count, explosions and puddles of blood. He still shows determination as he has to save some of his comrades, it takes time to show this happening but it's still impacting nonetheless. Unfortunately the film does flag a little perhaps due to the times of territorial overkill when the fight becomes long, and at points never seems to halt. <br/><br/>But it's all essential stuff as this is a time when Hacksaw Ridge becomes a Gibson film when he gathers all his expertise into one scene. His transitions through the two different flanks are all wonderfully adept. When the battle finally halts there is a gorgeous shot of a slender Desmond running through the battlements to save some of his teammates, it turns into a stealth mission, but it's beautifully done. In addition, his superiors call him a hero. Granted the film flags and it seems this film Gibson not just the director to watch it makes him the director to cherish. Hacksaw Ridge is essentially this century's Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>VERDICT: Garfield and Palmer are phenomenal, in this sensational biopic that shows heroism and justice that's heavily impacting, truly moving with Oscar worthy performances and a lot of heart."
"tomfunke-24930","8","2","5","5 January 2017"," Heavy War Drama.
","OK, I know this was Mel Gibson. OK, I know it would have strong religious overtones. I still liked it despite both of those. I found myself drawn deeply into this film. It was brutal. Horrific. What war probably truly is. I have never been to war or any armed conflict, but I believe that this film would be a rather accurate portrayal of what that hell would be like. Garfield was a lovable character that brought live to the mythos of Doss. As a man who has strong personal beliefs, Doss/Garfield is willingly thrust into a torment that puts all of his creeds to the test. As most movies that are based on a true story or a real person do, there is a small scene at the credits with the actual people, I was touched by this point. A very good film."
"hs-11395","8","2","5","18 December 2016"," A benchmark
","It's usually difficult to be unbiased to watch an anti-Japanese movie with nationality of China; it's also not easy for a theme movie to portray a story by presenting what it is supposed to present. The surprise brought by Hacksaw Ridge is it has solved these two difficulties. There's no flattery of leading character, demonization of enemy or sanctification of troops of America, which proves that Hacksaw Ridge is a qualified history film.<br/><br/>I'd like to introduce it to others by dividing it into two parts. The first half is about Doss himself and his faith which keeps struggling in the cracks of others' discrimination and prejudice. For my part, he is indeed a stubborn person, who was not willing to bend down even a little bit, pretend he could carry a rifle, to win the possibility to maintain his faith; even when his boss tried to understand him, his obstinacy still drove him to refuse to touch a gun. Yet on the other side, his peers' distortion of his adhesion also reminds audience of the importance of tolerance: a seemingly coward guy may also be humane to everyone, an introverted person may be good at listening than most people...everyone around has something you don't have. Similarly, from Doss's childhood memory, his father was an asshole who drunk excessively, had violence tendency even left Doss psychological shadow of rifle. However, when Doss was in prison due to his not touching rifle, his father gave him a strong hand to protect what he believed. From these plots we could find that an individual is much more complex than we imagine, and interacts with the environment unavoidably. Thus one's faith and one's keeping his faith is valuable especially under the uncertain background of World War II.<br/><br/>The first half is used to bring audiences' emotion into the resonance with that of Doss, then the second half is about war itself directly. From these cruel shots, the brutality of war has been presented in one hundred percent. This is the key point of a great anti-war movie, battlefield depicted by blood and smoke tells you emotionlessly: this is war, you can lose life in any time and survival is something like winning lottery. Comparing these scenarios to real life, audiences then will cherish this peaceful epoch more gratefully. Also, because of the cruelty in battlefield, Doss's kindness and industriousness bring audiences more impact. Actually not only his dignity, but also his peers' understanding and supporting, though some of them had mocked Doss's faith and regarded him as a coward guy. It feels like multi- aspect humanity shows its valuable side, lighting up a candle in deep night.<br/><br/>The best shot for me is that baptism – I'd like to call it baptism, although for Doss it's just a simple bath. In that shot, sunlight poured downward, lit up countless water drops, that body covered by blood, smoke and dust was washed back to normal, as clean as Doss's soul.<br/><br/>At the end, I want to go back to unbiasedness mentioned at the beginning. Unbiasedness, here, does not mean being sorely neutral. It should be an attitude which makes a movie to be based on reality. Once upon a time, I was unwilling to watch some anti-war works just because they tend to penetrate nationalism to audiences, which should not be conveyed perfunctorily or be regarded to be political correctness. Japanese in Hacksaw Ridge, fortunately, are shaped as person rather than enemy or demon, I wish this can be a benchmark for upcoming works."
"Ayman_Refaat","8","2","5","15 December 2016"," Different !
","I liked Hacksaw Ridge simply because it is different. Most of war movies cover certain aspects of war, like the courage of men fighting for their countries, the horrors of war or the psychological effect of war and difficult adjustment to civilian life. All are great aspects that have been displayed in movies like Saving Private Ryan (Dir. Steven Spielberg), Full Metal Jacket (Dir. Stanley Kubrick), Apocalypse Now (Dir. Francis Ford Coppola), Platoon (Dir. Oliver Stone) and Paths of Glory (Dir. Stanley Kubrick).<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge covers all these aspects, it shows courageous men fighting for their cause on both sides (Americans and Japanese), it shows the horrors of war and how men can be cruel and savages killing each other and blowing each other into pieces, it shows the psychological effect of war and how hard it is to get back to normal after living the horrors of war and after watching your friends die (displayed by Desmond's father who came back from WWI a different man, drunk and violent).<br/><br/>But to make the value of human life the main theme in a war movie? That's new! War, by definition, is a man trying to kill as many soldiers of the enemy as he can. Desmond here doesn't kill and doesn't even hold a weapon, he appreciates human life, he knows that all life is precious, he doesn't kill as many as he can, he saves as many as he can from his friends and even form the enemy! He was as courageous as any man in that war, maybe even the most courageous of them all, because it takes a whole lot of courage to rush into war without a weapon to defend yourself! Some people would even consider that suicide.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving gave a brilliant performance portraying Desmond's father with all the scars war left in his soul. Mel Gibson is a master director who knows exactly what he is doing. He has Braveheart (1995), Apocalypto (2006) and now Hacksaw Ridge (2016) to prove it.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is an important thought-provoking movie, with some mind-blowing action sequences and heart-breaking emotional moments. Definitely one of the best movies in 2016 and one of the best war movies ever."
"peefyn","8","2","5","12 December 2016"," A movie split in two, where one part outshines the other.
","While not as stylistically done as Full Metal Jacket, this movie is also clearly split in two. The first part of the movie covers the training, and the second one the war itself. I was not too fond of the first part (though it did have some fantastic moments), but the second part was so intense that when the movie was done, you have forgotten about most of the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>There's something inherently difficult with movies like this, and it's unfair because it's not a fault of the movie itself. There's been made so many American war movies that portray an exaggerated heroic narrative, without any nuance, nor feeling that you are watching something that actually happened. Many of these movies were really good, but the tradition has led to me always being skeptical of these movies, especially when they say they are based on a true story. Now, Doss was a hero, and he more than deserves the portrayal of him in this movie, but it still feels hard to trust.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is about the all American boy with an abusive father, deciding to do what he thinks is right. It really does feel like Mel Gibson proposing to the American audience. But, in between the rosy red scenes of wholesome American life, there are some really good moments. Hugo Weaving is incredible in this movie, and he steals every scene he is in. Especially a scene where the family is eating dinner, and he reacts to Doss' brother enlisting. Fantastic acting.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie, though, is great. From the Forrest Gump-like American boy in the training camp, it throws all the characters into war, and demonstrates beyond any doubt that war is hell. It's graphic, hectic and terrible, and it's impossible to look away. Despite everything happening at once, the movie manages to show what happens, and give you the feeling of being out there, and share a taste of the reality these young men were facing. And to think that this happened every day, many places, for years. They are all heroes, but the latter half of the movie is not so much about the glory (except some slow-motion sequences in the end). Which is how the heroes should be displayed. As (sometimes unwillingly) brave humans thrown into a situation beyond comprehension. And doing it because they believe it's the right thing to do.<br/><br/>The movie is worth watching. The historical inaccuracies are there, but they don't seem to be too major, and Doss was actually even more of a hero than what ended up on the film. The latter part is really good, and Hugo Weaving makes the first part enjoyable as well."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","2","5","14 November 2016"," A Great Comeback By Mel Gibson
","Hacksaw Ridge is at once a pre-modernist throwback to the valor- filled WWII epics of the 50's and early-60's and a restatement of a sentiment that has never really gone away. While many of today's war films offer ""war is hell"" chaos and fervor with an underlying tinge of anti-war proselytizing, Hacksaw Ridge dares to be different. Underneath Private Doss's importunity to remain a conscientious objector serving his country, and underneath Mel Gibson's at times comically caricatured brief of real events, lies some startlingly effective messaging. War maybe hell, but someone's gotta do it.<br/><br/>The film follows our humble and entrenched hero Desmond Doss (Garfield) whose medical services in the Battle of Okinawa saved 75 men during a month long campaign. While he never carried a gun (he was a pacifist and Seventh-Day Evangelist), Doss's perseverance under heavy enemy fire, won him the Medal of Honor, an honor no other conscientious objector had received at the point in U.S. history.<br/><br/>When we first meet Doss he's but a small child (Bryce), playing in the rugged backwoods of Virginia with his brother (Guerriero). The camera lovingly floats across amber waves of grain and fluttering sunlight much like the first scenes of Braveheart (1995). It's clear that despite being absent behind the camera for 10 years and having a flurry of personal struggles, Gibson's keen eye has, if anything grown sharper. Indeed there are plenty of other echos of Mel Gibson's other directorial efforts including Man With a Face's (1993) sincerity, Apocalypto's (2006) carefully cadenced intensity and a sado- masochistic glimpse into the heart of pain and suffering that has The Passion (2004) written all over it. Make no mistake Doss's baptism by fire during the invasion of Okinawa is among the most viscerally violent recreations of war ever committed to film; certainly up there with Saving Private Ryan's (1998) Normandy invasion. Those prone to nausea or suffering from PTSD may need to sit this one out.<br/><br/>If there is a sour note in this flick, it certainly isn't the film's ability to find glory in war. Again, most films of this breed, especially since the early 70's have replaced chest-pounding jingoism with anti-war sentiments ranging from the ethereal (Thin Red Line (1998)) to the mockish (MASH (1970)). Thanks in part to the inscrutability of our hero and the fact that WWII has always been considered ""the good war"" i.e. where idealism came first, Hacksaw Ridge had me and everyone in the theater agog with patriotic fervor. It of course helped that the enemy; a faceless mass of uniformly angry Japanese soldiers are so relentless on the ridge that seeing Doss apply morphine needles under heavy fire almost makes you forget we're supposed to be on offense.<br/><br/>The tumult on the battlefield, the bravery of Private Doss and the earnestness of the film's religiosity, goes a long way in covering the film's various faults. Unfortunately there are a few issues that remain encrusted in the tidal zones of the film's second act. I need not tell you what happens to Private Doss in basic training because, let's be honest, you've seen it all before. New recruits are dressed down and harassed into submission by their superior. A speech is made about a unit being as strong as its weakest member - and out come the socks full of pennies. Granted in this movie Vince Vaughn's patented motor-mouth delivery does raise some eyebrows but when compared to R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket (1987), Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer in a Gentleman (1982), or heck even Tommy Lee Jones in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) he just doesn't hold a torch.<br/><br/>Even with a few holes in the bow, this ship not only floats but is heavily armed, stained with the sinew of battle and hungry for more. Mel Gibson was looking for a comeback and boy did he ever find one with the sincere and unabashed piousness of Private Doss's story of heroism. In the words of South Park (1997-Present) creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone ""Say what you want about Mel Gibson but the son of a b***h knows story structure."""

","The intense war drama directed by Mel Gibson tells the true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), an army medic who saved the lives of over seventy men at Hacksaw Ridge.

He is backed up by Teresa Palmer as his future wife and Luke Bracey whose career is growing as a fellow soldier.<br/><br/>The story has a slow start with Desmond as a young boy as he comes to his face after an altercation between him and his brother.

"ccorral419","8","2","5","4 December 2016"," Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition.
","Yup, Mel Gibson (the director) is back, as he presents the true story of Conscientious Objector WWII medic Desmond Doss (well acted by Andrew Garfield ""The Amazing Super-man"" 2012), who served during the Battle of Okinawa without firing a shot and received the Medal of Honor. While the first part of the film is a bit of a cheesy set-up love story between Doss and Dorothy (Teresa Palmer ""Break Point"" 2015), the actual story that follows, Gibson's final battle scene, the writing by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, and the battle cinematography by Simon Duggan make the wait well worth the build-up. Unfortunately, Doss's reluctance to ""bear arms"" gets lost in the initial love story, until it become evident that this is the reason for the story. It also doesn't help that Vince Vaughan (""The Break-up"" 2006"") is completely miscast as Doss' s loud and confrontational Sgt. Howell. Vaughn looks out of place in this role, in both his presence and dialogue delivery. The same goes for many of the interactions Doss endures with his fellow barrack-mates, and the under utilized Rachel Griffiths (Brothers & Sisters"" 2006- 2011) as Doss's mom. However, just when all seems ""just another film,"" the battle begins and the film turns into breathtaking greatness. Much like the initial scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" when the battle and struggle begins one can only hold on for the experience that is presented. Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition. Mel Gibson is back, at least as a director, and you should get reacquainted with him here again."

","I very much enjoyed this movie, bonus points for it being a true story! Garfield is very convincing in his character, the depiction of his home life and family is quite solid as is the story that forms his moral character - without beating you over the head with it. And there are some nice details included throughout that do lend a solid setting.<br/><br/>Theresa Palmer is an excellent pick for her role - she has the look and personality down to the proverbial ""T"".<br/><br/>If I have anything to pick on, it lies in the details, and primarily in the battleground sequences.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, from what I have read the number of people he rescued is in some dispute - Doss thought it was around 50, other reports from the field reach as high as 100! <br/><br/>The details I pick on, as I said, are just that - details. As a boot and a soldier, his hair is too long! The sergeant's weapon is an unlikely choice, but is still correct for the period. The naval bombardments just looked wrong in scale for some reason (I'm willing to say that's the me..). And I don't recall seeing anyone reload! (BAR's only carry 20 rounds...) <br/><br/>And nobody 'wins' the Medal of Honor, they are awarded!"

"dinkofennick","5","3","10","22 February 2017"," If The Passion of the Christ wasn't religious, contrived or violent enough for you. Hacksaw Ridge should do the job.
","Some reviews have said that Hacksaw Ridge is a return to form for Mel Gibson. That's sort of true, if you consider the general form of a Gibson film to be deeply violent, thrilling and devoid of any subtlety whatsoever.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is gripping throughout, although there is no need for the first 40 minutes of war movie cliché and small town guff. It could easily kick straight off with the incessant gore and carnage which Gibson clearly focused most of his attention on. <br/><br/>Once the schmaltzy build-up is over we get into the real action and the change in tone is quite brutal. During the first part of the film Andrew Garfield (as Desmond Doss) woos and marries his sweetheart, earnestly fights his way through a court martial and doggedly earns the respect of his father and his squad. Next thing you know, we're on a war ravaged Japanese island and a man is running into battle using a dismembered corpse as a human shield.<br/><br/>If, like me, you spent a lot of your childhood recreating or pretending to be part of various world war two battles, then brace yourself. This is the film all juvenile war perverts have been dreaming of. Bullets smash through helmets and skulls. Blokes with flame throwers strapped to their back casually stroll around incinerating everyone in their path. Blown off legs, arms and heads fly everywhere, soldiers dive onto live grenades and everyone is screaming in everyone else's bloodied and muddied face. <br/><br/>You get the feeling there must have been a lot of friendly fire in chaotic battles like this but Hacksaw Ridge is not the film to broach such sensitive subjects. Instead its unashamed mission is to show us writhing bodies and flapping bloodied stumps in as real and graphic a way as modern technology will allow. It's gory, unnecessary and certainly ridiculous but it is also engrossing and incredibly well shot. Nevertheless, as the violence and trauma hits hard and fast in the second half, there is no corresponding increase in depth or meaning. In many ways this is exactly the type of war film which Tropic Thunder made fun of so well. <br/><br/>The Japanese soldiers (or rather the 'gooks, dinks and goddam Japs') are unquestionably the bad guys here, almost as though they have become Mel's new Jews. They are screaming, monstrous, sneaky little bastards and they get treated as such by the invading soldiers. Even the wounded Japanese, brought to safety by the pacifist medic and hero of the film Doss, 'don't make it' (i.e. they get snuffed out by the other American soldiers without a hint of remorse). <br/><br/>There is no real contemplation of the other side of things in Hacksaw Ridge. Towards the end of the film a Japanese general accepts defeat and nobly performs hari-kari. Even this seems included only to show some more CGI guts being spilled, this time by blade rather than by bullet. In this way, Hacksaw Ridge demonstrates not only the awfulness of war but also how it can be used as a free license for almost pornographic levels of violence in the name of 'honouring history'.<br/><br/>Whether or not all veterans would be happy with this depiction of the mass slaughter and trauma they endured, recreated so gratuitously in High Definition and Dolby Surround Sound (and, as a result, raking in big cash at the box office), is maybe a worthy question. But then again, who cares about such considerations when you get to see a man carrying a flamethrower explode into a massive ball of fire. Why not 3D Mel?<br/><br/>Despite the remarkable true story of medic Desmond Doss, and its connotations of courage and selflessness in the wake of real life horror, Hacksaw Ridge contains a lot of comedic lines and cheap jump scares. There is little of the sadness and quiet reflection of Saving Private Ryan or even Flags of our Fathers. <br/><br/>Maybe this is a film for its own time. Glossy, brash, aggressive and with little depth. A potential Oscar winner representative of the new Trump era."

"Troy_Campbell","7","3","11","5 November 2016"," A solid return for Gibbo.
","It has been ten years since Mel Gibson was calling the shots for Mayan saga Apocalypto, but his direction here is so confident and ambitious you wouldn't know it. It's like he never left. This true story is essentially split into three parts: the introductory story to our heroic protagonist, the training segment full of adversity, and the horrific battle between the Yanks and the Japanese atop the eponymous ridge. Each act is better than the last, with the family and romantic drama at the beginning slow and not totally convincing, the boot camp section predictable but highly engaging, and the extended war climax an immersive triumph. It doesn't come as a surprise that Gibbo feels most comfortable with the battle scenes—he is the director of Braveheart after all—and in this respect he is firing on all cylinders, creating a truly intense and visceral experience. The death and decay is gruesome and unsettling—you can almost smell the burning flesh and rotting corpses—but the savagery is necessary to generate the authentic juxtaposition of horror and heroism. Portraying Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to win the Medal of Honor, Andrew Garfield is put the through the wringer both physically and emotionally, ultimately giving a solid performance despite working with some cheesy melodrama at the start. The supporting cast are predominantly strong, particularly Hugo Weaving who acts the hell out of his drunken WWI vet and Vince Vaughn who dishes out a delightfully shouty and zinger-filled turn as Doss' drill sergeant. A moving tale of one man's struggle to stay true to his beliefs whilst helping his country in the most harrowing of circumstances, Hacksaw Ridge is proof that Gibson should be behind the camera more often."

","If this was really based on actual events as they happened I will eat my shorts. As a number of people have pointed out, not only is a 100 foot sheer cliff very topographically unlikely except on a beach, how on earth did the Japanese allow a climbing net being erected on it and then not simply chop it down? ""Duh"" the Americans are climbing up to kill us so we will allow them to do it. A competent machine gunner could have mowed them down as they appeared at the top anyway, as shown in reverse when the Jap soldiers appear at the edge in pursuit of Doss and are shot to bits by the Americans below. I really hate unrealistic films especially those claiming to show reality!
BTW Braveheart was not a great movie, it also claimed to be realistic and compeletely departed from historical reality. An exciting movie maybe."

","This was another masterpiece by Mel Gibson, but the most masterful thing about it is that it was based on the true life story of Desmond Doss, an American hero. This movie made me proud to be an American. I wouldn't agree with Desmond's take on Scripture with regards to ""killing"", but more importantly I don't have to. All those men were heroes. All of them loved their country and were willing to die for it to protect their loved ones. Just as importantly, as Americans, our Founding Fathers understood and recognized the importance of not compelling free people to violate their conscience. So agree or disagree with Doss' stance, he was the real deal, and clearly was honored by God and man for it. The ending scene was an acknowledgment of sorts to the faith of his fellow soldiers, by choosing to lead them into battle with prayer on Saturday (his Sabbath).<br/><br/>Doss, in his own way, was an extraordinary testament in bravery, courage, conviction, and self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Well acted and gripping throughout. It's appalling that so many out there chose to rate this classic so poorly. A sign of the times - and not a good one."
"SnoopyStyle","7","2","6","12 May 2017"," aw shucks sincerity
","Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up with his brother Hal, his loving mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths), and volatile drunken father Tom (Hugo Weaving) who returned damaged from the Great War. His mother's religious upbringing and childhood traumas lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist. He falls in love with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). To his father's dismay, Hal joins the military. Desmond joins anyways but he insists on being a conscientious objector. His view clashes with Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) and the military commanders. He even faces court-martial. During the Battle of Okinawa, he becomes the last man to leave Hacksaw Ridge after being over-run and ends up saving many of his comrades.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield does his aw shucks puppy-face acting which I find a bit annoying. It's deliberately naive at times. A corollary of that happens with his reasoning for joining the military. He seems to join out of embarrassment. I want him to be more resolute in his religious belief and I need him to state his need to save more directly. There is a comparison to Gary Cooper's Sergeant York whose religious conversion is spelled out more clearly. The solution is all right there in the movie. He needs to save his brother or somebody like his brother. He just needs to do is say that.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is a highly skilled director and the action is top notch. The movie can be heavy-handed at times. On the other hand, the heaviest-handed moment of him walking alone into a field of artillery fire is probably the best moment in the movie. It is a balancing act. It works most of the times but Mel can push it too far into overwrought territory. Overall, he has created a movie in his own vision and that's pretty compelling."
"Rawal_Afzal","7","2","6","20 February 2017"," A breath of fresh air amongst war films!!!!
","Although I'd some minor idea as to what this film is going to be about, but still I was expecting it to be your average battlefield film, but it really surprised me once it got to the point of showing his accomplishment. Admitted that it's literally impossible to re- enact the happenings of a war and to show 100% accurately as to what exactly might've happened, but I think it was a very commendable effort by the film-maker, coupling it with the hide-and-seek kind of thrilling moments where you'd always be on your toes seeing the Japanese soldiers chasing him and often them missing him by a whisker.<br/><br/>A couple of blips on the film were, firstly the whole thing in the start could've been shorter to shorten the length of the film, and secondly the lead-up war scene to the main act was a bit too long and boring, really giving me the impression that the film is going nowhere and made me fear that this will be exactly like your any war film.<br/><br/>Overall, again, really appreciable the fact that this film chooses to show and glorify another kind of war hero other than the average Joe with a gun. He was different and indeed a brave guy, a guy who stepped onto the battlefield without a gun - the most unique kind of act in a war. His determination to stick to his words and not to be pressurised into going against his principles is worthy of praise."
"billcr12","8","2","6","8 February 2017"," Gibson's War
","Mel Gibson may be a racist lunatic in his real world life, but he is one hell of a movie director. His eye for detail in Hacksaw Ridge is impeccable. Andrew Garfield is Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who will not carry a weapon or kill due to his Seventh Day Adventist upbringing. Early on, he encounters a bureaucratic wall, as the military informs him of the necessity of carrying a gun in combat. Doss eventually is able to travel to Japan as a medic and winds up in some extremely vicious and bloody battles near Okinawa in 1945, just before the end of World War II. The fighting scenes are fairly typical of previous war films and the basic training insult laden, politically incorrect drill sergeant are lifted from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" Mel can be forgiven for this, as the character development is fully realized by Garfield and the supporting cast never hits a false note. The last few minutes are a beautiful tribute to a real American hero and Hacksaw Ridge is one of the ten best movies of the year."
"aidanvoonav","8","2","6","6 February 2017"," Wonderful directing
","Okay, okay. Before anybody gets angry at me for saying the directing is good, i meant that the directing by Mel Gibson was wonderful, splendid and all round beautiful. It does not mean in anyway that i agree with what he said in the past nor do i like him as a person. IF you guys are actual movie goers and actual movie enthusiasts like i am, you cannot argue about how gorgeously this film was directed. This film was directed in a way to show us exactly how gruesome and horrid war can be. It shows us how violent and terrible and outcome of a war is and i like it. Too many times movies have shown us war heroes that go through war like as though it were some sort of video game. War is not a video game nor is it adventurous nor is it fun. This film shows war as it is and doesn't glorify war either. Another thing that this movie does is that it doesn't try and justify itself and it doesn't try and explain much about why people do what they do. Which in my opinion is good, because people in general are like that. People in general do not need a reason to hate, they do not need a reason to love nor do they need a reason to do anything. This movie is surreal and realistic (for the most part) in their representation of war. And i like that. For the acting, it's not extremely great but it is fairly good. As this is based of a true story, the story isn't exactly original, but hey, it's based of a true event. Another notable thing about this movie is its pacing. There was not a time where i felt like they should skip a scene nor should they push the story a head nor did i feel like a scene was unnecessary. In fact, i was very invested in the film and wanted to watch it through. As a whole, this film is very nice and entertaining and it is by far, way better than the film ""Unbreakable"" by Angelina Jolie which i found slightly overrated and dry. (both films are depictions of war heroes and even though Louis Zamperini arguably did way more than Desmond Doss, Hacksaw Ridge made Desmond Doss look like more of a hero as it looked like Desmond had to go through a tougher time even though he did not compared to Louis Zamperini)"
"thechoctopfilmblog","8","2","6","5 February 2017"," An extraordinary man, with an extraordinary tale
","Bravery comes in many forms, especially during times of war. Desmond Doss' story is one that makes us re-assess the truest form of it. An extraordinary man, with an extraordinary tale, it's difficult not to be drawn to his story. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is the nickname given to the 400 foot cliff 'Maeda Escarpment', a stronghold for the Japanese's defence of Okiwana. Known as the bloodiest battle of the Pacific, the capture of Hacksaw Ridge was vital to the battle of Okiwana. In April 1945, a young combat medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield – 'Silence'), was one of those deployed to conquer the ridge. <br/><br/>Shy and taciturn, Garfield suited the role of Doss very well. If you took one look at Doss, we would most likely immediately write him off as a war hero. He is the unlikeliest of heroes, in much contrast to Garfield's previous character of the 'Amazing Spiderman'. He has no super powers here, instead, his 'power' stems from his unwavering faith in his religious beliefs and his unbridled valour in putting other men before himself. Garfield has proved that he could handle serious roles with '99 Homes', and in this film, he advances his capabilities further and demonstrated incredible inner strength despite his slim build. <br/><br/>As a fervent Seventh - day Adventist, Doss is tenaciously committed to the Ten Commandments, and vowed to never pick up a weapon. As a result, in his training at Fort Jackson, he endured horrendous abuse and bullying from other men. Ironically, he was despised for his 'cowardice'. Even his commanding officers loathed him and attempted to court martial him for refusing to obeying orders of handling a firearm. Undeterred by this, Doss remained resolute, and not once did he show hatred towards those that hurt him. Even if you're not a believer, you cannot help but be moved by his kindness and faith. <br/><br/>After 10 years break, director Mel Gibson ('Braveheart', 'Passion of the Christ') returns once again with a gritty war epic. Gibson does not shy away from the sheer brutality and violence of the battles, and showcases in gruesome detail, the ruthless and unforgiving nature of war. The battle scenes are bold and excruciatingly honest, closely reminiscent of the beach landing scenes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Death is quick and fleeting, but its wounds are lasting. Gibson tells war stories as it is, and in my opinion, it is necessary. It prompts us to think, how much courage would this man have to save so many men in circumstances like this? <br/><br/>Screenwriters Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan take their time sketching the character of Doss, steadily adding additional elements about his childhood, personality and relationships. Despite its central focus on Doss, the film does manage to develop a few memorable characters, including Doss' wife Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), Sgt Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey). I particularly enjoyed the caricatures Vaughn had for his men. Hugo Weaving was convincing as Doss' father – a veteran of WWI suffering from PTSD related alcoholism and depression. <br/><br/>Doss is famously credited with saving 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge, without firing a single shot. For his bravery, he became the first conscientious objector (though he calls himself a conscientious co-operator) to receive the Medal of Honour. After watching this film, you would feel he undoubtedly deserved it. <br/><br/>Sometimes heroes themselves don't feel like heroes. They feel they're merely doing what they think is right. Doss never took glory for his actions, he believes he did what he did was because of God. At Hacksaw, all you hear him say was 'Please Lord, help me save one more'. The ones he saved were never enough, he just wanted to save one more – much like Oskar Schindler. The courage of these men were unfathomable. After all they have accomplished, all they could think about were still not of themselves, but of others. Hacksaw Ridge was a tribute to those heroes."
"americusr","8","2","6","5 February 2017"," Don't miss it, but...
","A lot was terrific. The lead was consistently great (Sorry, I don't bother with most new names anymore), loved his backwoods face, nice touches and plenty of clubs over the head in re: war and sacrifice. Variously brutally objective or unashamedly nostalgic about the White, Christian American myth, nice rendering of Depression-era, rural Virginia, bible and brotherhood motifs, the feather, a rifle puking smoking cartridges three inches from my eye, the dad's cemetery scenes. I almost gasped at some sets and exteriors seen through Mel and his cameraman's storytelling eyes: the Appalachians, that Dantesque trek into Hell, the rope ladder, those infernos, fathers and sons, that beautiful scene of budding romance in the movie theater amid flashes of swastikas, the mother's wisdom, the flashbacks with the pistol: all so well done. The incident with the brick, yeah, that was me gasping. Sixty years ago when I was a little kid my barber had a totally burnt head. At the clinic in town Doss paused to let him by. <br/><br/>Minuses? Thought Worthington was great, loved his Arthur Kennedy face, agony written all over, and well played when the script didn't let him down. May I nit pick? The worst age make up I've seen in a long time. Visible latex around the eyes. <br/><br/>The real 'noise' started when Doss went off to basic. #1: Mel's choices of actors for and direction of soldiers: the ethnics, OK, but the WASPy boys...huh-uh. OK, the mean one and the dorky one were fine. Those were not Greatest Generation faces, mate. Those were post-modern, Heinz 57. Too homogenized. Too....Millennial! The Hollywood guy? Those were Planet Fitness and protein shake muscles. Men were never built that way in the Forties. And that face? Compare it to Flynn, Gable or Cooper. OK, maybe Tyrone Power. The younger officers: the same, except for his drill sergeant.<br/><br/>The first two scenes in the barracks: very stagey, mannered performances and my-big-break-out-of-drama-school amateurish, the background boys looking exactly that, the writing stagey (theatrical), unrealistic and stilted. Good fight scenes. <br/><br/>But then, the scene when the sarge tells him to give up and, after that, as one by one the officers up the chain, for various reasons and backed up by rueful horns and strings, betray an underlying sympathy for him, OMG, I thought they were going to kiss him sometimes! After the court martial they were all 1980s, Alan Alda-sensitive guys. Doss melted every heart? I doubt it. Men didn't act like that. They had no reference to even know how to act like that. Too soft, too ""touch me-feel me."" And if they felt it, they wouldn't have shown it so overtly. That's Melodrama, not Cinema. They should never have been directed to wear it on their sleeves until The End. And here's where the structure got in the way. It had to happen abruptly because in 'Act Two' it's the end of the war, 1945, and he's obviously long won their respect, which leads us to the finale. But that's what I wanted to see! We're cheated out of how he won it with these out-of-character switcheroos. <br/><br/>An interesting lesson I think: you can't be true to a story like this and play it with modern sensibilities, because our modern sensibilities have been largely defined and articulated by Hollywood, a specifically Method Hollywood, an approach to interpersonal exchange that only just began to influence our culture, speech, informality after the War. But I'm showing my age. No one but a Boomer would know what I was talking about.<br/><br/>The score: I really thought Mel was above this kind of blatant audience manipulation. Hated it. It didn't trust the story, the actors or the audience. Every heart-tugging trick in the book. That juxtaposition of pseudo-church music and choirs with blood and entrails! No! I wanted something else! Abbott and Costello! Yma Sumac! I don't know, or Nothing! The triteness of the music actually distanced me from the reality Mel was going for. I really wanna slap some of these composers. It's all John Williams' fault, btw. He's almost ruined Lo Spielberg for me at times. Yes, the battle scenes were horrifically, excellently shot and edited. The accompaniment? Oh, here we go: more minor horns descending and an all male chorus's durging, punctuated with slo- mo...please: my nerves. <br/><br/>But, then again, when they said they had to go back the third time, I may have come the closest ever to knowing what utter despair is. If anyone with a hypodermic ever says to me ""This is gonna make it OK,"" I'll know they're taking me out. And something odd: after a while I actually became inured to the slaughter and watched it with a kind of perverse and unflinching curiosity about the many ways the human body can be exploded. <br/><br/>I'm typing with my right arm raised: Henceforth, whenever I hear or see yet another reference to The Wizard of OZ in any work of art, I'm walking out. Is The Wizard of OZ the only myth that unites American culture? THAT IS PATHETIC! Regardless, there was no TV in 1945. There were no DVDs. No one had seen The Wizard of OZ since its cool reception in the summer of 1939. The guy the sarge said ""You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy"" to, as they pulled themselves up to Calvary, would either have thought the guy'd lost his mind or wanted his back rubbed.<br/><br/>Wait a sec...Is this movie a kind of cancellation of Brokeback Mountain? Just a joke.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Best intentions in the world, a needed-to-be-told story of the cost of American Individualism that is great when the action tells it, with a great leading man, quite a lot of bad soldier dialogue, beautiful camera, design and editing work, not a big budget for actors and writers or makeup, and a score to make sure we don't think it's a comedy."

Perhaps the only ""negative"" points of the direction are attributed to some slow ""unnecessary"" movements. I also felt that ""something is missing"" in the scenes that start a movie story, and show a family, city and love life of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) character, but nothing that is extremely bad. Talking about Garfield, the actor is incredible, managing to pass on his character's ""innocence"" during the whole movie, making the viewer that this man really would die for his personal belief. Make an analysis of a change, putting a test one more time an ability to do, becoming more ""physical"". In short, the best Spider-Man in the theaters, shows that he has an undeniable talent throughout the film. The story, while not having anything great, is built very well, arresting the audience to the movie pace with certain ease, and thrilled in its ""climax"", in addition, all the cast of excellent support, For Hugo Tecendo, but making clear that the rest of the cast delivers what is expected, when necessary.

But this one was quite good & easy to watch unlike others which are either too boring or simply lack action required to keep the audience interested!<br/><br/>Saw this last week not long after it was released in January, it was a great film on how a young man who never broke his principles & pushed forward despite what he had against him. The story is about a young man who goes off into the army, but doesn't want to fire a weapon let alone touch one, he vows to become a paramedic during the war on the battlefield helping the those who are severely wounded & injured! He then goes even further & helps more injured soldiers! Based off true events, this film portrays what happened during the first & second World War! <br/><br/>I found the film to be quite moving. Though it wasn't a film I'd be in a hurry to watch or even get on DVD, it was still a interesting film on the real life events which took place. <br/><br/>The war & action scenes were done well. The blood & gore was pretty decent & the injury detail was hard hitting & raw! It really did portray the devastating effects the war has on people physiologically & psychically! It was a good watch of a film!<br/><br/>I give this an 8/10! A must watch!"
"davidgee","8","2","6","1 February 2017"," An American Hero without a gun
","Wow. Mel Gibson's 'comeback' as a director is a war movie more savage, more visceral than anything I've seen since Hammer's CAMP ON BLOOD ISLAND in 1958, which probably wasn't as brutal as I remember it.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a powerful central presence as the Christian boy from Alabama who wants to serve his country with a medical kit rather than a gun and who is viewed by his comrades first as a coward, then as a hero. As he did in SILENCE last month, Garfield continues to remind me of the young Montgomery Clift. Sam Worthington contributes a solid performance as the platoon captain, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths as Garfield's violent drunken father and abused mother were presumably cast as a 'nod' to Gibson's Australian roots.<br/><br/>The end-credit 'portfolio' of photos and interviews with the real- life Desmond Doss and the men he served with clearly underlines the fact that this is a true story about an amazing true hero. Viewers may wonder if Gibson ramped up the battle scenes a few degrees. Was there really as much 'medieval' hand-to-hand combat between our guys and the Japanese soldiers on Okinawa as there was in the Crusades or the Wars of the Roses? Did our guys really torch the enemy with flame- throwers? Did Desmond Doss really single-handedly save so many wounded soldiers (some of them Japanese)?<br/><br/>As in BRAVEHEART and APOCALYPTO (and even in THE PASSION OF THE Christ), Mel Gibson focuses perhaps too lingeringly on gory death and dismemberment, but there's no denying that Hacksaw Ridge brings home the full horror of war – and the outstanding heroism that can blossom amid the carnage."

","There's a better way to fight your enemies apart from artillery, and that being with love as your weapon; for its harmless, softens hearts and always wins.<br/><br/>A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic elevation through a story that move like a love story then a war story, due to one man's fierce determination to pull his fellow platoons out of the fire as this shows tremendous act of love.<br/><br/>This trailer is eye-striking and musically stunning, with effects that will blow your mind.<br/><br/>The performance full of conviction and strong. Andrew Garfield was truthfully and emotionally connected as he took on the needed RAW emotions to fully transform into his character; to show hard work, technique, and good direction. In which, none of this is seen, but the fully realised three-dimensional character right in the truth of the moment. The other characters were believable American soldiers played by Australian actors who showcased a ton of character strengths and virtues. Like courage, perseverance, bravery, prudence, leadership, teamwork, honesty, zest, wisdom, humanity, kindness, justice, fairness, social intelligence, love, Temperance, Forgiveness, Humility, Prudence, Self-Regulation, Transcendence, Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, and Spirituality.<br/><br/>The trailer keeps you on edge as it takes you into the highlight reel of the life of ""Desmond Doss who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers, and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers"" (ref. 'Hacksaw Ridge' Trailer app).<br/><br/>The production quality is brilliant and attractive throughout; both visually, musically with a dynamic display of sound effects.<br/><br/>Overall, the trailer holds your attention hostage as it gives you this anticipation that you can't afford not to see in a theater for the full movie experience."

"Wuchakk","6","1","2","1 December 2019"," Tribute to a real-life WW2 ""conscientious collaborator""
","After Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss' potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant.<br/><br/>Based on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroic element too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding ""Platoon"" (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.<br/><br/>The movie's about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn't. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to ""turn the cheek"" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: ""A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult"" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one's nation.<br/><br/>For proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren't absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple - throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They're wrong. Sometimes it's necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"

","This is a good movie. A conscientious objector wins the Medal of Honor. Shows that one need not use a weapon to be a hero. It also shows the fanaticism of the Japanese troops who had zero chance of winning, yet would rather die than surrender. The movie would have been stronger if it had provided more historical context to the story. For instance, why the US found it necessary to invade Okinawa and why the Japanese fought fanatically to defend it. The movie presumes that the audience knows the history of the US-Japanese war in the Pacific. It also does not provide more depth into the characters and personalities of the Japanese soldiers who, without exception, are ALL depicted as mad, blood thirsty maniacs. Nevertheless, the movie succeeds in telling a story of one man who stayed true to his principles and emerged a hero."

"cayaatkins","10","1","2","15 October 2018"," One of my favorite movies
","Hacksaw Ridge <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The first half lays out the childhood and adolescence of its hero, Desmond T. Doss, a Seventh-day Adventist turned U.S. Army corporal. Set in Virginia hill country in the '20s and '30s, it's shot in the creamy hues of a Norman Rockwell painting, and filled with earnest, Old Hollywood-styled exchanges about violence and pacifism. The second half is set during the Battle of Okinawa, where Doss, who described himself as a ""conscientious collaborator"" rather than objector, rescued 75 fellow infantrymen injured by the Japanese. The combat pays nearly as much attention to the rending, burning and perforating of flesh as it does to the hero's anguish and ingenuity. Gibson shows soldiers using mortar shells as homemade grenades (as in the climax of ""Saving Private Ryan""), shifts into glorious slow-motion to showcase a soldier kicking an enemy's lobbed grenade away, and treats us to the surreal and inappropriately comic sight of Doss towing a paraplegic infantryman on a homemade sled while the man cuts down bushels of Japanese soldiers with a sub-machine gun. All that said, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" seems aware of its inability to present the horrors of war in a consistently non-thrilling, non-cool way. There are even moments where the film seems ashamed that it can't live up to Doss' example-particularly when other characters question Doss' belief that violence is never justified and that there is no real distinction between killing and murder. What you see on other characters' faces in these scenes is not contempt but incredulity, followed by petulance and finally denial. They can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty. The rifles that Doss refuses to pick up are described as girls, women, mates, ""perhaps the only thing in life you'll truly love."""

"byrann_gowan","9","1","2","24 August 2018"," Welcome back, Mel
","Over the years, Mel Gibson had developed a bad rep in Hollywood, most notably for his drunken anti-Semitic rants. It seemed like he was going to be blackmailed for the rest of his life by Hollywood. But, in a Robert Downey Jr.-like moment, he has returned in full form with his first directorial feature film since Apocalypto and, I have to say it, it is so good to have him back in the good graces of Hollywood!<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector who joined the army in the midst of World War II. However, due to his beliefs, he did not allow himself to touch a weapon, thus causing a rift between him and the rest of his fellow men. However, once they arrive at Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa, they - along with us - see a true hero emerge as he saves the lives of countless men fighting alongside him.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Mel Gibson has created a masterful stroke of genius, and it was so good to see him get recognized once again by the Academy over 20 years after his previous Oscar wins for Braveheart. While he is a good actor, it is behind the camera where he shines the most; he knows what angles to use, what direction to take. Also, since this is a war film, I must remind everybody of one of Mel's previous films, The Passion of the Christ. Since that movie is considered one of the most violent movies ever, it is safe to say that once the war scenes come in this movie, you know that Mel will not hold back. But with a war film, that is definitely a good thing. There is no sugar coating war of any kind and thankfully they got the right guy to direct the film.<br/><br/>But he is not the only one who gets all the praise. Andrew Garfield received his first Oscar nomination as Desmond T. Doss in a role that cemented him as a great actor. While Garfield is well known for his turn as Spider-Man, it is his turn as Doss that will go down as one of the greatest movie heroes ever. Throughout the film, you see the struggle with his morality - you see it when he is being beaten by his own men for not touching a weapon and you see it when he is in the throes of battle. Garfield pulled it off so effortlessly that I truly believe that he was the one who was truly deserving of the Oscar that year. As a matter of fact, this film should've won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>But this film would not have gotten made if it weren't for one man. On that note, I must pay my respect to soldiers who give their life to fight not just for their country, but for all countries in all the world. While I am not a supporter of war and violence, I have a lot of respect for those who stand up to the bully. As for Doss...where there was hell, you showed us Heaven; when there was darkness, you showed us light; when there was despair, you gave us hope. Thank you so much for never giving into your morality and for saving all those men on the battlefield. Your courage has not been forgotten.<br/><br/>""With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together."" - Desmond T. Doss, Hacksaw Ridge"

"DKosty123","8","1","2","23 July 2017"," A True Story Not Varnished
","Mel Gibson's 7th directing effort in film is a very serious solid dramatic effort. The film is everything the true story and title implies. The battle for Okinawa was one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific (most the campaign was pretty bloody) as the Japanese considered Okinawa as a home Island and fought furiously to defend it. Hackshaw Ridge was shown as a ridge with a massive complex of tunnels the defending troops would stay in until American Troops were trying to take the ridge. Then they would come out and suicide attack the Marines. <br/><br/>Desmond Doss (played by former Spiderman Andrew Garfield) true story deserves to be shared. Amazingly, 2 script writers wrote this true story script to film without the benefits of basing it on any novel. The facts of the story are amazing in themselves. Doss's father, a World War 1 vet does not want his son to go to war. His son enlists after Pearl Harbor but only as a Medic. Still, Dad is not happy. When his son is on trial in court for not willing to train with a rifle, Dad shows up in uniform in court. It is an important true story within the story. Vince Vaughn is very effective as Sgt Howell in training camp and on Okinawa. <br/><br/>This is a very serious film with few light moments (naked man in boot camp). It is told pretty much straight forward from Doss childhood after the opening battle credits. The facts stated at the end of the film are amazing. The biggest won, Doss Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the unit from Hackshaw Ridge. It is hard to tell if it is totally like it really happened but it is well told. The drama is solid, and worthwhile."

"lavatch","Null","1","2","21 February 2017"," Desmond Doss--A Genuine War Hero
","The focus of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is on the Battle of Okinawa in May, 1945. It was there that Private Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector serving as a medic, distinguished himself for his valorous rescue of wounded soldiers.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was excellent as Doss, and he was supported by an able ensemble of performers. Mel Gibson provided a sure hand in directing graphic battle sequences.<br/><br/>The only weakness of this fine film was in the opening section that sought to offer exposition of Doss's childhood and family background. These early scenes were far too complex than they should have been. There was excessive use of flashback and simply too many of the domestic sequences. It was difficult even to follow the basic family relationships in the abusive Doss family.<br/><br/>While it was important to show that young Doss was capable of applying a tourniquet and that he was a gentle, passive soul, the most important revelation about his abusive, drunken father did not even come until a flashback incorporated late into the film.<br/><br/>Apart from the clumsy and over-written opening segment, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was a powerful and provocative war film.<br/><br/>For film-goers who enjoyed this film, an intriguing film that was released concurrently is called ""Ithaca."" There are remarkable similarities in the approach of the two films to the impact of World War II on the home front."

","This was one of the worst films of 2016. Sure Gibson did a nice job with the combat scenes and that's the only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1 but the rest is just garbage. Andrew Garfield is a mediocre actor at best and the story is just laughable. Gibson lets his own religious bias shine through and portrays Doss as some kind of Jesus figure even adding that ridiculous light shining on him at the end. Anyone who believes Doss never picked up a weapon of any kind while rescuing those soldiers all by himself and surrounded by Japanese troops are either stupid or so gullible they believe in the same imaginary friend as Doss did!"
"vinni_vinni","4","2","7","31 May 2018"," What just happened there?
","I've been on IMDB since years and have never ever written a review. This incredible movie begs for an exception to be made. Me and my wife were looking forward to see this movie. We used to be watching movies every night ... but since the birth of our daughter we don't get to see films that often anymore. That's why we only pick the special ones. And oh boy ... this turned out to be very special.<br/><br/>The story of Doss is very gripping for sure, a true hero. Unfortunately it's very hard to take this film seriously. The first part of the movie is so extremely corny that it became a caricature of itself. Sugar was dripping off the screen in gallons. Not even the cheapest soap opera would be this tedious. Doss is from a troubled family, his father lost his friends in WWI and couldn't cope with that ... Doss decides to join the army as a medic and refuses to touch a weapon because of his beliefs. The army doesn't like that and Doss takes it all the way to court. He's very determined. Sounds like a strong guy eh ... but he's continuously presented as the biggest victim of the universe. Ow poor silly Doss, how did you end up in this conflicting situation? Why don't people understand? <br/><br/>Second part got even worse: strategically the entire battlefield didn't make any sense. After the assault the army pulled back and Doss sticked around to help and save his buddies. Somehow it doesn't trouble him at all that people are killing each other. Good for him, just one more to save! I'm sure the real Doss was a strong hero. In this movie he's presented as retarded guy that has some disorder making him help people.<br/><br/>At some point the Japanese only needed to cut some ropes and throw some grenades down to get red of the Americans. But of course they didn't. On top of it all Doss was gifted a shower scene that belonged in Bay Watch and slapped a grenade away as if he was playing women's tennis at Wimbledon <br/><br/>Sorry for putting my thoughts down in a pretty random order. In short: Saving Private Ryan ambitions turned somehow into a very cheap way less funny Inglorious Bastards rip-off. Want to see a good WWII movie? Watch Das Boot, Longest Day, Letters from Iwo Jima, a Bridge Too Far, Patton, Dunkrik, etc ... Want a good laugh with your buddies? Watch Hacksaw Ridge."

","Others have noted how the violence is gratuitous and excessive. The story could surely be told without this, as evidenced by so many better movies about World War II.<br/><br/>However, I haven't seen any discussion of why Gibson and co. shamelessly copied Kubrick's drill sergeant hazing scene from Full Metal Jacket. This is far beyond mere homage, to a lengthy repeat of the nicknames (""Joker""), war face/yell, love-for-your-rife, etc. I found this copying outrageous and boring.<br/><br/>On the score of tedium, that goes for most of the film. The love story is without passion, although I grant that Garfield is a talented actor. The only drama is in the final exchange between Doss and Smitty.<br/><br/>Does anyone really believe that a veteran or anyone could interrupt a court martial and address the presiding judge? I guess this has to fall under the heading of total suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Finally, Hacksaw Ridge as depicted in the film is pretty dramatic and resembles Banzai Cliff on Saipan. But the Maeda Escarpment in Okinawa was apparently where Doss's exploits occurred."

","Everyone is saying it is a great produced war movie. First of all, a considerable part of the story takes place at the protagonist life before he went to war and, honestly, I think this is the best part. We have great comic events on the army training. Then we see the war we were waiting and yes, the wounds are very realistic and you do have to have stomach to watch. But still it looked like a movie. If I had to tell one reason I would say the camera movements and takes. All we see is the common beautiful shots we are used to. Everything is so clean that at the end the protagonist's hair remains untouchable. The script does not surprises us as well. The dialogues are simple and it leaves the impression that the movie is too anxious to get to the war as fast as possible. At the end we see it taking the side of religion and exalting the hero. I do think Desmond Doss is a hero but I do not think we should say what he did was a good thing. What he did was madness and he was very lucky to came out alive. The performances are very impressive especially Andrew Garfield's. To conclude, if you enjoy a good war movie this is the right way to go. If you don't, it does not worth to see too much blood for a weak plot."

","Mel Gibson is back! And not in front of the screen but behind it! And we already know that what he does with the camera sometimes is way better than his performances and this film is a perfect example of it.<br/><br/>The story that the film is based on is an interesting if not hard to believe story, but it did really happen. Having a good story to make a movie about does not mean that the movie is going to be a good movie, is not the case of this one, as it is indeed a great movie. The story is brilliantly told, we see the evolution of the main character, his childhood, his preparation for war and the point of it all, when he is at war, what he does, how he does it and at some point we learn why he does all this no weapon thing.<br/><br/>The camera follows the main actor, Andrew Garfield, wherever he goes. It's a smooth movement that keeps us attached to the main character. Andrew does a fantastic work in this movie, which proves that he is an actor with potential so it looks like that we will hear more from him (and that he has obtained an Oscar nomination for this role just proves it).<br/><br/>At some point you will smell in the air a big of ""Saving Private Ryan"", because it is how it is made, but instead of somebody trying to find a private and to rescue him, in here is the private who is doing all the rescuing, which is simply impressive when you think it really happened, maybe not that way exactly, but it doesn't make it less incredible.<br/><br/>An entertaining movie where you will learn what a real hero is without the need of special powers or spandex outfits. Because heroes really exist and here is an example to learn about one of them while being entertained."

","Likes : Wow this film is incredible on storytelling of one of America's greatest heroes during the WWII that never fired a shot once due to religiously beliefs , with his courage and bravery he rescued over 75 men from the what i can describe ""hell on earth"" that was hacksaw ridge.<br/><br/>This film is brutal , emotional , intense and very frightening as it throws you into a story of the bravest men that throw them self in to a ""meat grinder"" , as wave upon wave of Japanese fighter's throw them self at them with a kamikaze attitude.<br/><br/>This is how war film should be portrayed with brutal violence , with an emotional concept giving a realistic point of view of how war was like during these times , Despite all the things Mel Gibson has said in the past it look as if Hollywood has forgive him and give him a chance. Mel certainly is good at directing as what his done with this film is incredible directing , with good direction and flow.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield we haven't seen a lot of since the spider man film although his recent film silence after he was fired , but i think after this film he's proved to Hollywood that he can have a variety of acting skill as his performance in this film was nothing short of perfection.<br/><br/>Andrew portrays Desmond Doss on screen playing a simple country farm boy that found god after an incident with his father who refuse to carry or shot a weapon in this war , yet he wanted to be apart of it which cause some upset with the generals & sergeants as they all called him a coward but despite of this allow him to serve as a medic.<br/><br/>Clearly during this war he's shown absolute bravery in the face of danger and death by rescuing 75 injured men from the Japanese onslaught on battle field which he was alone and by him self doing this , which to the shock of his fellow soldiers who we're all off the ridge saw him in a different light after this.<br/><br/>Andrew portray this brilliantly on screen with one of the best performance I've see in a long time , giving us a believable character and showing that Andrew has what it take to become to the next big star in Hollywood. Andrew is also up for a nomination in the Oscars which he well deserves for his performance in this film.<br/><br/>The action choreography and stunt work gone into this film to bring us a brilliant story is amazing done , these brutal scene through the film show a real situation in war. It very similar to film such as ""Apocalypse Now "", ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" in brutality , which add's to the film entertainment value also show us i vivid blood thirsty violent war.<br/><br/>The supporting cast made this film as well as they all play their part in the film with brilliance , from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer put in some screen time performance in this film surprised me on how good the casting is.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind being good as the side characters but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn , who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film , particularly that of an Army Sergeant which he done brilliantly.<br/><br/>Very rarely does a film in the year hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to film making from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best war film's I've seen since Mel Gibson ""we we're soldiers"" you be a fool to miss this film special on the big screen as this is a phenomenal film you must watch.<br/><br/>I will say this ; this is true heroism to actually rescue injury soldiers knowing that any min by yourself you can get shot , Desmond in the history of soldier is the bravest man I've seen who received the ""Medal of Honor"" the highest award for courage under fire.<br/><br/>He went on to marry his wife after the war until she sadly past away in 1991 son after he spoke up about the war saying "" the real heroes are buried over there"" at hacksaw ridge , Desmond Doss one of the bravest men to service in the us army who saved 75 men sadly past away at the age of 87 in march 2006."

","""In a world so set on tearing itself apart it doesn't seem to me like such a bad thing to want to put a little bit of it back together."" This film pulls you in within the first few minutes with brutal shots of battle in dramatic slow motion to a haunting score, which I can say now was the perfect preview of what was to come later in the movie. Andrew Garfield's character is introduced to the audience as a simple minded but well meaning, all around smiley, adorable young man. When we get farther into the movie we see the depth of his bravery and his values, and Garfield did this wonderfully. We felt the fear and the need to protect, the grief and the struggle to get people to listen, and the frustration when they refused to. I could sing my praises for this performance all day long. Shot in a two act format, that deviates from the standard three act formula, the first act is bright and happy with a bit of cloudiness, like one half of a yin yang, the other the opposite half, so they fit together quite nicely. This movie is brutal in its battle scenes. It is intense and merciless. I cannot emphasize this enough. Before our boys go into battle, we are introduced to them enough that you learn their complexities and loveliness and confusion for what is right; You fall in love with them a little. Therefore, it is so shocking when they enter the battlefield and you see young men getting blown to bits or shot through the back of the head with less than a second of screen time. There is no denying this is a fantastic movie, but the violence was a bit much for me. I only recommend knowing what you're getting into. A story about course and innovation and a desire to serve, this is the epitome of a Hero story with a capital H."
"Ricc0","7","2","7","27 November 2016"," Faith in Battlefield
","Gibson's work is a biographical war film about Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who ""fought without a rifle"" during the battle of Okinawa in WW2. Desmond Doss enlisted in the U.S. army voluntarily as a combat medic refusing then to carry a rifle or even touch it only to save 75 injured soldiers and clear them from the battlefield on his own. Doss won the highest medals in his country to become the first and only conscientious objector to receive the medal of honor in WW2.<br/><br/>Desmond, who died in 2006, turned down many offers for books and films because he was scared that they'd portray his life inaccurately. Gibson's film on the contrary, depicts Doss's life rather accurately except for certain events such as him taking the gun out of his father's hands, the details of his first marriage, and bringing him his bible out of the battlefield directly after he was wounded. A veteran of WW2 also stated that the term ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was not used back then but rather ""the escarpment"". Otherwise, the life story of Desmond down to the slightest details was depicted accurately. The same veteran even mentioned that they teased Doss a lot asking him all the time, ""What are you gonna do, Doss, if a Japanese comes around the corner and he's got a gun?"".<br/><br/>The film starts with scenes from Desmond's childhood were he used to be violent.. then it moves to his romantic life with a bit of comic atmosphere around it.. then the dramatic struggle of Desmond with his comrades and commanders for what he believes in. This is for the first part of the movie.. the action starts with the second part when Desmond goes to Okinawa.. and while the movie starts to become more and more violent the spiritual atmosphere all around it gets stronger (implying that Desmond's faith became stronger after witnessing the battle unlike what happens in many other cases). It is important to note that Desmond in fact was religious and one of his comrades said that he maintained his strong faith even during the battle. Gibson showed in one scene a courageous soldier afraid of death after he was fatally wounded implying also that faith at such moments is vital. The humanity of Doss towards his comrades as well as his enemy was touching (the film showed him rescuing 2 or 3 Japanese soldiers).<br/><br/>The symbols were nicely included yet I would say that it was not sentimental enough for its spiritual mood.. maybe it is about the characters' depth (I was not able to get emotionally involved as I did in ""Braveheart"") or the sequence of events where I found a gap between the two parts of the film.. Or maybe the incidents shot were more of an action for the second part and comic in the first part and that didn't help in maintaining a general mood of sentimentality. <br/><br/>The war scenes nevertheless are thrilling and turn sometimes to more of a horror genre.. and Gibson did pick up the horrors of war, yet, it did not seem as natural as it was with his ""Apocalypto"".<br/><br/>The score was appealing but I would not say the same about acting. I'd say Hugo Weaving was the best while I wish Andrew Garfield was a bit better. Vince Vaughn, an actor that I admire, was as always really funny where he should but I cannot say that his role as sergeant Howell really suits him.<br/><br/>All in all, Gibson directed a good movie about an interesting character that defended his beliefs in and outside the battlefield.. he stood for what he believed in, did not surrender, and the hardship he went through only made him stronger, more faithful, and more of a human."
"virindra","9","2","7","27 November 2016"," Vey intense movie,
","I am glad Gibson traded his career as an actor to direct movies. Despite of the negative sounds he got when he made Apocalypto and The passion of the Christ, he did not let them beat him down. And I am glad for that.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge has a magnificent cast. The first half of the movie has a romantic taste. It did not feel like a Gibson made movie. Vince Vaughn was hilarious. The first half was the building up towards a second half that turned out to be quite a spectacle. It felt like I was in that war. Very great shot, beautiful soundtrack, well done acting.<br/><br/>Maybe some will say this movie is nothing compared to Braveheart, The last samurai or even Platoon. I think that is correct.

"Oberrated","9","2","7","17 November 2016"," A rarity to ever take your eyes off the screen
","From start to finish, 'Hacksaw Ridge' practically demands attention. From the early phases of backstory and developing the ""who is Desmond Doss?"" answer, to the 100 mile an hour action sequences. 'Hacksaw Ridge' leaves its audience in awe at what is occurring on screen, and as previously stated before; this is a film to see for the year... Andrew Garfield does such a phenomenal job at portraying the kind-hearted Desmond Doss. In an environment filled with rough and tough characters and an enemy with nothing but bad intentions, Garfield creates a loving and heart warming character that you can not help but smile at... The battle scenes were incredible. From the very start, my jaw was floored and I could not take my eyes off the screen. It was just a constant barrage of chaotic action. Quite possibly one of my favorite aspects of this film due to the sheer intensity of the action portrayed... Lastly, I was very impressed by how Mel Gibson and company took true accounts said by Desmond Doss himself and inputted them into the film. Without spoils, this was very pleasing to watch as it happened.<br/><br/>I thoroughly think this may have some Oscar nods coming its way soon. Myself and some of my fellow film fans believe this too. One big recommendation by Oberrated to see 'Hacksaw Ridge' before it heads out of theaters and if not, definitely catch it upon its digital and physical copy release. From the director chair, to the artists in motions, to behind-the-scenes players, this whole product was quite the piece of entertainment."
"RforFilm","9","2","7","17 November 2016"," The story of Desmond Doss, a Christian medic who served in WWII, earns a grateful film with Hacksaw Ridge
","Within the hands of a solider, a gun is a killing machine that those in training learn to use and accept their fate as they will eventually have to take a life. Without the finger to fire, it is simply an item filled with the power to create change. I'm not making this an anti gun review as I myself have gone shooting (but I've never pointed it at anything living), but what I'm trying to get across is that every machine requires energy to perform its function, and those weapons cannot go off without the intervention of people operating it. <br/><br/>As an American, I believe in the right to own a gun as long as the owners are mentally sound to operate with it. But given their violent history, I can understand why one would object to their use. Guns are the primary example of a coin flip invention, which can have its use, but also hides a dark side. The subject of today's movie refused to touch a gun on religious grounds. He has every right to defy the social norms in order to show how ironically, he is American. Hacksaw Ridge is an example on how a solider can do important things without a rifle.<br/><br/>Were introduced to Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), who is a stance Seventh-day Adventist who abides by his philosophy to treating others well, especially after a flashback reveals he nearly killed his brother. After learning medicine from his nurse girlfriend Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) and seeing his brother enlist in the army, he too decides he needs to go to WWII for his country. He arrives at basic training under the command of Sergeant Howell (played by Vince Vaughn). Though Desmond does well under physical training, he becomes an outcast when he refuses to even touch a rifle during training.<br/><br/>Attempts to get Desmond to leave from physiological tests to even getting beaten up by fellow privates fail to break his spirit. At one point, Desmond get charged with insubordination when he doesn't follow an order from a superior to hold an unloaded weapon. Without saying how he gets out of it, he does make it through training where he's sent to the South Pacific where he becomes involved with the infamous Battle of Okinawa. Again, I won't say what he does, but it's so inspiring that it almost seems like Hollywood fiction (I looked into it, and it really did happen).<br/><br/>With a hero whose also religious, this could have been incredibly easy to hand this over to a Christian film company and let them handle it in a too safe manner. Instead, director Mel Gibson knew the importance of showing the brutality of WWII (I don't think I've seen this much blood since Saving Private Ryan) which always manages to balance with Desmond's beliefs. Andrew Garfield's voice might seem a bit hokey, but I think it manages to carry his character fine. I appreciate how the movie does reveal a lot of character and how his devotion to Jesus makes his struggle harder.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge reminded a lot of Full Metal Jacket, as both movies seem to feel different after the first half. Both have a basic training half and the other all about the days on the battlefield. What Hacksaw Ridge has over the latter is a more unique hero. It's an overall nice change of pace from the typical shot-the-bad-guy and everything will be fine. You don't see too many war stories about the ones who never fired a weapon. Even pacifists deserve to have their story told.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine Battle of Okinawa pictures out of ten. Mel Gibson is definitely back in full force behind the camera. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best of 2016 and I highly recommend this to those that want a WWII story that's different. While it's not for those that can't take too much violence, I think, like how Desmond defends his beliefs, the action is justified and deserves a chance."

","Mel Gibson, you must be one zealous, stuck up git to ruin a film like this. Despite an amazing true story and momentous historical context providing a perfect foundation for a great film, Mel Gibson screws it up by turning it into folksy, formulaic, religion-soaked dross.

","The first part of the movie was absolutely terrible. Full of clichés, religious nonsense and a love story less believable than the one in STAR WARS EPISODE 2. If the movie continued like that I would have probably given it a 3/10 or a 4/10.<br/><br/>Then comes the military part of movie and it was just excellent. I don't remember seeing such believable war scenes since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Excellent sound, excellent score, great war pyrotechnics, good cinematography.<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed by Andrew Garfield's acting. His constant silly smile is so annoying. Ignoring the smile, he was OK in his role - not more, not less. <br/><br/>If you manage to ignore the awful first part of the movie and Mel Gibson's regular nonstop religious themes, you better try to catch this movie at the cinema if it's still playing - that's a movie to watch on a big screen with good sound.<br/><br/>As much as I hate Mel Gibson on a personal basis, this was a good movie, if just for the authentic war scenes.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn, who I usually hate, was surprisingly good (perhaps the best actor in this movie) and it took me a while to recognize him. Although the military training had some FULL METAL JACKET ripoff vibe, he was good on his role."
"phizzle21","4","2","8","11 November 2019"," Hacksaw Ridge - The Notebook meets Tropic Thunder (feat. racist undertones)
","(4 out of 10 stars; minor spoilers included which do not give away much as this is ""based on a true story"" and apart from that the movie is terribly predictable)<br/><br/>Upfront, I would like to say that I have been rather susceptible to Mel Gibson's work in the past: Absolute fan of Braveheart, pretty impressed by Apocalypto and I could even get something out of The Passion. When watching his movies, I was usually able to overlook their weaknesses (such as the rather simple stories and dialogue, Mel's limited directing skills, overloads of pathos, gratuitous violence etc.) and allow myself to get hooked by their sheer overwhelming force and to enjoy the emotional ride.<br/><br/>This time, it just did not work for me. At all.<br/><br/>I do not want to go that much into the first third of the movie. A lot has been said about how cheesy and kitschy and clichéd it is. It actually reminded me of The Notebook (which I do not mean as a compliment).<br/><br/>The second third to me was basically a sort of blasphemy. If you try and take on Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, you can only lose. Especially, if your name is Mel Gibson. And in my opinion, he staged the military training part not so much as a quote and a bow to Kubrick, but sort of try to remake it. That was just bad. All these cardboard dudes in the barracks were also not really convincing. Of course, the meanest of them all in the end becomes sort of our hero's best friend.<br/><br/>The military trial scene was also rather ridiculous. Apparently, the right to refuse to serve for reasons of conscience was in the Constitution all along. Why did it take a letter from the major General to convince the court of that? And WHY was that same General already sitting in the room all along without saying anything??? ""True story"" or not, I am sure this is not, how it played out.<br/><br/>The whole war scenes were just too much. I am not faint of heart and I actually enjoy violent movies. If the violence serves a purpose or delivers a point made by the director. It is one thing to depict violence to show the audience the horrors and the pointlessness of war. However, Mel is just wallowing in exploding bodies and heads, severed heads and limbs, burning people, protruding innards and intestines, gushering pools of blood from open wounds and whining dying soldiers. It is just too much and actually bored me already in the very first opening scene.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the action is not realistic. The battle is a complete mess, with people from both sides everywhere all the time like in a sword fight (this is NOT Braveheart). Then all these explosions that have people and body parts constantly flying all over. It really reminded me of Tropic Thunder. I read a review from an actual combat veteran, saying that this depiction was utter BS and not remotely close to actual war.<br/><br/>What also really bugged me was the unrealistic set-up and actions. It would have been a matter of seconds for the Japanes, occupying the cliff, to just cut the damn cargo-net off and ending the U.S. attacks for good. Apart from that, why did they not constantly just bombard the U.S. troops below from the ledge. Instead, they let them climb up every time and went at them only then. ""True story"" or not, I am sure that the actual fight went down differently.<br/><br/>Another major problem I had was with the incredibly depiction of the Japanese which reminded me of an 80ies Chuck Norris Vietnam action movie. Rambo III was more nuanced and human in its portrayal of the Russians than this film. The Japanese soldiers in this movie are portrayed as faceless, blood-thirsty, almost super natural creatures who know no fear or sympathy (""Nobody can survive this..."" ""Well, they can.""). They just keep attacking, coming wave after wave, screaming frantically while they butcher the soldiers as if they were enjoying killing just for the sake of it. While the noble U.S. soldiers only see killing as a necessary evil in fulfilling their heavenly duty to protect their glorious home country and their comrades. When the evil Japanese are finally defeated, they come crawling out of their holes (literally), suddenly looking like broken animals (all of them are only wearing torn underwear at this point). Even now, of course, they can't be trusted. Waving a white flag in one hand, they insidiously toss a grenade at the U.S. soldiers with the other; giving them a welcome reason to gun down even the defeated Japanese. The only dignity, Mel grants to them, is the one of committing ritualized Seppuku in the face of defeat (as does the General in one of the final scenes).<br/><br/>I don't even want to go into the whole topic of religion and faith and how it is shown in the movie. It is even hard to criticise, considering we are watching a Mel Gibson film after all. It still was laughable, though.<br/><br/>One big surprise for me was actually this: When his girl visited him in prison and gave him.... ta-daah... a bible (what else?!), I was 100 % sure that the bible was going to stop a bullet to his heart in a later battle scene. Surprisingly, it did not. You got me on this one, Mel...<br/><br/>The 4 stars awarded are mostly for production value."
"shaun-porritt","3","2","8","28 November 2017"," Sharknado of War Films
","Sat through the turgid cheesy opening half expecting some decent war film action in 2nd half. From the over the top stepping through heads and entrails to the never end stream of slowmo shots of machine gun shooting while screaming, it made Tropic Thunder look like Apocalypse now. Yes it is based on true events but really, is this the way to portray true heroism ? When the Thin Red Line exists, from the same theatre of war, which depicts the reality in a much more gut wrenching way. Who thought Vince Vaughan could play a tough drill sergeant, who thought up the dragging through the mud, rear gunner style machine scene could be taken seriously, who thought the scene of a soldier volleying a grenade away was anything other than laughable, probably the same director who stole all the component parts of other war films and stitched them together into a parody that is totally unaware of itself. I would go so far as to say it is an insult to the genre. It gets a 3 based on some technical flair and the heroics of the true story."

How in the hell are you going to cast Vince Vaughn as a drill sergeant? He can barely perform in comedies where he has creative lead. Maybe it is worse than that, it could be all that good actors turn down said roll.<br/><br/>2.

The battle was way to grotesque, too much gore and violence and cartoon levels of ""scary"", vid examples on my Instagram. So much I became bored of it and lost any tension of failure or loss of an actor, and I say actor because there were no characters out there.<br/><br/>Overall a totally over rated movie and will only entertain you if you are from/ in the military or some sect of the Christian religion; if that's you, great, be you and I love the movie.<br/><br/>Beyond those 2 demographics, don't see this movie."

","Couple of things before I start. One: I wish I hadn't known who directed this movie. Yes, I think it informed my opinion on this film. That is, I expected it to be way better! And B: The first half of this movie was so...um...well... horrible. The bar for war movies has been considerably raised. (ie. Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, The Pacific) and by that standard, Hacksaw is shabby and inferior. There are two movies here. The first part so horribly acted, corny and badly written that it's hard to believe they nominated Garfield for anything but a 'Raspberry'. The second half is all combat and here Gibson is in his element and the acting improves considerably. You wont believe it's the same movie. Is it worth watching? I guess if you like combat scenes. (I do.) Vince Vaughn is miscast as the tough 'Sarge' with the heart of gold. We've seen this character so many times and Vaughn brings nothing new to it. The Aussie actors struggle with the accents. (Apparently everybody in the war was a tough guy from the lower east side of New York.) Garfield plays his character with a syrupy excessiveness. He'll have you thinking 'Forest Gump' instead of 'Audie Murphy'. This might have been better if they had left out some of the story lines with his family, father and focused on the battle front."

","Oscar winning director, Mel Gibson returns to the helm after a long ten years of not being behind a camera, Apocalypto being his last film back in 2006. Maybe due to too much shaky cam? No! Sorry. That was a cheap shot and I'm actually a massive fan of Gibson, he's still very much one of my favourites and I know he can take a joke. <br/><br/>Gibson is one of the few directors who can boast a long runtime and it not be a warning off- putter, though not as long as Braveheart, it's up there with this longest films with a runtime of 139mins, but you certainly don't notice it. <br/><br/>The film is based on the legendary WWII army medic, Pfc. Desmond Doss who enlisted but with an absolutely objection to firing a single bullet, not just during the war zone but during training also, who went on to serve regardless and saved of life's of approximately 75 soldiers under fire.<br/><br/>The film is in two parts. Firstly the background on Doss, his family, his love and the eventual training where he becomes branded a conscientious objector, bringing him a world of hurt and abuse from his fellow regiment and the military powers. It has to be mentioned, during this part Hugo Weaving gives an incredible performance as his drunken father clearly combating PTSD. <br/><br/>The second part of the film is the obvious, bloody assault on Hacksaw Ridge. The carnage of unforgiving violence that's gruesome yet captivating to watch. The brutal war scenes are loaded with exaggerated action for cinematographic purposes but is superbly executed with building tension and often gory outcomes. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield takes the lead role of Pfc. Doss and does an amazing job. I can only believe he done the hero justice because the son was brought to tears during a screening. The supporting cast, including names Sam Worthington, Teresa Palmer and Luke Bracey all give good strong performances. And apologies to Vince Vaughn because he's an actor I find difficult to take seriously. But he fills the Sargent's boots quite well, nearly bursting a blood vessel bellowing humorous insults at his subordinates. Unfortunately, scenes like that will always be compared to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, but Vaughn does an amazing job. <br/><br/>Gibson' direction, like most of his films, is quite symbolic with some stunning visual imagery. He doesn't shy away from the opposing side either. The war sequences are some of the best captured, striking a realism that Saving Private Ryan got respected for. <br/><br/>Rupert Gregson-Williams score replaces John Debney's rejected score, after he replaced the late James Horner. Gregson-Williams actually does a good score in honour of Horner, mimicking his style to a degree, just listening to ""Okinawa Battlefield"" has echoes of Horner. <br/><br/>Though the number of people saved are not wholly accurate, to say 75 people is actually an understatement, himself saying 50 on that particular bloody night, witnesses claim it to be 100, which could be a result of him treating 50 men up on the escarpment who made their own way back to camp. It's said that during his three week tour he rescued a number close to 300 souls. <br/><br/>Certainly succeeds in placing Desmond Doss in eternity, being an incredible, moving tribute to the hero about courage and belief to stand alone not just against adversity but against the common command of war. A remarkable story about an even more remarkable man. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 Script: 10 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an amazing tribute not just to Desmond Doss, but to all conscientious collaborators. <br/><br/>95% 10/10"

","This film deserves bounteous amounts of recognition and is worthy of a 10/10. Without spoiling anything, this film not only excels in setting the scene, character development and pacing. It is a truly wonderful representation of a true story, it is heartfelt, brutal and real. I couldn't look away from the screen and had goose bumps for the majority of its length. The acting was superb; Andrew Garfield, Theresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn and all of the soldiers embodied their roles phenomenally and made every scene a pleasure to watch and experience. The war scenes were indefinitely on par with Platoon and Saving Private Ryan and managed to maintain a balance between drama and action. The music accompanying every scene was subtle yet perfect, and I can't express how well it all came together. The religious aspect of the film also is not overpowering or unrealistic, it is genuine and easy to watch even if viewers have different values/religions. This film was in one word, beautiful. I felt the need to write a review about it as soon as I left the cinema and I implore every lover of a great movie to pay to see it in the cinema and not stream it online or wait for the DVD. It was a cinematic experience I will never forget and I'd say it is one of the best films I have seen in years. Go see it."
"alindsay-al","10","2","8","2 February 2017"," An Epic war film that hits you emotionally
","I have heard great things about Hacksaw Ridge and this has been a film i have been anticipating for a while and it ends up that it is absolutely brilliant. The premise of the film is set in WW2 and sees a man join the army as a medic but he vows that he can never use or even hold a gun which creates problems for him. It seems to be a great start to 2017 for Andrew Garfield as after Silence he is even better in this film with his best ever performance in this film. He is such a good person in this film and you really care about his character as you really want to see him succeed. I was rooting for him from the first minute of the film to the last minute and i believe he may even win the Oscar for this performance. Hugo Weaving plays his father in this film and he is is immense in this film, we are used to seeing him in confident roles in blockbusters it is so interesting seeing this drunk abusive father that doesn't understand his son's wishes to go to war because of his past experiences. Teresa Palmer plays the romantic interest for Garfield in this film and she gives her best ever performance in this film and they have great chemistry in this film. you buy there romance and you really care about there relationship as the film progresses and you see it drive Garfield throughout the film. Vince Vaughan, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey are all in this film with Vaughan as the drill sergeant and he brings his comedic chops to the roll but also a great dramatic performance that i haven't seen from him before. Also Bracey and Worthington aren't known for giving great performances but this film is different as they both are brilliant in this film and you end up really caring about them in this film. The story of this film has really two halves, the first half seeing him building his romantic relationship and deal with the other soldiers and his beliefs. The second half sees the war events in the film that really hits you hard. It is fascinating to watch this guy stay true to his beliefs and as the film progresses you really believe in him and i think the fact that this is a true story makes it an even more emotional story. also for those worrying about this film heavily pushing religion, it really doesn't and it is just another small thing in the film that is used very well. The script has great dialogue in it whether dramatic or humorous really helps add to these characters and your love for them. The style of the film is great, especially when the film starts showing all the war scenes in the film. The Brutality of the film is well shown and it doesn't glorify the war element but shows it as a horrific event that you really shouldn't enjoy. also the sound effects are great and i really felt every shot that was fired in this film. overall this is one of the best war films ever made and I recommend that everybody sees it to appreciate it."

"aciessi","7","2","8","21 January 2017"," Desmond Doss: American Hero
","Hacksaw Ridge is Mel Gibson's comeback film. After half of a decade of banishment from Hollywood following a string of leaked audio tapes revealing Gibson to use violent, racist and anti- semitic language, it appears that he has been absolved of his sins by the Hollywood elite, and has been given one more shot at success. He comes back to silver screen as a director, with a film many have placed into the category of conservative-freindy films. Films like American Sniper, 13 Hours and Patriots Day, that play extremely well with audiences across America and provide soaring box-office returns, but are scoffed at by films critics as being cliché, jingoist, patriarchal.. you name the buzz word. But perhaps Hacksaw Ridge finally bridges the gap between the film snobs, and the filmgoers. No, Hacksaw Ridge is not a movie only a Trump supporter would love. It tells a heartbreaking, inspiring story of courage, faith and unwavering love for humanity.<br/><br/>Desmond Doss is a man many Americans strive to be, and quite frankly, fail. He's a man of deep faith, who enlists in the army to fight the Japanese in WWII. He would be the ideal marine, except for one thing.. he refused to pick up a gun. Desmond is the ultimate pacifist. His religion teaches him never to kill, even on the battlefield. To the chagrin of his division, he is demoted as a combat medic.<br/><br/>The story unravels slowly, as we see Desmond in times before the war romancing a young southern belle played by the stunning Teresa Palmer. As well as his problems at home with his alcoholic, WWI vet father, provided by a tremendous performance by Hugo Weaving. Comedian Vince Vaughn appears as the drill sergeant, who brings his quick wit to this drama, and does a fabulous job. The sweet moments of the film's beginning seem sort of cheesy. But then, Desmond leaves for the war and with an anaconda grip, you are sucked into his hell on earth.<br/><br/>We are taken to Okinawa, and the carnage begins. Hacksaw Ridge is by far the most violent film of the year. It's a war film that is unafraid of showing all of the blood and guts. You'll be taken completely aback as it begins. Heads get split open, torsos get cut in half, legs are blown apart. The nastiest aspects on this horrible war are on full display, but perhaps more disturbing of all, is the shell shocked Desmond, who fights with all of his might to do his job, and save his fellow men. One by one, he fills them with morphine and takes them back to the base. ""Lord, give me one more"" he chants to himself. Desmond Doss is an unmistakable American hero. This is a moving picture. I hope that people can still be moved by a picture like this, but in this divisive climate, it is hard to say if that is even possible. As of this moment, we have never been farther apart, and we have never been more cynical as a country. But what we know far too well, is that we must honor the brave men that came before us that died protecting us. We enjoy our lives on the graves of men like Desmond Doss, who risked his life and his dignity saving us from the evils of fascism. His story is one that we desperately needed to hear from."

","Corny as hell but also vital, intense and at times truly transporting. The chaos of war is wholly apparent here. It's not just quick edits, it's cohesive editing done quickly and with precision to create impact. It's astonishing how powerful some of these scenes are.<br/><br/>But all the drama doesn't really work. Or it works like you expect but even cheesier and more obvious than you thought possible. Garfield is good, but his good old boy voice sums up this movie perfectly. What the hell is that mixed up with all this other good? Why is the dichotomy so alarming? If it's intentional it doesn't work.<br/><br/>This is a classic Gibson Martyr. Is that him? Is the dichotomy of war and peace the point of his existence?"
"Gordon-11","Null","2","8","1 December 2016"," It made me tremble and weep for an hour.
","This film tells the story of a man who is against killing people, even in the act of war. Yet his sense of patriotism and responsibility causes him to enlist. He insists on not touching any weapons, despite direct orders from seniors and even when he is face to face with enemies on the bloody battlefield.<br/><br/>I have heard good things about ""Hacksaw Ridge"", but nothing prepared me for such a powerful and touching experience. Initially, I find Andrew Garfield's innocent and even goofy smiles annoying. I kept wondering why cast someone in a heroic role when he does not look like the typical hero. His constant smiles made me wonder if he took anything seriously. Yet, over the course of the film, I have learned that he is just the most courageous and loving person anyone could hope to find on the battlefield. His selfless acts even in the most adverse conditions are beyond words. His heroic acts radiates throughout the second half of the film. Just like his fellow soldiers, I judged him too early.<br/><br/>I checked the time twice in the cinema, not because of impatience, but because I wondered how much screen time there was left. The film was so powerful that tears kept falling for an hour. My body trembled uncontrollably, and I just didn't think I could take the heavy scenes anymore.<br/><br/>I remember the first fifteen minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". The scene is now famous for being super gory and highly touching, that made it an effective anti-war message. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the battle scene lasted for an hour, and every minute of it is as intense as the most famous war films. There have been so many minutes in the battle scenes that I just could not open my eyes. Just listening to the men screaming, shells exploding and guns firing was already enough to make my body and mind completely entrapped in the soldier's hell. Tears kept falling, and every part of me hoped for a relatively good outcome for the soldiers.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" is such an intense film. Every bit of it is superb. Even little things like the placement of bullet shells in the battlefield, and the final scene of Doss being lifted down tell stories that are not told in words. The very final scenes of the interviews with the survivors are very touching as well. To hear Doss recount his own experiences on the battlefield is certainly very effective and fascinating.<br/><br/>This film is profoundly effective and emotional. Tears keep falling from my eyes. Even on the way home, as soon as I thought about the scene where all soldiers look to one side before going back up to the Ridge was enough to set my tears off again. Doss was such a valiant hero, he meant so much to the soldiers. Not only did Doss saved their lives, he saved the soldiers' morale as well.<br/><br/>It is rare that I feel so much emotions during and after a film. It made me tremble and weep for an hour. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is truly superb."
"GeorgiaBoy9009","7","2","8","18 November 2016"," Good Summary of a True Story
","Overall a well made movie with great performances, a well rounded script with a hint of comedy, and decent action sense. This one is very difficult to review, I very much want to criticize the historical inaccuracy of the film, however I understand at some areas it would be difficult considering all Desmond Doss did at Hacksaw Ridge alone is more than what could fit in one movie. So bare with me... <br/><br/>I will do my best to not over-criticize the details but there are a few I like to point out. Starting with Doss did not volunteer in the Army but was drafted, this point does change the look surrounding his time at boot camp. Secondly they made it appear Doss and the rest of his company went straight from boot to Okinawa when in truth Doss, with the 307th, fought in Guam and Leyte prior to Hacksaw Ridge. Now as for Hacksaw Ridge, it was not as much inaccurate as it was incomplete; Doss was there for 20+ days before succumbing to his injuries. There were many other selfless acts and acts of bravery that could have been used in addition, making his honorary distinction even more deserved. Again I understand the difficulty those involved with the creation of this movie must have been facing trying to balance high quality entertainment while trying to stay historically accurate. With that being said I will not let it effect my rating too much.<br/><br/>As a film, this had a great roster of actors; Andrew Garfield did an outstanding job as Desmond Doss, Vince Vaughn did a great job adding his comical personality to mix, Sam Worthington and Hugo Weaving are worth mentioning for their well performances as well. Mel Gibson did a great job directing this film, only criticism I will mention would be that the battle scenes were too ""jumpy"" (they cut to different POV or to other explosions to often) making it difficult to catch all that was happening. <br/><br/>With that said, I have decided to give a 7/10 which is lower than most others I've seen but for me it's difficult to rate it any higher, if I were to be more critical on historical accuracy it would be even lower."
"BlueFairyBlog","7","2","8","18 November 2016"," Lots of Heart, but Not Enough Common Sense
","Good versus evil is an old concept that makes for the best movies, and Nazis are the ultimate historical evil. From the forties onward Hollywood has created some seriously amazing narratives about American military forces braving the front lines to combat the Axis of Evil, but pacifism rarely enters the narrative. Some people really do believe that any violence, any killing, is absolutely unneeded. People like to forget that FDR waited until Europe had been fighting amongst themselves for three years before intervening, and only after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. (Even after that Canada actually declared war before we did, by one day.)<br/><br/>In the same vein as past war films by Gibson's, this is the real life story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who served as a combat medic at Okinawa with the 77th in May 1945. He fought against his superiors and a court martial in order to serve without a weapon and went on to save between 50-100 lives during a particularly terrible siege of Hacksaw Ridge. The actual story end of Doss' story is much more spectacular, as Doss was eventually shot multiple times and yet gave up his stretcher to a more injured Marine. Then he was left in the field for three hours before a stretcher came for him, and went on to be the first conscientious objector to gain a Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The film stars Andrew Garfield in the titular role, giving an uneven performance in an uneven film. The whole first of the film feels lazy, as it sways between clichéd moments, over-the-top nostalgic nationalism, and simple corny dialogue that falls flat compared to the obviously superior second half of the film. This section tries to set up why Doss is a conscientious objector, but it does so by giving little information about his life in lieu of a spittle faced performance from Hugo Weaving and a false start between him and his brother. Doss isn't even explained to be a 7th day Adventist until he's at basic training, and the reason he won't raise a rifle isn't explained until ¾ of the way in the film. This information is also prompted by one of several dream sequences, which comes across as purely lazy screen writing. This opinion does not stem from the fact that the film is religious in subtext. When the film dives into its fervor, especially during the battle scenes, it truly resonates on screen. The actual battle scenes are handled with so much care and dedication it's clear that Gibson put most of the effort, and the film's budget, into it. The blood and gore of these scenes truly hits home how gritty and horrifying war can be, but there's still a grand glory to the entire battle that prompts a feeling a patriotism. Everything about these scenes is astounding: the action, costuming, effects, and performances are all top notch in their scope, and they capture the real honesty of what it is to kill or be killed.<br/><br/>It's obvious why this film received a ten minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival: It's the true story of a man who was above and beyond a hero, even if he thwarted many attempts to turn his story into a film during his lifetime. Gibson returned to his roots in an unprecedented sweep of glory, and while I sincerely disbelieve his efforts will yield an Academy award nomination, he has put his foot in the right direction for a grand return to cinema."
"plpregent","6","3","15","9 November 2016"," A good – not great – picture on perhaps one of the greatest WW II stories ever put on film
","Mel Gibson goes back to directing one decade after he delivered Apocalypto, a stunning adventure film blending history, romance and tremendous amounts of savagery. Interestingly, these three narrative pillars have been at the very core of Braveheart (1995), The Passion of the Christ (2004), Apocalypto (2006) and, ten years later, are now deeply rooted into Hacksaw Ridge, a war film depicting the bravery of Army Medic Desmond Doss, who enrolled to serve during World War II. <br/><br/>Besides telling the story of an undoubtedly true American hero, Hacksaw Ridge dedicates a substantial amount of screen time to the backstory and development of its characters, sometimes successfully, sometimes not as much. The film is pretty much divided into two distinct halves, the latter of which is the Battle of Okinawa. <br/><br/>The aesthetic qualities of Hacksaw Ridge cannot be denied. Visually, it looks neat. Forget the over saturated cinematography of late Middle- East set war films, or the under saturated greyish tones of Saving Private Ryan (which all look great, but Hacksaw Ridge looks different). Instead, Hacksaw Ridge feels naturally lit, and the horrors depicted and the smothering atmosphere are nourished by torn limbs, blood, guts, burning men and screams. The battle sequences are intense and overall well directed. Mel Gibson's direction is competent, especially in the first half. While the battle sequences do feature never-before-seen grisliness and some surprisingly innovative shots at times, Gibson's sense of geography is a bit chaotic, and probably purposely so. After all, we are not following the squad capture an objective, but rather a medic going in all directions to rescue his wounded fellow soldiers. Bravery is well depicted, and Doss saying ""Lord, help me get one more"" will echo through your mind when the credits start rolling. <br/><br/>Back to the first half of the film, where the romance, family backstory and training camp occur, I thought it was good. There is a lighter tone to all of these parts than what can be found in comparable films. I don't think that's neither a good nor a bad thing: what it is, though, is a bit of an unusual vehicle for emotion in such a film. Forget the big violins. There is a somewhat « feel good » aspect to it all, almost comedic, even when it comes to the training camp segment. At first I thought it was Vince Vaughn playing the Sargent, but it's actually the dialogue which carries more humour than most would probably expect, blended with the expeditious nature of the narrative structure, where very little time is actually dedicated to characters' emotions and is instead driven by a relatively quick succession of meaningful actions. The approach itself appears to become a trend among recent war films (American Sniper definitely comes to mind). It kept me thinking about Steven Spielberg, who once said that he likes to show his characters think in his films. I found that remark to be interesting, and when I watched Saving Private Ryan after that, it made me realize how many of these moments the film features (and other Spielberg films as well), and how, emotionally, sharing an intimate moment with the protagonist before jumping to the next scene allows for great viewer involvement, especially after an intense battle sequence where plenty of supporting characters die. To me, this expeditious way of depicting events prevented Hacksaw Ridge from rising to greatness along the likes of war films such as Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan. The abusive and troubled father backstory, among other things, suffered greatly from the approach. I also felt like the heroic actions depicted in Hacksaw Ridge did not carry as much weight meaning-wise because of that, although the story that is told is probably greater than any other World War II story ever put on film. There are some emotional moments in the film, but very little time for the viewer (and the characters!) to let them properly sink in before moving on to the next scene. <br/><br/>The cast was excellent. Andrew Garfield portrays a gentle, almost naïve young man whose principles and faith are absolutely unbreakable. The supporting cast is also fantastic. There is a bit of an unusual light-hearted aspect to many of the characters, but this could have came as a breath of fresh air, had that not been awkwardly exploited due to the narrative structure. <br/><br/>The ending features what I found to be a very pleasing and emotion- filled surprise. Definitely one of the film's highlights for me.<br/><br/>Overall a worthy war picture, telling an amazing story that feels like it could have been delivered a differently to really rise to its full potential."

","The story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who, at the Battle of Okinawa, won the Medal of Honour for his bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. <br/><br/>The film shows his upbringing and how this shaped his views, especially his religious view and anti-killing stance. <br/><br/>We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the Army and trying to become a medic. <br/><br/>Then we get to the titular ridge.......<br/><br/>Whatever your opinions are on Mel Gibson, no one can deny that the man is a master film maker, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Scorcese, Spielberg, and De Palma.<br/><br/>His films are challenging, important, edging a little too much on religion, but one thing is that Gibson pulls no punches when it comes to visceral cinema, and if you thought the opening of Private Ryan was tough, this outdoes that scene tenfold, because Gibson makes you care about the characters, thanks to an extended training act, which isn't just tough, it's quite endearing as you know that the rest of his barracks are vexed at his choices, but still give him respect for standing by his rules.<br/><br/>Gibson does turn on the Schmaltz in the feisty act, and at times, Garfield becomes almost a Forrest Gump-alike. When he first meets his wife to be. It's as if Gibson wants to put you in some sort off comfort zone, before he throws you into the middle of a terrifying situation.<br/><br/>And what a spectacle the actual war zone is. It's haunting, dangerous, threatening and unpredictable, and you can almost feel the troops fear when they know that this could be their last day on this planet. <br/><br/>Even though your aware of the story/miracle of Dobbs, you cannot help but fear for him when he goes for another injured soldier. There is one particular scene where he has to covertly hide an injured troop, and it's unexplainably tense.<br/><br/>If you've ever doubted Vince Vaughn or Sam Worthington in film, see this, because Gibson makes them give the performances of their lives. This makes films like Clash/Wrath of the titans, and anything Vaughn has done in the last nine years, seem like such a long time ago.<br/><br/>Gibson has made a wonderful epic, with each act so totally different from one another, yet working so very well.<br/><br/>A really well made film, which will be surprising if it doesn't make my top ten of the year."

","Don't kid yourself, Hacksaw Ridge is nothing more than a paint-by- numbers Hollywood war drama — complete with wholly unnecessary romantic subplot and flashbacks to childhood traumas. There is nothing courageous about making a film like this, it's as safe a bet on box office success that a studio exec could ever make.<br/><br/>But it's well made damnit and having a competent director at the helm working with a script that never strays too far from what is at its core a simple story about a man's convictions and the ordeals he goes through really is a treat to behold.<br/><br/>My only major complaint is that none of the actors at any point reloads their firearm. Vince Vaughn is also out of place as a drill sergeant and his lines early on often feel as if they'd be more at home in one of the myriad comedies for which he is better known. I suspect his role in this film has more to do with the personal politics of the major players involved than it does his established body of work."

","That should show how much I love this movie.I love Mel Gibson's work, and for this to tie with ""The Passion of the Christ"" for me is something.<br/><br/>The movie tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a religious 18 year old man who will not kill anyone in World War 2. The Ten Commandments forbid murder, so he refuses to do so. He won't even carry a gun. (He makes one exception, but it's essential to save someone.)<br/><br/>Instead, he saves the lives of wounded soldiers, letting tons of people live who would have died otherwise.<br/><br/>How interesting and inspiring that is. A man loves God and his country so much that he will fight a war, by saving his enemies, and his people. I guess that's why I think ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is as great as ""The Passion of the Christ.""<br/><br/>This is one the best modern movies I have ever seen. Even if you are not religious, you can appreciate the fact that Doss stood up for his beliefs and went to war to help people, not hurt them.<br/><br/>Note to people: Despite being somewhat of a Christian movie, there is a little profanity but it's PG level. There is war violence, but it's war, it's not glorified.<br/><br/>There is implied nudity but nothing dirty is shown, just the tops of the married people smiling at each other, preparing for sex. The scene is a handful of seconds long. It's Rated R, but before you think it's inappropriate, I'll name 20 worse ones and have way more!<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie.

","Director Mel Gibson has produced a nifty story of a small-town religious boy, Andrew Garfield, who enlists in the army, is ridiculed and beaten by his cohort because he refuses to carry a rifle, but nevertheless achieves heroic stature on Okinawa by becoming a medic, staying behind and saving several dozen wounded soldiers, alone, unarmed, and in grave danger every moment.<br/><br/>Garfield delivers in the principal role. He LOOKS like a small-town religious boy with his overgrown thatch of hair, small stature, and vacuous grin. His support varies. One or two of the dilatory suits are pretty ugly folks.<br/><br/>Gibson is unable to avoid several clichés. The slow motion deaths are particularly distracting. I blame Kurosawa for first using it in ""Seven Samurai,"" Arthur Penn for using it with relish in ""Bonny and Clyde"", and Sam Pekinpah for going stratospheric with it in ""The Wild Bunch."" Several incidents are lifted from ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's very gory too but maybe that befits a story about an intrepid medic. I notice the shattered bodies have been criticized by some other reviewers but, according to memoirs by combat veterans like Paul Fusell and William Manchester, that's what a battlefield looks like. Not just dead bodies but parts of dead bodies as well.<br/><br/>There's an ominous element in all that blood though. Perhaps the most tense and frightening scene of combat in World War II appeared in ""Pride of the Marines."" Three men manning a machine gun at the Battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal, one shot dead and the other two wounded severely, and not a drop of blood is shown. Very little blood in ""Platoon"" either. Not until ""Saving Private Ryan"" are we treated to death up close and butchery galore. This one tops ""Saving Private Ryan."" I hope we're not on one of those treadmills where directors try to out-do one another in bloodiness.<br/><br/>But anyway this is a believable and compelling true story of a guy who went overboard in doing just the opposite of what warriors are supposed to do. Good on him, as the Aussies would say."
"Diss","10","1","3","22 July 2017"," Best war film ever made
","I have to say this is the best war film ever made, and in my top 10 list of all films. A big part of this is the movie has somewhat of a unique approach to the standard war film fare. In that the main character is a pacifist, who still wants to serve in his own way. And the main character's religious conviction is something you don't see in nearly every war movie, and even then it's usually an afterthought or just there to provide dialogue. I felt a huge emotional investment towards the main character. Going in, I didn't know it was based off a true story, so I didn't know the ending. I'd say this helps, but isn't necessary to enjoy the movie. You can't help but have tremendous respect for the main character. The emotional angle is why I feel it's the best war movie. I actually cared about these characters. More so than films like Saving Private Ryan (though I do tear up at the end) or Platoon.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well choreographed, and I could actually understand what was happening at various points of the battle, even despite the smoke. Many war movies, especially modern ones, make the action so muddled you can't understand what's going on. They want to show war as chaotic, and they succeed in this, but sometimes you can't tell who's winning or losing (or who's advancing or who's retreating). Another excellent war movie We Were Soldiers is a bit like this. Still an excellent film though. It's just the war scenes in that movie can't compare to this movie. Only drawback is a little lack of realism in that nobody ever reloads. Small quibble, but should be mentioned. Especially that grease gun, it looked impressive, but no way he had that much ammo on him.<br/><br/>The movie hit on all cylinders. The boot camp scenes aren't as good as Full Metal Jacket, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. And I appreciated the humor in the boot camp scenes. Even the love story was tender, and you really felt a bond to the lead female character as well, especially in the prison scene. Everything worked.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tomsview","7","1","3","4 April 2017"," Wears its heart on its sleeve
","Mel Gibson wound the clock back in making ""Hacksaw Ridge""; it reminded me of ""Sergeant York"" with Gary Cooper. Back then, films could wear their hearts on their sleeves and ""York"" was loaded with emotion and sentimentality.<br/><br/>The treatment in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is in a similar vein to that 70-year old film. Although it might be considered too syrupy in our more cynical age, I think Gibson may have caught the spirit of Desmond Doss. To perform the deeds that he did, Doss must have been working on raw emotion – appealing to God to help him save one more.<br/><br/>Although many of the technical aspects of the film can be questioned, the emotional and sentimental heart of the movie seems about right.<br/><br/>The film was made in Australia with a combination of American and Aussie actors. I think it's fair enough that Australia pays a little homage to Americans who fought in the Pacific in WW2. Australia owes a big part of its survival in 1942-43 to the U.S. Much of the brilliant mini-series, ""The Pacific"", was also made here.<br/><br/>Gibson admitted that he changed some things to drive the drama and also because they seemed unbelievable. However proving truth is often stranger than fiction, the surreal looking scenes of Doss and his comrades climbing the net hanging from the cliff really happened – although the filmmakers apparently added about a third to its height.<br/><br/>As for the film being anti-Japanese? The hatred between the Allies (Americans, Australians and British) and the Japanese during WW2 was rivalled only by that between the Germans and the Russians. Pearl Harbour was still fresh in American minds and the death marches and massacres of prisoners by Japanese soldiers were known by then. The film is honest about the feelings at the time.<br/><br/>The film smacks of a labour of love. Desmond Doss was a real man and he did even more than was depicted in the film. Although the film takes plenty of artistic licence, the essential truth comes through. I think you just have to take ""Hacksaw Ridge"" as it comes – with all its emotion and sentimentality."
"rafael_jaramillo_avellan","7","1","3","30 January 2017"," Great Performances, check; Mel Gibson directing, check; One of the year's best movies, not.
","Desmond Doss' story is absolutely worth to turn into motion picture, but I left the cinema not that amazed.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about the performances. Andrew Garfield (AG) is committed to his role in every aspect. A hillbilly conscientious objector who wants to find a purpose in the middle of a world conflict. The gestures, the way he leans a little his head when too excited, the uncontrollable laugh, well, everything. All of his nominations are more than well deserved, congratulations. There's also the supporting roles which were taken to high precision by the cast, making this an all believable portrayal of WWII.<br/><br/>Now, direction. Mel Gibson (MG), I love MG, I truly do. If he was able to make AG be worthy of an Oscar nomination, it means he has the ability as a director to exploit acting skills in his performers; that's bonus points for the almighty MG. He succeeds in making this an all emotional and brutal (for not saying gory and explicit) two hours and twenty minute journey you can enjoy for the sake of good will, staying true to what you believe and transcending as a human being. In terms of filming techniques and cinematography I won't comment, I'm still learning about that so, I will jump to what's next.<br/><br/>So, do I find this movie one of the year's best? Absolutely not. The movie does not make a proper treatment about this extraordinary real life event. Some critics say that the movie is at the same height of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), which I find difficult to believe. Let's go stage by stage; first of all, the love story feels at some times taken out from some clichéd love stories. There's a feeling of excessive heroism depicted in many scenes; the scenes of slow motion entry and blind firing helps to this. The music as well: it plays at the moments where Desmond is carrying someone with explosions behind. This gave me the feeling that the movie was at some level produced by Michael Bay, which is something that can never be good. Reason why I can't catalog this as a MG masterpiece.<br/><br/>Something extra: in some scenes, the film editing fails and seems like a bad green/blue screen effect; the ships also look short of CGI budget. <br/><br/>My final consensus: Hacksaw Ridge takes the best of leading man Andrew Garfield and master director Mel Gibson for delivering a brutal and emotional flick. Sadly, it doesn't proves to be an instant masterpiece due to some excessive heroism and clichéd action sequences."
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","10","12 November 2016"," A Remarkable Story
","Putting aside his personal life, Mel Gibson is a great director & has a knack for big scope pictures based on true stories. Now is Hacksaw Ridge the next great thing from the infamous director? Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>As I say about a lot of genres these days, we don't get a lot of great war films. We just don't. Free State of Jones, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and even 13 Hours haven't been great. But I was hoping Hacksaw Ridge would reinvigorate the genre, and perhaps reinvent it. To a certain extent, it does. A story about a Seventh-day Adventist who wants to join the army as a conscientious objector makes for a different way of telling a World War II story.<br/><br/>I think the problem here is that the first and second halves of this story feel like two completely different films altogether. The first mainly deals with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) budding romance with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) back at his hometown of Lynchburg, Virgina. I really bought into the cuteness and sincerity of that relationship, but it gets lost entirely in the second half. I think I would have preferred more of a balance between a straight romance story and a straight war film. And not a split down the halfway mark of the film, I mean each aspect sprinkling into each other.<br/><br/>I can't deny how impressive Gibson's ability to direct intense battle sequences is, however. Braveheart has one of the most beautifully shot finales of all time, and there's plenty of that to go around in the battle sequences here. The fact that Doss' beliefs prevented him from being able to pick up any sort of weapon and he managed to save over 70 men during the Battle of Okinawa. The story is remarkable and watching Doss relentlessly saving one person after another when everyone else had left, is definitely inspiring. But I think the rush of it all overwhelmed my enjoyment of the battle, considering the first half is a different film entirely.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, and Rachel Griffiths round out the cast nicely and add other levels of emotion to an already fascinating story. But if I had to change something, it would be the pacing and direction from Gibson. If Gibson could have found a way to sprinkle in romantic scenes to the unsettling battle or the other way around, the film would have been more fluid and even. Other than that, this is definitely a film worth seeing in theaters just for the remarkable performance of Garfield alone.<br/><br/>+Cute romance<br/><br/>+Comradery at the Army base<br/><br/>+Performances all around<br/><br/>-Uneven direction, pacing<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I saw ""Hacksaw Ridge"", starring Andrew Garfield-the Amazing Spider-Man movies, Lions For Lambs; Teresa Palmer-Lights Out, The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Sam Worthington-Everest, Avatar and Vince Vaughn-The Internship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith.<br/><br/>This is a WW2 movie directed by Mel Gibson and is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a 7th Day Adventist that was the first conscientious objector in American history to receive the Medal of Honor. It was filmed in Australia-I guess Mel likes filming in his home country-and centers on the 1945 Battle of Okinawa. Andrew plays Desmond, who enlisted in the Army because he just wanted to serve his country, but not have to kill anyone. He wanted to be a medic and wanted to save lives but he would not carry a gun. Teresa is his girlfriend back in Virginia-they eventually married-and Andrew even went through a court martial because he refused to carry a weapon. Sam plays his Captain and Vince is his Sergeant, who along with just about everybody else, thought Andrew was just a plain old coward for not carrying a gun. The battle scenes are pretty graphic and grisly. Remember the opening of Saving Private Ryan? The last half of the movie is like that one scene, only amp-ed up. The scenes of Andrew rescuing the wounded soldiers are very heroic and it's estimated that he rescued somewhere around 75 men. As the end credits start, you get to hear from the actual people that survived, including Desmond Doss, and what happened to them afterwards. It is a bloody but moving story. It's rated ""R"" for graphic war violence and grisly, bloody images and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I would buy this one on DVD."

","From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto), this film served as his big chance to return to form, he has had it hard the last few years since his drunken outbursts and conflicts. Based on the true story, young Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce) was traumatised and his religious beliefs reinforced after he almost killed his brother Harold ""Hal"" (Roman Guerriero) during an argument, hitting him on the head with a brick. Years later, Desmond Doss (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Andrew Garfield) saves a man injured by a car, taking the man to hospital he is instantly smitten with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), they soon start dating and fall in love. The majority of his town, including his brother Harold ""Hal"" (Nathaniel Buzolic), are enlisting in the army to fight in World War II, having learned about medicine from Dorothy's work, Doss is motivated to sign up. Doss's father Tom (Hugo Weaving), a troubled veteran of the First World War, is upset at the thought of losing his sons, having lost his childhood friends, with his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Desmond intends to serve as a combat medic, before he leaves Dorothy accepts Desmond's proposal of marriage. At Fort Jackson, under the command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), Doss excels physically, but is immediately an outcast from his fellow soldiers, refusing to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays, due to his beliefs. Howell and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) cannot get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Doss is put through gruelling labour by Howell, his fellow soldiers turn against him, mistaking his beliefs for cowardice, they try to get Doss to leave of his own accord, and despite a beating one night, Doss wants to continue training. The squad complete basic training and are released on leave, Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but he is arrested for insubordination, Dorothy visits him in jail and tries to convince him to plead guilty to be released without charges, but Doss does not want to compromise his beliefs. In the trial, Doss pleads not guilty, before he is sentenced his father barges into the courtroom with a letter from a Brigardier General stating that his son's refusal to carry a firearm is protected by an Act of Congress, the charges are dropped and Doss marries Dorothy. Doss and his unit are assigned to the 77th Infantry Division, to participate in the Battle of Okinawa, they are reliving the 96th Infantry Division, tasked with climbing the cliff face of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed ""Hacksaw Ridge"", to battle the stationed Japanese forces, artillery bombardments from the U.S. Navy have had little success, U.S. forces have been pushed off the ridge repeatedly and suffered heavy casualties. In the initial fight both sides suffer heavy losses, Doss successfully saves several soldiers, including those with injuries that appear too severe to survive. The Americans shelter for the night, Doss spends the night in a foxhole with Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), the first of his squad to call him a coward, Doss reveals his aversion to holding a firearm is due to a night where he nearly shot his drunken father after he threatened his mother with a gun, Smitty and Doss make amends. Next morning, the Japanese drive the Americans off Hacksaw Ridge, launching a massive counterattack, Smitty is killed, while many Americans, including Howell and Doss' squad mates, are severely injured and have been behind on the battlefield, Doss hears the cries and decides to run back into the carnage to save them. Doss spends the entire day and night carrying and dragging wounded soldiers to the edge of the cliff and rappelling them down on rope, Doss prays each time to save one more, the rest of the unit below are shocked by the arrival of dozens of wounded soldiers presumed dead. Day breaks, Doss rescues Howell, they escape enemy fire and finally escape Hacksaw, Captain Glover tells Doss the man have been inspired by what they see as a miracle, and that they will not launch the next attack without him, despite it being Doss' Sabbath Day, he joins his fellow soldiers to care for the wounded, with extra reinforcements they begin to win the battle. Falsely surrendering Japanese soldiers create an ambush, Doss manages to save Glover and others, knocking grenades away with his bare hands, one of which wounds him, Doss is safely lowered down the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy gave him. Desmond Doss saved the lives of 75 men, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman, the first time in history for a conscientious objector, Doss stayed married to Dorothy until her death in 1991, he died aged 87 on 23 March 2006. Also starring Rachel Griffiths as Bertha Doss, Richard Roxburgh as Colonel Stelzer and Luke Pegler as Milt ""Hollywood"" Zane. Garfield gives a splendid performance as the man who risked all to save many, Vaughn and Worthington do well also, it is an extraordinary story of bravery and courage, there are the odd sentimental bits, but it really grips you with its high amount of violence on the battlefield, it really proves that against catastrophic odds, doing the right thing is not impossible, a brilliant, must see biographical Second World War drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","Hacksaw Ridge is a good movie. If you're only curios if I recommended this movie then yes I do. But I will not say that this movie is as good as many people are saying. <br/><br/>The movie is really cut into three sections (which nicely break this movie into the traditional three act structure quite well) which are the scenes before joining the military, the scenes of the main character at fort Jackson, and the titular battle of Hacksaw Ridge. To Be quite blunt the first two portions are really well done if a bit melodramatic in a lot of sections. The acting all around is really good, especially from Vince Vaugnh and Guy Pierce who kind of steal the scenes that they are in. However the story takes a strange turn once it gets to the battle the film was named for for chopping it up so much that a lot of the vital information is lost and has to be indirectly told to the audience such as: 1. How many people has he saved? 2. How long has he been up there? 3. How is he feeling during this time? <br/><br/>Truthfully, what should have been its greatest moment turned into a confusing and totally bland montage that does little to enlighten the audience on the mental toll being taken on the character, the test of his morals under fire, and if his relationship with his God/religion ever waver during the hell of war. The worst bit is when Garfield's Character sneaks into one of the Japanese tunnels to help wounded men and then leaves. no real extended tension on if is caught, no mental dilemma about literally walking into enemy hands, it just happens. <br/><br/>And that's the real on the movie, it fails to really add tension to what could have been an edge of the seat, heart-pounding, nail- biting, third act. Its more interested in showing what happened rather than to entertain which is not a bad thing but it is a facet that is better handled by documentaries than it is for a blackbuster with the goal to entertain."
"Turfseer","7","1","4","16 April 2017"," Overly pious Gibson still delivers war as gripping spectacle with calculated verisimilitude
","After ten long years, Mel Gibson is back in the director's seat. Certainly he needed some kind of self-reclamation project given the debacle a decade ago involving some drunk driving and words overheard by an arresting officer that were deemed anti-Semitic. Gibson might be a little like German director Leni Riefenstahl, who for years asked when the statute of limitations would run out on her collaboration as a documentary filmmaker with the Nazis.<br/><br/>Gibson somehow needed a project that would ameliorate the notion of his past narratives infused with hyper-violent tendencies. He perhaps found it in his choice of Desmond Doss, the Army medic awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery during World War II, despite also refusing to pick up a rifle during combat. Ben Croll writing in IndieWire grasps the paradox—he finds that Hacksaw Ridge is ""a movie venerating pacifism, made by a man pathologically beguiled by violence.""<br/><br/>Gibson however provides a rather chaste back story for his pacifist protagonist, chronicling a childhood replete with an abusive father and an incident which leads to his embrace of non-violence when he almost kills his brother during a fistfight (encouraged by the father). After saving a man hit by a truck, Doss (Andrew Garfield) meets nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) at the hospital in his home town of Lynchburg, Virginia (Gibson filmed most of this on location in Australia). There's a series of rather perfunctory courtship scenes finally leading to Doss' decision to join the Army.<br/><br/>The action picks up as Doss must endure basic training where he is harassed by his fellow soldiers who don't respect his Seventh Day Adventist pacifist beliefs. He also is singled out by the company drill sergeant who makes an example of him in front of the troops. When he is finally court-martialed for insubordination (failing to obey orders to pick up a rifle), there's a rather unconvincing scene where his father obtains a letter from a brigadier general with whom he fought in World War I, and presents it to the commanding officer at the court martial which leads to all charges being dropped.<br/><br/>Gibson's talents, however, are on display in the combat scenes at the battle for Okinawa. The soldiers are forced to climb up the Maeda Escarpment (also known as Hacksaw Ridge), where they come up against scores of Japanese troops, mostly hidden in caves. Gibson proves to be a master at choreographing the battle, which depicts massive losses of life on both sides.<br/><br/>Doss' heroic achievement is highlighted as he climbs back up to the main battlefield and drags wounded soldiers to the edge of the cliff and lowers them down using cleverly knotted ropes. All the while, the Japanese are a short distance away about to pounce. Doss eventually is wounded himself and just makes it back down to join his already decimated unit.<br/><br/>Despite being highly entertaining, the film exhibits what Christopher Gray writing in Slant Magazine, perceives as an overly pious stance here: ""The eponymous 350-foot high ridge itself is a resonant image of Desmond's ascension, and Gibson finds more opportunities to place him in baptismal and Christ-like poses. It's all deeply silly and occasionally risible, but it's also undeniably canny, a throwback entertainment that somehow successfully integrates a lofty sense of piety with an unyielding taste for bloodlust.""<br/><br/>Jessica Kiang writing in The Playlist is even more critical of Gibson whom she perceives as a tad bit self-righteous: ""But this tale of real-life heroism seems less a celebration of humanist convictions than a glorification of religious intransigence and a declaration of the moral superiority of the faithful over the faithless.""<br/><br/>Has Gibson redeemed himself for his own past personal sins? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. The piousness is still there as well as the aforementioned ""taste for bloodlust."" Nonetheless this is a director who is still quite talented and can draw the viewer in by depicting war as spectacle with a calculated verisimilitude."

","Hacksaw Ridge<br/><br/>By not arming your troops you cut your military budget, like, in half. <br/><br/>In fact, the unarmed soldier in this drama supports that economical theory.<br/><br/>Following Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is determined to join the war effort, but his Seventh-day Adventist beliefs preclude him from carrying a firearm or from fighting on Saturdays.<br/><br/>Scorned by his superiors (Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington) and platoon over his convictions, Desmond's medical training later mends those who ridiculed him during the Battle of Okinawa, where he singlehandedly transports the injured back to base. <br/><br/>Based on real events, but more importantly a real pacifist, this unconventional Mel Gibson helmed war-story is steeped in heroism and Catholicism. While it is an unflinching depiction of battlefield horrors, Gibson's overly graphic skirmishes seem to indulge in the violence, especially when directed at the Imperialists.<br/><br/>Moreover, being unarmed indicates to your enemy that you're an omnipotent being. <br/><br/>Yellow Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","4","15 February 2017"," Masterful Direction Makes for a Terrific War Film
","Hacksaw Ridge (2016)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>The incredible true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a simple man from Virginia who grows up with a strong religious nature, which means that he can not kill anyone. WWII breaks out and Doss believes it's his duty to sign up but he's soon butting heads with the people in his troop as he refuses to pick up a gun. They believe him to be a coward and can't understand his feelings but soon he's going to have to prove his worth during the battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's HACKSAW RIDGE is a story that probably would have been laughed off the page had it not been based on a true story. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the various plot points in the film but it's quite remarkable what this young man did. Not only the courage he showed but also the guts it took for him to stand up and do what he believed in. Gibson's direction is perfect and technically speaking there's not a single flaw to be found. There's no question that the film is one of the greatest war movies out there.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so wonderfully well is that the drama off the battle field is just as intense as what is on the battle field once we get there. The battle scenes themselves are downright horrific and there about as tense as you're ever going to witness on a screen. Gibson's direction through these scenes was terrific and I must say that he managed to put some of the most graphic war scenes that you're ever going to witness. There's also a jump scare that happens towards the end, which has to be one of the greatest of any film I've seen. There's no question that you feel the horror that these men felt and it's just amazing that anyone could go through that and survive.<br/><br/>Many people say SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has the greatest battle scenes and they're perfect but so are the ones here. What makes this film even greater for me is the fact that the story outside the battle is wonderful. I thought the training sequences were terrific and I thought the abuse that Doss goes through was terrific. Yes, we've seen this stuff in countless war movies but the story here is just so great and Gibson does such a wonderful job that you can't help but feel as if they're fresh and original. It also helps that the entire cast is so wonderful with Garfield leading the way. He's simply terrific here and not once do you ever feel as if you're watching an actor doing a part. You really do feel as if you're watching a real man battle with his beliefs. Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are all terrific as well.<br/><br/>I usually hate when a new movie opens and it gets labeled ""the greatest"" this or ""the greatest"" that. I honestly think films need time to grow and time to become a classic but I honestly have no reservation calling this film something truly special. It works on every level and it's really a masterful piece of filmmaking and it shows once again that Gibson is one of the greatest director's working."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A well made and effective war film that ultimately loses The Battle of Clichés.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Biography about war hero and pacifist Desmond T. Doss.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The bullets whiz by at an alarmingly rate, and so do the clichés in Mel Gibson's war epic, Hacksaw Ridge. Based on a true story about Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector who fought valiantly in WWII, saved 75 lives, and never carried or fired a rifle. Granted, this is a remarkable tale of valor and courage, but, as written by in his screenplay, rarely registers as a real human being, more like a saintly hero with lots of aura to spare. This Seventh-Day Adventist warrior emanates a distinctive glow throughout the film that distanced this moviegoer to feel any emotional connection.<br/><br/>Corporal Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a PATRIOTIC SOLDIER who enlisted in the Army to do his bit for America and fight against THE EVIL Japanese. Of course he runs into some complications due to his religious stance. He runs smack into a TOUGH SERGEANT (Vince Vaughn) and a BULLYING BUNKMATE (Luke Bracey) before hitting the front line. His LOYAL AND LOVING GIRLFRIEND (Teresa Palmer) waits at home while he fights a good fight to stay true to his religious convictions and risk his life numerous times to help others and earning the Purple Heart. The body count rises, along with the clichéd and contrived situations. The set-up is Americana hokum, although based on facts. The screenplay by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan tells their tale with passion and verve, but the dialog lacks any degree of realism or subtlety. It's a standard WWII biography about a superhero done very well.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson directs his film with hundreds of gory close-ups of bodily carnage. His obsession with grisly images never abates, but he does create a powerful war movie. The film is directed with a sure hand, although Mr. Gibson overdoes the religious symbolism with making Desmond such a pious Christ figure to the point of redundancy. The war action sequences are skillfully staged to maximum effect and achieve the right shock value results. Bodies (and body parts) shoot into the air with precision, blood spatters, heads are riddled with bullets as explosions and fire accentuate this balletic dance of death. Other calmer scenes of Desmond's usual earlier years carry with them a nostalgic 1940's glow that contrasts with his dysfunctional family upbringing, also tinged with violence episodes.<br/><br/>As our heroic pacifist, Mr. Garfield downplays the country bumpkin elements of his character and makes Desmond more convincing and multi-layered. He gives a totally assured performance and his emotional conflicts resonate with the audience quite effortlessly due to the actor's likable factor. Strong support is also provided by Mr. Vaughn, who avoids his stock character's trademark gruffness with much agility, Sam Worthington as his captain, and Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths as his quarrelsome parents. As his love interest, Ms. Palmer makes Dorothy's kindly stereotype of the girl back home more interesting than her role suggests.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge, though well-crafted, is all stereotypes thrown together to tell its war-is-hell theme. Relentless in its violence, and redeemed by Mr. Garfield's earnest performance and strong technical qualities, with fine editing by John Gilbert, impressive photography by Simon Duggan, and rousing sound design. The film is equal parts completely contrived and highly effective. Call it Hackeyed Ridge."

","Mel Gibson has become an enigma. I mean he started out a charismatic face, became an OK actor as he went, switched more to directing, even making some amazingly powerful movies. But, he seemed to become quite weird in his personal life. It kind of made you wonder if was just heading out in space? Well, with Hacksaw Ridge he's grounded more than he's ever been. Grounded in a great WWII story well told. It will please a large audience and without controversy.<br/><br/>Gibson has brought the story of Desmond Doss, the first and only conscientious objector in the armed forces ever to win the Medal of Honor. It's a story that deserves widespread attention even this many years later. One might think that it was simple for Gibson to make since the story is the thing. True, the story is the anchor, but getting the power of it to the screen told straight without Hollywood bombast is what I believe Gibson should be credited for. There is some amazing cinematography here that is quite visceral and harrowing. And the choice of Andrew Garfield as Doss seals the deal. This is a movie that is entertaining even in it's violence. That's really an amazing thing to pull off. It's uplifting even as it is surrounded in darkness because it has a real feel that you're watching important history which you might not realize the gravity of unless you see it like this. It's a proud achievement and it really is special in many ways. Highly recommended for all."

But it's a good film. There's a certain backlash that has formed against the film for being so successful for the award precursors that leads to eventual Oscar nominations. I don't think it's one of the best films of the year, but that is unfortunate if it will keep some people from watching it. I do think Andrew Garfield's performance is worthy of praise. He really makes the total character work and he is really giving the role his all. Overall I do recommend it. It could have been something truly great but it could have been a lot worse."

","Hacksaw Ridge- In this bloody, yet heroic biopic Andrew Garfield portrays Private First Class Desmond Doss who was a 7th Day Adventist and an obvious pacifist who enlists into World War two refusing to bare arms. Garfield plays the character in an almost ""Forest Gump"" like Southern personality that is simple, innocent and true.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson shakes off a decade of rust with this one and though it's visible in a few spots, overall you would not be aware of a 10 year absence in directing. The movie itself is shot similar to ""Passiondale"" where there is a backstory of true love followed by the gruesome and gritty realities of war that delivers non-stop intensity and at times a grotesque view of events.<br/><br/>Depending on your religious believes you may grapple with Doss' reasoning for entering war with zero intentions of killing or even fighting the enemy on behalf of his country but just as his superiors learned in the movie (and in real life), so too will the viewer of this film who will quickly discard any negative opinions of him as they learn the nothing but spectacular heroics of him (Private Doss).<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn offers some amusing scenes early on while playing a very convincing drill Sgt (Howell). Hugo Weaving has played better roles than an abusive alcoholic father to Doss, but he does pull i toff respectably enough. The previews for Hacksaw Ridge in my opinion depicted this movie to be a little more heart wrenching than it actually is but in the end I think it will successfully appeal to those who believe in a higher power and the strengths that one can gain from such beliefs, while still feeding those who want to see some epic World War 2 battle scenes and action that do not shy away from the graphic details that come along with it.<br/><br/>I'm always up for a good war movie so I certainly recommend this to those with a similar affection. I enjoyed the back story as well and I felt it added to the overall film but it may prove a bit of deterrent or drawback for some."

The film chronicles his early days on a farm in Virginia, his strained relationship with his father (a traumatized WWI veteran), and his eventual enlistment and deployment where he saved the lives of countless fellow soldiers despite his pacifistic nature. The script is full of conventional elements, and you've no doubt scene similar characters and depictions of battle in plenty of other films, but the performances are good, the frontline war scenes are compelling, and the biographical source material gives it added weight. **½"

 The only thing the lead character ever says about his father is that he's a drunk and abuser. So where's the Christian compassion and forgiveness for his father and first world war veteran who's obviously suffering from post-traumatic stress? Some Christian. His Dad was firmly against his son going to war out of concern for his health and safety. You'd think his son, who is a pacifist, would appreciate that. Some pacifist.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn was also unconvincing (but kinda funny) as the drill sergeant (or whatever he was). The lead actor (forgot his name) was ok, but would it matter how good these actors are anyway in a movie with every known cliché and formula in the book from a director who uses cheap images and ideas to pretend he's profound? Oh wow, more gore, well how innovative. It's like Gibson et al watched Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Rambo, Blackhawk Down, Jarhead, and a Call of Duty game or two and then said, ""ok let's do all that, except make it bloodier....oh! and we need to have the most muscular guy naked too-like in Rambo.""<br/><br/>A completely overrated yawn of a movie from a self-important ""director"" who hasn't made a good film, or been in a good film, since Braveheart.

Even though the movie tried not to focus on the war, rather the life of the miracle man, Mr. Doss, himself, I felt it was too long to take. The first half of the movie is just for the background of him, and I felt it was unnecessary. You can literally enter the theater an hour late, and still wouldn't miss the point. I believe this story is true and give so much respect to Mr. Doss for what he have done. But while watching, my mind was asking what American doing there in Japanese territories. Maybe I am not American so I was not so much into the movie. But, ironically, the director, Mel Gibson is not American either. For me, this one is just another long boring movie."

","Hacksaw Ridge is a formidable anti-war film that's closer to popular war films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon than anti-war masterpieces like Full Metal Jacket and Paths of Glory. The film is elevated by sublime performances from Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, and the lovely Teresa Palmer. Mel Gibson is certainly back with a bang and seems to be following the footsteps of Clint Eastwood. All we need from Gibson now is a Revisionist Western. Speaking of Gibson, his choice of including the archive footage of Private Doss and other survivors from the Battle of Okinawa helps add a lot of weight to the film. <br/><br/>With as many as 6 Oscar nominations to its credit, Hacksaw Ridge is certainly one of the biggest films of the year. Apart from the brilliant screenplay and direction, it is Garfield's performance that makes Hacksaw Ridge what it is. 2016 proved to be an incredible year for Garfield who delivered not one but two great performances-- the other being his turn of a stoic Jesuit Priest in Martin Scorsese's Silence. It's an interesting coincidence that in both these films, Garfield played a Christian pacifist. A real pity is that Garfield didn't get a second nomination for his sublime performance in Silence which is even better than his brilliant turn in Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge looks set to win the Best Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. A win in any other category would be a real bonus.<br/><br/>For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

A bit schmalzy in the start maybe but decent overall, the movie loses much in the portrayal of the battle scenes on Okinawa. Many of them are almost ridiculous, even being no expert in the matter I'm pretty sure every military practitioner will confirm this has not much in common with real military attack practices, behaviour etc.. Soldiers running around suicidal upright in barrage gunfire etc., common ...<br/><br/>A somewhat poor tribute to the true facts behind, how this movie is set up in a less than credible, overheroized action-like manner.

","Mel Gibson may be a racist lunatic in his real world life, but he is one hell of a movie director. His eye for detail in Hacksaw Ridge is impeccable. Andrew Garfield is Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who will not carry a weapon or kill due to his Seventh Day Adventist upbringing. Early on, he encounters a bureaucratic wall, as the military informs him of the necessity of carrying a gun in combat. Doss eventually is able to travel to Japan as a medic and winds up in some extremely vicious and bloody battles near Okinawa in 1945, just before the end of World War II. The fighting scenes are fairly typical of previous war films and the basic training insult laden, politically incorrect drill sergeant are lifted from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" Mel can be forgiven for this, as the character development is fully realized by Garfield and the supporting cast never hits a false note. The last few minutes are a beautiful tribute to a real American hero and Hacksaw Ridge is one of the ten best movies of the year."

The first hour is a bit pedestrian and plays out a little bit like Forest Gump (in my humble opinion you could have shaved half an hour off the running time).The film comes to life in the amazing battle scenes which (in places) were like nothing I have ever seen. Some times the action is bit too frenetic and you can lose track of who is who. Occasionally the tight production values show as it clear the whole thing was shot on quite a small set. Also (without spoiling anything) why did the Japanese not cut the ropes (you will know what I mean when you see the movie). On the subject of the Japanese..they were all a bit one dimensional.

"Argemaluco","7","1","6","5 January 2017"," Hacksaw Ridge
","The true story of Desmond Doss undoubtedly deserves a tribute, but Hacksaw Ridge manipulates the facts in order to fit into a classic war cinema structure: the rookie with good intentions who suffers the disdain from his partners and superiors, in order to later earn respect in the battlefield. Sure, the key difference of Hacksaw Ridge is that Doss' religious beliefs didn't allow him to kill, or even touch a weapon, something which made his military career even more difficult; but everything else is developed exactly in the way we have seen in too many war films. The avalanche of clichés makes the first half of Hacksaw Ridge occasionally a bit tiring, and it contributes to Doss' excessive simplification. I guess it was necessary to show the experiences which made him become an obstinately pacific man, but the screenplay feels so artificial that Doss ends up looking like a less endearing Forrest Gump. That's how we have a fight with his brother which almost concluded on a tragedy, an alcoholic and violent father (brilliantly played by Hugo Weaving) and a search of internal peace through the Adventist religion. Needless to say, those are valid motivations, but co-screenwriters Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight present them on a cold and artificial way, like a list of ingredients, instead of incorporating them to the natural development of an individual with strong moral convictions. Fortunately, all that changes during the second half of the film, in which director Mel Gibson overwhelms us with a brutal and bloody vision of war which doesn't only capture the struggles of combat, but also the chaos and hopelessness which torment soldiers. I won't say more than that in order to preserve the best moments of Hacksaw Ridge; but I can assure that the weak first half is compensated to some point by the visceral and emotional impact of the battle scenes. Andrew Garfield brings a good performance as Doss, credibly transmitting his character's transformation from a pusillanimous innocent man to a hero, while Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Richard Roxburgh also make a credible work as officers who find Doss infuriating, incomprehensible and even offensive. In conclusion, Hacksaw Ridge is definitely very far from being on par with classic war movies such as Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line, but it still deserves a moderate recommendation, mainly for portraying such a peculiar fragment of World War II, proving that courage doesn't necessarily require aggression."

But it's not necessarily a bad thing because for all the clichés and simpleness it also manages to be one of those beautiful event movies which win us over by just how well they are put together in every aspect.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are as brutal and eye-catching as expected but I especially liked how the movie manages to work on different levels.<br/><br/>It reminds us that war was hell before it was all entertainment for the younger generations – but it also manages to be sweet and kind of feel- good, praising the good in our souls which can make us rise to the occasion and make the most of the bad situation. And, of course, action fans will not leave disappointed either.<br/><br/>It's also amazing how soulful performances the actors offer based on quite shallow one-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Garfield is a true star here, giving his all as a boy not quite a man but ready to do man's job – all starry-eyed, idealistic and physically resembling a young calf at times – yet never giving up on personal quest to be worthy of own's ideals. You will totally buy him as a young American hero.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is strong too, especially Hugo Weaving as the hero's troubled father and Vince Vaugh as sgt Howell.<br/><br/>It is kind of ironic that after years and years of yawn-inducing talky roles in mostly mediocre comedies, Vaughn has found new calling in serious, violent stories such as ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and the mafia man in HBO's ""True Detective's"" season 2.<br/><br/>This is also kind of comeback/renewal for Mel Gibson, one of the more likable movie stars from the end of 1970's to the beginning of 2000's.<br/><br/>In the middle of 2000's, he suddenly stopped acting, directed two violent historical movies (""Passion of the Christ"", ""Apocalypto"") and turned from a longtime family man and father of seven to seemingly homicidal maniac, if we believe the news and notorious recordings made by his neighbors, leaked to web.<br/><br/>He's returned to acting in 2010 but has been keeping lower darker indie- er profile ever since, so many of you have probably not seen him in anything new. Except maybe cameo-ing in Machete 2 and The Expendables 3. This time, he's ""only"" director and does a marvellous job at that, putting everything together and wringing the most out of the cast.<br/><br/>""Hacksaw Ridge"" may not be remembered as one of the greats in crowded war movie genre but it's working beautifully in ts own right. Two hours well spent."

","Hacksaw Ridge follows a man who joins the army with the intention of not killing anyone, and how he goes about doing that. <br/><br/>The pacing for this movie is excellent. When I left the theater I figured it's been about 100 minutes long, give or take. But turns out it pulled off a 139 minute run time. It kept itself going, and it made it that much easier to enjoy. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield as Desmond Dos was pretty great. He's not fantastic, but come Oscar season he'll probably get some buzz. Everyone else does a good job too, but Garfield was the standout of them all. <br/><br/>The violence is very graphic and pretty realistic. It's largely underglorified, which is a good thing when it comes to war movies. Plenty of characters go for heroics throughout the movie, and I can't say whether or not that's entirely realistic, but it does glorify the violence from time to time, and it kind of takes the audience out of the movie due to the tone it already set for itself. <br/><br/>My biggest and really only problem with the movie is that it's just a montage of the same thing over and over. It's just one giant war montage, and by the end I felt largely unsatisfied, like nothing had really even happened. In a way it's pretentious, in that it acts like it was some big deal when in actuality it was just one of many battles fought during the war. I'm not saying what happened wasn't important, but it wasn't as big as the movie makes it out to be. <br/><br/>Overall Hacksaw Ridge is pretty good. It's the kind of movie that I probably wouldn't watch again, nor would I buy unless I found it for $2 at a Pawn Shop or something. Its one of those movies. In the end I'd still recommend it, but I don't think it deserves the praise that it received, and had I known how much I'd like it I probably wouldn't have paid to see it in theaters."
"pc95","7","1","6","3 December 2016"," Remarkable Story a Bit Overcooked
","(Major Spoilers) Director Mel Gibson has a flare for the dramatic in ""Hacksaw Ridge"", and the blasting score and unrelenting violence is lathered on a little heavy for this reviewer's taste. Not knowing the story, I find it difficult to fathom that all fellow troops sat idol while Private Doss lowered down man after man after man. No one bothered to help him apparently. Performances range from very good from Weaving, to good from Garfield and Worthington, to out-of-place for Vince Vaughn. Stealing the show for certain though about a third through is introduced Aussie Luke Bracey - a breakout movie for him as Smitty, owning most every scene he's in. Although he's in a supporting role, he's magnetic, and Gibson figured it out. The movie, a tale of 2 halves is beautifully shot, but the music gets a little much as does the violence - a misplaced glory with it sort of feels off-kilter and strangely hypocritical between content and portrayal. Still recommended though for the captivating story. 7.5/10"
"CptLande","6","1","7","18 January 2019"," Too artificial
","Hacksaw Ridge tells the ""true"" story of Desmond Doss, who as a pacifist saved more lives than most people during WW2, which by itself is an amazing feat. Andrew Garfield does an interesting portrayal of Doss, an awkward but charming fellow who after his own experiences and beliefs does not believe in violence, but still wants to serve his country in the war.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with this one is the fact that the setting, costumes, sets are too artificial. It really doesn't sell me on the idea that they are really in Japan, in boot-camp, on the town. It looks like a set, and it completely dragged me out of the experience.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch this because it won oscar for best editing, but I really don't understand why. The movie is cut very generic, nothing about the making of the movie sticks out in my mind, and there were other movies that year which were more deserving of the award.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn tries his best at playing an angry army sergeant akin to R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, but it really doesn't come across as intimidating or convincing, it feels more like a parody. Whether it's because of Vaughns acting or something else I don't know, but I found his scenes more laughable than anything.<br/><br/>What I did like about this movie is that even though the japanese soldiers are portrayed as ruthless soldiers with no fear for their own lives, they still show some humanity in them when showing their side. They truly believe in what they are doing, and it's easy to see the story from their side as well.<br/><br/>It's an O.K. movie, but not one I would want to watch again."

"artmania90","7","1","7","16 January 2017"," Welcome back Mel
","Mel Gibson is certainly a director of considerable talent, and excusing his brushes with scandal, he is still a man who knows his craft and exudes a confidence on screen. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is his first directorial effort in 10 years, and although at times the films fails to reach it's full potential, it's still a reminder that Gibson isn't someone we want banished from Hollywood.<br/><br/>In a time when it feels like World War II movies have been tired out, here comes another one that tells the true story of Desmond Doss. Unlike most soldiers, Doss is a Seventh Day Adventist who refuses to go against the 10 Commandments, particularly the one against killing. Enlisting to serve his country, his only slight is that he will not touch a gun. At first he is told that this will be acceptable. Boot camp certainly proves him wrong.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is told in two very distinct parts: the blossoming romance on the eve of enlistment, and the hellfire of battle itself. When you think of a war movie you must introduce the characters as everyday people. Doss is raised in Virginia, son to a drunk and lover to a nurse at a nearby hospital. On their first date he can't help but stare at her in the dark, ignoring the newsreel footage of battle. In another film that black and white image would be enough to spark Doss to enlist. Instead, he just smiles and smiles and wonders whether he should kiss her or not.<br/><br/>We see the fragments of why he is so against violence. His father (Hugo Weaving) who at one time lost his friends in World War I, is now a raging alcoholic who takes out his anger on both wife and kids. His only solace is the cemetery where his friends are now buried. Guns are expected in war, but in life, Doss sees them as a tool to only incite destruction. When so many people arm themselves to fight, he decides to work as a medic to try and save people instead.<br/><br/>Boot camp sees all the typical scenes one might expect, including peer bullying, obstacle courses, and a barrage of insults from the drill instructor (Vince Vaughn in a curiously non-comedic role. His performance and delivery of lines is astonishingly bad in an otherwise fine cast. This is the first true time I can honestly say that an actor was absolutely miscast). As he continues to refuse weapons training, Doss is thrown in a military prison and threatened to be locked up the duration of the war. We know he won't be, but it's still required in the film to establish the drama of the scenario.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is very clearly two stories, and part two hits the audience like a freight train as the nightmare of battle manifests on screen. Gibson, the director whose battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are still considered some of the best of their kind, knows how to film action. The left-to-right path of the allies move across screen at Hacksaw Ridge; a precipice of mud and trenches on the shores of Okinawa. Taking this fortress means changing the tides of war. The battle which is filmed in extended sequences that truly are horrific, show blood and gore the likes of which we haven't seen in a war film in quite some time. Steven Spielberg didn't necessarily revolutionize war films with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but the intensity certainly hearkens back to it.<br/><br/>Doss is remembered as having saved nearly 100 wounded soldiers from the battlefield when all other troops retreated. Through the night and into the next day, he worked to slowly drag men from the mud and lower them down a 50-foot cliff to their salvation. It's almost too fantastic to be a true story, and yet Mel Gibson himself said he was drawn to this story because it was about ""a real life superhero without the spandex."" After the war Doss even became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The film (nearly 2.5 hours) wraps up so quickly that it felt like a 3-hour movie that was missing the final reel. A quick montage shows the final moments of the battle and show some incredible real-life footage of the elderly men who actually knew Doss. Aside from some moments of cliché (how can a war film ever seek to be original when so much has been seen) and that brisk wrap-up to such an unbelievable story, I still would recommend the movie. Andrew Garfield in the leading role is at times a bit too hammy to demonstrate the depth a character like this would have, although such selflessness is maybe 100% accurate. I was happy to learn a bit more about one of America's unknown heroes."

"thesar-2","7","1","8","28 January 2017"," Thou Shall Not Kill, Except...
","This movie reminded me of a childhood favorite character and his best line from his entire show:<br/><br/>""I will not carry a gun, Frank. When I got thrown into this war, I had a clear understanding with the Pentagon: no guns,"" says Benjamin Franklin 'Hawkeye' Pierce, M*A*S*H.<br/><br/>(Frank snorts in disgust)<br/><br/>""I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash-and-carry, carry me back to Old Virginia, I'll even 'hari-kari' if you show me how, but I will not carry a gun.""<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge and I have something in common: we both hate guns. At least, Spidey does. <br/><br/>I feel the same as Andrew Garfield's character did, but for different reasons. I all-around hate guns and if I never pick up one for the rest of my life, I will die happy. This movie, or another ""true story,"" deposits other reasons for not holding.<br/><br/>This movie is very, very long. Did it need to be? Absolutely not. While not at the caliber as Pearl Harbor, it's fluffed with so much back story that's completely not intrigue to the final message/heroic mission, I wonder why Passion Director Gibson would pad it so much.<br/><br/>That all said, it was incredibly shot and ruthlessly real with war- scenes that went on for what seemed like hours. As much as I hate war as I do guns, I wasn't checked out by the carnage, but I was ready to get to the point.<br/><br/>And that point? Well, for the synopsis, we get background on Garfield's Doss' home life as WWII began. Additionally, his love interest, his complicated father and his passivism. He agrees to enlist with the ""Everyone Else is Jumping Off the Bridge"" hype, but only to medicate people despite his lack of schooling.<br/><br/>Following, we have a chunk of the movie where he stands against guns for various reasons, a war scene that seemed like a good third of the movie and come-full-circle climax that makes the entire movie worthwhile. <br/><br/>Truth be told, I didn't stand with Doss. His anti-killing attitude is admirable, but to enlist in a war that does just that is contradictory. It's like applying at a convenience store but refusing to sell cigarettes due to a moral high ground. Or wanting to be part of the NFL but refusing to work on Sunday, the Sabbath. Or a vegan chef at Arby's. Or being pro-choice and volunteering at a Republican convention. <br/><br/>Now, yes, all jobs are possible, but dumb. Nonetheless, he volunteers and what's to become of him needed to be told in film. Only, in just a tad bit shorter film.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: this movie is incredibly shot and if you want realistic wartime, borderline NC-17 blood and guts, this is the film for you. I'm sure some people would want that and just praise this for the gore alone. More power to you. Hackaway at more human beings.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I gotta look this up. Okay, I did. Nope, I could not find the Japanese box-office totals for this. I bet they won't be very high. Like the Jews Gibson hates, you'll see how much he thinks of the ""Japs"" here."

","I was excited to see this movie but kept my expectations low. I didn't do any research prior to watching the film, so in a sense, I had zero expectations. I recommend you do the same.<br/><br/>Pros: The best thing I can say about this movie is the acting. Every actor in the film nailed his/her role close to perfection. Some of the battle scenes were well directed and made you feel right in the middle of the fight.<br/><br/>Cons: Pace was slow in the middle of the movie. It felt like it dragged on with scenes that were forced only to further validate Doss' struggles. The movie and direction obviously wanted to give off a patriotic feel but it failed for me. I enjoyed learning about Doss' heroics, but the last ¼ of the movie was lacking the emotional connection. The scene where the Japanese commander performs seppuku (suicide via knife) was unnecessary. It was overly dramatic and was awkward. The scene was to signify the U.S.'s near victory at Hacksaw but it could have been portrayed differently, more naturally. I had trouble connecting with some of the characters. There wasn't enough character development and camaraderie within the unit to make all the heroics credible.<br/><br/>I am a fan of war movies and I am glad I saw this movie in the theater. I also appreciated the Christian morality subplot. However, it was a slow and awkwardly paced movie that didn't come without disappointments."
"dfwesley","7","1","8","8 November 2016"," A conscientious objector becomes a hero in World War II
","I could not help but think of the movie SERGEANT YORK when I saw this. Both were based on true stories, both had main characters who were deeply religious. The big difference was that York became a combat soldier and Doss, a conscientious objector and medic. HACKSAW RIDGE was the more touching of the two. Both were Medal of Honor winners, but it surprised me that I had never heard of Desmond Doss before viewing this movie.<br/><br/>I am a fan of war films and I rate HACKSAW RIDGE quite highly, but not in the same category as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PATHS OF GLORY, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and several others. The acting was good and the story well told. I find fault with the overemphasis on violent and gory images. More time should have been devoted to how Doss saved all those lives. A few other things bothered me like the scene showing the sergeant being pulled backward on a blanket mowing down the enemy. Also it was difficult to believe the order could not be given for the company to advance until Doss was finished praying.<br/><br/>Well above average, yes, outstanding no."
"xeybar","7","1","9","19 December 2016"," Good film that's short of greatness
","I watched this in the theater and I enjoyed it very much and would've rated it at 8 leaving the cinema. But as I thought about it, it left no lasting effect on me nor did I feel that I would watch it again. <br/><br/>This is a one-time-viewing film.<br/><br/>I liked the drama at first, the family stuff and his background, but it felt like a briefing than a story on its own. We spend all this time establishing a connection with the character (given a reason to care about him) and then we place him in danger so that we worry about him.<br/><br/>It's formulaic, straight from a generic scriptwriting course.<br/><br/>The result of that is the film looks like two films. The story of our protagonist and his family life, relationship, etc. and then an action film. <br/><br/>They are two separate films. We did not even see him go back to his family, back to his girl, hometown. As soon as he goes to Hacksaw Ridge, that's the end of everything from part one.<br/><br/>What I would've liked is better editing, intertwining the two stories, flashbacks, references, have two stories running in parallel. The only time this happened was when he recounted as story of his father's drunkenness. It happened once and that was the end of it.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is just an action survival film. Survival films come in all flavors - Apocalypto was one, the Revenant was another, and there's a whole slew of them.<br/><br/>This story is very straightforward - there are no twists or surprises. There's nothing to discuss after.<br/><br/>There are things that are not explored - his reason to not carry arms is not religious, but personal. No one called him a hypocrite on that. (His fiancée suggested pride, and said swallow your pride, but that's not the same thing). His father bore arms in WW1, his brother 2, so it's not against his religion, it's against his own personal convictions (a promise he made to himself after wrestling his drunken dad once).<br/><br/>There's also no reason why he can't just do the target practice to tick the checkbox. The Bible says nothing about shooting practice. He would not have to kill anyone in the war and there would be no one forcing him to shoot at anyone. He just had to pass a test.<br/><br/>Guns are not just used to kill people, but people also hunt animals, not for fun, but for population control, because even if you're a vegan, some animal populations are destructive to agriculture. <br/><br/>This blanket ban on guns was his own invention, but he presented it as religion and no one called him out on it which is strange.<br/><br/>And when he was confronted on his belief system, he did not tell his superiors that ""instead of carrying a gun, I could carry so much more morphine/medical supplies/bandages/etc"" or ""Instead of carrying a gun back and forth, I can bring the wounded faster because I'm traveling lighter"" - all these are sensible arguments that could convince even the most rational atheist. But instead, he quoted verses and thumped the Bible on their tables.<br/><br/>Even if one agrees with the core message, one must be completely baffled by his arguments and his contrarianism/antagonism. <br/><br/>Anything from this would do: ""Do you want me to carry wood and metal back and forth or do you want me to bring your boys back in one piece?"" ""Do you want the lightest, fastest medic or do you want a heavy gun-toter who can shoot? You have many of the latter, don't you want one from the former?"" ""When our soldiers are wounded on the field, would you want me to have a backload of morphine, needles, bandages or do you want me to say 'sorry, boys, I'm out. But at least I have ammo and a gun. Would you like a cartridge?' ""<br/><br/>Oh well."

","A few days ago, a friend shared with me and watched this movie. After two days of delay, I just watched it when I was free. In short: Wow, I'm so touched, this movie is great.
Expand to talk about feelings, there are the following aspects
1. In terms of freedom of belief. I like the quote at the end of the film ""I think any behavior that interferes with the beliefs of others is wrong."" The belief of the male lead in the film is really difficult to understand and has an impact on others and even yourself. But the principle-driven spirit of the male host is hard to follow. Dare to ask you in your life, when you encounter other people's incomprehension, and when people around you persuade you to give up your obsession many times, can you be brave and say no? I might be hesitant. It's a lot. It can be really difficult to insist on self regardless of everything.
2. Love respect. The love of the male host is also very sweet, full of love from all angles. From the ignorance of the male host when he fell in love at first sight, to the regretful wedding scene, the dialogue between the female host and the priest when the male host was absent. Priest: ""Sometimes men will flinch"" Mistress: ""Some men will, but my Desmond will not."" There will be follow-ups when the male host is stubbornly imprisoned, the female host backs up, I think this is inseparable It is also a good point to see the true feelings in adversity without giving up. The ending paragraph was also very touching. The male host was injured and was put on a stretcher. He still remembered to blow up the bible sent by the female host. About this Bible throughout the movie, it is faith and love. Perhaps the sentence of the hostess: ""I think you put me in my heart"" or the ""I'm waiting for you to come back"" behind the hostess's photo, all support the male host to go through every moment. With the victory of Gang Saw Ridge, the stage of seeing Wu Siren finally came to an end.
3. War aspect. As a war movie, there are definitely many details about war. From the perspective of the male father, from the male father 's father borrowing wine to visit the sacrificed comrades, to the helplessness of the father when he saw the male brother wearing the military uniform, and then to the male father 's father to put on the military uniform again to save the male father. Perhaps the understanding of war seems to be changing quietly. From the perspective of the male lead, from volunteering to be a military doctor, to insisting on self in the face of other people's incomprehension, to the end to save the wounded regardless of his own safety, these deeply moved me. The pinnacle lies in the silent line in the mind of the male host when he saves himself: ""Help me got one more."" This sentence reminded me of the medical staff and many beautiful retrogrades who faced the epidemic and ignored the danger of life. Perhaps it is the phrase ""Let me save another one"". This selfless spirit is sublime and respectable."

","Based on real World-War II events, a peculiar young man named Desmond Doss is eager to participate in the war, with just one holding hook: refusing to bear arms.

He sticks to this non-violence principle after childhood trauma involving violence.<br/><br/>After joining the war unarmed Desmond turns out to be the bravest of all and rescues seventy-two comrades and survives himself without firing a single shot. A tale of a miracle taken from real life. The message is hammered home powerfully. The film shows the Japanese' uncompromised loyalty to their nation in their impressive and self-sacrificing way of war. It also goes to show the Japanese lack of the Golden rule of Westerners when they raise a white flag in a scene to fire a grenade in the next moment, just as they're about to win the forgiving trust of the gullible Westerner. The Asian mind makes a virtue out of deception if it favors their in-group. The famous Chinese symbol yin-yang shows the hide-and-seek play between apparent opposites that seem to characterize existence.<br/><br/>The main character Desmond is the opposite of this Asiatic mindset and, instead, fully syncoperated in his unbreakable faith, even chooses to save Japanese soldiers when he gets the opportunity.<br/><br/>An inspiring tale of hope amidst a world of chaos."

","Probably the cheesiest, most unrealistic war movie I've ever seen. The romance was as shallow as can be and seemingly predicated on Andrew Garfield staring at the poor girl with a sharktooth grin. The dialogue was wooden and clichéd. The action was over-the-top Hollywood nonsense. The story-line of a young medic could have been interesting, if treated with the respect and realism it deserved, but instead watching it felt vaguely insulting to the memory of the soldiers who actually fought in this war."

","If there was an award for Best Trailer in the Oscars, hands down the one for this movie will win. Saving almost 75 soldiers without the use of a single weapon? Now that's the stuff Academy Awards vehicle are made of. This year's version of 'American Sniper', which was that year's version of 'Hurt Locker', I don't know how the nomination process goes but maybe it's about time to mix things up in order for us to see other good movies that also deserve our attention. Now this is not to say HR is bad altogether, but at this point seeing the same story for the nth time about how one white man in a middle of war became a hero is starting to feel repetitive. It's okay to still make a movie about them but to seemingly have an automatic slot in the Best Picture category needs to be looked into.<br/><br/>Now past the AA politics, HR is a well-crafted movie designed to reel you in for the next 2 hours. We see WW2 Army Medic Desmond Doss's humble beginnings, his love story, the struggles he had before he was allowed to be deployed with his battalion and then Hacksaw Ridge. Since life isn't as compact as a 2hr movie, they took the liberty of moving things around such as her wife only became a nurse after they got married, and deleting things such as HR wasn't his first deployment, he actually was already sent to Guam then Leyte, Philippines.<br/><br/>While this will not merit Andrew Garfield an Oscar trophy, he has just set himself up as the next go-to leading man in Hollywood and effectively getting out of shadow of the role he was most known for. Teresa Palmer reminds you of Kristen Stewart that can act, that Vince Vaughn is still alive, what Sam Worthington looks like minus the Avatar effects and Hugo Weaving as a person and not a ""machine"". Lastly, for effect, the director. It's nice to see Mel Gibson back on his feet after his racist and violent outburst years ago. Who knows, we may very well see a movie about his life soon."

"darkavenger77","5","0","5","26 May 2018"," Illogical premise and unlikable main character made this less enjoyable
","When I think over the war films or series I have watched and enjoyed, they are usually due to one or more characters that really helped to make them enjoyable. Band of Brothers stands out as a great fact-based example. Lt. Speirs was my favorite in that one. His scene attacking the town and connecting with another company was memorable, as were his scenes where he referenced his reputation- such as offering a soldier a cigarette. War films do not always have to focus on combat. One of the best films of the 40's I've seen is The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), which deals with problems faced by returning veterans.<br/><br/>The illogical premise here is why anyone would volunteer (not be drafted) into the military when they held a Biblically incorrect belief about killing- based on the Bible. As a Christian, I'm familiar with what Doss read (Thou shalt not kill), but did he (and fellow 7th Day Adventists) miss all of the parts of the same Old Testament Bible where Kings went off to war- often at the behest of God? It's difficult for me to enjoy a film where there is a severely flawed premise.<br/><br/>Doss illustrates this lack of logic when he attacks via hand to hand combat a Japanese soldier about to kill an American soldier. The US soldier then ganks the Japanese one with a gun. What would Doss have done if he had continued to fight? <br/><br/>As other reviews have noted, the battle scenes are often ludicrous. Unlimited ammo- something we see in a Hawaii 5-0 gunfight or usually a low budget western (or at times even a better one like Open Range). Then there was the flamethrower that inflamed an entire underground tunnel.<br/><br/>Of course, Doss proved his worth and courage by saving many soldiers. The ending is touching with archival footage."
"roby0067001","5","0","2","27 November 2017"," Over-hyped
","Can't say much about this movie in particular... Based on a real story that is of a brave young religious man i respect it and that they don't tweak it too much out of reality. The things i disliked a lot were the characters.Very generic military personas and not so much to add about them.Our main character childhood was not one to envy and leaved some marks on him on the use of weapons. He stays true to his beliefs and that is trait that shines the most. The bad thing : I felt nothing for no character at all(yes, even the Doss) the screen time development was little to none but i just saw a bunch of love scenes and felt like Doss went to war just not to be left out and feel inferior. Could not care less about his desire to save the country and protect the loved ones since there is no interior monologue in thought of what his decision are. He is very very straight to the point not even thinking about other influences, and while is not a bad thing it shows how little character inking i got for him.So characters where not to be cared of. I rate it a 4/10. Story was the interesting part that got me in and it speaks for itself i rate it a solid 7/10. The visuals are really good for the budget and look fairly realistic expect the ship attack. I rate it a fair 7/10. Overall unsatisfied with ending and wasting so much screen time with no build of emotion in a war that screams hell but we don't see any changes in other individuals(The cowards remain cowards the bully's appreciation for Doss work felt so out of passion) Overall enjoyment was a 5 , no more no less , not a waste of time but a huge disappointment of what it could have been."

","Some might say that the battle scenes are too gross...but there is, and never has been a nice clean battle...ever...<br/><br/>That, I think, is the strikingly accurate tempo of the movie, even the non-battle parts. Desmond Doss went through a private hell when he enlisted in the Army, and faced initial ridicule for what has become to be recognized as a valid belief. But this movie also shows the personal heroism that resides within each veteran, whether they carry a weapon or not. In fact, Hacksaw Ridge brings to light the truth of non-violent heroics...<br/><br/>The battle scenes are straight out of hell itself, and if you can't handle gruesome, perhaps you should avoid this film...for this one is indeed more gruesome than Saving Private Ryan. don't kid yourself, I find WW2 movies very entertaining, but even I had a tough time with some of it..."
"Uriah43","7","0","1","15 September 2017"," Non-Violence in the Heat of Battle
","Due to his upbringing as a Seventh Day Adventist, ""Desmond Doss"" (Andrew Garfield) does not believe in killing his fellow man-even in war. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent enlistment of every able bodied person that he knows, Desmond enlists in the Army as a combat medic. Yet, even though he is told he would not have to shoulder a rifle, Desmond discovers that his entire chain-of-command requires him to do so anyway. This results in an incredible strain on him when he decides to follow his religious convictions but refuses to accept any kind of discharge which might be prejudicial to him or his religious beliefs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film featured intense action in addition to some decent human drama. On the minus side, I thought that the combat scenes went on a bit too long and the computer graphics utilized were somewhat obvious. Likewise the interviews at the end were a bit redundant as well. But all things considered I thought that this was a good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"belacane","5","0","6","13 August 2017"," A story with a lot of holes in it
","I felt very oddly confused by this movie. Desmond decides to enlist and ""be a medic,"" yet the only medical preparation we see is him on the porch reading a book on anatomy. There is no mention made of any Army training, or any schooling in medicine he may have done before enlisting. I'm unfamiliar with the Army (especially in that era) but it seemed very bizarre that a boy could just ""decide"" to be a medic and that's all it took. I was also distracted by the end (after the war flashbacks ended). Thought that they should have shown what happened to him when he got home. Was his father still around? Was he proud of Desmond? They did show the still photos of the real Desmond, but it would have wrapped up more satisfactorily if they had concluded the story with a return of the actor playing Desmond, coming back to his home and family.<br/><br/>In addition to these inconsistencies I also felt there was too much emphasis placed on the gore of war. Too many men with gruesomely-missing limbs being dragged around, and so forth. I saw ""Tropic Thunder"" long before ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and the wounds in Tropic Thunder, done for comedic value, are almost the same as the wounds shown in ""Hacksaw Ridge."" I spent all of the battle scenes watching my cat groom his paws because the gore was so over-the-top.<br/><br/>Lastly, was that rope ladder up the cliff really a thing? Why didn't the Japanese just burn it, or chop it down, when the previous troops had left? It seems like it must have been created with cinematic license, because in the real world, it would never have stayed intact. I'm going to go read about this battle now, but that rope ladder was so jarringly stupid that it took me out of the movie quite a bit.<br/><br/>Ordinarily I like a good war movie but this wasn't one."

","Hacksaw Ridge brings the Pacific Theatre of war to your movie screens. Honestly, it's an unbelievably breathtaking film, the heroics of WWII Army Medic Desmond Doss is a story worth telling and retelling again. Andrew Garfield takes the lead and is rightly nominated for his efforts, the mere body transformation and weight loss to take on the role are not to be overlooked - putting his health on the line. <br/><br/>The scenes of combat truly bring the horrors of war and that of Hacksaw Ridge to a shocking reality to viewers, in many ways disturbingly so. The power of the human spirit and the moral lessons one can learn from the story can make even Mr Hyde an empathetic man. The only criticism I can give this movie is the acting of Vince Vaughn, sure he's a great actor but the man has imprinted himself in the comedy genre and for that, the connotations of his character will forever be taken far from seriously. Its as if Daniel Radcliffe was cast in Garfield's place - wouldn't be the same, would it?<br/><br/>In conclusion, there is no amount of films, money or praise to do films such as this justice. The sacrifice these men (or should I say boys) gave up to service their country and fight a war in foreign lands is never forgotten.<br/><br/>""Never in the history of mankind has so much been owed by so many to so few"""

"cathalokane","5","0","4","29 July 2017"," *Spoilers* A cartoonish war film that doesn't deserve its rating
","I felt moved to write this review after having watched two war films in the past fortnight. First of all, I witnessed the event that is Dunkirk in IMAX. Then after chatting about Dunkirk, I had this film recommended to me by a work colleague who said it was one of the best films she had seen in a while. I watched it at home on a quiet Friday night. As I was pondering what I had witnessed in Hacksaw Ridge, I thought I would check to see how IMDb compared the two films. I was quite stunned to see that they were scored very similarly.<br/><br/>Whilst I do not intend to conduct a full and detailed comparison between the two films, I feel some comparison is warranted because they must be equally good with such similar scores? Right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is intense, gritty, utterly convincing, beautifully directed, creative, challenging, packs stunning cinematography and realism, and is a physical and mental roller-coaster of tension, hope and terror. There are no blood and guts because they aren't needed. The director is more sophisticated than that. Hacksaw Ridge is a disjointed simplistic and linear film that spends an extraordinary amount of time on a wafer thin conscientious objector story-line before dumping you unceremoniously into a completely unrealistic orgy of frenzied war porn. The bodies fly through the air comically; heads explode; hapless troopers shoot at each other whilst leaving their valueless heads left hanging over the top of trenches like sitting ducks. *Spoiler* many lose their stupid heads. Both sides charge like crazed maniacs through a hail of gunfire, grenades and flamethrowers and then we all wonder how so many ended up dead. Every now and then we cut to a jarringly terrible CGI cut-scene of a few navy battleships bombarding the battlefield. This is all interspersed by our gun-shy hero charging around rescuing everyone in a feat of human bravery that would be more appropriately placed in the latest Marvel ""release"".<br/><br/>Doesn't sound too bad you cry? Well, you only get to this madness after we are made sit through an hour of tediously clichéd love story surrounding the simplistic half baked-ideas of a slightly creepy lead character who doesn't want to use a gun because a) his Dad was a nutter and b) he likes to parrot the ten commandments. There is no real attempt to asses the arguments for or against conscious objection here. It's ethics and morality for idiots. For a complex or interesting examination of conscientious objection thematics, one will need to go elsewhere. The jewel in the crown of this saccharine first half is an unnerving cinema scene where the stunningly beautiful nurse is bowled head over heels by the relentless glassy eyed stare of a drooling yokel. *Top tip lads*; if you go to the cinema with a girl on a first date, don't sit staring at the side of her face, with your tongue hanging out, droning at her in a slightly deranged Deliverance-esque voice ""... yer the most bootiful thin av evur seeeeeeeen, hyuh hyuh hyuh"". *Spoiler* this will not lead to a successful outcome for you. Here however it works a treat and the stunning nurse falls madly in love with our dim-witted protagonist. This is the level of realism we are dealing with in this film.<br/><br/>I must caveat here that I know this is based on a true story and do not want in any way to cast negative aspersions on the actual person this story is based on. I cannot imagine in any way that what we are seeing here is in any way close to how he behaved, or thought. I'm sure he was not a fool, but unfortunately that is how he is portrayed in this film. This is undoubtedly partly intentional; to portray his conviction as a simple and noble thing, but this never really hits home as it's never really clear exactly where the conviction came from over and above a few random events in his childhood.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie portraying war in a realistic, convincing and entertaining way, go watch Dunkirk. You mind find yourself intellectually stimulated! You wont argue with its gritty realism and simmering tension even if you normally have a penchant for blood and guts. If you like Transformer films, and/or enjoy sitting on your porch rocking chair caressing your beloved shotgun, you'll probably prefer Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>Despite my obvious dislike of this film ultimately it is watchable, and the frequent jarring moments (roughly every 30 seconds) where you think ""what a load of nonsense that would never happen"" didn't prompt me to turn it off. Possibly because I paid to watch it. The contrast between these two recently released war films that both hold an 8+ score on IMDb could not be more stark. Much as I would like to give this a 1 star to help remedy the obvious rating injustice here, I will give this film what it deserves, an average 5/10."

"jb_campo","7","0","2","24 May 2017"," Violent bloody war film
","Hacksaw Ridge is a very violent war film. Bodies are blown apart, knives are slicing people, and bullets or grenades are flying in close hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>This movie directed by Mel Gibson portrays a true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Garfield seems to have escaped the trap of Spiderman with a few films this summer that stretch his acting skills. In Ridge, he works hard to portray a young man who is an honest, hard working religious person who wants to help his country in the battlefield of Japan but won't use a gun. He wants to be a medic. Doss is a generally happy kid despite an unpleasant home life due to his drunken father's aggressive behavior.<br/><br/>The early part of the film shows Desmond when he's young, but I got a bit confused about who was who, and where they were flashing back or forward to. That part could have been better edited for clarity. Like most war films, there are so many guys that it's hard to remember who is who. Doss undergoes a titanic battle to get thru the Army's red tape to actually become a medic. Once deployed, the face Hacksaw Ridge, a huge 90 degree angle cliff several hundred feet tall leading up to the killing plateau. <br/><br/>From there on out, the scenes are blood and violent. Can Doss withstand the pressure to not pick up a gun? Can he stay true to his word and serve God in these conditions? The story draws you in and leaves you amazed at this person's courage.<br/><br/>Except for the confusing beginning, Gibson does a fine job getting good acting from all characters. At film's end, I felt somewhat drained from all the violence and horror of war, which I guess means that the film worked. Look for a fine performance by Hugo Weaving from Captain America and I think the Matrix series Mr smith. Weaving is outstanding as Doss's father who fought in WW1 and knows well what his son going off to war means. <br/><br/>Fine film. Unbelievable story. Worth your time. Enjoy."

","Hacksaw Ridge tells the real-life story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), an WWII American Army medic who fought in the pacific theater and showed exceptional courage during the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a brief re-telling of Desmond's childhood, coming of age and his decision to join the army as a combat medic, despite his father (excellent role of Hugo Weaving) pleading not to go. However, due to his past Desmond has become a very religious person and his believes conflict with the army's view that every soldier, including medics, are able to handle a rifle and not hesitate to kill in combat. Desmond refuses to even touch a rifle and the army want's to get rid of him, but Desmond is determined to finish his training. He eventually ends up in the battle of Okinawa where his incredible courage saves many soldiers lives, without him ever firing a single shot. <br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge is a well made movie which looks and sounds like a war movie is supposed to. The actors pulled off great performances to play believable characters, especially Andrew Garfield and Hugo Weaving. The other soldiers where not given much depth which was a bit of a pity, but it is Desmond's story so I understand the decision to keep the focus on the main protagonist. <br/><br/>What I didn't like about this movie is Mel Gibson's obsession with blood and gore in combination with sensational over-the-top shots. Yes we all know that war is hell but does it have to be shown with soldiers getting blown to bits in slow-motion? And showing horrific wounds a few times is enough, doing it constantly makes it almost feel like I'm watching splatter horror. A more 'subtle' showing of war-violence like for example, Saving Private Ryan would have been much better. But the battle scenes are still well made and well acted, I just wished Gibson made them a bit less spectacular and melodramatic. <br/><br/>So overall a solid WWII movie with an interesting real-life story that you should check out if your interested in a bit of history. But be noted that parts of it are very bloody."
"msenturk80","7","0","1","2 April 2017"," More ""clash of ideas"" scenes would have been better.
","First of all, it is not a bad movie. Most people have mentioned how splendid war scenes are. <br/><br/>But I'd like to see more conflict of characters which advocates opposite views. Opinion of the main character was shown as right. I respect that but there are some firm grounds which opposite view depends. Such a choice, refusing to use a gun even in a battle may risks your battle friends. Maybe even whole battle... <br/><br/>In the first half of the movie, we can see both sides trying to win this ""clash of ideas"".Both sides have good arguments. Both sides fight for his country and they accept they may die. But they think different. Watching these scenes attracted me more than battle scenes."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","5","25 March 2017"," Never boring, though kind of a mixed bag in the end
","Mel Gibson's ""Hacksaw Ridge"" in many ways has a strong echo of the 1941 Gary Cooper movie ""Sergeant York"", though both movies were based on actual events (yet in different wars). It has a lot of touches (particularly in the first half) that many present day viewers will consider to be old-fashioned, from the plot turns to the dialogue. While you could probably get away with these creaky touches decades ago, today most viewers will probably find them hokey. <br/><br/>To be fair to Gibson, as clichéd as the movie may get at times, it never gets to be dull despite a running time of about 140 minutes; Gibson moves from scene to scene at a fairly fast pace. And when the movie does get to the battlefront, Gibson does show that warfare is serious stuff and not fun at all. The fighting is bloody and ruthless, yet at the same time you can't look away. (Though the use of very unconvincing CGI blood when people get shot does lessen the impact.)<br/><br/>So in the end, the movie as a whole generates mixed results. I can understand why some people would like the movie, but I can also see why some people would dislike it. Since I don't know what your movie tastes are like, I cannot say what you'll probably think of it. Judge for yourself."

"avik-basu1889","7","0","5","18 February 2017"," A man of conviction !!!
","'Hacksaw Ridge' directed by Mel Gibson tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who saved countless lives of American(and a few Japanese) soldiers at that battle of Hacksaw Ridge during WWII without firing a single shot due to his convictions.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan divides the narrative structure of the film into two parts. The first half is spent in giving us an understanding of the character of Desmond, his nature, his family, the environment that he grew up in, his love life, and of course his religious beliefs and ideals. The second half takes place in the battlefield. Gibson sets a very saccharine tone for the section of the film dealing with Desmond's past and family life. I think the reason for this might have been the need for the film to reflect Desmond's simplistic, innocent and immensely uncomplicated approach towards life just like 'Sunset Boulevard' gets a bit over-the-top at times to reflect the character of Norma Desmond. Although that is an understandable creative choice, I think Gibson struggles a bit to keep the tone from spilling into cheesiness at times. The dynamics between Desmond and Dorothy is initially awkward(intentionally), but becomes sweet later on. But the family scenes that we see involving his father are a bit too clichéd. <br/><br/>Once Desmond decides to enlist and makes his way to the army training camp, the themes of the film come into full effect. He strongly and rigidly stands by his belief and conviction to never pick up a weapon. As one would expect, this leads to complications. Just like Serpico, Desmond faces animosity and coldness from his colleagues and superiors for holding on to his beliefs when others don't share them. Although from time to time you do get the odd Christian imagery and just like Frank Serpico in Lumet's 'Serpico', Desmond here is portrayed as a bit of a Jesus figure, but I still think Mel Gibson does well to not shove the religious aspects down the viewer's throats. The religious elements are mostly incidental, the major theme of the film is the need to stay true to your own beliefs and convictions(as long as they aren't illegal/immoral). If he wants to help the troops by being a medic without picking up a gun, then he maybe should be allowed to do so without being judged(especially when he isn't judging the others for fighting either).<br/><br/>Then the war scenes start and Mel Gibson's trademark visual flair appears through big, brutal, violent and uncompromising shots and set-pieces. But even though the scenes are stylishly executed with as much gore as you would expect from Gibon's action scenes, there is a potentially problematic aspect to staging these scenes with the kind of style and panache that Gibson does stage them with. On one hand the argument can be made that Gibson's decision to elaborately depict these scenes with the deeply horrific and hellishly violent aspects is actually an act of being authentic to the deadly truths of war and also an act of being respectful to the troops who endured and embraced these horrors for the love of their respective countries. But a counter argument can be made that these scenes are an example of a director prioritising and thereby indulging in graphic and stylishly directed violence of body horror and torture over the central theme of the film which is a man providing priceless help in the field of battle in spite of holding on to his ideals of pacifism and maybe thereby, the film ends up contradicting its central theme. This argument is backed up by the fact that although the rest of the film takes place completely from Desmond's point of view, as soon as the battle scenes start, suddenly the point of view shifts and we become a third person observer of violence in war. I can see validity in both the arguments which makes it a bit difficult to completely embrace those scenes. As soon as the point of view shifts back to Desmond and we see him carry out his heroically famous act of saving countless injured troops, the film starts working brilliantly and becomes immensely inspirational due to the bravery on show. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield deserves a lot of praise for his portrayal of Desmond Doss. It can be really difficult to portray someone who has a very simplistic view of the world and has a childlike innocence about him. There are scenes and lines which could have sounded very cheesy, but Garfield makes, at least, most of them look and sound sweet instead of corny. Teresa Palmer as Dorothy also adds a sense of sweetness and likability to the film. Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and Vince Vaughn are also good.<br/><br/>I don't think 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a flawless film. There might be certain moments of Mel Gibson's over-indulgence in extreme violence (by moving away from Desmond Doss' POV) which to some extent defeats the purpose of the thematic content and maybe some scenes also become a bit too saccharine. But even then, the film for the most part has something nice to say about the flexibility of the definitions of bravery and masculinity. It tells a story worth telling and it made me aware of a great man who deserves to be known for his actions. Recommended."
"richardj-33552","7","0","5","14 February 2017"," A time of war, a time of heroes.
","Spoiler Alert.<br/><br/>So here we have Hacksaw Ridge. I take it from other reviews here you may already know the incredible true story of Desmond Doss. If I'm not mistaken, Doss had already been in action on Leyte and had been decorated. So the men of his platoon already knew of his bravery before they went into action on Okinawa.<br/><br/>Being a fan of war movies I've come to the conclusion that the best war movies are the ones that use common sense along with a good grasp of military history. Theses qualities can put any war movie in good stead, unlike for example Fury.<br/><br/>To be honest I'm surprised by all the high praise and positive feedback to Hacksaw Ridge, it's a great movie but not exceptional. Putting the explicit battle scenes aside I would put it on a par with Angelina Jolie's, Unbroken (yeah I've said it), a movie that's had more than it's fair share of negative reviews.<br/><br/>I would describe Hacksaw Ridge as a kind of TV movie tapestry. A Waltons episode, the recruitment training of Full Metal Jacket, courtroom drama, 'you can't handle the truth', and the D -Day landing of Saving Private Ryan. Nothing we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>You know your in movie land, the Hollywood veneer of two coats. The first part of the movie is visually immaculate, almost too perfect to look real. The screenplay and narrative is not convincing, it had no real depth or reach, nothing more than the expected generic movie talk.<br/><br/>To me the new recruits in the army barracks looked too old and out of place, I'm not sure if it was standard practice for the US services in war time to recruit men of all ages. So you end up with a mixed bag of recruits of varying ages. All the usual suspects are there, including the platoon bully, who surprisingly comes good in the end. The whole training camp looked too manicured to be a true blood and guts factory of fighting men.<br/><br/>I'm no solider, but when the men climb the ridge they all bunched up together, making themselves an easy target for the enemy, it's just not good soldiering. Your natural instinct would be to find temporary cover until the whole platoon had climbed the ridge. I can't understand why the Japanese didn't make any attempts to cut the rope ladder from the ridge. When the bullets start flying your natural instinct is to take cover and keep your head down instead of standing up to see what going on. <br/><br/>The American weapons never seem to run out of ammunition. In close quarter fighting is it not sensible to attach the bayonet to your Garand rifle.? Although the battle scenes are very realistic and horrifying you get on real sense of place or space, you get the impression everything is shot (excuse the pun) in an area the size of a football field, unlike the real environment scenes of The Thin Red Line for example. <br/><br/>After the first days fighting, there's no chance the surviving men would sleep that night. You'd expect the men to secure the ground gained and set up some kind of defensive line. Because the following morning the Japanese attack, never saw that coming.<br/><br/>Be warned the violence in Hacksaw Ridge is not for the feint hearted, it's enough to take your breath away, leaving you a bit traumatized.<br/><br/>The acting by the entire cast is first class, Vince Vaughn gives the movie some warmth and humor.<br/><br/>I remain patient because the best war movie of all time has not been made yet."
"meeza","Null","0","4","11 February 2017"," Glad I saw the Hacksaw!
","Mel Gibson is not a Mad Phone-to-the-Max anymore; he is back; returning to passion with his harrowing true-story war drama ""Hacksaw Ridge"". The film stars Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss, who was the first American soldier who served in a war without firing a gun. I will try to be the first corny puns critic to write up a review without firing a pun; mmm don't see that happening. Anyways, Doss fought during World War II as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa. His religious beliefs in not killing was the prominent reason why he chose not to be armed, even though he fought hard with the Army for that right, and even almost got court martialed for it. I'm not going to fire away spoilers here, but what Doss did unarmed to save numerous soldiers was an unfathomable act of courage. Gibson's direction of the film was spectacularly vivid. Garfield was a tour- de-force as Doss; and there were also some sure fire supporting performances from Vince Vaughn as Doss' semi- sympathetic Sergeant and Sam Worthington as his defiant Captain. The battle scenes were mesmeric, but it was the more humane scenes of Doss' refusal to carry a firearm that triggered the best part of the film for me. The movie did run a tad too long, but that did not defeat the matter that I am a believer of ""Hacksaw Ridge"". **** Good"
"Sky_0010","8","0","6","20 December 2016"," A pacifist war hero, Doss
","Quite well directed movie by Mel Gibson, maybe his best till date. The way he encompasses all the aspects of war is simply elegant. Kudos to him as well as Andrew, portraying Doss, for making this movie worth a watch.<br/><br/>The movie starts of slow, focusing towards Doss's character and how he decided to become a medic, and slowly builds its pace as soon as Doss joins the army.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Mel Gibson has made use of Andrew's full potential. Also Teresa Palmer (Kristen Stewart look alike) acted beautifully. Hugo Weaving enacted Doss's father quite well.<br/><br/>Well, even though Gibson quite beautifully narrated the movie, it lacked the punch and fell a little short of hitting the bull's eye. The war scenes, at times, looked a little bit unrealistic. And there was a pinch of incompleteness in Doss's character, maybe because the aftermath of the war was totally neglected in the movie. Also, Doss was portrayed more of as a messiah, not a man. I feel somewhere the depth was missing.<br/><br/>Even with the cons, I would say the movie is worth a watch for the powerful performances and beautiful narration."
"popovicpetar","8","0","6","6 December 2016"," Mixed feelings about an unnecessarily inflated but in the end under-told story
","Mr Doss is an extraordinary character. It is enough to read a short article on Wikipedia, and to stand in awe to his bravery and selflessness. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it over-inflates some parts of the story, and unnecessarily changes some details ""for added suspense"", and then fails to present the audience some other details where Mr Doss showed further bravery and self-sacrifice. It presents his feat in combat almost as a one- night adrenaline induced brilliance, while in reality Mr Doss had a much wider continuity and variety in his heroic deeds. <br/><br/>I often have this problem with ""true story movies"" when writers/directors try to make real life events more dramatic, and then overlook some important details, ending up with some un-credible drama, and thus minimizing the actual real-life awesomeness of the real people and their stories.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the first part was a bit diffused and too long. The combat was portrayed perfectly, the confusion, disorientation and overwhelming presence of death in the battlefield are worth 11 stars, but in the end I'm a bit disappointed, although I admit to coming to the cinema with very high expectations. Nevertheless - go see it, it's a great story about an extraordinary hero!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","4","5 December 2016"," Unsung hero, until now
","After watching this movie, you would be wondering why it took so long to make into a movie this inspiring true WW II story of how a Conscientious Objector firmly holding onto his convictions finally erased the accusation of cowardice and won the respect of the entire world. The answer, if you don't already know it, is simple. Desmond Doss, our modest hero, shuns publicity and has not released the right to this movie until reaching old age.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson has organized this 140-minute movie into deftly crafted segments. The first hour comprises a brief opening montage, a short prelude of childhood scenes 16 years ago, and two establishing sequences (a) romance and (b) training camp (which starts with a light-comedy tone, then switches abruptly into intense drama). The remaining 80 minutes carry the full weight of the movie, the Battle of Okinawa, or more specifically: Hacksaw Ridge. My observations on this movie below follow these sequences.<br/><br/>The brief opening montage comprises carnage of soldiers at the receiving end of flamethrowers. While the agony is disturbing, you see no gore. But don't congratulate yourself. What is to come later gives new literal meanings to ""a bloody mess"", making ""Saving Private Ryan"" look like Walt Disney family entertainment.<br/><br/>The prelude shows pre-teen Desmond Doss, in the course of everyday children's play, dealing his brother a near-fatal injury. Fortunately, there is no permanent damage. ""I could have killed him"" he remorsefully whimpers. ""Yes, you could"", replies his sympathetic mother. The injured brother's role, a little unexpectedly, fades into oblivion after this. Much more important is his father who has been left an alcoholic wreck after witnessing the hideous deaths of brothers-in-arm during WW I. Later in the movie, there is a flashback showing Doss on the brink of pulling the trigger of a revolver pointing directly at the head of his father who has just beaten his mother. These only two scenes of Doss in violence, with brother (unintentional) and father (intentional) respectively, serve to underline his pacifist conviction. Hugo Weaving is excellent in his depiction of the father, especially in a later scene that I'll elaborate.<br/><br/>The romance sequence looks like it could have come from a different movie, retro, tender, squeaky clean. And yet Teresa Palmer brings to nurse Dorothy Schutte, a role that provides not much more than a traditional love interest, something extra. If you have seen her in ""I am Number Four"" (2011), a futuristic Sci Fi in which she plays ""Number 6"", the super-cool, lethal, effective heroine, you will recognize here a trace of that undaunted spirit.<br/><br/>The training segment, as mentioned, starts with an unreserved comic sequence. Instrumental to this is the training officer Sgt Howell, played by Vince Vaughn, whose range goes from blood-chilling Norman Bates (the unfortunate remake of ""Psycho"" in 1998) to a slew of hilarious comedies such as ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). However, there is more to the familiar persona of the gruff sergeant. His immediate and apparently casual assignment of nicknames to the soldiers has a subtle effect on bonding and morale. An additional layer, for the movie, is to enhance audience recognition and empathy with the group of individuals surrounding the protagonist.<br/><br/>Again as mentioned, what follows is swift gear-shifting. Upon adhering steadfastly to his Conscientious Objector and Seventh-day Adventist principles to the extreme of refusing to touch a rifle, Doss finds himself descending into the hell of an outcast, harassed, beaten, and finally facing court martial. Unexpected rescue comes from the estranged father who humbles himself in seeking help from a WW I superior who has since risen to high places in the army. Weaving's portrayal of the added dimension of the tormented but still loving father is absolutely remarkable.<br/><br/>On to Hacksaw Ridge, a 400-foot escarpment providing a Japanese stronghold on Okinawa. There is really not much to be said about this key segment of the movie. I have mentioned the gore and carnage which, although hard to stomach, recreates the grim reality of the battlefield better than any I have seen before. Anchoring this segment is the solid performance of Sam Worthington playing the veteran Captain Glover. Needless to say, centre to all these is Doss's miraculous feat of rescuing 75 wounded soldiers, lowering them one by one down the 400-foot cliff amidst Japanese bullets wheezing dangerously past their heads. By this time, Andrew Garfield has also completely convinced the audience how good an actor he is.<br/><br/>This movie concludes with clips from a live interview of Doss in 2006, a year before his death at 83. He speaks with alert clarity recounting a scene we witnessed recreated in the movie: how after he washed the blood clogging at a wounded soldier's eyes, the latter exclaimed in jubilation ""I can see! I though I've been blinded"". ""That moment"", said Doss, ""Makes everything worthwhile""."
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","8","9 November 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Hacksaw Ridge
","Having read feedback from other critics and having seen bits and pieces of The Passion of the Christ, I knew Mel Gibson was going to make a bloodily violent war film with 2016's Hacksaw Ridge (my latest review). I was right. Mel puts the ""hack"" in ""Hacksaw"" with men-at-arms having their limbs severed, their heads dismembered, and their fragile bodies being pierced by razor sharp bayonets. When Gibson perpetrates violence, it's to glorify, to sensationalize, to make you turn away in disgust. Oh and did I mention he includes several sequences of rats nibbling on decomposed body parts. Eek!<br/><br/>Anyway, his Hacksaw Ridge at two hours and 18 minutes, is kinda like his own starring vehicle, We Were Soldiers. Its got that earned R rating but without all the harsh language and disrespect between Battalion members. This film is split up into two halves. The first half is part Lifetime movie and part boot camp symposium. The second half is more akin to Windtalkers or Rambo. Mel Gibson with a standard canvas and minimal technical efficiency, gives us an unsettled action film that at times, tries to desensitize ""Hacksaw's"" true story of real-life WWII medic, Desmond Doss (played by a likable lead in Andrew Garfield). In the end, the whole thing seems to work anyway. That's thanks to closing credit interviews involving the actual Doss and his actual Captain known as Glover (played by Sam Worthington). Other thanks goes to screenwriter Andrew Knight for including the invigorating line, ""lord, help me get one more"". ""Help me get one more!""<br/><br/>Now Gibson fresh from starring in this year's Blood Father, becomes a more improved Peter Berg here (remember Deepwater Horizon?). No stilted camera work, less military numbness, and a little more genuine emotion. Hear, hear! And despite a miscast Vince Vaughn (he plays a soldier fighting in the Battle of Okinawa) and war clichés like the mean drill Sergeant, the picture of some GI's girlfriend/wife tucked away, and the notion of boot camp enemies becoming best buds later on, ""Hacksaw"" is still worth a recommendation.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge's story, which spans a decade between Desmond's childhood till his being drafted by the U.S. Army in 1942, is about pacifism, the notion of going into battle without carrying so much as a single weapon. Desmond Doss possesses this trait and his Army brethren try to get him kicked out before all are shipped to the islands of Japan (via World War II). Doss eventually saves over 75 infantrymen in battle and is awarded the first Medal of Honor as a conscientious objector (someone who refuses the aspect of performing military service).<br/><br/>All in all, the scenes of Desmond's rescue methods are Gibson's high point as a filmmaker. He depicts them as tunnel lights in the face of morbid brutality. As an audience member, you feel elated and exultant despite being turned off by his slight grandstanding of blood and guts. Therefore, I feel you should definitely see Hacksaw Ridge. It's a popcorn, combat relic that might be too commercial to sway the Academy. No matter. It manages to get a three star rating from me."
"mukava991","Null","0","5","6 November 2016"," good, grueling Gibson
","Mel Gibson makes the same film over and over. Nothing wrong with that as long as each successive mix of his favorite ingredients (brutish violence, morality, vengeance for wrongdoing, exhausting feats of endurance – all seasoned with humor) –adds depth to what we have already experienced. With ""Hacksaw Ridge"" Gibson sheds the more cartoonish excesses of his previous blockbuster, ""Apocalypto,"" and manages to hold our hearts and minds for more than two grueling hours. Perhaps the last ten years of his public excoriation have taught him something pertinent to his art.<br/><br/>This true story of a conscientious objector (7th Day Adventist variety) who as an unarmed medic saved a staggering number of lives while under fire on the island of Okinawa in the closing days of World War Two is just as brutal as other Gibson epics and also contains a compensatory number of tender and quiet moments between parents, siblings and lovers on the home front. The pattern of ""Hacksaw"" is set early in the main character's childhood during one of those typical Gibsonian horseplay sequences when the hero-to-be nearly kills his brother by slamming a rock against his skull during a roughhousing episode. The shock of what he has almost done shakes him to his core and contributes to his understanding of the fragility of human life and his conviction that killing is a primary evil. His ordeal begins in basic training when his fellow soldiers ridicule, taunt and even assault the rather scrawny fellow who carries a Bible and refuses to even touch a gun. One by one they realize what an extraordinary human being is in their midst as his strength of character and valor are revealed by degrees through basic training, near-court martial and eventually to the shattering test of battle.<br/><br/>His relationship with his father (Hugo Weaving), an emotionally damaged, alcoholic World War One veteran, expands the story's perspective, setting the son's experience in a larger context of how each generation has to come to terms with war - that ugly primal fact of civilization.<br/><br/>Some negatives: Although the movie's opening seems off-puttingly reminiscent of the sentimental 70's TV series ""The Waltons,"" it goes its own way soon enough. One line you could anticipate: Son, commenting on the father's nastiness: ""Why does he hate me?"" Mother: ""He doesn't hate you, he hates himself – sometimes."" Or this unlikely line: Sergeant, after soldiers have arrived on the smoldering shores of Okinawa: ""We're not in Kansas any more, Dorothy."" (Was that line really common jargon so soon after ""The Wizard of Oz""s initial theatrical release? Didn't it really catch on later after the Baby Boom generation embraced the film on TV?) The netting of thick rope that enables Doss's company of soldiers to climb up and down the titular ridge somehow remains intact from day to day despite fierce and stubborn Japanese resistance. What prevented the Japanese from destroying this means of access during lulls in fighting?<br/><br/>A note on gore, which ""Hacksaw"" displays dozens of times: Global popular culture has become so saturated with images of dismemberment, death and decay that the only way an audience nowadays can be jolted by the sight of rats gnawing on blackened corpses or a pile of guts lying where there was previously a torso is when the editing introduces them by surprise, perhaps with a synthesizer blast as accompaniment. As with most extended battle sequences in movies, the explosions and blood spouts become a tedious blur and come to life only when the focus narrows to an individual or two making their way through the pandemonium. One of the more effective of such points in ""Hacksaw"" is when Doss conceals a wounded soldier by covering his head with dirt and all we see is a naked blue eye staring out in terror and wonderment at the passing thud of Japanese boots.<br/><br/>There are so many excellent performances by charismatic actors that it's hard to single one out over others. Teresa Palmer shines as Doss's wife; Vince Vaughn is very entertaining as the borderline sadistic wisecracking sergeant, who like a whole succession of characters slowly succumbs to the radiating power of Doss's singular faith. Several blond actors who play Doss's fellow soldiers give effective performances but after the movie ends it's hard to recall one from another.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield as Doss just happens to be on screen most often and is definitely the center of the experience. He looks a bit like the young Richard Benjamin and as many have said, also resembles young Anthony Perkins, particularly Perkins as the Quaker Civil War soldier in ""Friendly Persuasion,"" another movie about a pacifist caught in war.<br/><br/>Most of all ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is about the triumph of an underdog, courage, love, faith, human potential (from frailty and baseness to redemption and forgiveness) and how they are intertwined. And all of these themes are touchingly tied up at the end in a way I will not discuss here."
