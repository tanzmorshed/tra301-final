","I have utmost respect for Wan. To my knowledge, he and his buddies were right out of film school. Instead of slowly building status by making mediocre films, he showed the world right from the get-go that he had something to prove.<br/><br/>Along with Silence Of The Lambs, Saw is the only horror movie that truly chills me. You see, I am not easily frightened by gratuitous bloodshed and screams that you might see in films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The plot has to be coherent, and there can't be anything ridiculous like a monster. Saw evokes strong emotions of terror and fear, all the while remaining plausible. Well, the story is actually unlikely, but everything in the film is physically possible.<br/><br/>The scenes that are meant to be frightening don't require things that jump out at you every two seconds, or cheesy orchestral flailings. The situation is what frightens you, not the presentation. Saw does have some second-rate acting, but then again it is a low-budget film and I suppose they couldn't exactly afford Robert De Niro. The script is not fantastic, but one true redeeming quality of the whole film is the story. It is dense, complex, but so captivating. I can only think of a few mystery plot lines that can even compare to this one. The Usual Suspects is probably up there, but Saw stands alone.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film who appreciate good stories, and aren't easily scared by the garbage you see in theaters like House Of Wax. For people who get squeamish, steer clear of this film. It is very nice graphic, and very sadistic at times. A brilliant debut, and a terrifying ride. 9/10."
"Superunknovvn","7","182","243","6 March 2005"," The best thriller in years
","Since ""Nattevagten"" I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as ""Saw"". Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With ""Saw"" James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Think you're hard-boiled? Think again and watch ""Saw"", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.<br/><br/>""Saw"" has been advertised as the new ""Se7en"" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, ""Saw"" does a much better job at actually being creepy. Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being, ""Saw"" does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure, the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart, outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans, but hey, ""Se7en"" and ""Silence Of The Lambs"" didn't care too much about realism, either, did they?<br/><br/>""Saw"" does have some flaws. Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters' lines are a bit clichéd. However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I've been surprised by a movie's final twist, but ""Saw"" has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since ""Cube"". I'm really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell's career develops after this fine sleeper."
"MaxBorg89","9","64","81","3 November 2008"," The game begins
","Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it's a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.<br/><br/>According to the film's notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.<br/><br/>The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn't really kill anyone, but ""plays a game"" with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man's hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that's Jigsaw's perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.<br/><br/>Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell's eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clichés and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw's philosophical undertones aren't entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what's going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie's more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don't come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the intelligence behind the film's structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell's desperation is conveyed with an intensity that's almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the ""too old for this sh*t"" gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it's the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie."

","Wow. The critics weren't wrong. Not since seven has horror been portrayed so majestically. <br/><br/>From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly. Just like 'Se7en', the all-round Grittiness that director James Wan creates disgusts and enthralls. Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle. <br/><br/>A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won't be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry! <br/><br/>I still can't sleep. <br/><br/>It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel.

","Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere the moment it starts, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that it has one of the best twists seen in any horror movie.<br/><br/>I watched this film alone at night with the lights off, expecting to be freaked out by it since I thought it was just another typical horror movie; but instead I was completely intrigued by the story line, and utterly drawn into the film for the whole 100 minutes. At the end I did not feel scared, rather, I felt something very few horror movies have to offer: satisfaction! This movie left me in a slightly disturbed but very thoughtful state. It did not give me nightmares, rather, it plagued my day-dreams; for two days my thoughts could not stray far from this film, that's how powerful it is.<br/><br/>If you want a cringingly gory and violent horror movie, watch ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Hostel""; if you want a nightmarishly scary horror movie, watch ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring""; if you want a clever and disturbing horror movie with an excellent story and a great twist, watch ""Saw""."

","Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat.

"dee.reid","8","79","112","11 June 2005"," I +Saw+ it last night
","""Saw,"" a film that was originally planned for a straight-to-video release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings, was finally given the green light in October 2004 - just in time for Halloween. ""Saw"" contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve, then doubles-back on itself three-fourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see why this almost hit the straight-to-video fodder list. I mean, people will closely observe that it obviously contains the traits of its successors, namely ""Seven"" (1995), and that may be all the ammunition the haters will need to trash it. Already, I see that the IMDb voters have averaged ""Saw"" a 7.5, with those people who have rated it with an ""8"" or a ""10"" being neck-and-neck at the polls.<br/><br/>But I begin with reassurances that ""Saw"" is a genius thriller, if not entirely original or daring. The film does its best to exploit the claustrophobia and mounting tension that collects as it progresses. ""Saw"" will also make you think twice about bladed objects as well.<br/><br/>Ironically, the title has very little to do with plot, as there is no chainsaw-wielding maniac on the loose as the ghastly cover art of a severed foot would imply. The only saws here are the ones the two main characters Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell, also the film' screenwriter) have been given.<br/><br/>The two men awaken to find themselves chained to lead pipes in a decrepit public bathroom. In the middle of the floor, is a dead body that's surrounded in a pool of its own blood, with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. As it would turn out, they're the latest victims of a serial killer known as the ""Jigsaw Killer.""<br/><br/>Jigsaw has a nasty little way of torturing his victims by trapping them in a situation where they have to kill if they want to survive. As Lawrence explains, technically Jigsaw is not a killer, simply because he hasn't killed anyone; the victims do that for him. As one fortunate victim observes, who survived her ordeal, she is bound to a chair with a reversed bear trap-like device strapped to her head with pliers wired into her upper and lower jaws. A timer is on the device and if she does not locate a key before it runs out, her mouth will be ripped open and no more pretty face. In order to get out, she must open up the stomach of a dead man lying on the floor next her to get the key.<br/><br/>As Jigsaw ever so carefully points out to his victims, he doesn't just choose them at random. To him, they're all perfectly immoral individuals and he uses their immorality to set up horrific situations where the victim rarely survives the trap; in essence, life is its own reward because Jigsaw's victims don't value it, as he explains to the one young woman lucky enough to fight through his plan. Also on the case of Jigsaw, are two detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), who bring forth the news of Jigsaw's previous victims in one particularly gruesome flashback sequence.<br/><br/>Lawrence is pretty well aware of the case of Jigsaw, as even once he was considered a suspect by the police. As you would have it, Adam is not especially trustful of Lawrence being that he seems to know a lot and is not reporting many details to him. They realize, however, that if they are going to survive this nightmare, they're going to have to play into Jigsaw's game, observe the clues he's willing to give them, and ultimately make it out alive.<br/><br/>""Saw"" was directed admirably by James Wan and written by Whannell, who also makes an effective victim alongside Elwes. Elwes, a highly underrated actor, is given a chance to shine here, even though this really isn't an actor's movie, as it is more in the hands of the director. However, we do get a sense of the desperation of the two leads, who soon realize that they're not the only ones trapped in this madman's game.<br/><br/>""Saw"" does benefit from its moody atmosphere, which may cover up any of the film's shortcomings. Towards the end, it does lose pace a little bit as things seem to be spiraling down the haunted house route, but quickly regains momentum as it draws to a close. I know that despite its flaws, I was glued to the seat and really ""in"" the film's tight tension, which thankfully doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Is ""Saw"" a genre classic? Certainly. Is it a classic like ""Seven""? I don't know. There's a lot to consider when pondering a question with so much baggage like that one. I liked it, but I'm not so sure about the news that a sequel is in the works. This seems a lot like a stand-alone-type movie, that of which doesn't need to get bogged down by the weight of unnecessary sequels.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Okay, i have seen a lot of horror films. Saw was another one that i liked much. Saw 2,3,4...and so on were movies i disliked.

This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. The movie's got a decent budget for an indie horror (a little over a million, i think) but it's pretty small for a film that got such a big release.

"drownnnsoda","9","161","260","11 December 2004"," One of the Most Unique and Grisly Thrillers In Recent Memory.
","""Saw"" is one of the better horror films in recent memory. I suppose it's more of a thriller than horror, although it still is gory and serves well on a horrific level. It's sort of a cross between ""Se7en"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I'd say, and the film is pretty damn good. <br/><br/>""Saw"" opens with two men who wake up in a dilapidated public restroom with no memory of how or why they are where they are. Chained to the floor, they are both utterly confused and terrified. Together, they begin to piece together the memory of what happened to them as the serial killer, nicknamed Jigsaw threatens them and plays numerous mind games that lead up to their demise. Meanwhile, detectives and officials are on the trail of the brutal serial murderer, trying to save the men the entire time.<br/><br/>This is definitely a smart thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the bloody, limb-severing conclusion. The characters are extremely believable and the acting was great, including performances by Carey Elwes, Monica Potter, and Danny Glover. Everyone performed perfectly and were very believable to watch. The entire movie has a dark, damp setting, and is overloaded with intense scenes and lots of gore, that are sure to please any horror fan. On top of that, the cleverly-woven story is unique and underived. James Wan does an excellent job, especially considering this to be his first feature film. I can't wait to see some his future stuff.<br/><br/>Bottom line - ""Saw"" is a smart, grisly, unforgiving, all-around brutal horror movie that is unique and original. If you are looking for a horror movie a notch above your average slasher flick, I advise you see ""Saw"". 9/10."

","Finally a horror/thriller movie that has a plot and scary bits! Most go for the scare and have no plot, so when they aren't scary they suck! This one is good from either plot side or scare side. This movie is tops!! I've often thought about the awful things that killers could do to people, but usually just shot/stab them - this movie does some of those things! It really made me cringe in some parts and I could really ""feel"" how terrified the characters probably were cause of the great acting.<br/><br/>I just didn't see that ending coming, that just topped it all off. At one point i figured it was just going to end in the same old ""big fight with lots of blood"" scene but, WOW! that ending was the icing on the cake!

"nycritic","6","35","53","7 March 2005"," Takashi Miike and Giallo Films Channeled by way of David Fincher
","Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel sucker-punched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film, most notably SE7EN, with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic, depressing, bleak, and filled with a growing sense of stomach-turning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through, making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment, if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus, be set free.<br/><br/>The problem with SAW its in the script itself, with plot holes galore, and character motivations/reactions completely unclear. The two main characters undergo the suffering victims are meant to and do so down to the end, but the supporting characters fair poorly. Danny Glover's character goes through being a broken man through the death of his partner to being badly obsessed with the Jigsaw Killer, and not once could I believe he would do most of the things he does throughout the film, like not requesting backup as he enters a deserted warehouse (in a flashback sequence), or allowing a clearly wimpy killer to get the best of him later on. Monica Potter plays Cary Elwes' wife who witnesses the killer point a gun to her daughter's temple while listening to her frantic heartbeats, but when she gets the chance to give him his just desserts she fails to do so because she was on the phone with her imprisoned husband. (It was a ""Huh?"" moment where motherhood somehow didn't enter into the plot logic, but then again, not many did.)<br/><br/>Another thing which works against it is the fact that that for a genuinely interesting and even innovative premise like this one, SAW would be best as a film 20 - 30 minutes shorter with an equally shorter time span (the plot extends for an approximate five hours from start to climax), and then would the shocking twist at the end make some sense. As it is, it has the look and feel of a video game in which the menacing growl of a voice orders the victims through audio/videotape to commit a horrible and nearly impossible act in order to survive, with some rapid-fire MTV editing to add to the viewer's disorientation and Giallo overtones (which do work here if you think of Dario Argento's PROFONDO ROSSO or Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE). Here's hoping James Wan will make a much better film as he does have an overall good technique with his visuals."

You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie.(believe me, it's my domain)<br/><br/>3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy.

"malaclyptic","1","55","95","18 April 2005"," trying to unsee what i Saw (haw haw)
","There are some actors who are terrific no matter who's directing them. (Paul Bettany, Denzel Washington) There are others who are irredeemably awful in absolutely anything (Ryan O'Neal comes to mind). And then there are guys like Cary Elwes. He was dynamite in The Princess Bride, every bit as swashbuckling and fun to watch as Errol Flynn. He shines in ensemble pieces; equally convincing as the desperately manipulative Thomas H. Ince in Peter Bogdanovich's pathetically under-seen The Cat's Meow and as a fat, balding, prissy theater producer in Cradle Will Rock. Of course, it helps that all these are good movies, which the generic horror flick Saw is not.<br/><br/>Not that it doesn't try. It's got that grinding, industrial-metal soundtrack, to get us all edgy when the film itself cannot. It's got those hyper-motion quickcuts, the same kind used in the remake of Thirteen Ghosts, which at least knew how lame it was, and was thus easier to take, with tongue firmly in cheek. Perhaps using the gore factor (which there isn't much of; Shaun of the Dead was gorier than this) to patch up some gaping, 747-size holes in the plot, Saw cheerfully telegraphs the shock moments, using some halfway-clever plot twists that almost make sense at the time but on second thoughtwhat a mess.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the set-up: A kid named Adam (Leigh Whannell, who wrote the script) wakes up in a nasty old bathroom chained to a huge pipe in the wall. Opposite him is Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes), similarly chained and even more confused. Between them lay a dead man, his head apparently half-blown away, holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. It's all revealed to be the work of the ""Jigsaw Killer,"" who devises unique life-or-death scenarios for unsuspecting, flawed folk to work their way out of or die. (Set this in a giant, three-dimensional Rubik's Cube, and you have the much more intriguing Cube; set it in another unnamed city with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman hunting a deranged Bible-nut, you get Se7enWhannell has obviously seen and studied them both).<br/><br/>So Adam and Dr. Gordon are trapped together, for reasons that are calmly explained away in a series of flashbacks. The goal: Gordon must kill Adam with whatever implements are at hand or else his wife and daughter will buy the farm. And yes, in a toilet stall they find a couple of hacksaws.<br/><br/>Nothing is what it seems, of course, and I have to report that I saw the final denouement coming from the first twenty minutes. The enigmatic ""Jigsaw Killer"" is a lot like the alien race out to destroy humanity in Independence Day: faceless and just plain bad, bad, bad! Kevin Spacey's genuinely chilling John Doe from Se7en may have been a fairly one-note character, but at least we were given reasons for his psychosisand what's more, we believed them. Saw's killer is given a perfunctory motivation, but it all rings as off-key as the acting.<br/><br/>First-time director James Wan wastes Danny Glover as a cop obsessed with the case, and his demise is a complete let-down. He delivers some nice, gruesome moments, but since I saw (pun not really intended) them coming, they're not much more than Pavlovian audience buzzers. Judging by the general crowd reaction, Saw will get plenty of word of mouth help from the high school set, make a nice, tidy little profit, and since a sequel has already been announced, old Jigsaw will likely be around torturing people for no apparent reason for some time."
"tat2guy","4","98","179","23 January 2005"," Disappointing
","I have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things.<br/><br/>1. What I'll call the ""stupid victim syndrome"". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - shoot him please. If you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back - shoot him please.<br/><br/>2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract - making you squeeze your finger.<br/><br/>3. It's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not noticing that you aren't dead. Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier.<br/><br/>4. Technically, the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone, that is murder.<br/><br/>5. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.<br/><br/>Other than those things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good, and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund."

","(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) <br/><br/>Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.<br/><br/>Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.<br/><br/>Not even the gore could've saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.<br/><br/>Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.<br/><br/>The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.<br/><br/>I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don't watch this movie."

","Just when I thought ""Copycat"" and ""Nightwatch"" couldn't be ""topped"" in the serial-killer genre, comes this piece of garbage straight out of the pen of a cretin. Either that or he considers every potential viewer to be a cretin. This nonsense has so many gaping holes in logic that it looks like a filmic version of Swiss cheese, and has more far-fetchedness than I've seen in years. Stylish? Yes, but does that even begin to make up for a plot so ridiculous it could have been written by Ed Wood's nostril in a nano-second? It is rare that I so give up on a movie that I have to fast-forward certain scenes to get it over with. Check out the mind-bogglingly dumb ending: one of the dumbest in the history of ALL cinema.

"HalbNah","2","38","66","23 April 2005"," Poor
","So I just watched this movie (I won't even make the effort to use the obvious pun here), and I am scared. Scared of bad acting, bad editing, poor plot. Two guys wake up in a shitty bathroom, tied to opposite corners by chains, nothing on them but their clothes and some tools they might need to survive, but haven't figured out how to use yet. In the beginning, I instantly thought of a CUBE-like setup, and was really looking forward to seeing it. But, as the story evolved more and more, I realised there was not much to it. A big chunk of this movie is told in flashbacks, to somehow ""justify"" why the two guys ended up there, how they are connected, and why the killer is acting the way he is (although, in the long run, I still can't quite explain why you have to kill people to show them how cool life is. Or why it makes you that insane and brilliant at the same time so that you have nothing better to do than set up strange traps that make people kill themselves, or why you start to enjoy watching your masterpiece of psychological torture-cabinet lying on the bathroom floor with your eyes closed, pretending to be dead. Ah, right, for the *surprise* ending. I forgot.) Everything is thought-out halfway, but that's where it ends. I mean, the story has potential, it could've made a really great movie, but they just ruined it to give them a platform to show off. ""Huh, yeah, see what I can do. I can use speed-up pictures and ultra-shaky camera. I bet you never saw this before, right?"" Right, right. Never. So, the standard tools to make a movie look young and fresh, again. What else do we need for a nice horror/slasher movie? Right, cliché! Lots of it. And the main thing that really makes me mad is this ""Stupid Victim"" Syndrome. ""Hmmm. This guy just wanted to kill me, but now I have the gun...what should I do? Yeah, talk to my husband on the phone instead of shooting him (at least in the legs)."" Seriously, this scares the hell out of me. Can't ANYBODY please write a script that has ""normal-acting"" victims in it? Like, shooting the guy? Sorry, but this was a quite boring movie with bad acting and a poor script (though the idea was great). Yeah, poor. That sums it up quite well."
"jlnuvi","3","42","74","22 October 2005"," Unlikelihoods
","The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous unlikelihood: can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room? It has not sense at all except to be the final (d)effect of the movie. The killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the male nurse) but not the floor of the white room. The director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden. Then, the film would be a quite good thriller. However, 'Saw' is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back."

Saw is known for its incredible ending twist that no one saw coming and it blew all the audiences away. Aside from that the great characters, the acting and dialog is a little lackluster between the two leading men, Dr. Gordon and Adam. The writing, well thought out story and death trap scenes really put Saw over the top and being worthy of a great horror film.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","17","27","15 January 2006"," Silly beyond belief (spoilers throughout)
","Saw is a film I was rooting for. It had the potential to be a grubby, nasty, eyesore of a film. But while it had gore and sadism in spades, it also had horrible acting, a terrible script and forgettable characters. Not even a man hacking off his own foot could make me overlook the tripe.<br/><br/>Well, having said that, Cary Elwes hacking off his own foot did help somewhat, but the scene, rather than being traumatic, was a laugh riot. You have hysterical direction (you quickly cut from screaming man to screaming man  close-ups of screaming men, especially when you quickly go from one to another, for some reason, always cracks me up), camp acting from Elwes (throughout the film he chews the scenery, but here he chews on his shirt) and cut around the scene is a hilarious car chase between Danny Glover and the red herring bloke. The cumulative effect is mucho laughter.<br/><br/>The car chase, though, I think, of all of the funny things in the film, was the funniest. It was possibly the most low-rent thing I've seen in recent cinema. And although I acknowledge the fact that the filmmakers were working on a paltry budget, it still doesn't make it any less funny when you film grown-men pretending to drive stationary cars that are not so carefully given life by a bit of smoke and jittery camera-work and editing. Rear-projection would have looked a million times more convincing.<br/><br/>Another budgetary giveaway was the car park that looked like it was filmed in a barn and which contained about five cars. I know you're meant to suspend your disbelief, and if the film were good I'd be able to do that, but when your film is ridiculous, it's just another nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>But sniping aside, I do appreciate what the filmmakers have done with so little money. Although visually a rip-off of Seven, it does look good and most of the effects are pretty decent. However, I just wish they would have spent a bit more money on the script and cast someone (anyone) else in Elwes' role.<br/><br/>Elwes is an actor who can get by just as long as he's not required to emote  he can just about have a normal conversation. But once he's got to express anger or sadness or love, he's out of his depth. And so it is in Saw, sometimes with spectacular results.<br/><br/>My favourite Elwes moment is when he recognises Zep (the red herring) in a photo and starts shouting like the man is alive inside it. Yes, if you shout loud enough the person in the photo WILL hear. (That's true.) But there's also the bit where the phone rings. He thinks it's Zep, so he shouts at the phone with camp venom. But it's his wife, so on a sixpence he changes into a doe-eyed husband, quivering with love and affection. Neither extreme is expressed in a believable way. But it doesn't help that Elwes has a weird thing he does with his voice. When he shouts he tries to boom like Brian Blessed, but when he expresses sadness or regret he talks in a child-like voice, almost like Joe Pasquale. It's a tad odd. And it makes his shooting of Adam bloody hysterical. ""You have to die. I'm sowwy. My family."" <br/><br/>But Danny Glover is almost as bad. He goes metal when his partner gets killed by the fiendish Jigsaw Killer and tries to apprehend him on his own. But Danny Glover's portrayal of madness only extends to lots of incomprehensible shouting  there's a brilliant bit where he runs out of bullets and charges the armed Zep while shouting ""Aaaaaaarrrggghhh!!"" But he does it again after the fight and as he runs out of the apartment to continue his pursuit. ""Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!"" And of course you then cut to the car chase and the foot cutting, which makes the film so overripe in tone that the only result can be hilarity.<br/><br/>But that's kind of a shame, as the first half is pretty promising. I especially love the ingenious traps. My favourite is the razor wire. Suicidal man rips himself to shreds? Magnificent! And the scene where the woman had to stab the man and root through his guts had me cackling with delight. But I do have to admit that neither sequence disturbed me as it should. Indeed, they both made me laugh. And this is purely because of how they were filmed. Large parts were speeded up to capture the frenzied emotions of the characters, but it's a technique that always gives me the giggles. It's just so over the top and hysterical, that rather than unsettle me, it distances me from the grisly proceedings and makes me enjoy them in a way I'm sure the filmmakers didn't intend.<br/><br/>And that goes for the whole film. I enjoyed it, but not in the intended way. I was laughing at the camp acting, jumping up and down with glee as men got torn to shreds in wire and rolling about when things went crazy at the end  Adam has a lot of fire in his belly for someone who just got shot.<br/><br/>And the villain also garnered laughs. He dressed like a goth (dig that robe and those gloves), moaned like a goth and hated the world like a goth. In fact, he probably was one. Wah-wah, I have cancer. Wah-wah, people don't appreciate their lives. Wah-wah, woe is me. I know most serial killers in films have BS reasons to justify their rampages, but this man made a fine art of it. And he sure was nimble for a cancer patientand could keep still for long periods of timeand was remarkably indestructible. Ah, but why apply logic to a film this silly? Just open your arms and let the shower of crap wash over you."

","Unfortunately, the lowest I can go on the rating scale is a 1. Never have I seen a movie with such a GREAT premise and promising directing lose so much because of the acting. Carey Elwes was extremely disappointing for such a seasoned actor. I mean this was suppose to be a scary movie and I couldn't help but laugh at the over dramatized way Elwes told Wannell he would send help to get him. Wannell's work wasn't nearly as bad and he's a newcomer. <br/><br/>Overall, this could have been a great movie given some better actors, major script adjustment and WAY more than 18 days to shoot. <br/><br/>I mean give me a break!!! You've got two guys chained at the ankle on either side of what appears to be a bathroom and a (supposedly) dead guy in the middle of the floor and you're telling me that neither of them, one being a doctor, notice that he's breathing?!?!?!?

","To cut straight to the point, Saw is an original and refreshing horror movie. It's premise - where people are put in potentially fatal situations by a twisted psychopath in order to appreciate their lives if they survive - is an interesting one. The psychopath in question, the 'Jigsaw' killer, is a good creation. His puppet-messenger is truly disturbing (especially if you were scared of ventriloquists dummies when you were younger), and there are moments in the film of real tension. For a first film, hats must go off to the two young writers, one of whom stars in (Leigh Whannell) and the other who directs the film (James Wan).<br/><br/>The film could have been a superb horror flick, but it really is let down by some appalling acting. And the main culprits should be ashamed: step forward Mr Glover and Mr Elwes. These guys have been around, yet they turn in performances worthy of teenage drama classes only. Bad drama classes. Cary Elwes especially is abysmal. His performance elicited laugh-out-loud moments from the audience from people like me who could not believe that this guy does this for a living. It is so unfortunate that much of the film's final act hinges on Elwes, because instead of sending us reeling and shocked form what is undoubtedly a fine twist at Saw's end, we only emerge ruefully chuckling to ourselves and wondering just how good this movie might have been if an actor of any kind of ability had replaced Elwes.<br/><br/>If you like your horror fresh, twisted and dark, see Saw. Just prepare yourself to feel a little blunted by it's performers.<br/><br/>Rating ** and a half (out of five)"
"kylekool150","8","5","6","12 April 2007"," Thin Plotting, Heavy Execution.
","To start off, I'm not too joyous about the streaming abrogating responses this film has received. So it's not the best horror film of the year, big deal. Personally I'd say this film differs from many other Hollywood blockbuster big budget or low budget horror flicks out there. It's a grueling and disgusting film in the eyes of the average viewer, but to some one else, you can see how these petty criminals portrayed in the film cleverly and affectingly pull together a wicked trap or two. The sadistic torture in the film is straight to the core and doesn't resist. This is very charming, in a lurid way. <br/><br/>The pacing in the film immediately picks up, as we get to know two of the main characters in the film. Not a whole load of character study here, more explanations and reasons, this makes way for the weak plot that needs some comeuppance. Many plots have been done in this cosmopolitan way, but not many knew where to go from here. This film doesn't just feature irritating scenes of brutal torture, tacky characters and forced on writing, instead they tried something different with the formula they are strained to bond with. To give simple yet justified examples of how realistic and original the forms of torture are in this film, I don't mean how gory they are. I mean how powerful and intriguing they are. Some mysterious and some you catch on too easily. For example, one man, gets his energy in a sickening way, pretending to shoot a person with a gun, so he can hear her heart beat. Sounds a little basic, but when you think about it, all serial killers need is to hear your screams, and that gives them enough pulse. <br/><br/>You may retract at some of the violent scenes you'll experience throughout the coarse of this film, but it'll pass. Nothing to gruesome. You'll notice, most of the characters are very energetic, and come to life on the big screen. This is produced not only by the dignified roles, but surprisingly by the actors too. Nothing is exploited for more than it is in this film, everything is too the highest quality and purity. I guarantee it's very suspenseful and will shock and befuddle you at times, with enough pulse pounding axiomatic thrills to satisfy. <br/><br/>Overall, originality and regenerated execution is key here.<br/><br/>2.5 of 4 Stars"
"mto123","1","36","65","2 July 2005"," a trite cliché with delusions of grandeur
","SEVEN (or ""se7en"", whatever) was a really good film. The killer (Kevin Spacey) was presented in such a way as to challenge us, the audience, about what we really believed about the nature of good and evil, and the status of those concepts in our current society. His madness was affective (with an ""a"") because of the degree of method it involved. He was a smart guy who had really thought about what he was doing and honestly believed that he was right. That we could ~almost~ (that's the key) identify with him, made him all the scarier, and all the more thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Unlike seven, SAW is pure fluff. This movie has nothing of consequence to say about anything. It has pretensions of being in a similar vein as SEVEN, but any similarities between the two movies exist only at the most superficial level. It's like writing a harlequin romance in iambic pentameter and comparing it to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie has all the typical elements of a provocative psychological thriller, but without any unifying principle to legitimate them. There are plenty of bizarre murders and plot twists, but in the end the only point behind any of it is gratuitous shock value. (Picture the filmmakers prodding you in the arm, saying ""That was some pretty messed up sh*t, huh!?!?"") I especially disliked the murder sequences that looked and sounded like Nine Inch Nails videos. It's works for about 2 1/2 seconds, at which point you ask yourself ""what exactly is the point here anyway?"".<br/><br/>Unlike Spacey's character in SEVEN, the serial killer in SAW is just some old guy who's angry at the world because he's dying of cancer. Thus he decides to punish people he feels are taking their healthy lives for granted, by coming up with twisted ""games"" in which they're forced to kill or mutilate themselves or others to remain alive, the ""lesson"" supposedly being that one should value one's own life over everything else, including the lives of others. In my opinion, this is a shallow nihilistic philosophy that's about as ""profound"" as Nazism. Overall, SAW is a pointless exploitation flick that is nowhere nearly as interesting as it pretends to be.<br/><br/>I have to admit that it's not entirely without craft (I have seen worse movies - WAY worse, in fact), but the end result I found to be primarily irritating for the simple reason that SAW DOES NOT DELIVER THE GOODS. If it didn't promise them in the first place, this would be okay, (I probably would have given it 5 or 6 stars), but as I have been arguing, that is not the case. I could overlook the plot holes and hackneyed genre conventions if the movie professed to be frivolous entertainment and nothing more. But it doesn't! It tries to pass itself off as a truly disturbing and ""serious"" film. If this is the criteria by which SAW is to be judged, it fails, miserably."

Then the killers are met by sterner justice from the parents who lived in the last house on the left.

And to top it all off to boot, Craven had a social commentary to add to the already intense storyline.<br/><br/>This film was a lot like ""Last House..."" with the exception of the moral at the end. this film was a plain, scare the pants off ya, turn the lights on in the middle of the night, scream out loud till ya barf twice go crazy, deadbolt your doors, pray you die early type of scare film. Two men are locked in a sewage room and must try to kill one another in order to be free. Other characters and lot twist are added along the way. But the film is executed unnervingly! <br/><br/>Elwes and the other dude were really great in their roles.

","Whenever I write a review my conscience tells me to think of all the talented people who put so much time and effort into their project. ""Be fair"" I hear it say. On the other hand, thinking of the readers of these reviews, there are times when a dose of brutal honesty is the only option.<br/><br/>Director James Wan and actor Leigh Wannell co-wrote Saw, therefore they have to accept the burden of culpability for what I can only describe as one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is quite remarkable considering that the opening denouement promises so much as we find Mr Wannell waking up to a living nightmare. He and fellow actor Cary Elwes find themselves chained by the ankles on either side of what can only be described as the bathroom from Hell with what is presumably a dead body between them. The only clean object is a clock on the wall. Ticking. We look forward to a psychological drama...<br/><br/>...what we get instead is a convoluted story centred on a character known as Jigsaw, a sadistic evildoer who gives his victims the chance of life if they are willing to sacrifice others. This is explained to us via flashbacks... lots of flashbacks. This gives us the opportunity to see Ken Leung as Detective Sing and his partner Danny Glover as Detective Tapp in a double act straight from the Lethal Weapon school of acting - which is actually remarkably good compared with our two leads trapped in the bathroom who are gradually running through every emotional gamut in an effort to convince us of... What? Well, this is where the problem lies. We have spent one fifth of the running time trying to establish characters, plot, development, direction. We have nothing. Mr Elwes, playing the part of a surgeon and Mr Wannell as a down-at-heel photographer have both tried tension-breaking comedic, breaking-down emotional and shouty. We shall leave them for a while as they bond, fall out, solve clues, fail miserably to escape before their deadline etc. Meanwhile we can continue with the flashbacks and find out just how easy it is for our two inept detectives to bond, solve clues and go after the homicidal maniac all on their own...<br/><br/>Oh by the way, did I mention Zep, the rather sinister hospital orderly, or John, Dr. Gordon's patient with an inoperable frontal lobe tumour. How about the good doctor's wife Alison and daughter Diana? Well they all pop up in the inevitable flashbacks. Eventually everybody, doctor,wife, daughter, policeman who is still alive, photographer, patient, extremely patient reviewer get together in a Grand Guignol finish... Oh sorry - you want me to save one-hundred minutes of your life? Here goes. Doctor has to kill photographer by six o'clock in order to save his wife and daughter who are being held by orderly who has been poisoned by maniac who will only give him antidote if he kills doctor's wife and daughter. Detective, who went insane after maniac killed his partner, is paying photographer to follow doctor who he thinks is maniac. Orderly fails to follow through due to not tying doctor's wife properly, detective arrives, fights orderly, speeded-up car chase a la Keystone Kops - no idea why. Both end up in the sewers, detective dies. Doctor loses concentration, realises it is now gone six. saws through his own ankle, shoots photographer but fails to kill him. Drags himself out of bathroom. Reviewer loses concentration. What we thought was a dead body in the bathroom turns out to be patient John aka Jigsaw who gets up and kindly tells photographer that key to padlock is in bath - same bath that photographer emptied of water at beginning of film thus leaving him trapped there. John/Jigsaw leaves.<br/><br/>To sum up: a film with sadistic overtones, poor acting, what we can only presume to be an unfinished script, ludicrous plot and loose ends inevitably leading to sequels which, fortunately for all of us I shall not be either viewing or reviewing.<br/><br/>Whilst IMDb offer no clues as to the ages of reviewers I feel fairly confident in declaring that most of the people who give this film a vote of seven or more would be below thirty.

","The current rating for this horror film indicates it is one of the greatest of all time. Give me a break! It's not even close. Unless you are VERY forgiving of glaring plot holes, bad acting, annoying dialogue, ""trendy"" rapid fire MTV-style editing, lame ""edgy"" industrial music soundtracks and a pathetic ""moral"" justification for murder delivered by a psycho obviously copied from Kevin Spacey's Se7en character, then you might be amongst the people who think this is something special. But if you're like me and take a more analytical approach to these thrillers, this thing simply falls apart at the seams and leads up to a surprise twist so implausible and unbelievable it must be seen to be believed. Not only this, but the film refuses to stay in one place for long. It jumps from the main story (leads Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell chained up in a bathroom and trying to figure a way to escape) about five times too many to maintain the suspense. We get to see bits and pieces of the police investigation and the killer terrorizing the wife and daughter of Elwes' doctor character. Said wife acts like a complete and utter moron even after the killer sticks a gun in her daughters face.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie.

"TheEverymansArtist","1","20","35","16 January 2005"," This movie was absolute crap on a stick.
","Well, to be honest I have seen worse movies.....but not many. I was ""fortunate"" enough to see this movie at it's Las Vegas sneak peek a week before it opened. Needless to say I did my best to forget it, but after seeing a sign for ""Saw"" at the local dollar-movie-theater my friends and I began to joke with my friends in the car about the wretchedness that simply was this film. An interesting concept, at first glance, but in retrospect there are a lot of films about serial killers that a far better than this and the only thing that is interesting about the idea is that this murderer is just a little more artsy and creative. Once you get past the acting of Leigh Whannell the first five minutes minutes aren't bad, but then it's all down hill from there. From the cheap hypertension/pop out scares to the cookie cutter chase scenes, this movie blows.......hard. Typically I enjoy Danny Glover and he has given many worthwhile performances. He was definitely the best part of this film, but he was phoning the whole thing in......logically that can tell you what the rest of the movie was like. Whannell is completely awful throughout and made my nuts hurt, just watching him attempt to act. Typically when someone hears you make such a critique they say, ""Oh yeah, like you could do better?"" Well, in this case I would have to say, ""Yes."" Cary Elwes, who I also typically love, is so bad in the last scene of the film that I began to question whether or not it was SUPPOSED to be funny. The acting was certainly as bad as the directing and script. If I do have one good thing to say about this steaming pile of monkey shirt, it's that all parts are equally terrible. How anyone could put this movie in the same class as Se7en or any of the Carpenter, Craven, Hooper, and Barker films is beyond be. This film is pure excrement. When this comes out on DVD (which will probably be in a month) save the two hrs it takes to watch and teach a k under privileged kid how to read.

","I saw this film in seventh grade. And liked it. i even brought myself to comparing it to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" at one point. How? i don't know. I thought of it in such a way i even showed it to one of my friends about two months later and told him it was better than Dawn of the Dead. For this i should be tarred and feathered. BUT, upon this second viewing, i started to notice things. Things that I didn't notice the first time. That viewing took me to a place i have only been to on two other occasions, but I won't get into that now. I'll just say that when the movie was over i had to apologize to my friend for lying and rethink this movie over and over.<br/><br/>The first aspect of this movie i hated was the editing. Are we watching MTV or what? i beg one of you readers to count how long the longest shot in one of the escape scenes is. You won't touch 4 seconds. Maybe 3. Perhaps the tension would build a little bit if the camera relaxed and waited for a human being who is not on speed to catch up with it. At least that way we know what we're afraid of instead of picturing the 1/100 second flashes of the ""scary things"".<br/><br/>The acting was atrocious and not in a charming horror movie way. The second leading man can't do a thing to cover up a British accent and Cary Elwes gave one of the worst performances in cinematic history. Why would the casting department hie a man who can't give a cry of pain to save himself from a real cry of pain. And Danny Glover? Does anything even need to be said? YES! What a bad role for even an ""only good in one movie(Tenenbaums)"" actor. We see know descent into madness. This is most likely because of the poor and pathetic writing or the sub-par performance given for a sub-par movie.Come to think of it, I can't think of one actor in this movie who I'd like to see in anything else unless they were playing a struggling and out of work actor. Ironic?<br/><br/>Now for the development flaws. I'll start with the obvious one. how can it be that two healthy men can sit in a room for hours with a dead man WHO IS BREATHING? Do they expect us to buy that? An idiot maybe(Which isn't saying much for Saw fans). Not to mention that they spent a good amount of time near the beginning of the film focusing directly on ""the dead man"". Next, the killer's whole ""philosophy"" about how he doesn't actually kill people, he causes people to kill themselves. What? My metaphor is that if you put a landmine in the front yard of a day-care center and wait for recess, you didn't do anything wrong. It's the kid's fault they walked onto the landmine that you put there. Who honestly thinks this makes sense? Be honest. Also, this killer claims to give everyone a chance to get out of his traps. But Dr. Gordon has to kill Adam in order to get out and save his family. This gives Adam what kind of chance? On the tape, never does our killer mention a way for Adam to be saved. This goes against his whole philosophy. The flashback in which the girl is let free: There are numerous things that bother me about this sequence. For one, the principle that i applied to the Adam situation applies to the drugged stranger laying on the floor with his stomach cut open. Also, the cancer-ridden killer is somehow able to rig up a ""creepy"" doll to ride a tricycle and turn its head? That's just unrealistic for lack of a better word. Last but certainly not least, she later says that he helped her. Why? Because he got her off drugs? I know about drug-addicts and an experience like that would not want to make them do less drugs. And this helps her better than, say, rehab? Also, if this helping principle is applied to every case, how does it apply to Dr. Gordon and Adam's situation. Will killing a virtually innocent human being help a man with his infidelity problems? Cheating on your wife is not nearly as bad as killing a man. Apparently, I disagree with the killer. Too bad. <br/><br/>What was Adam's wrong-doing in the first place?<br/><br/>Why would a man who is just an orderly at a hospital who appears to be the killer at first, but soon is rectified take pleasure in tying up a mother and daughter at gunpoint? Not only does he do that, but he listens to the girls heartbeat as he points the gun at her mother's head. What was cause this guy to think that his killer is the only possessor of the antidote to his poison? I'd rather go for help hoping that the cure isn't Tridium. And even if the killer DID have the only antidote, how would a cancer-ridden old man obtain possession of such a rare substance. And it never thoroughly explains what Zep did to deserve such shabby treatment from the killer.<br/><br/>Finally, The Twist. OOOHHH! How surprising! Why? Because we, as an audience don't expect a man whose living should have been apparent to our two main characters hours earlier. The movie all builds up to these two words.......Game Over! But not my review. No. How is the game over? We've left a still alive Adam, mother, daughter and Dr. Gordon unspoken for. OK, we can assume that the killer kills Dr. Gordon, but what about the rest of the characters? Once again, the movie leads up to ""Game Over"". Probably because this movie accomplishes about as much for the film industry as a bad Video Game that no one remembers. Wait, What's the difference?"

","What is going on with people these days? How come this piece of celluloid junk can garner a 7.5 rating on IMDb, higher than films like ""The Duellists"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", ""Predator""... or ""Bachelor Party"", for that matter? ""Saw"" is yet another derivative shocker, stealing copiously from the likes of ""The Cube"", ""Se7en"" and several low-budget European films. It has no redeeming values, and offers no real surprises to speak of. By comparison, ""Equilibrium"" was another derivative film, but it had a heart in the right place. ""Saw"" is pure cinematic drivel, coming from another ""cool"" wannabe director, probably weaned on video games and MTV-style editing, and scarred for life by hooded men in corridors with blinking yellow/blue lights.<br/><br/>Beyond a bunch of shocking images, there's nothing worth a glance, much less a second look. We're not talking about a ""Funny Games"" type of movie here, since the German film was at least engaging, albeit in a sadistic way. The re-watchability factor is *zero* for James Wan's creation... I was wondering why the local Blockbuster stores are selling scores of ""Saw"" DVDs for a couple of bucks apiece. Now, that I've seen the film, I know the reason. Word of mouth may have helped this abomination gain some attention, but its real place remains the trash can, amidst empty syringes, vomit-stained underwear and junk food containers.<br/><br/>I honestly wonder if the reviewers claiming this film teaches you true lessons in the meaning of life are in fact convicts escaped from an asylum where they were taught lessons about ""life, the Universe and everything"" - including art - by the likes of Dr. Mengele, Ceausescu and Uwe Boll."

"bob the moo","Null","44","91","10 October 2004"," Slick thriller in the mould of Se7en that covers writing weaknesses with consistent tension & urgency
","(This review contains no spoilers but it is better when you know very little about it and I would suggest not reading any reviews on the film but to just go and see it!)<br/><br/>Adam wakes up in a bath of water to find himself in a dark room, chained to a large pipe. On the other side of the room is one Dr Lawrence Gordon, who finds himself in the same position, in the middle of the room is a dead man with a gun and a Dictaphone in his hand. Two recorded messages reveal that Gordon's wife and daughter have been kidnapped and will be killed at 6pm that same day. The only way this will not happen is if Gordon kills Adam before this time, a feat that will involve getting out of his chains and to the gun.<br/><br/>The marketing campaign for this film had a very impacting poster with very little text and just the word 'SAW' on it. In a way, with no real bankable names in the cast to sell itself on, the film sold itself on the one thing that will always get audiences in  a concise and interesting central premise. Here it is very simple and very interesting and sets up a real tension from the outset that never really lets up until the very end. Let me just say now that tense is not the same as terrifying and viewers coming to this film looking for loads of gore and screaming horror will be let down; in fact I would class this film as a thriller more than I would a horror for this reason. The film opens with us right in this scenario of the chains etc and quickly we learn the ground rules and then learn more about the Jigsaw killer who is doing it. The flashbacks just take the edge off the main story a little bit but they do work well enough in themselves, and produce a more complex story.<br/><br/>In a way this is where the weaknesses come in because the hook of the simple premise is expanded out into a wider story  and not all of it hangs together with a great deal of logic. The motives of the killer are unsure and the way that everything does fit into place is unconvincing (to name two problems) but, while it is on, the film's tension covers these gaps and does a good job of holding you in its spell. This spell lasts no longer than the final credits as you begin to pick holes in the actual story, but by then you'll have been entertained and into the film too much to really let the plot holes bother you and it is only those hoping for a story to match the darkness of Se7en will be letdown, this is not of the same caliber as that film but it is still fun. The director has learnt from several other films and genres. He knows that the simple premise can be used as a great hook for a simple story (many short films do the same), he knows from Se7en that sometimes the horror we imagine is much worse than the one we can see, and he knows from recent Japanese horror movies that unsettling images are scarier than outright gore (hence the use of clown and pig heads). In terms of style the film is winning if a little overdone. Time skips forward with frantic camera movements, 'dank' is painted thick on every scene and generally the film delivers a mood of tension, urgency and unsettling action.<br/><br/>Not using the cast for the marketing was a good choice because there are no real a-list names here and, sadly, there are several botched jobs on the acting side. Whannell is good and does a solid job  even handling the script's 'comic relief' requirements without letting it take away from the dire nature of his situation. Elwes is OK but not as consistent. At times his delivery is flat and sounds like he is delivering some more serious lines in his 'Princess Bride' character, sounding insincere and wooden. It also didn't help that his make up for the majority of the film made him look like a tired old queen  I know it was supposed to be like white plastery stuff, but on Whannell it looked good but on Elwes it looked like it had been spread evenly! Glover is OK but given too little to do and his character changes too much too quickly before we have even known who he was.<br/><br/>Support from people like Leung and Martinez add familiar faces and generally the support cast do OK  but in keeping with the simple premise idea, the film is best when it keeps those involved to the minimum.<br/><br/>Overall this is an effective thriller. It will be compared to Se7en but it doesn't have the writing to really stand in the same crowd as that movie; the plot has too many holes and the twists often come from a desire to surprise and confound rather than coming as a natural part of the story (ie they don't have the common sense impact of Se7en's conclusion). However what it does do well is deliver a sense of tension and urgency focused on this 'simple' premise. This tension works so well that it pretty much covers the plot problems while you are watching the film, and you are swept along with it as you watch. After the film you'll pick away at it and it won't stand up to repeat viewings but it is still a great fun film while you're with it."

The people they hired could act in small roles, requiring a limited range of emotions; but for a person locked in a room with nothing but a saw, a foot, and a choice, the acting just didn't have me convinced.<br/><br/>The story-line was good, as were the different methods of murder/torture seen throughout the film. In fact the movie itself played upon a lot of my key inner fears. Despite this, I found most scenes less frightening then I first expected. I think this is mostly due to the poor soundtrack. If you ever watch a scary film, and it gets too much for you, simply turn off the sound and it is nothing. There were never any tense violins jerking as the killer got closer, or bass music building up as something bad was about to happen. I suppose if they had spent more then 18 days filming it, then they may have made some better choices.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a five because while there is technically nothing wrong with it, it is still lacking something to make it a good film."

","SAW (2004) ***1/2 Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Leigh Whannell, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Makenzie Vega, Tobin Bell. (Dir: James Wan) A cut above the rest.<br/><br/>Finally a horror film that pays off in actually being scary! Novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell  director/ co-screenwriters  have concocted a fiercely chilling tale of horror with echoes of dank élan to 'SE7EN' as well as any films during the seminal '70s the likes of Carpenter, Craven and Hooper in gleaning some of their mojo glommed onto their uniquely perverse, darkly humorous and more importantly downright bone-chilling spooky with this dark story of a fated morality play.<br/><br/>The conceit begins with two strangers awakening from a drugged abduction to find themselves chained in a rotted industrial restroom (just the ghastly cinematography by David A. Armstrong and grotty production design by Julie Berghoff makes one crave a Tetanus shot!) and at the fate of a ticking clock coerced by the whimsy of a madman's sick, twisted game of life or death.<br/><br/>Dr. Lawrence Gordon (a very fine turn by Elwes) is a successful oncologist and a slacker type named Adam (Whannell providing much needed gallows humor smart-aleckness) must unsolve a dastardly puzzle with big questions  Who did this? Where are we? - to small details (each have a micro-cassette in their pockets and the only way to listen to the messages are provided in the hands of a blood drenched corpse littered at their feet clutching a tape recorder) as their time begins to erode  as well as their sanity.<br/><br/>Using flashbacks it is discovered by the good doctor that they are at their situation thanks to a serial killer  or more apropos , serial gamesman  tagged as 'Jigsaw'  whose m.o. is to abduct someone and have them run thru an impossible mechanism designed solely to kill/maim them with the grand design being that each one realize just how precious a commodity life truly is.<br/><br/>Adam and Gordon are also discovered to have a handy hacksaw provided for them to attempt an escape but soon learn that the tool will not cut through the heavy metal but should do so nicely through their own ankles! So begins the sweat-inducing, nerve-wracking quest of getting loose in time  for Gordon particularly since he learns his wife and daughter (Potter and Vega) will be killed if he doesn't kill Adam (a single bullet has been left by the sicko and a handy revolver is in the other grasp of the bloodied victim on the filthy floor).<br/><br/>Added to the mix is a police investigation involving Det. David Tapp (Glover, in a snaky 'I'm getting' too-old-for-this-s**t potshot at his 'LETHAL WEAPON' character) and his partner Det. Steven Sing (Leung) who are getting too close to the crazed genius with some truly lethal consequences.<br/><br/>Wan milks several sequences in dark, cluttered and silent moments of dread while incorporating themes of infidelity, betrayal, redemption and employs a few stock gimmicks including grainy snuff-film video taping, a hair-raising sound effect of a maniacal clown laugh and just for the price of admission one of cinema's creepiest looking puppets to get his messages across.<br/><br/>The screenplay by both  native Australians  hearkens back to slasher/psycho exploitation films yet raises the bar in their inventive, ingenious set pieces especially one ghastly recollection with a 'reverse bear trap' head device ; nuff said.<br/><br/>There are moments of quiet devastation, nail-biting tension and just enough nervous laughter for the two protagonists racing against their inevitable doomed plight while also evoking many questions by the film's twisty canny climax (stop here if you don't want to realize the reason the pic is titled the way it is).<br/><br/>Violence is underscored with scarily innate logic yet not over-the-top (I for one cannot wait for the DVD to see what made the editing floor to get its MPAA R  rating) and it has some greatest hits of the genre standards like the rooting for the victims to get their much thirsted for vengeance.<br/><br/>A true crowd-pleaser that doesn't disappoint but will have you wanting to return to put each simply creative puzzle piece together as more questions will come flooding by its stunning conclusion.<br/><br/>You've been warned!"
"Li-1","Null","19","37","21 February 2005"," Despite a good premise and signs of potential talent from James Wan, Saw completely falls apart in the last half-hour.
","Rating: * 1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>Opening to acclaim throughout a number of film festivals, Saw became the low-budget horror flick that came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise. But hype has its backlash, and in my case, I can't say I came out of this film particularly impressed. There are elements in the film worth appreciating, but aside from a few tricky plot twists, it accomplishes nothing that other films haven't done before with more skill and freshness.<br/><br/>Getting straight to the point, Saw opens with young photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) awakening in a bathtub, disoriented and confused towards his whereabouts. As it turns out, he's in a large, dank, grime-filled bathroom, chained to the pipes. He's got a chained companion on the other side of the room, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), and in between them lies the body of a dead man.<br/><br/>Through a series of clues, Gordon deduces they're dealing with the ""Jigsaw,"" a serial killer who finds elaborate methods of forcing his victims to perform a series of grueling tasks, and if they fail, the penalty is death. A message left behind by tape informs Gordon of his task; he must kill Adam in eight hours or his own wife and child will be murdered.<br/><br/>It's a good premise, but it's obvious the filmmakers aren't going to make a feature-length production set entirely within a bathroom. Unsurprisingly, it's the scenes set outside the bathroom that the movie first shows signs of faltering. Problem number one is that the sets appear rather low-grade, no surprise given the budgetary constraints. Problem number two is that the movie still wants to keep its villain's identity a surprise. In fact, I wasn't swayed at all upon the initial revelation of the killer, especially when this ""surprise"" is still juxtaposed alongside scenes set in the past where the filmmakers' still keep the killer's face hidden.<br/><br/>Such twists and turns grow tiresome, all the more so when it's obvious that the killer always (and I mean ALWAYS) has a trick up his sleeve, making the final shock quite obvious moments before its underwhelming unveiling. Hey, I like my serial killer flicks to feature a smart villain as much as the next guy, but it's just plain annoying for them to be all-out omniscient.<br/><br/>The scenes set within the bathroom are initially effective. The acting between Elwes and Whannell is convincing enough, with Whannell showing hints of genuine charisma that could serve him well in the future. But all this takes a flabbergasting nose-dive in the last half-hour, beginning with the cigarette scene. It was by this point I wondered if director James Wan was winking at us because prior to this the film was serious in its intent to scare.<br/><br/>I can't help but admit that this far into the picture, I started laughing and couldn't stop. I was willing to suspend my disbelief at a lot of the plot, even at the fact that five hours could suddenly pass and catch up on the protagonists (surely, at least one of them would keep better track of the time?), but that the killer would know that at least one of the two men would look inside his wallet and find the right picture and message, and to be aware of how desperate one of them is for a smoke in even such a dank environment and have a back-up plan to test the possible contingency that could result; well, I have to say, it felt like a parody of all the ""smart"" serial killer flicks we've seen before, and the acting only goes further to serve that belief.<br/><br/>Decent at first, Elwes goes off the deep end in the movie's climax. One has to question how someone would truly respond in such a situation, so I'm not going to criticize his acting in that respect. I just can't deny that my immediate response was pure hilarity; Elwes is not a very good actor, but he's competent enough for me to believe he was perfectly aware of how silly he looked and overplayed it for all it was worth. Considering the absence of suspense, I think the laughs go a step or two in making up for it.<br/><br/>Also, without giving too much away, there must have been other ways for a certain character to resolve his predicament (like seeking help) if the danger that's posed upon him is slow-acting enough for an incredibly elaborate plan to unfold over the course of many hours. The danger is, in fact, so slow-acting that after all those hours, this man (who should not be a very skilled fighter or marksman) is still capable of engaging and holding his own in shootouts, chases, and fistfights with a crazed and determined ex-cop. <br/><br/>Director Wan has potential, but he needs to lay off on camera tricks and realize quick cuts and sped-up camera-work serve as distractions and do little to build genuine scares or suspense. In fact, I was surprised by how easy it was for me to sit through this film. At no moment did I ever feel a sense of dreadful anticipation like I do with the best (or even solidly competent) of the genre. Much of the reason for that has to do with the flashback structure, we're clearly aware of who's alive or who isn't considering we know who's telling the story. <br/><br/>It doesn't help that each twist spirals the movie further into a hole it can't dig itself out of, the final strike coming in the last moments with a preposterous surprise revelation. We barely saw this guy prior to this scene, so why make a big deal out of this surprise by going through a pointless flashback? This is one case where an otherwise middling movie is destroyed by a terrible ending."

","'Saw' (2004), begins with the high concept of 'imagine finding yourself with your ankle chained to a wall. Someone else on the opposite side of the room is in the same predicament. Items scattered around the room include a pistol with one bullet, a tape recorder, and two hacksaws that won't cut through the stainless steel chains, but would do a reasonable job on your ankle.' <br/><br/>Adam and Lawrence are the two men who are chained, both opposites in temperament (but that will change), and each are given instructions via a cassette recorder on how to escape. Adam, a photographer, gets the message ""...what do voyeurs see when they look in the mirror?"" And that he must escape the room, while Lawrence is told to kill Adam before a certain time, or his family will die. <br/><br/>A flashback reveals Detectives Tapp and Sing unwisely go and investigate a warehouse without a warrant and without telling anyone. Sing is fatally killed in a trip wire trap; a very 'Giallo' sequence. Tapp, now disgraced, obsessively wallpapers his apartment with news clippings in the style of Se7en (1995), whilst independently (a Dario Argento/Giallo concept) attempting to stop the mastermind behind the 'game.' Saw is padded with flashbacks to prop up the films running time to feature length.<br/><br/>A 'garage sale' of ideas from possibly every film the writers and director have ever seen; the grime and toilet of 'Trainspotting' (1996), 'Evil Dead Trap's' camera flash sequence, a man finds himself in a 'Suspiria' like room of barbed wire, the 'reverse bear trap' business fans often compare to Edgar Allan Poe who is 'Suspiria' director Dario Argento's favourite author, and this is where we first see the puppet 'Jigsaw' who is reminiscent of those in Argento's 'Four Flies On Grey Velvet' and 'Deep Red'. There is an autopsy on a drugged man, reminiscent of both Argento's 'Opera' and Takashi Miike's 'Audition', and 'Audition' obviously influences the climax. The multiple twist endings require a suspension of disbelief as it goes into 'look how clever am I' The Usual Suspects (1995) twists for their own sake, that you don't want to think about too much less the thread fall apart.<br/><br/>The Saw creators do give credit where credit is due; ""A lot of people have said that Saw is similar in tone to Se7en but the biggest influence wasn't a recent Hollywood thriller at all, it was the work of Dario Argento from the seventies,"" stated the director Wan.<br/><br/>With dreadful performances (and I feel the need to give special mention to Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, who if they didn't should have received 'Razzie' awards), Saw surpassed all expectations, becoming one of the most profitable horror films since 1996's Scream by Wes Craven.<br/><br/>I was never a fan of the jokey, not serious, just laughs and scares of the Scream school; but I am even less of a fan of 'torture porn,' of which this is hardly the worst, but it's the germ of the idea that started with Evil Dead Trap and lead to such dross as Eli Roth's Hostel (2005), and Srdjan Spasojevic's A Serbian Film (2010).

Why did Z torment the Mother and child if the whole time the real killer was playing possum on the freezing cold disgusting bathroom floor and therefore had no idea what was happening in the doctor's apartment so why did Z go to the extra effort?

Who administered the electric shocks to Adam and the Dr? If it was the killer how did he do this without moving or breathing? HOW were the electric shocks administered? Why did the Dr not use the shirt to reach the phone that somehow ended up on the other side of the room, instead of cutting his foot off. That was a very effective tourniquet!

"sluman","1","19","38","14 March 2005"," Dear James Wan, Please don't make a second Saw!
","Mullholland Drive, Terminator 3, Shanghai Knights, and Speed 2 were the bottom of the chum barrel for me. Then along came this movie and wow! It was conceptually a good idea. But the execution was awful. Actually awful would be a compliment. Our theater was in an uproar of laughter when the film was supposed to be at it's scariest and most intense moments.<br/><br/>To explain how horrible this film was is almost impossible. It's almost worth renting to see how to NOT make a movie. I joined IMDb only to put in this review. People need to know what's up before they waste $1.99 at the Wherehouse.<br/><br/>I'd compare watching Saw to rubbing wasabi in your eyes while drinking pepper spray when walking on shards of glass in a room filled with agent orange. I know it's a horror and the acting is supposed to suck... But Carey Elwes reached a new low. His performance was so brutally bad that it made is role in ""Robinhood: Men in Tights"" look Oscar worthy. His accent kept changing throughout the film like Madonna's did in the 90's. He was just so bad. I love Danny Glover but he was so miscast in this p.o.s. that it was unfair to him as an actor. His part should have been played by Beetlejuice from Howard Stern or Bobcat Goldthwait. Then maybe it would have been believable.<br/><br/>This brings me to James Wan. Is his dad the producer? Who would look at this movie and go, ""Yep! We got a masterpiece!""? The editing, directing, and acting were super sketchy and it is James Wan's fault. He needs to not make a movie ever again. Now someone is producing a sequel to Saw for him to direct? If you want a scary film see the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Winnie the Pooh's Heffalump Movie. If you want the side splitting comedy of the year get Saw. I'm going to go swallow some thumb tacks now."
"dbadrock","10","19","38","5 December 2004"," You really should see Saw
","Saw has achieved a rare feat in Thriller/Horror film-making in that it holds the suspense and intrigue throughout the entier film. From the opening moments (possibly the most captivating first 20 minutes of a film I've ever seen), until the end credits role, the audience is on edge, continually wondering what is going to happen next. The film centres around two men, chained to pipes, at either end of an industrial bathroom. Between them, lying face down on the floor is a body surrounded by a pool of blood. The questions of how and why these men are here are answered is a series of flashbacks throughout the film and this is where my only two real problems with the movie exist. Firstly, the first time out of the bathroom takes too long. Although the back story is interesting and necessary, I wanted to get back to the bathroom faster. The second problem I had was with the use of sped up film and rapidly changing camera angles in some of the flashback scenes. Although this technique did have an impact, after a few moments, it felt a bit 'gimicky'. The scenes in the bathroom however are masterful and the way the writers develop the plot in a setting that can seemingly go nowhere is a real credit to them. Saw is intriguing, it is imaginative, it is scary, suspenseful and wonderfully entertaining. Saw is a movie you must see at the cinema."
"BrandtSponseller","10","16","31","18 February 2005"," One of the best films of the year
","Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Larry (Cary Elwes) awaken to find themselves locked in a filthy, dilapidated public bathroom. As they regain awareness, things go from bad to worse. They see a dead body on the floor between them, and then they realize that they're chained to large pipes on opposite sides of the room. When they discover a hidden message for each, they learn that a madman is playing a sick game with them. Can they win the game and escape with their lives? Every once in a while, I'm given an opportune moment to engage in a mini-rant, so here we go. <br/><br/>Anyone wondering why I usually pay no attention to the Academy Awards need look no further than Saw. In my view, Saw should be nominated for eight 2005 Oscars: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Elwes), Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing--Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Makeup, and Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures--Original Song (Fear Factory's ""Bite the Hand That Bleeds""). Not that I feel it should necessarily win all eight, but it should have a fair shake at them. There are others that I would nominate for some of those categories--including Hellboy, The Village, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Dawn of the Dead, Kill Bill Vol. 2, Shaun of the Dead, and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. But you'll note that out of those, only The Village got a nod (a single nomination). It's difficult for me to take something seriously that is so far off the mark when it comes to recognizing quality films. But it's not as if a general anti-genre bias in the Academy Awards--as well as with professional critics and the self-appointed film literati--has not been noted before.<br/><br/>James Wan and Whannell (who takes on double duty as an actor) have authored a tightly interwoven story, with a puzzle theme that draws you in like the best material of the Cube (1997) series combined with a gritty, Se7en (1995)-like serial killer police procedural. The pieces of the plot fit together precisely and unfold like a predetermined chess game. Wan and Whannell build tension gradually, despite the fact that the film comes out of the gate extremely suspenseful.<br/><br/>Wan, who also served as director, creates a fabulously disturbing, dingy atmosphere throughout the film, bolstered by Julie Berghoff's production design, which is as inventive as the script. Part of the delightful novelty of the film is the elaborate, potentially fatal puzzles devised by the villain. Berghoff's designs for these scenarios and devices easily matches the lockstep intricacy of the plot and the ominous foreboding of the overall atmosphere. Viewers will likely cringe at vicariously envisioning themselves in the contraptions, and that's much of the point. The cinematography throughout the film is just as imaginative, easily telling a story that often depends on subtle visual cues, and reaching just the right balance of extended techniques, such as the varied film speeds during a car chase.<br/><br/>Because so much of the film is focused on just two characters in a single, relatively sparse room, Elwes and Whannell must turn in powerhouse performances, running a gamut of emotions including vulnerable helplessness, studied hopefulness, vengeful anger and frenzied desperation. Both are excellent, with Elwes particularly remarkable. Danny Glover, as Detective David Trapp, is impressive in his transformation from a somewhat typical macho cop to an obsessive loon, perhaps on a par with the villain in his single-minded irrational commitment.<br/><br/>The modus operandi and motivation (which serves as the theme) of the villain are intriguingly gray. The victims are often morally questionable, and can potentially benefit from their victimization. They're putatively given an out from their predicaments if they can muster the necessary wit and skill. At least on one level, the villain wants to give his victims a hard lesson and improve their lives.<br/><br/>It should have been clear by the comparison to Cube and Se7en that Saw is not for the faint of heart (although it's not quite as gory as it could have been) or for those who want only clear messages of good and evil and happy endings. As one of 2004's best films, however, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch."
"tpettyrox","1","16","31","30 October 2004"," ""Saw"" it coming...
","This movie just sucked. I only went because a friend insisted, even though I told him it would probably be pretty bad. ""Pretty Bad"" doesn't do it justice. ""Saw"" is about a couple of guys who find themselves trapped in a ""third-world bathroom"" chained to pipes with a dead guy in the middle of the room. The ""Horror"" technique is mundane and predictable. The bits of comedy are laughable to a 5th grader.<br/><br/>As far as Horror movies go, this one sits pretty low with the Scream Sequels. The movie aims to scare the viewer with gore and quick cuts, instead of using suspense and surprise to shock. There is only one scene in the film where suspense is used well and uniquely works, and this was the only time I was scared during the movie. Anyone who has seen this movie should know the scene I'm talking about. If you don't remember, don't bother seeing it again.<br/><br/>The dialogue is poorly written and slow. The characters lack any believable motivation through most of the film, which is two hours long, and only deliver convincing drama as the movie nears its end. The plot also plays out much like a game of Clue, and there are enough loopholes and loose ends in the story that attempting to explain them would drive a tax lawyer insane.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way... Danny Glover should know something about acting as a cop from all the Lethal Weapon films. There was obviously no attention paid to the details of investigative and law enforcement procedure and tactics. In one ""climactic"" scene I can recall seven or eight major tactical mistakes that would have easily been avoided if the production team cared enough to pay attention. This failure makes the scene in question laughable more than suspenseful, and this is the kind of thing that can ruin a decent movie.<br/><br/>Predictability is also a huge problem with this movie. It's not as predictable as a movie based on a book you've read, but it comes close. WARNING: SPOILER! It's the dead guy who did it, and I have no clue how he laid on the floor for eight hours with neither of the protagonists noticing he's breathing. This movie sucks.<br/><br/>In summary, all this movie gave me was a sore neck and a desire for eight bucks. I can't believe anybody paid for the script and the production."

","The very first in a long and successful movie franchise, ""Saw"" has two extremely unfortunate guys (played by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) chained to pipes in a large, disgusting bathroom. From hazy memories and clues given to them in the room, they realize that they have been kidnapped by a serial killer named Jigsaw in order to play out a vicious, painful and bloody game in order to escape. Should the two men refuse to play, there will be severe consequences.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Saw"" is the scene when Elwes reaches his breaking point and uses a hacksaw to begin his escape. Although cringeworthy, it is mild compared to what future ""Saw"" movies has in store.<br/><br/>""Saw"" works because 1) it moves fast thanks to a tight script and frenetic editing that can be annoying most times; 2) there is the mystery of who the serial killer is; and 3) it offers the audience very interesting and sadistic ways to kill the victims. Weaknesses of ""Saw"" are: 1) Elwes' often melodramatic, soap opera-ish acting; and 2) Danny Glover's cop character who makes one stupid move after another, making me wonder if he had a brain. Taken as a whole, ""Saw"" is an entertaining movie for fans of so called ""torture porn"" horror movies.

","Am I the only one who thought this movie was awful? It's really bad. Cary Elwes, who is normally quite good (i.e. Shadow of the Vampire), made me laugh. We saw the movie because the premise was good. The first moments of the flick make you curious of these guys' situation, but that doesn't last long at all. As soon as Elwes and the other dude start acting, it goes bad quickly. Most of the torture scenes seemed like a lame NIN video. And the jittery editing when Danny Glover was driving frantically was nauseous. We walked out the theater before the twist ending.

","*1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>Two men, a doctor and a photographer, wake up in the most disgusting bathroom in a dank underground Cavern. They are chained to the wall and have mad the gross discovery of finding a dead body in the room with them. They soon find out that they have been kidnapped and have to play a game in which the doctor must kill the photographer or the kidnapper will kill his wife and child. Soon they begin to collect clues and information about each other, but will they be able to escape, not only with their lives, but with the doctor's family's? The concept of this film is scary. The ideas are somewhat clever. Unfortunitely, those two things are the only things that are able to carry this film. And thankfully, they carry them a long way, but not through to the end, sadly.<br/><br/>This could have been forgivable if we were to care about the characters, but we can't. These kind of films should have more character development, but instead, SAW pushes that aside and layers the film with buckets of blood and guts, neither of which particularly grossed me out since we, again, could care less about the characters, especially the photographer(Leigh Whannell) who goes over the top to make the viewers surprised that the doctor(Cary Elwes) doesn't immediately murder him.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the normally brilliant Cary Elwes doesn't do well here. He begins too wooden and then tries to be emotional and then gets even more wooden and it just doesn't work. However, I understand that if an actor is British and must switch to doing an American accent, it won't be easy. It wasn't easy for him, and it won't be easy on the audience when he begins doing unrealistic whining noises as he and Leigh are getting chopped to pieces! What wreaks the film the most are the amount of flashbacks that occur nonstop and detract from the plot. The film could have been a good grisly time, despite the flaws, if it just centered on the one room that the two men are tortured in. The flashbacks are annoying and feel like an excuse to just talk about the killer and his sick ways, which eventually accidentally turn themselves into plot devices.<br/><br/>However, the film, despite being really bad, has good points. The plot is intriguing, and the violent torture acts are great fun for gore fans. At one point, a woman forces herself to cut open a man's stomach and find a key to unlock the door in his intestines. And the last fifteen minutes of the film is a create montage of disturbing insanity and depravity that I must recommend to those who like sick stuff. And the twist ending works great and really ends the film with a disgusting BANG!!! The bad out weighs the good this time, but for those looking for a lot of grisly violence will have a good time here. The film manages to just about deliver the gore, but the film has a long way to go to being as good and gory as SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I hope they get it right next time.<br/><br/>Rated R for strong grisly violence and language"

","Thriller about two guys who find themselves chained to opposite walls in an old shower room with a dead guy between them and the kidnapper playing riddles with them.

Messages like the one telling the Doctor that he has to kill the other guy within the next few hours or his wife and daughter will be killed. Messages like two hidden saws that they find that are not good enough to cut the chains around their ankles but definitely good enough to cut through those ankles. The doctor remembers having heard more about this killer, because he was once the main suspect himself. This killer loves to play such mind games where the abducted people usually end up killing themselves while trying to follow the game. Only one ever escaped. <br/><br/>The movie is very tight, fast with a good story and I haven't found one second to catch my breath, and that for a movie of 100 minutes. I really enjoyed it (if one can say with such a grisly movie that one enjoyed it), but the strange thing is, I came out of the movie and boom it was gone. I didn't feel anything special afterwards, I wasn't stunned, scared, awed or whatever. It's like I have seen the movie 10 years ago, not 10 minutes ago.

","Put Seven and The Cube in a blender and make an audience drink the dribble that comes out.<br/><br/>There is a clever twist near the end of Saw, but it is hard to enjoy if by then you have lost all interest. This movie wants us to believe in a madman with not only superior intelligence, but also unlimited resources and time to create a world full of electronic gadgets, props and puppets that Q would be jealous of. His opponents/victims are either incredibly stupid, or turn from rational beings into sobbing idiots at the snap of a director's fingers.<br/><br/>Movies like Seven stand out for a reason. It is not hard to think up stuff that shocks and upsets. A good plot twist is a little harder to invent, but anybody can do it. The real challenge is in trying to construct a plot that an audience can believe in. It is like walking a tightrope: set one foot wrong and you're dead.

I don't want to see a movie villain copying Hannibal, because Hannibal is one of a kind. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is far superior than Jigsaw, as you may have seen Jigsaw's weakness in the sequel of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just your average thriller-fest.

This will be the movie people will pass around as a gag gift in a few years. It is the morning after I caught a much anticipated sneak preview and I find myself more p***ed and disgusted than disappointed in the film. Jon Favreau noted on Dinner for Five once that you can take a chance on the script, the director or the lead actor in a project and still have things turn out all right. So we have a first time director, first time screenwriter ( he is also in the film and gives himself the only cool line in the entire movie) and Cary Elwes. 3 strikes and you are out. The thing that p***es me off is that the story is good. The base idea behind this film, a guy who gets his victims to kill themselves in a variety of horrible ways. Definitely up there with Se7en, wait a minute, that was the story from Se7en, so never mind. By the end of the film you WANT every one to die horribly just so that it will end. <br/><br/>A previous review commented on an overly giggly audience, they were laughing because this should have been a comedy. Not a single moment of the film was scary or even creepy. All of those scenes were telegraphed horribly and executed with boxing gloves on. There are simply no spoilers to give away. Danny Glover tried but he had nothing to work with, not sure why there were even police in the story line as they provided no advancement of the plot, and didn't even provide any interesting death scenes in their search for the killer. Dina Meyer has all of 3 or 4 lines and never even takes off her clothes, which could have redeemed to film somewhat. Monica Potter is the best performance of the film and that because I think the confusion and anger that her character showed so well on film was drawn from her own emotions at being connected with this project. Cary Elwes should never be allowed to work on any film, anywhere, ever again. I would have rather seen Jake Lloyd or Hayden Christiansen play the role because they could have given better performances. There was also none of the grisly violence that was promised, I think they either showed a different cut to get the R rating or they paid to get it. ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a more grisly, horrific and scary film and they were TRYING to be funny. This not only deserves no starts on any reviewers scale it deserves to be the baseline of a whole new scale of just how bad a movie can be. I give it 5 out of 5 thrown handfuls of monkey excrement.

I loved Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon, I thought perhaps it might be worth for him alone but...Oh how I wish had trusted my instincts!! The plot has more holes than a colander, the acting is risible and the script is a complete joke. Why in God's name does crap like this get made when there are so many good scripts out there just begging to be filmed??? Saw is fatally flawed and the exec who gave it the green light must have been clinically insane or totally incompetent. What a waste of 90 minutes. Rubbish.

","This is a thriller genre flick that is full of unintentional humor. The transitions in this film were awkward, the plot flimsy and worst of all the acting was miserable (in the pathetic to the degree of hilarity sense.) I am not often a critic butcher of the films I see, but I simply do not understand the rating of 7.4 for this amateur hour joke. The surprise ending was a novel approach, but by no means worth $9. It is worth renting if you feel like aching with laughter at the unconvincing cries of Cary Elwes and Co. Basically this film is a cheap attempt at capitalizing on the success of films like ""7"" and Silence of the Lambs. Don't buy the hype! USA today reported this film to be a work of genius...I challenge y'all to find a more appropriate deterrent for any moviegoer with a speck of taste than such a review from USA Today."
"Quinoa1984","1","10","19","30 October 2004"," Imagine if Ed Wood re-did Seven and this is what it would look like- the worst film of the year so far
","(Possible spoilers)<br/><br/>I was immensely grateful not to have paid to watch this film (snuck in); because if I did I would've felt un-clean once the credits began to roll. The filmmakers, writer/director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Whannell, have concocted another story in what Hollywood finds as the popular Silence of the Lambs/Se7en vein. The premise sounds like it might have promise- two guys (Whannell and Cary Elwes) are chained up in some abhorrent tub-room, and are given two saws. They have to find a way out, or else Dr. Gordon's (Elwes) wife and daughter will be killed. Then the rest of the story takes off, and it's down-hill. What happens then are a series of flashbacks, tracing how they got in there, how a cop (Danny Glover, a sad state of affairs to see him in this) gets maddened by the cases and an encounter, and how the gory details of the cases emphasize how disturbed and 'scary' the Jigsaw killer is (whom we never really see, except for a clown-type of face that's more of something to laugh at than anything else).<br/><br/>The problem with this film, the chief one among others, is that Wan and Whannell underestimate the audience's intelligence. Everything has to be explained, and with a style in bold, gruesome type that end up not coming off as successfully scary as successfully sadistic (and there is a big difference between something being effective and not- last year's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake is a prime example). They seem to care more (along with their editor and cinematographer and production designer) to drum up the atmosphere. But they spend so much time going over the top in many cases (and this includes with Wan's direction of actors, which brings out some bad performances, even out of co-writer Whannel) that they don't set up characters we can really sympathize for. In fact, at some point, it becomes so tiresome with how the plot dances around; you almost want them to get it over with it so that the Jigsaw guy can go on to his next abomination. What's worse is that when the third act comes around, all the elements produce material that becomes laughable, and not because we (or at least I was, the audience around me were much the same) are laughing at the sadism of it, but because it's so ridiculous. <br/><br/>Se7evn and Silence of the Lambs spent far more time setting up the good guys, or at least making they seem like strong forces we could identify with, and at the same time the story lines weren't completely unbelievable. At some point while watching Saw, I found it to be like if some hack (i.e. Ed Wood) decided to re-do Se7en except to focus on the victims instead of the cops, to dance around the storyline like they're going farther than Tarantino, and that by the end everyone who deserved to die (except for a few) do. Then I realized, it's like, it is. I don't discourage the 27 year old Wan and Whannell from some kind of potential in Hollywood, but I just don't see it here. D-"

","I'll Start of by saying that the ending did provide a small twist that I didn't expect, however it leaves you feeling completely unsatisfied. Actually looking back now I feel like I've been tricked and a bit of an idiot. (If you've watched the movie's ending you'll know what I mean)<br/><br/>Overall however,this movie was a joke, the concept was good, but it just didn't work for me. For starters Cary Elwes acting is horrid. By the end of the movie I was actually laughing out loud and thinking to myself ""how in the world did Elwes ever get an acting job?"" I felt nothing emotionally for any of the characters. A lot of the actors lines were cheesy. The movie had a few scenes that were a little creepy, but nothing that got my heart racing.I think what annoyed me most was how completely stupid the director ends up making most of the characters look. There were several times near the end of the movie where the characters could have stopped(remains nameless),but I guess none of these people were blessed with what would be referred to as ""common sense."" I understand that the director wanted to draw out the climax to make it more action packed and interesting, but he didn't need to destroy the characters intelligence to accomplish this.<br/><br/>If your looking for a good psychological thriller/horror movie like ""Scilence Of The Lambs"" then you'll be really disappointed in this one. The best advice I have is to save your money for a better movie and sit this one out, but if you're dead set on seeing it rent the DVD first! If you're like me you'll be glad you did! <br/><br/>Trust me by the end of this movie you'll have wished you could have borrowed Elwes saw to cut off your head because you'll feel like a complete idiot that you wasted your time(and money)on this!"

","What I liked: the story. I have to admit that I was bored for awhile because I thought I figured it out early, only to find out that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Another plus --> this movie tries for the creepy, get-under-your-skin horror as opposed to the cheap startle-scare tactics. And I was surprised to find that after years of watching grisly, bleak films like Seven and Event Horizon that this film was still able to make me wince at times.<br/><br/>What was lacking: a lot. The story was decent but the dialogue was poor. And the two leads in the film are both terrible. A lot of people were commenting that Cary Elwes was bad, and he was, but the guy opposite him is equally regrettable. The sad thing is, that guy doubles as the screenwriter, so you'd think he could do a better job with his own words. Danny Glover is so-so, but he didn't have much to work with. This film so desperately wants to be Seven in tone and style (when the killer espouses his philosophy, it sounds like the screenwriter is trying to remember Kevin Spacey's speeches, but can't quite), and yet this director is no David Fincher. And for some reason, he allowed Elwes to ham it up, so he's not an actor's director.<br/><br/>All in all: decent, but not nearly the masterpiece that all the other Harry Knowles types on this site are making it out to be. I give it a 5 out of 10."

","A fiendishly clever idea--for a 22 minute episode of, say, The Twilight Zone. But for a feature? Nope. Not without engaging characters, decent dialogue, a plausible story and a convincingly motivated villain. Saw plays out more as an assortment of potentially cool demo scenes strung into a threadbare and implausible story. Even the money scene--the reverse bear-trap--is marred by overly frantic camera movement and editing. The director has watched too many music videos and not enough Hitchcock. Basic storytelling and film-making skills are absent as is any command of actors, dialogue, mood and logic. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of that seems to matter any more as this film has already spawned a sequel and looks well on its way to becoming a franchise. The director/writing team are rich, successful and no-doubt convinced that they are the future of edgy film-making. Too bad, cuz now they'll never have the need to master the craftmanship necessary to add style and substance to their high-concept ideas. What a waste. Jigsaw not happy."

","Genres always exist, become living things, for a reason. A popular genre is the guy (or demon) who has the some omniscience and the ability to either create intricate scenarios which always work flawlessly. Often this is a serial killer.<br/><br/>The reason for the genre comes from some unavoidable facts in fiction. You have the writer who _is_ omniscient and _does_ have the capability of creating complex scenarios that do work. It is the writer's world after all. And we have the reader who occupies a place between the characters in the story (with whom we relate) and the writer (because we see and know things the characters cannot).<br/><br/>So it is a natural thing to propose a character that also occupies this space. I'm making a study of the complex ways we've evolved to do perform this trick. But one way is very simple: just have a character with these qualities, period. For some reason (an ability to impute Lucifer?), we accept this more readily if the god-like character is ""evil.""<br/><br/>Right, them. The game in this genre is one that grew up in the detective genre, indeed, there is often a detective still remaining in most editions of the genre. The game is a struggle among the three: you the viewer, the writer and the god-like demon to outsmart each other in the giving life to the world we see.<br/><br/>So, built in to the genre is the final twist. We know it is there, it is a structural necessity. All parties know it is there. An entry in the genre is judge on only one factor: how successfully did the bad guy (not the writer) flummox the viewer? All else is filler, usually noisy or grisly to distract us from the fact that it _is_ filler.<br/><br/>So how did this film do? Not well enough to fool me. But then, I know the game.

","Two men wake up in an empty room and finds themselves being manipulated in to playing a sadistic game by a mysterious character called Jigsaw<br/><br/>Looking at the above short summary you can how easy it is to pitch to the Hollywood studios . Yes I know SAW started out as an Australian short film by director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell but even so the premise alone is enough to intrigue the most cynical studio boss and make them want to develop it in to a feature length movie . It's easy to forget but the original SAW was marketed as a smart thriller with a twist ending and certainly my own reaction on seeing it was "" Wow I never expected that "" . This was very much an era inspired by THE SIXTH SENSE where films sometimes liked to surprise an audience . Despite the often graphic violence seen in this movie it's the shock twist at the end that led to the film gaining very good word of mouth on its initial release <br/><br/>The problem is that once you know the twist ending it doesn't really stand up to repeat viewings . Worse than that the original SAW's reputation has been greatly damaged by the large amount of sequels that followed it . None of them really concerned themselves with cerebral plotting and most of them concerned themselves with a function of continuity that would see yet another sequel set up . Perhaps worst of all each sequel tried to out do its predecessor by the amount of gore on offer . Indeed the phrase "" Torture porn "" became more and more increasingly used with the franchise and it's difficult to defend the later films from this which lurched from one gory set piece to another featuring a terrified victim suffering a cruel and graphic death <br/><br/>SAW was a film that succeeded as a gory mainstream thriller when it was released in 2004 . It's easy to dismiss it just another horror film but that's to ignore and sadly forget that it had a market outside the normal teen horror crowd . It's also a film that suffers from having a franchise started after it which has damaged its heritage"

It wasn't scary, the acting was sub-par at best (even veteran actors like Danny Glover and Cary Elwes looked like high school drama students), the dialogue was insipid (and at times, just plain stupid), and it was FULL of plot holes. Example: why was that Zep guy listening to the heartbeats of his victims? He wasn't kidnapping them for the joy in torturing them, but rather to save his own life. Why was he getting off on listening to their frightened heartbeats? Am I supposed to believe that the pawn that the brilliant Jigsaw used in his zany plot just happened to be crazy? Lame! Do gory scenes and clever little mind games and scenarios make up for all of the problems in this film? I don't think so.

","The idea is definitely good; in fact, that's what made me buy the DVD cheap at a sale. Psycho killer makes people play a 'game' with their lives. If they succeed---often at great pain, loss of blood, the occasional limb, or the killing of someone else---they will be set free again, and appreciate life more. If they fail, well... Let's just say they didn't appreciate life enough, then.<br/><br/>I'm not going to tell the story, hundreds of others already did so. I'm going to focus on what I felt as I was watching the movie. And that was basically nothing. It begins give minutes into the movie, when the doctor-character stresses in a totally unconvincing way that they have to cooperate to make it out alive. There isn't a single shred of mortal fear, of failure to reason properly, of distrust, or of whatever which makes humans human. *That* is the real scare you should get from such movies: to witness what happens when layers of sanity are silently but remorselessly stripped away. Instead, there's just grime, blood, sweat and dirty toilets. You know that the two main characters cannot kill each other because they are too far away from each other, and the only option they have to *make* the kill is by cutting off their own feet. Which is about the last thing they want to do---you really have to be desperate.<br/><br/>So what is the last straw? Not being able to answer a phone after you hear a lot of shots fired, and fear for the life of your wife and child whom you did not really show any affection for throughout the movie, I kid you not. I am sure that this is some ultimate joke aimed at people who are addicted to that wireless leash: they'd rather cut their own foot off in order to answer it then to let it ring and let voice mail handle it. The scenes portraying this ultimate breakdown are pathetic and totally unconvincing, simply because you---as a viewer---already know what happens, so you cannot sympathise with the victim.<br/><br/>The other 99% of the movie is just as bad. Flashbacks aplenty, sometimes even a flashback within a flashback, but this plot device doesn't really fit into this movie. They are just there to paint a picture of Jigsaw, but it doesn't really provide any clues as to solve the puzzle. Or rather, you learn that there is no other way to solve the puzzle save through what Jigsaw planned. In a really tense movie, the good guy manages to beat the bad guy by outsmarting him at his own game. A snowball has a better chance in hell of not melting than that happening in Saw.<br/><br/>I only give this movie a 4 because the only time I sat up straight and could appreciate the entire affair was the last one, one-and-a-half minute before the end. Then a totally unexpected alternate plot line develops you did not see coming, and it shows the only good idea the writer/director/producer had. I turned off the TV shaking my head and wondering why they didn't make the entire movie like that.<br/><br/>The psycho was such a nice idea to begin with. And it is really such a shame that it was ruined so expertly."

It had everything people in this day and age are afraid of- from the idea of rotting alone in a dark room to creepy dolls to the suspense of a killer lurking just around the corner. However. The acting was sub par to say the least. The actors who were well known (Glover, Potter, Elwes) gave possibly the poorest display of acting in each of their careers. Having Elwes in a serious role for one thing... I had to contain my giggles throughout most of the movie. In my head I kept envisioning him rolling down the side of a mountain screaming ""as you wishhhhhh..."" The unknown actors (Whannell for example) bothered me from the beginning with his strained and obviously forced fear. Also, the movie contained too many twists to follow. I myself am a big fan of subplots and twists, but it seemed that right around every corner was a new twinge in the story, connecting more of the characters together. It got to the point where you were tired of trying to figure out ""who done it"" and just wished it would be over and the good guys would win.

When the doctor FINALLY gets round to using the saw his performance is unconvincing and when he crawls around on the floor afterwards you can see that his foot is still clearly attached, just covered by his trousers and fake blood.

It was a horror without needing to be a cliché horror and follow all the rules.<br/><br/>Saw contained a story about Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) who's given a test by an unknown person, to kill the other man in the room, Adam (Leigh Whannell). Adam's test is simply not allow himself to get killed. As the movie progresses, we learn that these two more about each other than they first let on.<br/><br/>Every Halloween, Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures had a new Saw film come out, despite initially that director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell didn't have plans to make a sequel. It eventually grew to a substantial fan base.<br/><br/>By 2005, people had been split into two groups, logical and Gordonites. This was due to the fact that people were displeased with Gordon's fate not being shown or referenced which made people come up with theories for the next five years. Eventually, Saw 3D writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan wrote the character back in, using basically every idiotic idea from the fans over the years.<br/><br/>It ended up ruining my experience of the franchise that I had paid into for the last seven years. I feel cheated knowing I was lied to for the last six years and that Hoffman was the final accomplice to Jigsaw.<br/><br/>It's simply the worst horror franchise to date, thanks to how the writers ruined the whole series by being lazy and using all the fan ideas. Gordon's fate ruined multiple characters including: himself, Jigsaw, Amanda, Hoffman, and Adam. Plus, his fate ruined the storyline of Hoffman and Amanda being an accomplice. It also ruined the history of Jigsaw's work and it ruined a lot of crucial elements such as the timeline and flashbacks.<br/><br/>It could have been the best horror franchise of all time, but with the sloppiness and illogical conclusion it is now the worst."

","This review might be seen by many as blasphemy and I cannot help to change that idea. All I can give is my personal feeling towards the film. <br/><br/>My first and foremost reaction was that the film was poorly acted and poorly written. The major actors in the movie (with the exception of Danny Glover) had no grasp of who their characters were or why the audience should care for their situation. Throughout most of the movie I found myself cringing, not due to the ""graphic"" content, but due to the way actors delivered their horribly written lines.<br/><br/>Any comparisons made to Seven are horrific misrepresentations of this film. While Seven may have had flaws and problems, the sheer horror and chilling atmosphere of the movie made it far superior to the trash that is Saw. Saw merely attempts to rehash this atmosphere, and fails miserably.<br/><br/>One major problem that occurs throughout the film is the dismal acting of Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence). Both characters remain at one, boring, completely unbelievable level from scene to scene, until I found myself not caring whether they live or die at the end. And, given that Whannell helped in writing the script, his performance is that much more tragic.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone who wants to watch Saw: rent Seven and imagine what it would be like if Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman couldn't act."

(maybe he fell asleep).<br/><br/>the acting was the worst i have ever seen in a Hollywood movie! <br/><br/>ppl calling this movie a pycho thriller must get their pycho-analysis done. this movie was complete trash. <br/><br/>a friend was watching the movie, he called me up and recommended it to me..... i no longer watch movies of his choice. i deserve thanks from those who didn't watch the movie after reading this."

","I must say the fuss about all the bad acting was unwarranted. I thought all the players did what they could with what they had. The trouble is movie nerds are almost afraid to disagree with one another these days. My biggest gripe against this movie is the ole' too much plot getting' in the way of the story syndrome. This would of hit so much harder if it were slimmed down to about 80 minutes and somehow excised the character of Zep the orderly and told with more continuity. Good lord this thing was flashing back left and right and sideways too I think. The tension was all in that room with Elwes and the worst actor of the film Whannel. Aside from the creepy car crawl scene, you could just feel the tension alleviate as soon as they took the movie out of that dank hell hole. At any rate I wasn't as disappointed in the acting as I was the way the story was told. Ah well an excellent horror film is coming someday, maybe in James Wans' next effort?"
"MysteryFilm","8","3","4","7 October 2004"," Make this film huge!
","I went to watch this film last night not really expecting much as I haven't heard anything about it. The British press tend to groan about horror films. I was completely blown away at how amazing this film is! Not only is it genuinely frightening and scary, it is clever, original and down right amazing for a first times director and writer to come up with a concept like this. I never write reviews on films but was so impressed with this film I want it to get the recognition it deserves and the box office success too! This film is not for the faint hearted or weak stomached, but if you think you can brave it, then do. We all hear about the ""scariest horror film"" since the exorcist every year, but this really is. It's dark and twisted and is not your usual Happy Hollywood fare. I don't want to give anything away, but the scene in Adam's flat had the entire audience gasping and on the edge of their seats through pure fear! Go see SAW!"
"sean73267326","3","4","6","26 January 2014"," Silly, uninteresting, and badly made.
","I viewed Saw this evening after months of putting it off after buying it. I had bought it originally because so many of my friends had recommended it, saying it was amazing, or on a par with The Silence of The Lambs or Seven. <br/><br/>On viewing I can now confirm that not only does it fail to be on a par with those films, it fails to be on a par with even the most incompetent of Lifetime Movies, or even low budget straight-to-DVD crapfests, which is a pity because at times it's underlying story and ideas are genuinely engaging.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good points though, because there are plenty of them. The bathroom scenes are done in a very well shot and claustrophobic manner which adds a lot to the films atmosphere. Furthermore Danny Glover and Monica Potter both turn in very good performances. Two scenes in particular stand out, as well; Shawnee Smith's scene is shiveringly intense and gleefully nasty, and makes for exciting and vomit-inducing viewing. Secondly, the famous climactic scene is so delirious and well made that it almost redeems the rest of the films and makes it worth the price alone (I won't spoil it). <br/><br/>However, I can't even begin to count the myriad of problems I had with this film so I won't list them all, however my biggest problem is by far the editing. Who's idea was it to show things sped up with rock music playing in the background in the films intense moments? What a way to kill the suspense. Almostall the big horror/bloody scenes lose any potential excitement and intensity due to this silly choice, and not only that, they give the film a cheap and silly feel, almost like a bad music video.<br/><br/>On top of that, the acting from Cary Elwes is dreadful and he is woefully miscast. Throughout the film he seems to have two modes; unbelievably calm, thus ruining the realism, and over-the-top-upset, which generates laughs and ruins the drama. The big reveal, however inventively done, is still so pointless it begs the question of why they even bothered to put it in. Again I won't ruin it, but it just made me go ""meh"".<br/><br/>Overall, as much potential as it had, it's a wet blanket of a film, lacking the thrills to make it a thriller, and the horror to make it a horror. Go rent out Se7en, and save your money."
"nimbleweevil","3","4","6","9 November 2008"," Extreme? Don't make me laugh
","I'll get right to the real reason I hate this film, which is not necessarily because of the concept, the acting, the directing, or a lack of genuine scares. I hate it because it convinced a bunch of idiot kids that they had seen the gut-wrenching of the gut-wrenching when it came to horror films, when they have in fact seen only this, the whitewashed version.<br/><br/>I have heard a lot about how ""original"" the movie concept was. It's not. There were dozens of movies with ""everyone plays everyone else"" themes made before this, many of better conceived. I've also heard a lot about how intriguing the villain was. Persosnally, I can't believe they have now made five full-length films centered around this fellow. He's nothing special; Michael Myers and Norman Bates are more frightening, Regan MacNeil and Damien are more shocking, and Annie Wilkes, Jack Torrance, Lord Summersisle and Hannibal Lecter are all more psychologically mind-numbing.<br/><br/>But more than anything, it bothers me that people have the gall to refer to this as ""extreme cinema."" It tries very hard to be, but it fails; the director and writers are too afraid of what the censors might do to them, and it shows. Saw would be fine and marketable as a good watch on Halloween, but this effort I've seen to paint it as some kind of horrific moral treatise is downright insulting.<br/><br/>Cannibal Holocaust is extreme cinema. Salo is extreme cinema. Mondo Cane is extreme cinema. Irreversible is extreme cinema. In the Realm of the Senses is extreme cinema. Requiem for a Dream is extreme cinema. This is run-of-the-mill horror. Stop trying to make it into what it's not, and then we can assess it appropriately."

","First of all, i have to say that the movie was made well but it wasn't my cup of tea! I really like horror films and I enjoy gore but I just couldn't accept the entire premise and just when I thought I was going to start to appreciate it they threw a wrench into the film that absolutely ruined it for me.<br/><br/>I can accept that Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees are unstoppable forces of Evil. I can accept that Freddie invades our dreams to do his killing. I can even accept a giant lizard with a destruction passion for Tokyo. I couldn't accept a terminally ill guy lying all night in a pool of blood in a cold and abandoned warehouse without so much as a slight twitch to give it all away. The serial killer in this film isn't sub-human or super human, he's just a guy with a disease and it was such a cheap shot that it completely destroyed any real thrill or fear in the film.<br/><br/>Since the whole movie hinges on this key fact, the movie fails miserably for me. I'm glad I saw it...I won't watch it again. Give me Michael, Jason, Freddie or a good Lucio Fulci zombie and I'm a happy camper!!!"
"zpells-1","3","4","6","7 February 2007"," Avoid
","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe how many people think of it as ""one of the greatest horror movies of all time"". The only reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 was because it made be laugh on so many occasions.<br/><br/>Not only is the movie a disgusting snuff film (on several occasions we witness deaths that could have been done without), the writing is absolutely horrendous.<br/><br/>After one of the characters cuts his leg off with a hacksaw (hence ""Saw"") he tells the other character ""I've got to find help soon, or I will die!!"", as if he is completely oblivious to the massive amount of blood draining from the bloody stump.<br/><br/>The quote that 'Jigsaw' ""never actually kills his victims, they kill themselves...he gives them life lessons"" is utterly ridiculous except to the lunatic mind. He sets them up in horrible traps, in which nearly every one is killed, with the lone exception of a woman who is traumatized, and 'surprise!' returns in the next installment as yet another victim!!<br/><br/>How this is supposed to teach a lesson that ""people take life for granted"" is beyond me. After all, covering someone in propellant, in a dark room, forcing them to look for a combination to a safe out of all of thousands of random numbers painted on a wall, by candle light, only to be roasted alive really seems like the perfect way to teach a lesson. <br/><br/>Hmm... Something doesn't seem right about that. Could it be the fact that nearly every one of his victims dies? Or that the only survivor ends up being a victim of him AGAIN?<br/><br/>All in all, this was a completely ridiculous movie. I laughed so hard that I cried, but not ONCE was I scared. If you are looking for a comedy that wasn't originally supposed to be as such, look no further, but for horror, I suggest that you find a different movie."

","(r#51)<br/><br/>What's that you say? Scary? Grisly? Thought-provoking? A psychological thriller? A gory masterpiece? Are you on drugs? It's a really sad state of affairs when most new horror films are so awful that a barely-above-average trash flick like ""Saw"" gets praised because... um... why was this movie popular again? Oh right, because it's ""Saw""! You know, the new horror movie that's sooo indie and sooo controversial and so totally thought-provoking! Snore.<br/><br/>I was so massively disappointed by this movie I don't even know where to begin. This is truly a movie that only the people who put Star Wars III on the top 250 could call great. It makes me want to slit my wrists. Just kidding, I'm not a stupid emo like the Chemical Romance-listening wanna-be ""dark"" punks who probably liked this movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with the so-called controversial aspect of ""Saw"". This was hyped as the grisliest, most disgusting, disturbing thriller since ""Se7en"". It's not - at it's best, ""Saw"" is a bad copy of Se7en. It blatantly tries to copy Fincher's cinematography and style but it has none of his directorial skills. It also lacks Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey. Instead we have some unknown guy and the man whose last major role was as the dorky stepdad in Liar Liar. Oh, I'm sorry. This is after all so totally indie and stuff and I guess they couldn't afford big stars. Well was it too hard to find a cast that could actually act? Cary Elwes whines like a baby throughout most of the film and the dude who plays Adam might be this generation's Ben Affleck. He's so awful at showing emotion he'd do much better as a street mime.<br/><br/>Anyway, where was I? Oh, right. The gore. There's none. Let me read that to you again: THERE IS NO GORE IN SAW. There are five seconds of guts coming out of a stoner's belly. And that's it. That's the ""grisly and disturbing violence"" that Saw has to offer. Maybe the director's cut is grislier, who knows? Otherwise I suggest you watch Braindead. I mean, Quentin Tarantino's CSI episode had more gore than this. And your average episode of Teletubbies is infinitely scarier.<br/><br/>Saw is a pretentious and pointless exercise in death and cynicism. The ending makes absolutely no sense at all - what the hell is the point of spending 16 hours on the floor of a dirty bathroom? Even if you ignore the fact that it would be impossible for anyone to lie perfectly still for that long, there is no logical reason for the killer to do this. But who cares, right? It was totally thought-provoking and mind-blowing and unbelievable and amazing and stuff, dude!<br/><br/>There is some implied violence but it's told in a series of extreme quick cuts that show us nothing that's remotely scary. People (oh, I'm sorry, I meant ""ppl"") on this website are already hailing this as a modern masterpiece and a return to form for horror movies. You know what a conversation about Saw 20 years from now will be like, fanboys? It will go something like this:<br/><br/>""Hey, remember that movie Saw where those two guys where trapped in a bathroom and had to cut their own feet off? With Danny Glover?""<br/><br/>""Uh... no.""<br/><br/>""Oh... OK.""<br/><br/>This is fad at its most faddiest, folks. Don't fall for it. Don't watch it. There is no point. It's not gross enough to shock you. It's not well acted or filmed enough to be engaging. No matter what the fans tell you, there's nothing there. There is no point in Jigsaw's actions. I guess I better quit now - the fans of Saw don't have the patience to finish a review this long. Stick with the ""THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!"" five sentence opuses. I dare any intelligent person, who has seen scarier horror films than Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, to enjoy this.<br/><br/>""Hey, man, this review sucks, let's go watch Saw III!""<br/><br/>""Yeah! I heard there's a guy in it who has to choose between shoving a rusty nail through his eyelid or dying from a kerosene explosion!""<br/><br/>""AWESOME!"""

","Saw's trailer did get me a little bit excited. I had seen Se7en recently and since I was amazed at it, it was only natural I wanted to see more like it. However, I didn't bother to see this is a theater. I only just now rented the DVD.<br/><br/>It starts off kinda promising, with the room and the setup, and I liked the stories of the other victims of Jigsaw, but a good concept is not enough to cover the clichés, the sad acting, the bad pacing, the plot holes, and worst of all, the horrible camera-work. It might be original, but there's a reason no-one has done it before; it sucks.<br/><br/>The speed-up technique used to ""pump"" the intense moments takes whatever coolness they could have had and turns it into more of a head-ache. Especially the car chase looks really retarded.<br/><br/>In the end, we are rewarded with a sad excuse of a plot twist that was pretty easy to spot. I knew it from before, but my brother had never heard the story but he was onto it almost from the beginning. A lot of questions arise too, due to the sloppy script-writing. Why do that? Why wait so long? Why make this movie? In the end, Saw is nothing more than a quick cash-in at Se7en's popularity. It's much talked-about gore and sadism is weak and those who has seen good horror will not flinch or even care. Don't bother."
"markcody","3","4","6","6 May 2006"," SPOILER ALERT - Stuff that just didn't make any sense!!!
","I avoided watching this movie for the longest because I'm not attracted to the graphic violent stuff, but after being prodded by friends, I decided to stomach through it.<br/><br/>The movie was sickening but not as bad as I thought (except for the key in the stomach scene, that was pretty awful).<br/><br/>Couple things just didn't make sense, starting with ""Saw"" being the ""dead guy"" in the middle of the floor. If I'm chained to a pipe for six hours, I'm gonna notice whether a guy is breathing or not. No way to fake death like that for that amount of time. One character even remarks on seeing a dead body for the first time, and how still the body is. This was a lame way of throwing us (the audience) off the dead guy as being the ""murderer"" sense we had to accept the premise that the body in fact was not moving. A virtual impossibility sense breathing is required of any body that is actually not ""dead"". This was lame.<br/><br/>Another thing that blew it for me was , if I'm the mom who just escaped and saved my daughter from certain death, I'm not gonna stand there with the gun on the killer, waiting for him to take it back. I'm gonna fill the son of a b*** with holes... that's just me. My wife in fact went crazy during this scene yelling, ""shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em!!!"" <br/><br/>And perhaps the most bizarre scene was when the doctor was reaching for the ringing cell phone. Come on!!! He had already advised Adam to ""use his shirt"" when trying to reach the tape recorder earlier in the film. The cell phone would have been even easier to reach with a shirt than was the tape recorder. I thought the doctor realized this when he actually started removing his shirt, but instead, he uses his shirt as a tourniquet as he proceeds to saw off his foot. This was completely lame and contradictory... it took me completely out of the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, it wasn't scary at all. It was just a ""gross-out"" movie. Remember the scene where the guy digs a round in fecal matter searching for a clue. How many of us wouldn't have started with the tank water first, never mind the fact that this is where the heart was actually painted.<br/><br/>There was some other stuff that simply didn't add up, but these were perhaps the big three."
"simonchristoffersen","3","4","6","1 February 2006"," The movie about blood
","This movie is first and foremost, brutal and gory. None of the other aspects of film-making seems to be important in this film compared to the huge attention the director has put into making this movies scenes as sickening as possible.<br/><br/>Movies such as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs has shown that extreme gore and violence can be used to create scary and suspenseful films. However, in Saw the bloody scenes are not scary, neither do they contribute in any positive way to enhance the experience of the film. They serve only to invoke a gut response from the audience. The main purpose of the film is to be disgusting, and as such it is fairly successful, however one should not confuse gory with scary. The best thing I can say about the scenes in the film, is that they are extreme - they serve well to show the insane situations that the victims find themselves in.<br/><br/>But the film is just not scary, nor does it posses any other major qualities, exactly because it focuses so much on pointless gore. In my opinion the huge fascination shows a perverse fascination on violence, without any real understand into what violence really is.<br/><br/>I give the film 3/10 - since it did provoke me enough to write this review."

"RainWeirdo","4","4","6","15 August 2005"," Call me crazy, but...
","I'm really and honestly a bit in awe of this movie's high rating on the IMDb, especially in comparison to some other, and in my opinion, better horror movies. Sorry to say it, but I think this movie sucked, all the more so because I went with somewhat high hopes and because a very good thriller could have been made from this quite inventive and interesting scenario. Before everyone starts posting a bunch of worthless insults and saying I didn't get it or I don't know horror movies, let me just lay out some of my criticisms: Within the first five minutes I was chuckling at the acting and the lines. Whannel actually faired a little better against the more veteran Elwes, who was so over-emotive and so miscast I felt a bit sorry just having to watch him, unfortunate since I've liked him in other movies. The dialogue lacked really any kind of subtlety, and while I understand the necessity to introduce the killer through flashbacks and memories of reading the newspaper, the way it was done seemed so contrived it was like watching a puppetmaster pulling strings. It's a case of show vs. tell, I think. The dialogue seemed to be grudgingly forcing the plot along inch by inch rather than letting it develop.<br/><br/>Then we have the scenes involving the other victims: Was no one else annoyed by the sudden and jarring use of ultra fast MTV-motion and pointlessly loud music? I think these scenes would've been better played out much more slowly, wherein every second that passed becomes just that, one second closer to a horrifying death, one more ratchet of tension in which the audience could have felt the torment I'm sure the victims were. Something tells me those victims would have felt every second pass in those situations.<br/><br/>Danny Glover's character seemed to be a very unprofessional cop. Anyone involved in any aspect of investigation would know Dr. Gordon's pen appearing at the scene, while odd, is purely circumstantial, and not reason to start an obsessive and far from legal stalking of the guy. In this kind of case a cop would have relied much more on forensic data and psychological profiling. Yeah, I guess his mind snapped a little upon seeing his partner so brutally dispatched, but... I just didn't believe this character. Likewise to the wife and daughter, who were so underdeveloped, and whose only chances at development were robbed by Dr. Gordon's disdain or at least disregard for his family that I just didn't care what happened to them in the end, nor did I believe Dr. Gordon's sudden impulse to lop off his own leg in an attempt to save them.<br/><br/>Aside from these, there were just too many contrivances and errors along the way. How could Whannel have woken up submerged in water without having drowned? How would a medical doctor not recognize that the dead body on the floor was not dead? What did Jigsaw have against Zapp (name?), who was the only character who was interested in or kind to him? Could Dr. Gordon really not think of a better way to get that phone? Would that cell phone really work in that buried basement, and would it work only on the plot-dictated occurrences that it did? Why were Whannel and Elwes the only victims to have a long, drawn-out, two person situation? On the plus side, I do think the initial idea is quite inventive, and, although in retrospect the ending doesn't seem to add up logically, the finale of Saw does stick in my mind as being the one part I thought was really fairly well done. The image of Jigsaw standing up, his last look at Whannel, the implied but not shown final fates of our two main characters -- this whole sequence was quite tense and a really unexpected bit of icing on the cake after my expectations for the movie had dropped so low throughout the rest of the viewing. It just seems to me that a much better movie could have been made, the situation offers ample opportunity for a strongly character driven movie, while the outside situations could provide for sequences of unbearable tension, by a more seasoned and talented director of suspense with better dialoague at his disposal and the ability to elicit better performances from less miscast actors.<br/><br/>Tell me, am I really wrong in thinking it strange that this is the most talked about horror movie to come out in years... or has American horror just really gone so far down hill? And tell me also, what is it exactly that everyone saw in this movie that I didn't that sets it so far apart from all the other horror movies and thrillers of recent years? I really am quite curious.<br/><br/>""Toy-like people made me boy-like."""

","This movie was awful. Anyone who liked it was overlooking details that make it impossible and stupid. I guess it was entertaining if you look past all that, but who can? But most of the scenes were comical, not really scary, just freaky. First of all, why is it that when someone in a movie has the villain cornered, they don't shoot them? How many times does this happen in movies? It's ridiculous and overdone. If it was real life, that person would be dead. I hope Hollywood will get a clue and stop putting this movie ruining event in scripts. Also, if the guy in the middle of the floor is the killer the whole time, why the hell didn't the two guys notice this? Wouldn't he have to breathe or slightly move? I seriously doubt he would never move in 8 hours. Also, if he's in the hospital, wouldn't they notice he left? How would he have time to commit murders while in the hospital? Also, why would Zep do anything this guy said if the killer's in the room with the other two? Why would he so passionately work against the cop and Dr. Gordon's family? No, this wouldn't happen. Zep would go to the police when he got a chance. He'd get an antidote for the poison because doctors in the hospital are smart enough to figure it out.<br/><br/>This movie is beyond stupid and an insult to movie watchers' intelligence."
"squeezebox","4","4","6","6 March 2005"," Another disappointment to add to the heap of modern ""horror""
","SAW looks great. The filmmakers went to great lengths to create a seedy, grindhouse look for their movie and they have succeeded admirably. There are some genuinely creepy moments, and a couple of nice surprises along the way. And there's also a terrific ending, which briefly makes the movie seem much better than it really was.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems that they spent so much time making their movie look the part, they forgot three key ingredients: direction, a script and acting. The production design and cinematography are the real stars here, and everything else takes a back seat.<br/><br/>Let's start with the awful screenplay. Leigh Whannel's screen-writing skills are almost as bad as his acting ability. You sit and watch one good idea wasted after another. In an attempt to add (unecessary) twists and turns in the story, Whannel ruins golden opportunities for suspense and shocks. (SPOILER) The ""jaw device"" scene is totally ruined by the fact that we know the victim survived her encounter. No suspense is created, because we know she'll get out of it, and her cutting into a live person to retrieve the key to the device isn't shocking or horrific, because we know nothing about the other victim. He's just some guy.<br/><br/>Most of the dialog between Cary Elwes and Whannel is dreadful. How can you get wrapped up in a situation if you don't believe the characters? ""Who are you?"" Elwes asks. Whannel manically answers ""Mr. Pretty F***ing Confused, nice to meet you!"" Give me a break, please? Can't people simply talk anymore? Does every line of dialog have to be a one-liner?<br/><br/>Elwes has received much criticism for his performance, which is odd, as he delivers one of the stronger performances in the movie. Whannel flounders uncomfortably, giving Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee a run for their money in the category of people who should NEVER appear in their own movies. The normally reliable Danny Glover turns in perhaps the worst performance of his career.<br/><br/>The direction is another problem. This movie has none. It just jerks from one scene to another, with no rhyme or reason, almost as though director James Wan believes that sloppy storytelling and disruptive editing will make the movie more gritty and surreal. It doesn't do anything except make it look as though Wan doesn't know what to do. The movie doesn't even really have any scenes, but a series of set-pieces linked together by the most rudimentary dialog and plot contrivances Whannel to muster.<br/><br/>As I said before, the ending is great. I did not see it coming and I admire being caught off guard. And I enjoyed SAW more than many other so-called horror movies I've seen in recent years. But filmmakers like Wan and Whannel have to learn that if they intend to stand on the shoulders of giants such as Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper and David Fincher, they have to do more than simply try to emulate their respective styles. These filmmakers' movies had more going for them than good set design, claustrophobic photography and gruesome special effects.<br/><br/>SAW has ONLY those things. And that's not enough."
"maximillion89","3","4","6","5 March 2005"," Plot holes sink ""Saw""
","I caught this movie for free and have to say that I liked it for the first half. The second half sent me into a whirlwind of confusion and anger, mainly caused by the stupidity of the main characters.<br/><br/>This movie was what you might call plot heavy, and while some say this is its biggest asset, it is also its downfall. Everyone comments that it is just like Seven, and I can't disagree there. The basic idea is just like Seven.<br/><br/>However, the screenwriters failed to hammer out the little details of plot, and this is where it all falls apart. Having just finished watching the movie twenty minutes ago, I feel I have everything fresh in my head. So here goes, a list of plot holes in this movie.<br/><br/>1. The biggest and best hole is that the two characters trapped in the bathroom had no less than eight hours to figure a way out, and plenty of tools at their disposal. Yes, one of them had a family that was being kept hostage, but they could've turned off the lights or something. Also, whenever Adam or Larry try to saw through the chains, they always go at it like they were trying to saw off a tree branch. I'm sure that if they'd had a little more patience and kept their cool, they would have been able to figure out how to get through thick chains or locks with even a thin-bladed saw. Every chain has a weak link, just like this movie.<br/><br/>2. Danny Glover's character and partner are complete idiots when they zero in on the perp's lair. Why don't they call for backup? Once they have the place in sight, and know the guy's there, why not call for backup even then? Why didn't they bring in their radios or cell phones? How could the perp take a shotgun blast and get right back up (or if he was faking, how could he fall at exactly the right moment). And more importantly, WHY DID GLOVER'S CHARACTER NOT JUST SHOOT THE BASTARD WHEN HE HAD THE CHANCE, HAD A SHOTGUN ON HIM AND THE GUY IN THE CHAIR WAS GONNA BE OK? He had a split second there, and didn't even bother.<br/><br/>3. Okay, by the end of the movie we've discovered that Zepp had poison in his blood. Huh? What kind of poison was that again? It's never explained, except that it is supposed to be slow acting. Does that mean it's slow acting as in a matter of hours, days, or weeks? Because if it isn't going to kill him in the next day or two, then what's the big rush??? Zepp then has plenty of time to figure out a way around the poison instead of holding the Good Doc's family at gunpoint. Yeesh.<br/><br/>4. Seeing Glover's detective with all the stories pinned up on the wall gave me the impression that the other cops had already given up finding Jigsaw, or that all the other crimes were already 'solved' to the police's satisfaction. Just how else is it that the rogue detective is the only one still chasing Jigsaw? We've seen from serial murder cases here in the U.S. that the police rarely give up, even after 30 years.<br/><br/>5. By the end of the movie, it's revealed that the killer had an inoperable brain tumor, hence the motivation for trying to make others appreciate life more. Okay, I can buy all that appreciating life stuff, but what I can't buy is that someone who has a brain tumor would be functioning well enough to create all these complex schemes and carry them out without getting caught at least ONCE. Just what kind of brain tumor was that again? Was it malignant or benign...because if it's malignant, then the Jigsaw would have died after only a few victims (it's in the brain, after all), or he would be a vegetable. (And there would't be years of stories to make about him for the detective to put on his wall!) If it's benign, then there's no fuss.<br/><br/>6. And the worst ending of all time. Just how in the blazes does a person lie absolutely still on the floor of a dirty bathroom for hours on end? Especially a person with a brain tumor! I'd really like to know what part of the brain that tumor's on, guys, because some parts of the brain, when touched or pushed on by a stimulus (such as a tumor might be!) will actually make your limbs move, or make you say a certain word! It's been scientifically proved.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ, do not see this movie. It would be an offense to the intelligence of Koko the Gorilla, let alone a normal human being. (And Koko likes breasts too!) Possibly the only redeeming value of this flick is that it has great camp and after you figure out how dumb all the characters really are, you can start enjoying it for being bad."

","Saw: two men trapped in a room, with 6 hours left to save a family in a ""Homo homini Lupus"" situation. And a serial Killer who likes to play with his victims. A cop (Danny Glover) chasing him.

BUT, and I'm very very tired of this... for God sake, if you have the killer in front of you, and your shotgun points towards him... look at him! shoot him! this film is full of this stupid clichés, evident sign of a poor script! There are so many bloopers in the film that is very difficult to count them! And they aren't simple bloopers like Pulp Fiction's hamburger's bite, they are real script awful errors! Hollywood' thrillers have had a great time some years ago, and Saw tries to renew this times... but with no ideas. At all.

Game over!"" Another important quote is: "" I am so sick of people who don't appreciate their blessings"" To me this shows that he is very big on appreciating life and everything you have and that you should never take it for granted because some people are stuck with nothing or have a short life.<br/><br/>I think that Adam is going to live because the whole movie was based on him because if you look at it this way the whole movie started with him in the bathtub and he wouldn't have been the one who was left alive in the end or the one who got the key in the bathtub.<br/><br/>I really think that Saw was a great movie!!"

","This film is host to some of the most contemptible 'acting' ever captured on celluloid, especially that of Cary Elwes, who offers a performance so staggeringly awful that every scene with him in (most of them, unfortunately) is a potential side-splitter. The sheer awesomeness of his inability to plausibly affect emotion is astounding; they might as well have cast Tom Green in the central role. Mind you, Elwes isn't helped by some of the most unbelievable and quite frankly atrocious dialogue I've ever come across in a movie. OK, so it's a horror film, I didn't expect Shakespeare, but I did expect some at least vaguely convincing character exchanges. Even the ever-dependable Danny Glover struggles with dire-logue this ludicrous. All of which makes me wonder bewilderingly how this film received such critical praise. To quote but one example, The Guardian newspaper in its review stated: ""perhaps you enjoyed 'Seven'. This goes up to 'Eight'."" How the film review section of such a prestigious newspaper could even compare the magnificent 'Seven' to this vile entity is beyond my grasp. If you watch horror films merely for guts and gore and don't really care for characterisation, halfway decent scripting and actors who can actually act, 'Saw' is the film for you. However, if you enjoy intelligent, well-acted, brilliantly-scripted psychological think-pieces then you're much better off with 'Seven.'"

","I had no idea of the story before I was going to watch it. I thought it was about a killer with a saw and killing teenagers just like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it turned out to be so different & unpredictable than any other horror movie it definitely took horror genre to a new level! The film is much more eerie & psychological than scary basically it plays with your mind mostly in the scenes were: <br/><br/>1. The guy Paul trapped in razor wire & was constantly cutting himself to get out.<br/><br/>2. Where Amanda had the reverse bear trap in her mouth.<br/><br/>3. When Dr. Gordon was sawing his foot that has to be the most horrifying scene. <br/><br/>4. When Adam was constantly pounding Zep with the toilet lid until it smashed.<br/><br/>A couple of scenes were quite boring when Dr. Gordon was telling the story about him where he was in the car park and Adam's story when he was in his apartment just before his kidnapping. Their are a lot of mistakes in the film like: <br/><br/>1. They cannot saw off the chains but they can saw the pipe because it was really rusty & pipes are hollow it shouldn't take them longer than an hour.<br/><br/>2. How did Jigsaw put an electrical currant through the pipes in a bathroom?<br/><br/>3. If the 2 men were in a bathroom for more than 6 hours doing nothing than talking to each other & looking at the dead body they should of noticed him breathing.<br/><br/>4. If you try to saw off your foot you faint of shock before it reaches the bone & you bleed to death straight away.<br/><br/>5. Zep was doing all this because he was poisoned & wanted the antidote it's not a big deal just go to the hospital.<br/><br/>Overall its a good film and I liked it because of its ending it has to be the best twist I ever seen in any film. When Adam killed Zep I was saying to my self ""It that it nothing great about it"" but when he pulled the tape recorder and played it my eyes expanded & I put the volume up a bit higher then the dead body raised and he turned out to be Jigsaw I almost fell off my seat. The corpse was there right in front of the audience the whole time & we never even suspected about it. Saw is amazingly shot in 18 days with a budget of $1.2 million & grossed almost about $103 million worldwide making it a huge hit."

I do respect Elwes, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he's strapped for cash. However, the acting was pretty bad, overall--even his. Many, many inconsistencies in the plot. The ending is totally unconvincing. There are a few interesting turns--it kept my curiosity peaked for about 2/3rds the way through, but after it was all over, I was just irritated.

There are two cops investigating these weird murders where other people have found themselves in similar situations and died.<br/><br/>One of the cops is the Mel Gibson's partner in Lethal Weapon. There are a couple of other recognisable faces, like the other cop was in Red Dragon and the doctor guy was Hot Shots. But the performances they give are so bad it made me want to kill myself. If you think Keanue Reeves is a wooden actor, wait till you see these guys, oh boy.<br/><br/>The direction was crap, the screenplay was crap, the scripting was crap, the acting was crap, the plot was crap, this film was just crap. If you don't want to be scared, and you like a plot with more holes than a dead gangster then this is one for you.

I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters was acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. The plot have some major holes in it and the characters are so, so stupid in their actions. Why couldn't the cops track the killer down after the incident involve Danny glover and his partner, aren't everything about the killer right at hand in that lair? Or why in god's name did the killer decide to lay uncomfortably in the bathroom with his two victims instead of watching it else where a tad more relaxing?

Cary Elwes tries, but does not succeed, often due to the script, written by co-star Leigh Wannell. Leigh's acting and writing were equally disgusting.

The film is neither gruesome nor scary (if you want gruesome and scary check out the Japanese flick ""Audition"" or any other number of horror films). Some directors will never realize that mood sets up the scares; fake blood and feet and heads, and whatever else are not scary on their own.

"j30bell","6","5","9","3 March 2005"," Great horror, but is ultimately lacking in purpose
","Considering it is by some margin the best contribution to American horror since Se7en, Saw is a strangely unengaging film.<br/><br/>It is certainly slick enough. Throwing you right into the action you awake, along with the lead character (Adam) in a Fincher-esque, dingy underground bathroom/dungeon. You soon find Adam is not alone. Across the room another is another man. Both are chained by the ankle, taken by the mysterious jigsaw killer. The room contains a dead body, a gun and two saws. To survive, one of the men must kill the other by 6pm. If not, both die. Problem is, the saws won't cut the chains. To make it out, you must not only be prepared to kill; you also have to saw off your own footNice.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are some good, if not terribly subtle, twists in the film; told mainly through the flashbacks of Adam's fellow captive, Lawrence. And the film has one or two moments that will be relished by the gore-fest lovers. There is some pretty good acting here too, especially from Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Danny Glover (Detective Tapp).<br/><br/>The problem mainly lies in the fact that the film is such an obvious homage to Se7en - many of stylistic devices very reminiscent of the Fincher film  without any of the substance. Fincher manages the neat trick of wallowing in the murky side of the human psyche while appearing appalled by it as well. Saw just seems to revel in the brutality. If you're expecting moments that force the audience to be introspective, you won't find them here. Saw just isn't interested in discussing apathy, or greed or even the value of life that the killer talks about. The jigsaw killer is just another sick f*ck, complete with Thomas Harris name, eerie doll, dank warehouse apartment and kitsch slasher movie hang-outs (like subterranean car parks).<br/><br/>All this leaves the film feeling a bit devoid of purpose. In style very much life Se7en, in execution, more like Friday 13th. Which is a shame, because there really is much to enjoy here if you're a fan of the red stuff. 6/10"

","If a rabbit pooped in the woods and a bunch of art critics determined it was a great work of art, would it really be art or rabbit poop? That is the problem with this movie. It was so heavily hyped that i assumed it would be worthwhile. But, when i actually sat down to watch it, it was-in fact- a big pile of rabbit poop.<br/><br/>The screenwriters have obviously never had a realistic conversation. The dialogue was trite and predictable. They were more distracted by horrific acts of torture than actual plot. While the common complaint about horror movies is that they are just gore with no substance, SAW would be worthwhile if we just admitted that it was gore for the sake of two Austrailian film students getting off. The film style was that of a bad Lifetime Made-for-TV movie and the ""plot-twist"" at the end was just unfair. It was barely a step above of saying all these horrible things are happening because a drunk squirrel got run over outside of Home Depot. It made no sense. <br/><br/>The biggest victim of this movie(other than me for actually watching it) is Cary Elwes' career. What was once a spotless resume has now been forever stained by the skid marks of this terrible piece of celluloid. Danny Glover should also be chastised but he was not the one who agreed to sit in a room chained to a pipe screaming into a cell phone.

The only dilemma the audience faces is which of them they'd like to see die first, and how. Sadly (and I don't feel it's a spoiler to reveal this), my prayers to see the irritating b*****d doctor - played by (or should that be carved from) Cary Elwes - being flayed alive with a pair of rusty toenail clippers by a crazed Nicky Campbell went cruelly unanswered.<br/><br/>A word of advice: don't be fooled by comparisons with Seven. The Guardian's review of Saw gave it 4 stars (bewilderingly out of 5, not 100) and concluded: ""Perhaps you enjoyed Se7en. This often goes up to Ei8ht.""

","Based on the comments of many acquaintances and friends of mine, I bought this DVD expecting an original and violent thriller. However, the tense beginning and the unexpected twist in the last scene are the great parts of this very sick movie, with a screenplay full of clichés and flaws. I was very irritated with many sequences along the story, such as, for example, when the killer was dominated by the detectives, and escaped from them. In a situation like that, the minimum they should do would be to shot one of the criminal's legs, shot the threatening drills and give attention to the victim. Later, when Alison Gordon fights with the killer, I believe any mother would immediately shot the bastard to protect her daughter and herself but Alison. Last but not the least, when Detective David Tapp chases the killer in the tunnels of the sewage plant, he prefers to fight with the sick guy instead of shooting him. The lack of credibility of these scenes really made me mad and upset with this movie. The comparison of ""Saw"" with ""Seven"" is simply ridiculous.

Nobody wins. Most of the characters end up dead. I suppose we can be glad the kid wasn't shot, but then some guy hacked off his own ankle, which kinda evens that out. It's frustrating because it's so well made but just...eats away at your soul for two hours. It causes no lasting damage, but you come away wondering what sort of mind could come up with something like this. And then make a sequel. And announce a third.<br/><br/>Clever, well-made, exciting and scary, Saw is definitely worth watching and creates a lasting impression."

","I saw this movie premier night at the local theater when I was 14. I was beyond thrilled to watch this movie. I was prepared for a visceral jaw-dropping experience, a middle finger waving anti-hero to Hollywood, a punishing Tour de Force that would kick my butt. Instead, what I got, was a 100 minute Nine Inch Nails music video with a ""THEN WHO WAS PHONE?"" twist every 10-or-so minutes. <br/><br/>Saw is an infernal editing fiasco imitating Chris Cunningham with jump cuts every 5 seconds, but with that it already has the gory visuals and gross subject matter, so it becomes way too excessive, like someone adding 3 packets of sugar to their Mountain Dew. To insult the senses even further, I'm being punished with a strobe-light flashback and audio clip of every single little twist that unfolds; and at that point I'm thinking that I really don't care what kind of twist gets thrown at me. The actor/co-writer Leigh Whannel does a solid job playing Adam. Carey Elwes, the man playing Dr. Gordon couldn't decide if he was a<br/><br/>blacksmith from the Old West, a Brit or a property manager from upstate New York; his acting was awful. The setup in the beginning is promising, but it's just a constant strobe light of gore, screams of agony, and loud noises. <br/><br/>The thing that had me excited for the film, was the scene with Amanda. They show a small part of Amanda's bear trap scene in the teaser, and I was sold. What I didn't realize was that abrasive ultraviolence industrial-music ridden strobe light style editing would take up almost the entire movie. <br/><br/>And to think I was a gorehound 14 year old who loved horror, I would hate this movie. I still do, and am ashamed that this become such a hit that it would spawn another half a dozen movies and a video game; tragic!"

"klosterfelder","1","4","7","18 February 2006"," Horrible, at best
","The trouble with so-called horror flicks nowadays is that they're not scary. Worse yet, not only are they not scary but they're just downright boring, making it difficult for it to make that subtle yet delicious passage from bad to funny. ""Saw"", I wish I never did. At the eleventh minute of this snore-fest, I knew I was in for no treat. Yet the premise could have rendered an interesting story and maybe even some character development. It fails where movies like ""Cube"", for example, succeeded. It uses the psychological characteristics of each character, what makes them tick, to make the story move forward. This movie relies heavily on long, uninteresting flashbacks in which we learn surprising facts like: doctors are cold, calculating people with little or no hearts. Or: police officers are strong, willing, dedicated Americans, who will go to the fringe of madness and beyond to save a few lives. Or yet again: private detective artist-wannabe photographers live in rundown, crummy buildings, try to look cool and smoke cigarettes.<br/><br/>The first and foremost problem with ""Saw"" is that its creators like horror flicks but don't really know how to write beyond a paint-by-number model of flavour-of-the-month genre flicks. It's a little bit of Japanese-horror, a little bit of Poe, a little bit of snuff, a little bit of Cronenberg. And a lot of this thrown together yields crap. Although it might have been otherwise. ""Saw"" seems to feel like it has to please a certain number of crowds all at once, the most obvious being pseudo metal-heads McFarlane-toys collecting types. With its ""dirty"" Ringu-type aesthetic, and its incomprehensibly reccurent ""trashy"" 1990's goth-video fast-forward effects, ""Saw"" stumbles in the dark, looking for something to hang on to that will stick. I could go on and on here, but just thinking about this film leaves me perplexed.<br/><br/>Finally, why is it that in films like this (think ""Identity"", although that on was somewhat more watchable, or ""Haute Tension"") the culprit is always the guy you least expect? Oh, right, the dude hidden in the closet in the first frame of the twenty-third second of the film. I'm so surprised and shocked. Gee, he was there all along? What a maniac! Why the hell would a guy (who's what, pretending to be a cancer patient? Actually dying? I don't even want to know) go to all that trouble with the complicated traps and the Blade-Runner-rip-off dolls to teach people a good lesson about life. ""Oh, you're so ungrateful that you're alive"" Hell yes, I'm grateful I didn't shoot myself halfway through this junkheap. I would rather there be no explanation at all as to who is the killer than have a half-assed explanation...or I would just rather the guy be completely out of his mind for no apparent reason, or like he lost his job in a pig-slaughtering factory, like in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (NOT the remake).<br/><br/>I thought ""Mindhunters"" was horrible, and then I saw ""Saw"". But at least, the former was funny.<br/><br/>Also, if this movie had been a play, it would have been 30 times better. Just one room, two guys tied up. One single angle. Period.<br/><br/>Finally, Cary Elwes is incredibly bad in this. Actually, for the first 45 minutes of the film I was like, ""He kinda looks like the guy from 'Princess Bride'"". And then I realized he was. And I was sad.<br/><br/>Finally finally, I'm only giving this movie a 1 out of 10 because IMDb won't let me put a zero there. And because there was the one scene where the photographer guy flashes his light in his apartment which I thought was okay, cause the writers actually gave the character some consideration at that point and made him act accordingly.<br/><br/>That is all."

The sequel is already a big hit and SAW 3 is probably in the works right now.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe a film like SAW has created so much buzz. The film is mediocre at best and the idea is NOT original at all. Just take a pinch of ""Texas ChainSAW Massacre"" and combine it with ""THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES"" and there you go, you have SAW. I'm shocked by how much SAW rips-off its ideas from other film, certainly from the brilliant DR. PHIBES. Taking ideas from other sources is nothing new but most of the time they never work, and here, in this case, personally, they don't work because the film is cheap, cheap, cheap.<br/><br/>The film has zero style; the music, editing, dialogue: crap; the acting is truly horrible; sets look like, well, cheap sets; and the tension or suspense or the gory moments are all facile and cheap. I mean, kidnapping a mother and her daughter and threatening them throughout the film. So F'N' lazy.<br/><br/>SAW has a ""surprise ending"", which is probably why this film has become such a hit (like SIXTH SENSE and other films with tedious ""surprise endings""...) but the ending was hardly a surprise, certainly if you have seen tons other films with actual surprise endings.<br/><br/>The state of horror films today is truly sad if this is considered the best thing around."

The masked killer speaks to his intended victims through some type of voice-altering electronic sound device to disguise his real voice, and proceeds to teach his human quarry a few valuable lessons about...whatever it is they're supposed to have learned and known already. <br/><br/>You may recognize some of the lead and supporting players in this one, such as Cary Elwes (as opposed to his less serious role in the children's comedy ""The Princess Bride"") and Shawnee Smith (an '80s horror veteran due to her debut in ""The Blob"" remake). <br/><br/>Throughout the course of ""Saw"" the plot gets sort-of muddled and just the tiniest bit exasperating to (this) viewer's more rational senses.

Cary Elwes delivers one of the single worst performances I've ever seen from an actor over the age of 8. Some of his moments are laugh out loud funny, he's so egregiously bad. He should be embarrassed, given all the acting experience he's had. Leigh Whannell, with much less experience, is better, but only marginally. Some of his moments are also laughably bad. Together with a plot that quickly becomes insipid, and dialog that sounds as if it were written by a high school dropout, Saw is a pathetic example of its genre. More than that, the favorable reviews of it here on IMDb are an example of how idiotic the movie watching public has become. I can't believe Danny Glover associated himself with this. He should summarily fire his agent."

Was he like ""hey guy, could you get your hands on some poison for me? Okay thanks. Lay down and let me inject you with it. Thanks. Now kill these people for me. Great.""

I would say I made it about three-quarters of the way through... but every time I would start to connect with the characters, every time something started to develop, they would switch scenes, shift gears, and lose me. I couldn't connect with the actors as characters, because just when I felt they were expressing real emotion, either dialog or over-acting would get in my way, and remind me that I was just watching a movie.<br/><br/>Gruesomeness is NOT a prerequisite in a thriller.

The space between him and the open door of the cell is covered with a dense web of barbed wire. Then, he sees a voice recorder. When he presses play, a recorded voice calls him by his name and tells him that he recently committed suicide, and that now is the time to know whether he really wanted to die that day or was just trying to attract some attention. If he really wants to die, all he needs to do is to just sit there and wait. But, if he wants to live, he has to go through the web of barbed wires. Moreover, he has to do that within two hours, because the door of the dungeon is on a timer.<br/><br/>Putting a person to such a painful test is hard to justify. But, John relies on the assumption that ""those who don't appreciate life do not deserve life"" - the idea being that the gift of life is precious, and that one needs to appreciate the beauty of every moment. He thus chooses somewhat lost and unappreciative souls, and tries to make them come to the realization of that particular truth about their lives. He does this by designing a game, and putting them in it. Each game is a matter of life and death. Yet John claims that he never murdered anyone, since his test subjects always had the chance to survive.<br/><br/>In a way, John plays God - that is, his tests involve pain, suffering, and death. There are warnings, awards and punishments. And, not playing the game is not an option.<br/><br/>Serdar Kaya"

","You wake up. You're in room with two other guys. One of them is dead. You are trapped to the wall by a chain on your ankle. You have no idea how you got there. Imagine that. Now imagine that getting much, much worse. And you have Saw. Saw is brilliant. It has no cheap twists or turns. No clichés, which are often unavoidable in the genre. And the whole film, as a horror flick, is a refreshing break from the plentiful jump scares that other films are so prominent in using. This film is frightening. It is gruesome. It is creepy. You never find that in horror films nowadays. Even in the sequels that follow this film, they are burdened by cheap and exhausted trends that, yes, may be frightening, but never do they leave you thinking ""I didn't see that coming"" or simply leave you with your jaw hanging as much as this film does. Saw also benefits from it's truly human characters. Characters that are flawed, troubled and real. Characters who move along the way with you. Instead of the classic ""Don't open closet, don't open the closet"" feel you get from some movies, Saw puts you there with character, totally okay with opening the closet until you realize it was an awful decision. The entire film digs at you, unsettles you, makes absolutely sure that your uneasy. It doesn't hesitate in pulling the carpet from under your feet. So many horror films make you chase them. They make you panic for answers. You are scared. Saw doesn't do this however. Saw grabs you by the ankle and drags you in until your just as captive as it's characters. You are amazed. Watching Saw alone, in the dark, late at night is how it should be watched. Otherwise you'll miss the full experience that this film proves to be. To all you horror fans out there, go watch this movie right now. To all of those who don't enjoy horror films, swallow the lump in your throat and do the same."

","""Saw"", the first entry of this ""horror"" franchise, and it is also the best. That being said, this movie is not very good.<br/><br/>The plot from this movie is quite similar to ""Se7en"", though this is not so good and well developed as the film directed by David Fincher. I've got mixed feelings about the visual style of the first ""Saw"" On one side, the sceneries and the atmosphere were disturbingly beautiful, but on the other side, the edition (Heavily influenced by MTV music videos) is horrible, annoying and distracting. I think that the performances weren't so bad (A bit hammy, if anything) but most of the lines of the script were incredibly cheesy or exaggerated. On the other side, the plot twist at the end is just forced and laughable, being the worst part of the entire movieAnd sadly, that's the trademark element in the whole franchise, getting worse and worse with each installment.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is not so original or innovative as some critics saidIs just merely watchable, with a few nice sequences. (The first scene was pretty good, then everything goes downhill from there) At least this is not a complete waste of time as the sequels, or even worse, the atrocious ""Hostel"" film."
"Nell_Smith","1","3","5","11 January 2012"," Ridiculous and impossible - and a straight rip-off of Mad Max (a GOOD film)
","OK, the usual horror stuff. I usually avoid this kind of nonsense nowadays, having been saturated with the horror genre during its true heyday throughout the 1980s. Always the same: blood, gore, nastiness, psycho serial killer, obsessed detective(s), more blood, more gore, so-called plot twist that is blindingly obvious, yada yada, blah blah.<br/><br/>But seriously, apart from being as unoriginal as this kind of film usually is, ""Saw"" is one huge rip-off from the very start. Is everyone on IMDb so young as to have failed to watch ""Mad Max"" - an actually GOOD film - which was such a worldwide hit in the 1980s and is still one of cinema's all-time classics?! For those who are either too young (or too forgetful) to know just HOW big of a rip-off this crummy film is, let me just quote the end of IMDb's OWN Plot Synopsis of ""Max Max"" here: ""Max [...] handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked, overturned vehicle with a ruptured petrol tank. Max lights a crude time-delay fuse and gives Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs (which will take 10 minutes) or his ankle (which will take 5 minutes), and then drives off into the desolate outback. As Max drives away, the camera shows Max's car from the front, with a large and fiery explosion in the distance behind it. Max blankly continues to drive in a rainstorm."" ... I mean, come ON, people!! ""Mad Max"" doesn't deserve to be dragged down by being associated with this pathetic, unoriginal, blatant rip-off. A tribute? I think not. Just the writer(s)/director hoping - apparently with great success - that today's typically young horror-fan cinema audiences wouldn't realise from which classic film they stole their whole central so-called ""shocking"" premise. Feeble.<br/><br/>And as for all the stupid, gaping plot holes, well... where to start?!<br/><br/>First: How on earth was the ""dead man"" on the floor managing not to breathe for, what was it, some 8-10 hours? He's being stared at by a DOCTOR, no less, who fails to notice, all that time, that he is BREATHING?! Maybe he's a secret fakir who has taught himself to hold his breath for days at a time, hm? And that's just ONE *grossly* stupid plot flaw.<br/><br/>Second: Nobody, but nobody, can saw their own foot off and remain conscious for more than a few seconds. If their instinct for self-preservation will even allow them to make the attempt, the pain would cause fainting in less than a minute, and as for cutting through the BONE?! Don't make me laugh. What a joke. Oh, wait a minute: obviously THAT guy was a fakir too, capable of ignoring all forms of pain after a lifetime spent sleeping on beds of nails and walking over hot coals! And, of course, also acquiring, during his training, some kind of miraculous ability to NOT DIE OF BLOOD LOSS even if he managed the (impossible) foot-sawing claptrap. Of course! Why didn't I think of that! Er, because it's just stupid.<br/><br/>Third: Sheesh, forget it. Too many plot flaws to list - and I have better things to do. Like spending a couple of hours watching paint dry. Which I strongly advise anyone who is considering watching ""Saw"" (or any of its increasingly moronic sequels) to do, since it would be far more rewarding than spending the same time watching a cheesy rip-off gore-flick like this rubbish.<br/><br/>I hope the writer/director of ""Mad Max"" sued these idiots into the ground for theft of intellectual property. And sheer bad film-making.<br/><br/>IMDb really needs a ""zero stars"" rating for this kind of tripe.<br/><br/>Drivel."

","Today I was twitching to see a scary movie through my fingers as I grasped my face in horror, sadly however this just did not cut the mustard. In fact it did little to cut anything but my concentration. Firstly, the acting was poor to say the least, some of the scenes were horrible (most notably the chase scene which I thought was a joke) and it just was NOT scary in the slightest!<br/><br/>For a 7.7 I was expecting something quite great to be honest but I was utterly disappointed, even 'The Thing' with its ancient effects was scarier.<br/><br/>Moreover for all those who even dare compare it to 'Se7en' clearly have no idea of what they are talking about. The murders may seem similar but 'Se7en' is far beyond it in every aspect of what a film is! . .

","I find it hard to be impartial to something so objectionable. It would be wrong of me to whinge about the film's shortcomings as there would be little room left on the IMDb server for other user comments. Suffice to say, this predilection Hollywood has with introducing us to 'inventiveness' regarding the horror genre and it's ability to dispatch victims in a ridiculous fashion has got to stop. I blame Se7en. Not a bad film: 'gritty' and ballsy enough to stick Gwyneth Paltrow's decapitated head in a box, which would be enough to recommend any film to me, but implausible nonetheless. It's biggest crime however, save that of being lathargically repellent (and I've sat through August Underground 1 & 2) was to open the door for tripe such as this. Being a fan of 70's and 80's horror (especially Italian schlock and American grindhouse) it broke my (and my brother's heart) to have to walk out of the cinema for no other reason than not being able to give a flying fook about any aspect of it's derivative and utterly implausible plot, cringe-worthy acting, and 'twist' ending (The usual suspects this is not). It seems a film is not a film without a 'twist' these days. This exception however proves that rule. The fact that I am commenting on it five or six years later (having just noticed the IMDb rating) should give you some indication as to how strongly I feel, if the rest of this 'review' hasn't already done so. This film manages to encapsulate everything that is wrong about the horror genre today. For those of you of the MTV generation who are apparently unable to process two coherent thoughts consecutively, here's my review in a nutshell: Trite."
"galensaysyes","2","3","5","6 April 2008"," Needed sharpening
","I found this movie impossible to watch all the way through  not for being too frightening but for being too dumb. It was one of several so-called ""torture porn"" movies I made a point of watching to understand what the genre consisted of, and after watching them I understood it less than before: they weren't all alike, Saw was the only one the label seemed possibly to fit, by one of the two competing definitions in my head. Where I got either from or whether I just inferred them both I don't know, but if the term doesn't mean one or the other I don't know what it could mean. Definition number one is: a movie that uses torture scenes as porn, that is, to gratify the audience erotically; definition number two is: a movie that uses torture scenes in place of porn, so that they comprise its entire content, or reason for being. Saw may meet the second definition, if one supposes, as one easily might, that it exists mainly as an excuse to describe and illustrate the ordeals the movie's maniac puts his victims through. These are all on the level of a gross-out game played by thirteen-year-old boys  what if I sewed up piranhas in your stomach and I sewed up a bottle of piranha poison in one of your sister's arms or legs but you didn't know which one so you had to cut them all off and then she'd bleed to death or else the piranhas would eat your stomach and you'd die? Not only the maniac's schemes but everything he does, and everything the cops after him does, are on the same level of head-pounding stupidity, and this is what makes the movie unendurable.<br/><br/>But the strange thing is that this nonsense, while taking up most of the screen time, isn't the main story: it's the _filler_. The main story is about two guys trapped in a basement in a him-or-me situation that seems as if it can only end in violence and the death of one or the other: in essence a Grande Guignol one-act; and it isn't bad at all. Rewritten and improved, probably by a different hand, it could have been very good indeed. The drama between the characters, the increasing tension of their situation, the suspense of their efforts to escape could have made a good, tense half-hour film or TV episode. But obviously it wouldn't be enough to fill out a ninety-minute movie, and so the rest of it is padded with the cops-and-loony story alluded to above. The director is too flashy and too little focused to build an atmosphere of suspense or fear (to see what's missing  and limiting the comparison to movies with similar subjects  refer to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Creep), and so the movie becomes depressing, because in the absence of fear or any other emotion it's just depressing to watch people struggling through paths of barbed wire, broken glass, &c., or to watch a child terrorized. However, I have a feeling the guys who made this movie and the guys who like it view the ability to enjoy such things vicariously as a proof of maleness, and that in fact the existence of a movie like this owes less to the splatter tradition than to Chuck Palahniuk (whom guys read to show they're man enough to). At cross-purposes, then, I and they: because I'd rather the culture I inhabit be not as of thirteen-year-old boys.<br/><br/>Or thirteen-year-old men."

And the ending was supposed to be a twister, but it didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Only big names in the flik are Danny Glover and Cary Elwes and I suspect their salary was 90% of the cost of this movie. Really - some high school kid could have made this movie for a few thousand bucks.<br/><br/>Memorable scene where the doc (Elwes) saws off his own foot. Also unbelievable.

It over-compensates for a lack of a real plot and suspense with added gore.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is interesting but I think there was a lack of effort made in creating a tense atmosphere. When the two main characters in the film are forced to jump through 'Saws' hoops you never fully feel the mis-trust and anxiety the film attempts to shown them go through.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film, but it is not executed well.

","I often want to comment on some of the many movies I see. Sometimes I want to just gush when I see a movie that I feel is great, share a movie I thought was funny, or rip a movie that I feel is junk. The thing is, I don't ever take the time to do any of that. THIS movie made me step up to the plate.<br/><br/>After much hype and even higher ratings I finally got around to checking out the SAW series. Now that the third installment is out I figured it was a good time to find out what I had missed. BIG MISTAKE.<br/><br/>Are current movies that bad that this one found an audience? Maybe. Anyone that puts this film in the same sentence as Seven should be dealt with severely. Absurd. I am a fan of Seven but not a crazy person that thinks it is the Citizen Kane of Horror/Mystery/Suspense films. This film, however, is just pure MTV generation, hype sustained, copycat Garbage. All that being said, it still does not find a place on my 3 Worst Movies of All Time list but it does a good job of trying. For the record, this always possibly changing list now includes, for different reasons: War of the Worlds, Mystic River, as well as Charlie and The Chocolate Factory (Depp + Burton version)<br/><br/>Let us explore some of the nonsense in this movie that has to be completely ignored if you intend to recommend this steaming pile to someone you either like or think might enjoy it. <br/><br/>1. Eight hours prone on the floor, face down, with no movement, and no problems just getting up and walking out? and from a supposed terminal cancer patient? Ha I tell ya. Ha. <br/><br/>2. What if Danny Glover kills the dude from Lost in the hallway? It is supposed to be okay that the movie doesn't even consider this? <br/><br/>3. So the key was in the tub the whole time and I am supposed to see this as clever or kinda cool? <br/><br/>4. The Dred Pirate Wesley has gone from Robin Hood: Men in Tights to this piece. Time to retire. I hope he saved some cash. <br/><br/>5. So After the deadline passes, he saws his own leg off, shoots the photographer, and crawls home? <br/><br/>6. Why is the photographer just left there at the end? Game Over? Who thought this was a cool ending? <br/><br/>7. Even MTV stopped making videos using the jerky 13 Ghosts camera style. Just not cool. Over and Done With. <br/><br/>8. Red Herrings with no thought in todays movies are just B.S. The dude from LOST was obviously not Jigsaw if there was a picture of him in the toilet. If you don't show the bad guys face but some of your characters actually see him, you know it is not a major character. Why reveal at all who the baddie is? You know if it works, a sequel would be needed. No, instead kill or maim all the major players. That is what you do when you make a movie in two weeks. Success. <br/><br/>9. I just love the drug addict that beat her puzzle, gutted a drugged paralyzed guy, and now has a new respect for her life. What a great moral for the movie. Better than any 12 step program. I sure there will be a rush for that kind of rehab. <br/><br/>I cant go on anymore because it is becoming painful to rehash. Heed my warnings or don't. This is my release. Had to be done. I am worried by all the viewers that gave this higher than a two rating. Mindless, easily led lemmings that fatten the pockets of the makers of this film. Shame on yourselves. Don't get me wrong. I love junk movies and consider some of them among my all time favorites. But please don't preach this and similar trash as top notch, must see material."

I couldn't help but chuckle at the black and red satin cape/hood outfit worn by the villain. ""He must be a bad guy, he is wearing a cape and hood."" And throughout I wasn't scared. Ugh.

","You know, just when some know-it-all says, for the upteenth time, ""all the plots that can be done have been done"" or ""there are no original story ideas,"" somebody pulls out a new one.<br/><br/>This one isn't an absolutely unique idea, but in the initial moments of the film, there was great potential. Take a standard mystery/thriller convention: the locked room mystery. How the heck did the killer escape? How can we get in there? Then just reverse the premise: How the hell did we get in here? How do we get out?<br/><br/>As I said, it's been pulled off before (Cube comes to mind), but the very tight limitations here - one room, one tape recording, one gun, two guys, two chains - made it seem this was going to be an intense little flick. The added frisson of the little test, the puzzles to be figured out, could have made this a remarkable two-man-play translated to screen, a psychological study, lots of things.<br/><br/>Then? It all falls to hell and gone. For some reason, the screenwriter and director made the worst mistake in their artistic lives: they indulged in flashbacks. Then we get flashbacks within flashbacks. Then we get framed stories with flashbacks, inside the flashbacks, inside the flashbacks. Suddenly, a claustrophobic and genuinely creepy premise tuns into an ensemble gore-fest, edited with all the tricks - jump cuts, silhouette lighting, sharp angles... Boring. Strictly for the VH1 crowd. That the characters turn out to have no decent motivation (and that includes our unseen villain and our heroes) is simply par for the course once this movie takes that sad, sad turn down the road to mediocrity.<br/><br/>Pity.<br/><br/>Grade: D+"

","There has been so much written on Saw since its release in 2004 that I doubt there's much left to be said. Therefore, I'll limit this to just a couple of comments. It may not be the best ""new"" horror film I've seen, but it certainly beats a lot of the post-Scream films that glutted the market in recent years. Saw features something sadly lacking from a lot of modern horror  actual dialogue. Too many of the recent horror movies rely so heavily on larger-than-life CGI effects that dialogue is often an afterthought. It was a welcome change to see a film where characters have actual verbal interaction with one another. Even though the movie is heavily dependent on two characters speaking to each other, there are still enough gruesome scenes to spice things up. They are shocking in their nature and difficult to watch in their viciousness. These scenes are very well done.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint (and I'll try not to reveal too much and spoil the film as it was spoiled for me) is the big twist at the end. I just don't see how it's possible for ""that"" to have occurred. It doesn't seem feasible to me given the time frame of the events in Saw."

","****MAJOR SPOILERS**** Where do I start with this movie? The sad thing is, that much like the movie ""Identity"" this movie could have been good, but the idea just did not make the translation into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie went from tolerable to ridiculous in only a short amount of time.<br/><br/>The movie starts out creepy enough. Two men Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell who was also one of the writers) wake up to find themselves in a dirty, abandoned bathroom.<br/><br/>OK, so far so good as they start finding ""clues"" to how they are supposed to get out of the room. Sounds like a classic thriller, but too bad ""sounding"" like one, was as close as it got.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this movie that maybe it would just be simpler to list them instead of trying to view the positive aspects like I normally do.<br/><br/>1. Why is it that cops tell someone not to move or they will be shot, and yet when the person does move, the cop repeats the order over and over? Danny Glover (Detective David Trapp) had the ""killer"" in his sights, told him not to move and not only does the killer move (yet Danny Glover does not shoot him) but the killer manages to nearly mortally wound him.<br/><br/>2. How about this one...the lessons that each of the characters were supposed to be learning. OK, sounds great...someone out to teach mankind a lesson. Not so great because it was never clear what at least two of the ""victims"" were supposed to learn lessons for! For example...Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) was a kindly orderly in the hospital where Cary Elwes worked. He did not care for how Dr. Gordon treated the patients (how he referred to them in that typical cold, doctorly manner instead of as human beings with feelings) so doesn't that make him a good guy? If not, what was his lesson to be learned by ending up poisoned and attempting to kill Dr. Gordon's family at the killer's behest? And Adam, the guy in the room with Dr. Gordon...what was his lesson? Don't follow people? Don't listen to cops? It would be nice to know why he was being punished. However if someone as seemingly kindly as poor old Zep could be punished then obviously it doesn't take much to need ""punishment"" in the killer's eyes.<br/><br/>3. Why is it that when victims get a gun away from the killer, they don't shoot him? If a man had threatened to kill me the way Zep did Lawrence's wife Alison (Monica Potter) and my child, and I managed to get the gun away from him, they would need to shovel his brains off the floor, end of story. Instead, Alison looks over at her kid (Makenzie Vega...who has been whining ever since Zep tied them up) who is crying, like this was the first peep she had made. So, what happens? Zep gets the gun back from her.<br/><br/>4. Oh and someone please answer me this...how can someone survive a shotgun blast to the back? Am I just behind on how lethal shotguns are? Yep, the killer gets shot in the back and yet gets up and runs. I want that kind of power for my next birthday...<br/><br/>5. I also did not understand this and doubt I ever will. The killer was kind enough to supply the men with a cell phone...one that takes inbound calls only. Dr. Gordon is on the phone with his wife while Zep is toying with them. After Alison Gordon wrestled with Zep for the gun, she and her daughter managed to get away from him. OK fine. Not knowing what had happened to them, not knowing where he was and having no clue how he is going to get home, Dr. Gordon then decides to saw his leg off so he can get home to them. Does that bother anyone except me? News flash...being a doctor, you should know that if you bleed to death before you can make it out of the building...as he was already pale and dying before he even made it out of the room...you're not going to be any help to anyone. I also doubt that the killer would conveniently have a car waiting there for him either.<br/><br/>Probably the two biggest kickers for me though and what ended up totally being a slap in the face for anyone with a modicum of intelligence, was how a man (Tobin Bell...who ends up being the true killer by the way) could lie ""dead"" on the floor for the entire movie and yet neither man (including one who is a doctor) can't tell that he is breathing. I haven't met a person yet who could make it look like they weren't breathing. The fact that a doctor, a surgeon no doubt as Lawrence stated he was; could not tell that the man was breathing is disturbing.<br/><br/>And lastly...how was Tobin Bell (who had been lying in the hospital, dying at that, with an inoperable brain tumor just scenes before) able to get up, leave the hospital without his doctor knowing it...you guessed it, his doctor is Dr. Gordon one of our hapless victims...and plan all of this out, let alone execute it in his ""weakened"" condition? My suggestion...if you like movies that don't make you think, then this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a true thriller, this is one better left alone...<br/><br/>The only thrill you will get...is when it is over."

","Saw; first the praise; this film is a bargain basement 'Seven'. After that I found little to cherish in this face-painted psycho-thriller, based around two men chained to pipes in a grim toilet with a dead man between them. The idea is they have to think their way out of the situation using only clues provided by hidden weirdo 'Jigsaw'; it's a kind of pervert's crystal Maze. One might wonder why these freaks who like to mess people up according to a psychotic evaluation of morality, don't just go to a 'make new friend's club', church or an adult video shop. This film also tries hard to be ground breaking on themes such as survival, love, psychological warfare and retribution but when you are BLATANTLY using white face paint and blue lipstick on one of your actors so they look ill with agony, the only provoking your doing is laughter. Indeed, at one point a character is so violently hurt, he goes white faced and you can see the pink bits the make up artist missed; very funny. This film is annoyingly complex too, so that there is a constant barrage of twists and turns that some might find delightful, others unoriginal. On top of that the mind-game playing character Jigsaw creates his persona using a clown headed paraplegic in a rusty wheelchair; you want to shout; 'no-ones interested clown man, we just want to get on with our selfish lives so go an kill yourself you interfering little loser'. Still on a high note, that's not to say that if this clown wheeled itself to the end of your bed you wouldn't crap a river, before kicking the hell out of it. So ten out of ten for creepy aesthetics but beyond that it is ultimately a very bankrupt man's Seven."

","There isn't one move made by a character in ""Saw"", aside from the little girl crying, that makes ANY sense. Sadly, a very good premise is blown to shreds by these mindless, phony actions. In fact, you do not simply need to suspend disbelief to see the dots connected as they are in Saw- you need to take a few tabs of LSD to do it. And the acting is atrocious. Neither trapped actor shows a hint of the terror they are supposedly experiencing, and Carey Elwes' whining is unbearable. The camera work is ridiculous, too. The Mtv-ization of the narrative shots completely swamps the affecting VHS video shots and dilutes to non-detectable levels any palpable suspense. Instead, we are left banally wondering, and not FEARING, what will happen next. Sad."

","Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>I really hated this movie. And it shocks me that I am one of only a few. <br/><br/>To me, the film was heavily influenced by several 90s thrillers and slasher films (""Se7en"", especially) and the story basically relied on old ideas and shock value. The violence was disgusting and often ridiculous, and I sort of feel like the people that did this movie thought they had to make it really gross to be scary.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes seemed as though they were trying to just scare the bajeezus out of the viewer without creating any sort of suspense or fear. For example, a woman has to dig around in the stomach of her drugged-up friend so her head doesn't explode. Why?? What the hell is the point of that? It's just stupid. <br/><br/>And in the final scene, why did the guy have to saw through his foot?! I mean, c'mon. There were ways around that. He just seemed to snap, and suddenly the fact that the key to his shackle was just a few feet away was irrelevant.<br/><br/>Okay, I admit that the cinematography was sort of cool...<br/><br/>But Cary Ewles? Good god. He was great in ""The Princess Bride"", ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"", and as the villain in a variety of family and action films. But in ""Saw"" he was truly awful. I think my local newspaper stated it best in a caption under a photo of Elwes in ""Saw"": 'Mommy, please make the bad actor go away'. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Saw"" was an interesting concept that was executed horribly. But I'm probably just crazy, because everyone else in the world seems to love it."

","I went along to the cinema to see this film, optimistically hoping it would be ""The new Se7en"" that it was billed as. Right from the opening scene with the two guys waking up to find each other in some sort of cell with a dead guy lying on the ground, I was appalled by the acting of both of them. What followed was the story of a killer, yes a killer, who put people in really nasty situations that if they survived, they should somehow learn something about themselves. Thus giving the psycho some kind of twisted morality. As the story of the two guys unfolds, we find out that one of them is a doctor who cheats on his wife and the other guy is a photographer who follows people who are cheating and exposes them. From what I understand the killer is punishing the doctor for cheating on his wife, and the photographer for invading peoples privacy. Which makes no sense at all. If he thinks it's alright to force a cheating man to cut off his own leg, then taking a few photos seems a bit pale in comparison. Aside from this idiotic contradiction, there were limp performances from everyone concerned, including Danny Glover. The bad guy's voice sounded like the killer from Scream, and the final plot twist was just ludicrous. Like a doctor would not be able to tell that the guy lying on the floor for hours wasn't actually dead.<br/><br/>I am seriously disappointed that this film managed to get any sort of acclaim, as I didn't even find it's awfulness funny."

","I bought into the hype and watched ""Saw"" last night. And afterward it left me with a feeling that I would have been better off flushing my money in the toilet. It started out very promising and with what I thought was a great chilly feel to it, then suddenly took a turn for the worse when it wanted to be smart as well. In my opinion ""Saw"" tries to be as cruel, scary and intelligent as ""Se7en"" but fails miserably - it seems to me someone had a great idea for an overall plot but decided to film it before thinking it through. There are too many of the little ""diabolic"" subplots which are just completely ridiculous and unbelievable - completely destroying the film.<br/><br/>Two people are chained to the spot in a small room. No more than six feet from either of them a body is lying in a pool of blood. It's not a dead body though. Nooo. It's the evil mastermind pretending to be dead; nobody notices a thing for 7-8 hours after which he gives himself away on purpose. That's one thing. Another is my lack of understanding as to what the villain's motivations for doing it were? How about those electrocutions? Current flows through a chain attached to your ankle and from there to ground, hurting you. Fine. But when the other end of the chain is attached to a pipe that comes out of the ground as well? Even my sister understands electrical potentials better than that.<br/><br/>But the best thing really is the scene where the cops have the bad guy cornered. Luckily for the bad guy, he's got a hostage strapped to a chair in an evil contraption - in which two power drills advance on rails towards the helpless hostage's head. Yeah okay when put into writing it does sound a little ridiculous. But it's not. Not compared to the moment when the bad guy trips the switch for the machine to start in order to force the cops to choose: Save the hostage or catch the villain? And the cops are indecisive. Unable to instantly figure out what to do. Panicking and ultimately letting their antagonist get away. Not....... the power drills! Please no! There are two power drills quite slowly closing in on someone's immobilized head. Two cops armed with shotguns are standing ten feet away. Damn what a tight spot. Come on.<br/><br/>I'm sorry.

"rosscinema","3","3","5","15 March 2005"," Intrigueing premise falls short
","While I found ""Open Water"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" very effective in what they both wanted to do I definitely didn't think the same with this film. Instead, I came away thinking that these young filmmakers were just trying to cash in with a gimmicky concept aimed at mostly young film viewers. Story starts out with two men waking up in the bathroom of an abandoned building and they're both chained to pipes on opposite sides of each other. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and a photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) are the two men and in between them is a body with a tape recorder and a gun and as they talk with each other they figure out who is probably behind this.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** It dawns on Gordon that they are victims of the Jigsaw Killer who kidnaps his victims and puts them in some horrible predicament with the weird notion that they will appreciate life better if they survive and with these two they find cassettes in their pockets with a message about what they must do and Gordon must kill Adam by 6 o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed. They are also given saws in which they are to cut their feet off if they want to get out and it becomes a race against time as Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) starts to close in on the identity of the Jigsaw Killer.<br/><br/>Director James Wan and screenwriter/actor Whannell made this film in about 18 days with more than 90% of the principle photography shot in one building with several sets built for the different scenes. I do give Wan lots of credit for directing this because parts of this actually work in terms of being a horror/serial killer genre film but the script throws so much into the mix that eventually it loses steam. If the script had stuck with the basic premise of ""saw your foot off and you live"" I think this would have worked so much better but unfortunately screenwriter Whannell gives viewers more twists and turns than a game of Clue. There are about three things I found distracting and the first are the scenes with the film sped up with choppy editing that's just annoying and dizzying to watch. Secondly, Glover is a natural to play a cop but his character consistently fails in whatever he's trying to do. There was maybe two moments when he's chasing the killer and could have shot him in the leg (or worse) to stop him but he keeps missing and gets his ass kicked. Thirdly, the script goes off track with all the games that Elwes and Whannell are supposed to figure out like ""find the X"" and the ending that ultimately sets itself up for a sequel. The Achilles heel for this film is it's far-fetched visions of grandeur and since the makers are in the process of producing a sequel I hope they come to the realization that a little simplicity goes a long way."

"canadude","3","3","5","9 February 2005"," Warning: this review contains no puns about the title of the film
","First off, ""Saw"" is a thriller not a horror film. It's been a long time since someone has directed a great horror film, and it looks like it might be a while still. Nonetheless, it's not a bad movie. It takes the concept of two people stuck in a room at first for no apparent reason from ""Cube"" and toys around with it, albeit not in the same fashion. While there is some very entertaining reasoning, nice non-linear plotting, ""Saw"" remains nothing more than an interesting and mildly entertaining thriller.<br/><br/>When you decide to go out of your way and actually dissect it, the plot starts to make less and less sense. But with serial killer movies, plot is rarely the strong-point (with the exception, of course, of classics like ""Silence of the Lambs,"" or ""Se7en""). What usually makes a good thriller is its ability to thrill, to terrify. ""Saw,"" a film whose violence-level is extremely over-hyped, is more nasty and cruel than it is scary. It has the obligatory tense sequences and jump scenes, but they don't really lead to anything that (for me anyway) would cause you to lose sleep.<br/><br/>And I take back some of what I said. Plot is crucial in a thriller insofar as it makes the story somewhat realistic, consequently more terrifying. While the scenes and set-ups and situations created in the film are relatively original and interesting, the ending of the film (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal it) is almost ludicrous. As is the dialogue for that matter and the acting (or lack thereof). The problem that I have with the ending is the same problem I had with the ending of ""High Tension."" While this film does technically have a stronger ending than ""Tension,"" and while ""High Tension"" has much more tension than ""Saw"" up until its ridiculous finale, both films leave you with a feeling of ""quoi?"" There is something lacking - something that would make you continue to shudder with horror long after the credits roll. ""Saw"" of course, is not a terrible film. It doesn't have a lot of blood, but it has a lot of freaky looking objects and people and torture devices. It's even entertaining to watch. It just, in my humble opinion, doesn't live up to the hype, which made it sound like it was the first really scary horror film in ages. I would more confidently recommend ""High Tension,"" which is, on some level, horrifying in the old style, almost brilliant, but it ends the way this film did; haphazardly. I hope the creators of ""Saw"" won't make a sequel to it, but rather hone their talents and come up with something even better. I'm sure they're capable of it."
"Jexxon","3","3","5","16 January 2005"," Bites off more than it can chew
","Two men wake up in room, chained to the wall, a dead guy on the floor with a tape recorder and a gun next to him. That's the premise of Saw, a film that thinks it's more clever than it is.<br/><br/>Obviously having borrowed inspiration from Seven (and other similar films), Saw is very entertaining for half an hour or so. Once the characters are established and the rules of the game are set up, the film stops dead. The story goes nowhere, relying on an onslaught of flashbacks to tell the story, leaving time for the audience to reflect upon the gaping plot holes, bad acting, and inane dialogue.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Whannell unwisely casts himself as one of the leads, and from time to time, it feels more like a comedy watching him, Elwes, and Glover chewing up the scenery while delivering bad, albeit unintentionally funny, lines. The plot is also so reliant on characters doing (or not doing) certain things at a specific time that it just ends up defying all common sense.<br/><br/>At first sight, Saw also seems to be a very gory film, but upon closer inspection you realise that it isn't true. Things are implied, but never really shown. I'm not saying that I'm thirsting for blood, but it would at least have made the film a bit different, rather than a rehash of old ideas and tired clichés. A promising start followed by, more or less, crap does not make a good film. However, the final minute was bloody brilliant - I'll give them that. [3/10]"

The wire jaw lock is particularly memorable.

I actually couldn't help but laugh at loud at what was supposed to be one of the more climactic moments. Even Danny Glover was bad. Of course, part of that is because the writing was so horrible. Whoever said in another review that the flashbacks were ""seamless"" and ""unforced"" must be on crack. They were horrible and so incredibly forced. The way the Doctor kept prefacing all the flashbacks, it's almost camp... ""Let me start from the very beginning..."" So, that's bad writing, bad acting... oh yeah... really bad editing. The pace was so off in this entire movie. The director can do a good scary sequence... the guy in his apartment with the flash camera... but he can't direct a movie. Everything else was SO choppy.

Don't waste your money."
"The_Master_Critic","7","3","5","6 November 2004"," Saw is an uneven but satisfying film. (possible spoiler)
","Oftentimes you watch a movie and can easily tell that it was inspired by current events. Obviously Saw wasn't ripped from the headlines of yesterday's paper, but I think a recent, amazing story of survival may have sparked the filmmakers' imaginations. The event I'm referring to is when Aron Ralston cut off his own arm with a pocket knife after being trapped under a rock for 5 days. There are no trapped mountaineers in this film, but a couple of guys are chained to a wall with nothing but a hacksaw that isn't sturdy enough to cut the chain. Hmmmm. How are they supposed to escape?<br/><br/>Saw tells the story of two men who awaken to find themselves chained to opposite sides of a nasty bathroom with a dead man face down in blood between them. The dead man is holding a gun and a cassette player; each of the two men wake with a tape that gives them clues on how to survive the day. One of the men, a doctor, is given a few hours to somehow kill the other man or his wife and child will be murdered. The person responsible is a twisted serial killer who rather than killing his prey, sets up elaborate traps where the victims either kill themselves or someone else. I don't want to give away too much because I want you to be as intrigued as I was while watching. It's not often that a thriller works so well for so long, but I was completely enthralled by the story and the setup. There are only a couple things that keep this movie from hitting the bullseye: acting, and uh, overacting.<br/><br/>Sure this is a low budget movie, and it isn't packed full of familiar faces. The problem is that the guys we don't recognize do a fine job, while a couple of 'old faithfuls' are all over the map. Not only is Cary Elwes all over the map, he's all over the desk next to the map; he's across the street in the map shop looking for a map large enough to contain his awkward performance. Elwes plays one of the two men trapped in the bathroom. He's a doctor who recognizes what is happening because he was once a suspect in the search for the vile, but creative, serial killer. The good news is that he doesn't come across as a total and complete hack. He's believable for the first half of the movie, but whenever he has to show any sort of emotion, he crumbles. Acting classes should be forced to watch his performance to see the perils of overacting. He looks more like an actor trying to portray anger, than a man whose unusual circumstances have driven him into a panic. It's a terrible tragedy when the audience is laughing through the climax of a film because the actor can't carry the part. His performance is so over the top  so completely distracting  that the film really suffers.<br/><br/>The usually steady Danny Glover is also inconsistent. He plays the lead detective investigating the serial killer, nicknamed 'Jigsaw.' His character is very emotionally driven but not enough time is given to his development. The audience can't help but question his motivation and many times the logic behind some of his decisions. The part was never fleshed out and because of this, Glover's performance is weak. He just didn't have enough to work with.<br/><br/>The supporting actors fare much better. Monica Potter is good as the doctor's wife, and Makenzie Vega is quite good as her daughter. The most pleasant surprise was the performance of Leigh Whannell, also one of the screenwriters. Whannell plays the other man who finds himself chained to the wall in the bathroom. There were a few weak moments, but overall his performance was solid.<br/><br/>A lot of hype has been given to how shocking, disturbing, and scary this film is. Let me set the record straight. Saw isn't scary, but it is suspenseful. It's much more of a thriller than a horror movie. There are a few surprises, and a few truly disturbing sequences, but as hard as it tries, Saw doesn't achieve the atmosphere and feel of Se7en. That's not to say that it doesn't successfully create a disturbing mood. A couple moments really worked for me. There is a creepy moment with the young daughter of the doctor (Makenzie Vega) staring at a mobile in her room, wondering if the boogie man is there. Another sequence with a man using a camera as a flashlight also worked well. In fact, the first three quarters of the movie successfully draw the audience into the story and the characters. But then it starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>The final act of Saw feels like a different movie. The tone seemingly changes, and the film relies on clichés and coincidences to drive the story. It becomes a cookie cutter thriller straight from the Ashley Judd school of predictability. But then everything changes again. SPOILER WARNING: DON'T CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK, the ending is great. The movie had hit rock bottom and there were no explanations for the actions of the characters. Then there is a twist and everything makes sense. As great as the twist may be, I'm not sure it makes up for the previous 15 minutes of the film. It's hard to forgive what the movie does to the audience during that sequence. I felt detached from the film and I felt the story had let me down. Still, I don't often fall for surprise endings, and this one got me good."

I was worried that the whole movie would play entirely in the dingy room...much as Phonebooth did, but the plot progressed with flashbacks and the like.<br/><br/>The trapped Adam and Dr. Gordon work with the clues given. As they discover the clues, you can predict what is going to happen, which gives the viewer a feeling of involvement. However, it leaves you with enough suspense that you can't predict everything, especially the ending.<br/><br/>I, and the entire movie theater, screamed out loud at one part. I also yelled a rated R word without meaning to. My roommate and I held hands since her boyfriend was no comfort. <br/><br/>I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes until he began to talk. He has changed a lot since Princess Bride. While I consider him to be a decent actor, he didn't suit this film. He held well until the end, but his last words left me screaming 'fake.'<br/><br/>This film is very well made - the plot was fantastic. But warning, the acting belongs to an '80s slasher film. Danny Glover played the cop role, but the movie is not a resume booster for him. Again, while an exciting thriller, this is definitely not Oscar material. Glover deserves better.<br/><br/>Leave the children at home."

","God I really wanted this movie to be good. I looked forward to seeing SAW for months thinking that it just might be the catalyst to spring the dying horror genre back on track. What a colossal letdown. First off the filmmakers completely squandered a golden opportunity by peppering their movie with flashy MTV style editing and a ridiculous over the top headache inducing soundtrack. God I hate that! Didn't anyone learn anything from Kubrick's THE SHINING. These two aspects of the film, which every American horror director is apparently addicted to nowadays, time and time again snuffed out any flicker of hope for intensity or genuine malaise. It was like clockwork. Just when you started to feel the slightest bit uneasy... wham, they throw you into the middle of a mosh-pit at a Nine Inch Nails concert and completely ruin the tone. There was absolutely no subtlety in SAW whatsoever. As for the plot. I didn't go into SAW expecting to be blown away by the plot in fact I was hoping to basically see two guys chained to pipes in a bathroom for 90 minutes trying to deal with their unthinkable situation. That premise alone, without all of the terrible flashback scenes and outrageous non-sensical plot devices to aid in the great USUAL SUSPECTS style revelation at the end, could have been infinitely intense and terror inducing. It could have been as gut wrenching as anything in Texas CHAINSAW or FUNNY GAMES, which is what I was so desperately hoping for. Instead what we got was an absolutely unnecessary rehash of a SEVEN storyline that was neither provoking nor engaging. Now to the acting. I don't need much in the way of acting to keep me satisfied in a horror movie, but let me say this: I felt embarrassed for Elwes and Glover. It was the kind of instinctual feeling one gets when a public speaker stutters badly or can't remember their words. You want to help them but you can't. These two guys were dreadful. And it is 100% true that the audience was laughing at them and rightfully so. To put it bluntly, SAW was the biggest letdown I've had at the movies in a long, long time. Last year I looked forward to seeing HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. As unsatisfying as that movie was at least it stuck to it's guns and didn't try to be something that it wasn't. The filmmakers behind SAW should have stuck to their guns. But Elwes and Glover still might have ruined it then too."

","But that's a bad thing. In society, there are certain lines you just don't cross. In some cases, ('South Park' comes to mind), barriers are crossed with humorous and usually well-intentioned results. 'Saw' has none of these though, and crosses some barriers with such a mean spirited savageness that I practically walked out.<br/><br/>Cary Elwes leads the cast as Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Brilliant oncologist, but less than stellar family man, Dr. Gordon awakes one morning to find himself chained to a pipe in a horrifically disgusting bathroom with a young man named Adam (film's co-writer Leigh Whannell). Between the two men is a dead body, and from there begins the twisted game of a killer the police call Jigsaw. Once Lawrence and Adam figure out what's going on, the killer's previous exploits are told in flashback (and poorly done). The always reliable Danny Glover plays Detective David Tapp, whose obsession with catching Jigsaw leads him to be removed from the force after a breakdown following his partner's death (Ken Leung) at Jigsaw's hands.<br/><br/>Monica Potter is good enough for what little screen time (not to mention dialogue) she gets as Alison Gordon (wife), Dina Meyer reappears briefly as Kerry, another officer investigating the crimes, and Makenzie Vega chips in as Diana, Lawrence's daughter.<br/><br/>OKfirst off.an open note to all directors, especially those of you raised on that cultural void we call MTV. STOP THE JERKY CAMERA AND SPED UP FOOTAGE. Much like with 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', the scenes of Jigsaw's victims are sped up and herky-jerky, making them practically unwatchable. This form of film-making was dead in 2000, quit beating this dead horse. <br/><br/>This film is probably the most repulsive, vile, repugnant piece of trash I have sat through in my 33 years. In fact, this movie is lower on the 'lowest common denominator' scale than 'House of 1000 Corpses' was. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Using a stethoscope to examine a child's heartbeat while a gun is held to her mother's head is appealing only to those of us in the community who should probably be under observation anyway. **OVER** There are films that are brutal and a test to watch ('Texas Chainsaw', '28 Days Later', etc) but when you walk out of them you don't feel like you've just been violated. <br/><br/>Clearly director Wan and writer Whannell have a brilliant idea, with potential far eclipsing that of 'Seven', but instead allow (either by lack of writing skill or overabundance of depravity) themselves to basically do nothing more than test how much they can get away with just to see what that point will be.<br/><br/>An outstanding concept that quickly descends into a sick example of excess. You two should be ashamed.<br/><br/>0 out of 5 and I'm sorry for having plugged the potential of this movie the past few months."
"KarenandCo","1","3","5","30 October 2004"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","There are not words to describe how bad Saw was. Horrific, and not in the scary sense. Hideous. Abysmal. Those merely skim the surface. Where to start?<br/><br/>The Acting: Cary Elwes should turn in his SAG card; the groveling and whining and sobbing just made me embarrassed for him. Leigh Whannell did a marginally better job than Cary, surprisingly, but that didn't make it good.<br/><br/>He was horribly wooden and unbelievable thoroughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot could have been great. It was certainly a great concept, but the execution was just awful. The flashback scenes were repetitive and eventually became monotonous - especially when it got to the point of nesting flashbacks within flashbacks. The police procedure in the movie was so ludicrously unbelievable that no suspension of disbelief was possible. The relationship between Elwes' character (Lawrence) and his wife was one dimensional and, again, poorly acted. And Elwes' scenes with his daughter were schmaltzy and played in a sing-songy voice that grated.<br/><br/>The *only* redeeming scene in the movie was the jaw-trap scene. It was suspenseful and horrifying - if you skip past the VH1 video on speed part.<br/><br/>I really wish I could write more, but there's nothing more to write. I supposed I could say it was a good effort for an Indie film, but I've seen Indie films that rocked my world, so that's no excuse. There just are no other words."
"foundyouhere","1","3","5","30 October 2004"," See Saw? DON'T!
","I am quite impressed with the amount of good reviews on this website in regards to SAW. Usually people are much more cynical with their opinions on a horror movie.... Those reviewers who say SAW is a psychological movie are half right. Psychologically there's a lot to discuss, like how stupid would someone have to be to look over the obvious plot holes to say this movie is ""good"" entertainment. How A.D.D. are we as an audience that instead of a movie moment with true suspense we instead get a Nine Inch Nails music video interlude inappropriately thrown in. First things first: the acting is beyond terrible. Even for Danny Glover, but to his credit is working with a cheesy and laughable dialogue. Cary Elwes is downright terrible, the worst acting I have seen this year. An evil bad guy who broods about saying in dark cartoon voices ""I AM SICK OF THE DISEASE OF THE WORLD"" is scary? The actions of nearly all the characters are flat out illogical, even with a hearty amount of suspension of disbelief. I find it amusing that people justify this flick by accusing bad reviewers of being brainwashed by constant eye candy from high budget studio pictures, when clearly ""SAW"" tries to disguise a bad movie with exactly that, loads of technical eye candy. This movie would have been much better had it just stuck to a simple story. It was an original idea that went to waste with complicated & unnecessary ""plot twists"" and poor execution from a freshman writer and director. Its a shame that such a promising movie became such a complete waste of time & money."
"Virginstateofmind","1","3","5","30 October 2004"," Extreme Insult To All REAL Horror Movies
","My name is Draven and I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. You name the horror movie, I have most probably seen it. I first saw Ringu, long before ""The Ring"" came out. I have seen horror movies from all over the world. Because I have an extreme love for horror movies, I wanted to see Saw. I saw a lot of promos for this movie and a lot of comments saying ""its scarier then Se7en"" or ""the serial killer makes Hannibal Lecter look like Dora the Explorer"" and ""Not just blood and gore, but clever blood and gore."" So, I am thinking, ""wow, this has got to be a great movie, right?...right?"" <br/><br/>This is BY FAR the worst ""horror"" movie, I have ever seen in my life. This is a f*cking sad statement when I have to say this, but The Blair Witch Project was better then this and we all know The Blair Witch Project should have never been made. Calling Saw a horror movie is the most extreme insult to actual good horror movies. Don't get me wrong, the plot and storyline for were GREAT! But the acting and the way it was done and the ending were lame. It seems more like a wannabe Action flick then a Horror movie. <br/><br/>*Plot* - Psycho guy kidnaps people and finds ways for them to kill themselves. <br/><br/>Psycho guy never takes part in the actual killings. He just is a master planner and the ways he comes up with killing people is great. It is basically like a huge puzzle that they have to do to free themselves. If they are able to free themselves they feel great to be alive and value everything that life has to offer. <- This part of the movie is great.<br/><br/>*Acting* - A first you see two people who find themselves trapped and chained to a pipe on opposite ends of the room. The acting by both characters is completely lame and pretty unrealistic. In one scene, ""Adam"" is supposed to ""die"" and the way he goes about doing it is like, ""You have to be f*cking kidding me."" It is something you would see from a child who is playing to get shot and dead.<br/><br/>*Ending* The ending was very interesting. I won't tell you what happened in case you still decide to see it. But, the way it is done is so pathetic. At the end, my girlfriend and I (who also LOVES Horror movies to death) were both like, ""That's it????? That sucked.""<br/><br/>Afterwards we started talking about and honestly were thinking about going to the theater and asking for our money back. Everyone billed this up to be the ""instant classic"" or ""Scariest movie in the last decade."" I am sorry, if any of you actually like Horror movies, don't waste your money."

And there are no words. Bad acting from pretty much everyone. Horrible shots. Predictable plot. No tension in the entire film. Pretentious soundtrack. There was not a single part on the entire movie where I could feel any fear. I guess it was a good idea, and has become a famous and successful saga, but I really, honestly don't understand why it has so many fans. I don't know if the other movies are good at all, but after watching the first one, I don't have any intention to find out. One of the biggest disappointments of ""horror"" movies that I've ever had.

Saw is a gripping film that walks the line between suspense and horror. The story is twisted and reminiscent of ""Se7en"" and ""Hannibal."" The sets were incredible and gory. The real star here is Cary Elwes, who turns in a great performance. Kudos also to the director James Wan, who did a fantastic job. The ending was original and satisfying and you'll never guess who the ""Jigsaw"" killer turns out to be. Take the phone off the hook, turn out the lights and watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet. Interesting fact: the guy who plays Adam (Leigh Whannell) wrote the script."

This isn't your typical slasher, gory horror movie......it has a plot twist that could NEVER be guessed.....I'm talking ABSOLUTE CINEMATIC GENIUS.........give that director and screenwriter...(who, by the way, also plays Adam)......an Acadamy Award!!!!!!!! And to comment on the ones who say it is a cheap Se7en rip-off....Yes is does have shades of Se7en in it's death, (or lack thereof), scenes but to compare this film to Se7en....is an understatement. Don't get me wrong until I saw ""Saw"".....lol.....Se7en was one of my favorite films. If only more production studios would take a note of this film and start producing more like it for all us die hard chiller fans!!

","This movie is fantastic and exciting. Despite the film's name, ""saw"". It's not very gory unlike it's sequels. For some viewers, it may not be scary at all, but it's the thought and idea that makes it scary. The film revolves around different places around different times and all comes together in a conclusion. You could be wandering why a character is doing certain actions until it is revealed later. These ""twists"" are well thought through and well explained.<br/><br/>The film is very unique, as it's a new generation of horror. Saw started a lot of new horror movies like The Cube and Amusement. Instead of having a killer going around killing people violently or a ""demon/ghost is possessing something"" kind of movie, Saw is none of those things because it's different. People are in situations where they can make all sorts of choices to survive, or achieve a certain goal like saving another ones life. The killer in the movie doesn't attack victims, but tests them based on their weaknesses and sins. All these things make the writing really good.<br/><br/>The film also has one of the greatest plot twists I've ever witnessed. You will be shocked and have goosebumps when you see it.<br/><br/>This is a must watch, even if your not a fan of horror, this film is completely fresh and original and I suggest it to everyone."

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

I'm honestly surprised that many people were ACTUALLY shocked and amazed at the ""big"" twist at the end, when it was, in fact, downright ridiculous. But well, unrealistic, 90% of the movies out there are too, to some extent. The main problem with Saw is that it was unrealistic AND pretentious. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whanell were constantly trying to prove to the viewers, at every single instant, that their shallow school project of a thriller was, in fact, an Earth-shattering artistic masterpiece. Not only that, all the flashbacks and revelations were there not to give depth to the story and characters, but merely to shock the viewers.

Saw, on the other hand, left me wishing I could get back those 90 minutes I spent watching it. Cleaning the bathroom would've been more entertaining and far more terrifying."

","Most of the plot holes have been listed here, but what really sucks about this film is the originality - or lack of it. The debts to Seven becoming embarrassing half way through. Likewise, the sawing through your own foot is a scene straight from Mad Max. Worse still was the script. Some of the lines were so bad, notably Cary Elwes' lines as Lawrence. No wonder he passed on Saw 2. That said, this film has made a fortune for its backers and I can't believe it only cost $1.2m to make. There may not have been much talent in the creative department on Saw, but credit to the late Gregg Hoffman and the marketers behind this film."

The man on the floor turns out to be Jigsaw? So he's been alive the whole time, breathing, and i might also add that fact that he managed to electrocute Adam, while neither Adam nor Lawrence noticed it.

","HeHe! So many anally retentive movie-buffs out there huh?! It always tickles me to imagine these people, poring over the celluloid like it were a Sudoku puzzle, or the I-Ching, stroking their chins, and looking for a deeper insight into the ineffable motivations of the human soul! Hehe!<br/><br/>YOU WENT TO SEE A SERIAL-KILLER MOVIE CALLED ""SAW""!! WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?? THE MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS?? Hehe!<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the movie. I did, admittedly, see it for free, but with a title like SAW! I was expecting something in the vein of ""Mute - Killer - With - Shiny - Weapon - Dismembers - Hormonal - American - Teenage - CalvinKlein - Model IIX"", only with a little less refined elegance. Bit this hurried, little, no-budget movie, pleasantly surprised me. The claustrophobia gimmick is one close to my heart, I have always enjoyed movies that take a couple of actors and lock them in a room for the duration; something interesting usually ensues, (although I must confess to a little pang of disappointment when the story strayed beyond the confines of the filthy bathroom.), and the notion of a gruesome conundrum, (albeit a join-the-dots one in this case.), seldom fails to pique ones morbid imagination. Yes the acting was barely passable, and the script didn't shed any light on the human condition, but this amusing little romp looked quite pretty, quickened the blood ever-so-slightly, and even provided this jaded viewer with a wry smile as the plot performed its fair attempt at a ""Oh-I-never-SAW-that coming!"" ending.<br/><br/>One thing does puzzle me though.... Are most of the posters here American?? I only ask because I've read so many reviewers complaining that ""SAW"" was implausible because the doctors wife didn't blast holes through her hapless, would-be killer, as he lay UNARMED on the floor at gun-point!! I have to wonder how many of these movie-buffs have ever been called upon to shoot another human being...But I digress...<br/><br/>At a time when the cookie-cutter movie industry is allowed, nay, encouraged by its consumers to churn out an endless regurgitation of formulaic nonsense, even from its most experienced luminaries, its was almost refreshing to see this ambitious neophyte crew attempt to take a derivative premise and make their mark on an extremely hackneyed genre.<br/><br/>Yes, It doesn't break much in the way of new ground. Yes, I'm sure the director has watched far too many MTV videos. Yes, It probably should have been about 25 minutes shorter. And yes, Mad Max did the same gnaw-off-your-own-limb gag many, many moons ago. But hey....Its only a bit of fun. Pass the popcorn!"

","**********SPOILERS************ I actually saw this at the theater when it first came out so it has been a little while. I just remember feeling like there were such huge holes in the story I wished I had the time back I wasted on this crap.<br/><br/>The reason I am writing this now is I just got snookered into seeing Saw 2 and it was as nearly as bad as the first one. For one thing the killers premise is badly flawed ""making people appreciate life by facing death"" doesn't make any kind of sense, not even in a twisted sick killer sort of way. Not to mention most of his victims had little or no chance to survive as the killer seems to think. I also disagree with everyone who says that in a life or death situation people would not pay attention to details. I think that if your life was really on the line you would pay very close attention to everything. Anyway, I thought it was really stupid, the dialog, direction and acting were mediocre at best. I will work on avoiding such ridiculous contrivances in the future."

The many plot twists and storyline were intriguing and if all facets of this movie were done just as well, it could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>However, the acting and pacing of the entire movie was lacking in my opinion.

","I waited for 'Saw' to hit the shelves, and I decided to rent it. I really don't like too many of Lion's Gate Films' movies, besides 'Punisher,' so my expectations were rather low for this movie. They had washed up actor Cary Elwes star in the film as the helpless victim, and Danny Glover as a detective, of course. Is there a movie Danny Glover is in that doesn't have him in a role in the crime stopping scene? There is more than a few things I really didn't like about this movie. For one, the acting was pretty rundown, dull, and generic horror movie screaming and panicking. Also, the gross violence this movie contains. This is just violent for the sake of being violent, and they think it adds to the ""thrills,"" but it just makes you wanna be sick. The only thing that scared me in the movie was the clown/dummy thing, which always rode around on a tricycle. A good scary movie needs to have me scared after the movie, and this movie really didn't do that for me. If you are looking for a scary Halloween movie, this movie is not scary, it's just really violent and gross. I definitely don't recommend this to the horror movie person, or anyone for that matter."

The plot holes is not easy provable, but more like the typical annoying B-movie symptoms like: ""Why the h... didn't he just ..."", and the defender of the movie could of course say: ""well, maybe he just didn't want to"". The acting of panic and fear is at its best as good as the acting you would perform as a joke with your friends. The characters don't react to things the way people do. They constantly do stupid things, carrying their ridiculous face expressions. I'm sorry – I have nothing good to say about Saw.

"padiyark","4","2","3","19 April 2005"," Pseudo-intelligent film-making
","Hearing the myriad of hype about ""Saw"", I decided to rent it and see what was so great about it. After a (approximately) 2 hour viewing, I have to say that it was an insult to the audience's intelligence. The premise of a serial killer giving a chance at life to those who take it for granted is definitely a good one. The photography is also very meticulous and intriguing. But aside of those two things, this movie just plain sucked. First of all, you kind of get the idea of who is plotting everything from the beginning and the ""sins"" of the main protagonists. The acting from Cary Elwes and much of the cast leave much to be desired. When you finally get to the end, you realize that you have been suckered all along, but can't say it's genius because there are holes in the rationale. Not to say that I felt cheated on an intellectual level; as a matter of fact, I like films that challenge me, whether I got the killer/concept or not. The problem is that the filmmaker or the scriptwriter makes you think that he came up with a original and genius concept, but then tries to obfuscate his mistakes with an implausible, if not ridiculous, ending while trying to stroke his ego. I cannot stand this type of reckless film-making and neither should the audience."

","I don't want to give away too much in this movie, but all i can say is that the amount of buildup an suspense created by this movie leading up to the end, was not worth the ending. This film started out with a good premise, 2 guys trapped in a room with no clue of how they got there or what the point of them being there is. The more this film unravels, despite the shock factor, it is just too far fetched to be believed. There were too many questions left unanswered, what was the deal with the wife and the child? How does the killer actually hunt down his prey and how why does he do it? There wasn't enough motive there it was all based on shock an gore factor, which leaves a lot to be desired."

"scarletminded","3","2","3","20 February 2005"," Tries very very hard, but isn't the great thriller I thought it would be
","Contains spoilers<br/><br/>I thought this movie was OK. Not bad, not a masterpiece, just OK.<br/><br/>What I liked: A strong wife character for once! So many films like Seven have whiny little wives that seem more plot points than 3-D, something for a main male character motivation. Saw blew that out of the water. The movie had a Cube like feel that I enjoyed ""how did I get here"" and the paranoid, etc. Saw borrowed a lot from Cube and I liked Cube much better. I thought the movie had great acting, especially over some of the writing the actors had to deal with, the ""are you OK""s enough to make me start laughing...no, I am not OK, I am being kidnapped or no, I am not OK, i've been shot, plus the opening scene had some very bad dialogue that could have been totally cut out, but the actors did a lot with what was given to them. Plus, the weird statement by the black cop to the girl drug addict who had experienced extreme trauma, not to mention killed someone, ""Do you feel grateful?"" What? Who talks to a victim like that? Sorry, this is easily become the dislike section, sorry! I did like the use of the props in the film to create a puzzle, the key, the X, the photos, the recorder, etc. I liked the ideas used in the plot, though for me they tripped on their feet (heh) in the end. The cell phone scene where the doctor hears shots and his child scream etc was pretty horrifying as was the scene with the girl with the Brazil like device on her head. Was all that metalwork needed? For every good scene, though, there was an equally bad special effects driven scene with bad dialogue. Yes, it was maddening in both good and bad ways. I did like how the story of the doctor and where he was kept changing with added information.<br/><br/>What I disliked: Can we say Seven and Natural Born Killer moments until it hurts? I started to assume this movie was only intended for teenage boys, since it was videogamey here and there. The car chase scene at the end was truly laughable, but I am not sure if it was meant to be or not. The constant jiggling camera and spinning were just annoying and reminded me of a Nine Inch Nails video. It's been done too many times before and it was a strike against the decent plot of the movie instead of a boon. It looked like a complete Seven ripoff. <br/><br/>There was a lot of confusion for me viewing this. My suspension of disbelief doesn't run so high as to believe that a madman can literally lie still and play dead for 8 hours. If fact, I turned away for the movie for a second and thought the doctor who cut his foot off actually got up and tore his face off Scooby Doo style to reveal the bad guy. That is how much I couldn't believe the bad guy here just played dead for 8 hours with neither of the man in the room noticing. I didn't believe the black guy would have gone mad enough to follow this man, because I thought the ex-cop thought the doctor was the killer. He could definitely see he wasn't, so the plot threw me off there. Plus, there was a girl who survived, yet couldn't say anything about where she had been, yet the cops could figure it out in about five seconds? Then there is the whole doctor shooting Adam but Adam not dying. I could have sworn the doctor hit him full on in the chest and I am sure someone can make the point that the doctor was mad and therefore tried to kill Adam so his family could live, even if it was too late, but it fell flat on me. <br/><br/>Why would he shoot Adam then? It seemed the only way to explain was too say ""they all went mad"" because we didn't really get a motive other than the bad guy had a disease and wanted people to appreciate life by causing them trauma that made a few of them go insane. But when we see him in the hospital, he is in a coma, or at least I thought. So that leaves me confused. Plus, the ""game"" seemed so bloody complex, you really start to wonder how one person could do it all without being found out or something going wrong. Even with a good amount of fantasy and disbelief added.<br/><br/>Overall, if I watched this film 3-4 times, I would probably make sense of it or things would become clearer. But I don't want to waste my time on it. I guess a lot of people liked this film but I didn't think it was more intelligent or suspenseful than any other movie on the market. Maybe I have too high of standards for my suspense-mystery flicks. I want movies in that genre to be a roller coaster, this one tended to stop before the ride was over and I got out, entertained but wanting to experience the last part of the ride but couldn't get back on. This is more than people who like their suspense films like an interesting story without much commitment to the ""whys"". I rather like the whys myself but this really had none. It was like a suspense film without much suspense. I really wanted it to be more."

","""Saw"" is the story of two guys who are locked in a room chained to a pipe. One of them is told he must kill the other and if he does his wife and child will not be killed. The only way they can get free is to cut through their foot. This film at no time thrilled or scared me like a thriller is supposed to do. I think the reason for this were the huge holes in the story and abysmal acting, if you call them actors. This film took 18 days to film and it shows.<br/><br/>Now for some of these holes. First the cell phone worked in that environment. Mine never would have worked. It would not have gotten reception. Here comes the spoiler so if you have not seen the film do not read the rest of this. The killer was playing dead in the same room with these two guys and during the entire film he did not breathe or twitch a muscle. Then before he got up he let the doctor leave the room, not that he could get too far in this condition. Can we say witness. And lastly and more importantly even though the saws could not cut through the solid metal of the chain why didn't they cut through the pipes. Pipes are very thin and hollow. <br/><br/>Now god forbid let us wait for Saw 2."

When the two captives were up close to each other near the end, one audience member yelled out, 'Here comes the Hollywood Kiss'. The audience broke down laughing.

","If you like movies such as Seven and Silence of the Lambs, then you will probably enjoy this movie. Alright, the acting was pretty laughable in this movie, and the general story was not that original, but it really had some great, and gruesome, ideas. Many people compare it to Seven, but I think it really worked off some of the ideas in Seven well, improved it some and really made the ideas its own. The cinematography was awesome, and the movie was overall creepy. The movie can be pretty gross at parts, and tends to be very suspenseful and tense. There are virtually no boring parts in this movie. Just lots and lots of rising tension. Very thrilling. The ending was also a complete shocker. Actually, a common complaint amongst my friends is that the ending is too shocking! I know that sounds odd, but once you see the ending, you're going to think to yourself, ""Wow, I did not see that coming at all."" Sure, there are some scenes that the acting is so bad, that it's funny. And it is funny, rather than lame, so I'm not complaining. Some movies seem like they have bad acting, but it's really just poorly written. It's the opposite for this movie. It's well-written, just some of the actors are bad. It's just a good thing that the acting does not really take away from the creepiness of the movie, and its great ideas. So if you like these kinds of movies, then I'm sure that you'll enjoy Saw. And if you do not appreciate the ideas in this movie, then I'm sure you'll at least find some of the acting to be entertaining. 7 out of 10.

"phatmojo","Null","2","3","30 October 2004"," Saw: an in-depth review (no spoilers)
","Saw was a good and refreshingly original horror film that was almost great. With a mixture of a capture-the-killer plot and sick-and-slick psychological terror it recalls such films as The Cell and the gritty feel of Se7en while remaining completely its own. The plot alone is worth the eight bucks to see: two strangers wake up in a locked room, chained on either side, with a man in the center who died from an apparent suicide. Together, they must jog through their memories and random clues in the room to piece together the killer and a way out. They each are supplied with a hacksaw which isn't sharp enough to cut through their chains but maybe a leg<br/><br/>Saw is in the category of what I like to call the second-wave new horror that (apart from mpaa restrictions) isn't afraid to take horror to the next level and is much more psychological and realistically gory. Se7en (1995) was one of the films that started this second wave showing there's more to a horror film then a cheap scare. However, unlike such milestones as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, I'm afraid this film will eventually be one of the many films that will collect dust on the video store shelves only to be checked out by true horror movie fans. <br/><br/>The problem with the film lies not in its main plot but its execution. The first thing I noticed was the film's blatant inexperience. I checked IMDb when I got home and my guess was correct, this was the writer/director James Wan's first film. Although the plot was amazing some of the story and situations to help run it just didn't seem real, (a major problem I had with Jeepers Creepers, which I apologize for even mentioning.) The characters didn't seem to behave and talk like most normal people would. At first I chalked it up to second-rate acting, but I realized that these actors - especially veteran actor Danny Glover, are not bad actors and that it had to be equal parts inexperienced script/directing.<br/><br/>Less problematic but still awkward was the cinematography. Just like most other aspects of the film, it was hit-and-miss. There were some scene changes that were awesome and swept right into each other, and then there were those scenes that just stuck out - a few scenes (and even characters) seemed extraneous. While it's good to have an abundance of information for a murder-mystery these people and scenes did nothing but interrupt the story.<br/><br/>I review this film really hard because it truly had the potential for greatness. While the above factors brought the film down it was only from 10 stars to a 7. If this film was ever remade it would be nothing short of perfect but the end would already be spoiled and thus defeat the point. I can only look forward to seeing what James Wan comes out with in the future, let's just hope he doesn't pull a Larry Cohen and make a movie called Cellular after his hit Phone Booth."
"ConnRog","3","2","3","29 October 2004"," Too many flaws plague this thriller
","I went into SAW with high hopes, and while it was very interesting for most of the way through, in the end, the writing ruined it. (Spoilers) The real flaw is that the characters actions didn't shape the story, the story shaped their actions. We are given no reason why the real killer was doing this. Since his victims almost never live, whats with the ""Phone Booth"" life lessons? Also the decoy killer, Zap, was too sadistic in his actions to be someone who reluctantly is doing all this to save his life. All the acting was poor as well, i don't think of Cary Elwes as a bad actor by any means, but he really wasn't good at all. Not that most people consider this in this type of movie, but serial killers don't play games with victims or cops. The whole shock value aspect in these movies can really only go so far, before it all feels like deja vu. If you're looking for a good killer thriller, seven and silence of the lambs are much better movies on all levels, acting, directing, scripts, use of cinematography etc. While its by no means a horrible movie, at a minimum 5 or 6 dollars, you can save a couple a rent something much better and worth your time."

I understand that a lot of you like being mind-f*cked by the ""twist"" ending, but it was just that: a twist ending for the sake of a twist ending.

Cary Elwes performance was mind-numbingly bad. I had never cared so little for any character simply because I couldn't stop laughing. As for the other guy in the room (who I understand is the writer, which gives me more reason to dislike him) he was bad. My comments to him...stick to writing. Actually, get out of the business.

","How far would you go to save your own life? Go ahead; ask yourself that question right now. Exactly how far would you go? Would you kill someone if your life were on the line? Would you cut through someone's stomach to get something you needed to save yourself? Would you watch an entire night of UPN programming with no interruptions? Would you make out with Rosie O'Donnell? The extent a person would go to save his life, an indication of how much he actually wants to live, is the underlying theme of Saw.<br/><br/>The movie follows the sick and twisted exploits of a killer only known as ""Jigsaw."" But in reality, he hasn't killed anybody. He's much more sadistic than that. He places people in very dire circumstances and then tells them what they need to do in order to survive. It's all part of his game. You break the rules, then you'll pay the consequences.<br/><br/>Simply put, Saw is one of the most entertaining, original thrillers of the year. You might want to introduce yourself to the edge of your seat before the movie starts because chances are the two of you will be getting acquainted real quick. In fact, it might not hurt to bring it flowers. My interest was piqued at the very start, and just when I was scared I had figured everything out (and was getting disappointed because I thought things were going to be too predictable), the movie slapped me right upside my face and taught me a little lesson in not thinking too far ahead.<br/><br/>Now if you're the nitpickiest of nitpickers, then you can find enough nits to pick if you have nothing better to do. The movie's got its flaws; I won't deny that. Plot contrivances? Check. Plot holes? Sure. The acting? Well, it's a tad suspect at times, mainly in regard to Cary Elwes. Rumor has it that a landing strip was placed on ""the top,"" and he just flew right over it. Elwes kicked subtlety in the crotch, and then beat it while it was down. He's all right when he is more constrained, but at times it feels like he is auditioning for a high school production of Hamlet. I haven't seen so many crocodile tears since Bill Clinton attended Ron Brown's funeral. Oh well, just be prepared to laugh at him and you'll be fine. Other than that, the acting is decent even though most of the characters like to scream a lot.<br/><br/>Personally, I can ignore the film's flaws because I was mainly concerned with where the movie was headed and if it could pull everything together effectively. I'm happy to report that the climax is possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie I've seen this year. Off the top of my head I count six unexpected twists in that short amount of time. To put it bluntly, the ending knocked my socks off, ran 'em through the rinse cycle, chewed 'em up into little pieces, spit 'em in my face, and made me thank it for the privilege. It was quite the spectacle.<br/><br/>I guess I better warn you that if you're looking for a pot of gold and a rainbow at the end of these proceedings, then you'll be disappointed. But I liked the ending. It fit with the dark tone and dreary atmosphere of the rest of the movie. This isn't a love-fest about every child in the world getting a puppy. It's a movie about a demented individual with a really warped view on what constitutes a fun game. I guess Yahtzee just doesn't do it for some people.<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>Saw is the perfect thriller to get you in the Halloween spirit. It's not what I'd call overly scary, but it'll keep you in a constant state of unease. The scariest thing about the movie is that there *could* be an individual out there like ""Jigsaw,"" but it's probably best if you don't dwell on that.<br/><br/>If you don't like gruesome movies that revolve around people in very tense, unenviable positions, then this may not be for you, but it wasn't nearly as gory as I was expecting. For the most part we're shown the beginning of an act of violence or gore, and then we're allowed to form our own mental images. It's really nothing I haven't seen on a very special ""Viewer Discretion is Advised"" episode of CSI. So if you think you can handle it then check it out and enjoy the thrill ride. <br/><br/>Rating: 4 (out of 5)"

","This movie really had a chance to be a great film. The opening scenes, and many scenes in the film, are creatively very interesting and original, with a grainy look throughout that is reminiscent of 'Se7en'. The acting leaves a little to be desired, but the plot itself is first-rate stuff, with few mistakes, although of course there are always a few goofs, but it's easy enough to swallow. Beware that some of the characters may seem a little stupid, but oh, well. Take it in stride.<br/><br/>Captivation is the key word here, in the world of 'Saw' and in the viewers themselves. You *will* be interested, and you'll want to see how it all turns out.<br/><br/>Spoilers are definitely a no-no for this film - please see it with no previous knowledge, and you will be rewarded. There are many other movies that are more intelligent than this, but it's acceptable fare in comparison to what's served today, and well worth seeing at least once.<br/><br/>Don't pass this up - one of the best of the season for horror fans.<br/><br/>6.8 out of 10"

Maybe I didn't notice because I was to wrapped up trying to figure it out along with the victims. This movie kept my attention. In the beginning I was afraid I would be disappointed. It seemed to move kind of slow for me...more mystery...less actual horror......once we got onto the second half tho and the doctor started loosing his composure...YES!!! now thats what I want to see...hysteria, panic, realization of whats really going on, despair, all of it..and I got what I wanted thats for sure. I am one of those people ALWAYS trying to figure out the ending before it arrives...I thought I had it...I don't get fooled often...this movie got me and that made me love it even more. I was pleased as things unraveled as hero's annoy me. I wanted a clever ending that wasn't a storybook close,not and they all live happily ever after. Certainly wont find that here. Not so gory that I couldn't watch....but left plenty of scenes where I had to grit my teeth and hold my breathe...especially when you see that the dr. is coming to the realization that he is definitely going to use that saw for the purpose it was intended.<br/><br/>I was like...omg I think he's gonna do it....GREAT STUFF!!"

","I got to see this film at a screening tonight, and had the added honor of having the filmmakers there for a Q&A to introduce and follow the movie.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't stellar, and the movie itself was admittedly a little rough around the edges, but none of that really mattered. It was one of the most intense and disturbing movies I've ever seen. It became pretty clear why that was so during the Q&A. The filmmakers mentioned that they had been approached about just selling the script, but since they had worked so hard on it for so long, that it was their project and they were going to hold out until Wan could direct and they would maintain control over the script. And thankfully, Evolution gave them the funding and left them with creative control of the project.<br/><br/>The result is that the whole movie has a level of internal cohesion that can only come when the project is a labor of love from concept, through development, and ultimately into production. Despite the faults of the movie, it still worked amazingly well, and had such a profound effect, because it was made by people who intimately knew every nook and cranny of the script, concept, and plot. <br/><br/>My fear is that this movie will go the way of Blair Witch (about which I had very similar feelings.) This movie will benefit from some very well deserved positive word of mouth, but it's just too intense, and too much of a niche film to live up to the mass market's expectations. This is NOT a movie for the general movie going public. This is a movie for people who appreciate the art of film-making, and want to be scared and frightened by a challenging work. If the average popcorn muncher makes it through 45 minutes of this one, I'll be impressed. For those who go -- and I recommend it highly -- be ready for a unique experience that one can never truly be prepared for."

","Saw is a perfect example of a movie that should have been standalone, because the sequels really ruin all the mystery and atmosphere established in this film.

"triton_ogletree","5","1","1","4 November 2018"," Se7en meets Cube
","I don't care much for this film. My main reason for not liking this film is because almost the entire movie ripped off two movies that I do like. Those films are called Se7en and Cube. Both of these films were released within a ten year span of Saw and both were good. Cube's acting and effects aren't great but the concept makes up for it. Se7en is a gritty, suspenseful masterpiece. Saw is a pretty blatant rip off of both. I understand that most films are rip offs of other films but again, these both came out within a ten year range of Saw. That's a little much. Try ripping off something older next time and try not to be quite so blatant about it. I mean, watching Danny Glover rush to save the day was almost a frame for frame replication of Freeman chasing down Pitt and John Doe.<br/><br/>The film is graphically violent and the plot is pretty basic. Two guys wake up in a room and have to figure out why they're there and how to escape. There's torture devices, red herrings, plot twists, good guys, bad guys, etc. It ends pretty well, although half of it's very predictable, the other half is pretty smart.<br/><br/>Had I not already seen all the film's that this movie stole from, I would likely reward it with an additional star or two but that wasn't the case. So, you may like it more than me. If you have seen those films, you'll quickly realize what I am talking about. This is not the most gruesome or brutal film that I have ever seen but I also own Traces of Death on DVD...so, gore doesn't exactly disturb me. That, said, if you're squeamish, it might disturb you.<br/><br/>There's one more reason that I don't like this film...the sequels...knock it off!!! The villain's been dead forever! Think of something original for a change!"

","Well Saw is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. With the premise it had, I honestly believe it could have been one of the best horror movies of the 2000s. Unfortunately, there are too many problems, the biggest being the acting. The guy playing Adam was so bad, he actually made everyone in the theater laugh hysterically. Every other problem I had was relatively minor, like in the opening shot of the movie, we see Adam waking up in a bathtub full of water and it looks like he's been there for a while. How didn't he drown? Stuff like that. Like I said, minor, but it drove me crazy. For once, I actually hope they reboot this franchise and do it right. 4/10."
"vip_ebriega","5","1","1","18 October 2007"," Far from what the hype has made it look.
","My Take: A few good moments, but not exactly as great as its hype has made it look. <br/><br/>I'm giving SAW a mixed review. The film has some very unique ways to scare you out of your seat, until they just made it too bloody and just messed up the the ending. The film starts out pretty well, following the strange, gloomy and gory traditions of other serial killer films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SE7EN, it also gets pretty good on the second act as well, but the third act, which is very long, is messed up and, I believe, they got bored for most of it and just gave it the ""kill them badly"" treatment. SAW is not a bad movie, and far more entertaining than I expected it to be, but then again, there are very big flaws that prevent me to give it thumbs up.<br/><br/>The film opens in a terrific gloom when surgeon Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and hired photographer named Adam (played by Leigh Wannell) are chained in an old cell, which looks exactly like an old bathroom with a voice in a tape recorder giving them strange instructions in how to survive. The voice comes from serial killer called ""Jigsaw"" (inspired from the markings he puts to dead victims). Unlike any serial killer, Jigsaw doesn't kill his victims Jason Vorhees-style, he allows them to try to survive he's twisted challenges or die trying, killing themselves. This time, for his latest victims, he gives him strange instructions to kill his fellow cell mate, in order to keep his wife and daughter alive. This is, of course, the twist, which I grant you will be effective.<br/><br/>The film then goes on with some rather interesting moments of suspense (minus the excessive blood and guts scenes), and even the flash backs, which rather detract from the main plot, are rather interesting. But, it seems like director James Wan wanted to finally end his film with a lot of things that just comes out of his head. Either blood sport that aren't totally quite as creepy as its strange revelations and suspense. And then of course, there is the ending. I mean, how could something that starts out pretty good end in such a way that the producers wanted more and the audience having enough. I would give away the ending for the sake of some who haven't seen it, but I will say my reaction to this conclusion. Let say that the characters in this film remain interesting to start with, but it all falters when they just wanted to end it with a lot of blood. This concept is very annoying, and I don't appreciate it for that.<br/><br/>Do I recommend SAW? Sure, as long as your stomach can take the intensity and your brain can handle the unsatisfying ending. Since there is a SAW II, you (for those who haven't seen it) already have a hint that there will be an open ending. <br/><br/>Rating: **1/2 out of 5."
"slcchina","6","1","1","24 May 2007"," A Let Down
","I have to say after all the hype, after all the hoopla - when I finally saw this film I was terribly disappointed. It was supposed to be this smart, scary film, and instead it went for shock value and plot twists that made absolutely no sense at all. As a shock film, it works, but on any other level it just doesn't.<br/><br/>Let's start with all the elaborate traps (which if you haven't seen the film you can see them in the trailer). These things are a forensic expert's dream - there's no way not to leave trace evidence behind somewhere. The police act with predictable stupidity for these kinds of films: the two detectives close in on a known serial killer - who they already know has a proclivity for booby traps - WITHOUT backup? A doctor who apparently doesn't know the first thing about actual first aid and can't tell... well, no spoilers here.<br/><br/>I think if the movie had just been two guys locked together in a room, and left at that, this would have been so much better. But by the time the third victim is trundled out it becomes clear it's all about the body count. The puppet's creepy, but it's the only original thing here. The pacing is good in places, and in others ruined by predictable plot clichÃ©s and unnecessary exposition that only further underscores the incredulity of the overly-complicated premise.<br/><br/>So why six stars and not lower? Because for the kind of viewer who likes this thing, there was nothing wrong with it. And if it hadn't been for all the hype, I probably wouldn't be so harsh on it, either. But for everyone who hailed this as the second coming - and all the films that followed in it's wake, it's just not worth it."

","I sat down with high expectations, which, as experience has shown, is never a good idea with movies. I had heard that this movie was like Se7en in some ways so I figured it couldn't be bad, boy was I wrong. The movie claims to be a thriller, yet I felt hardly any suspense at all, probably on account of the story taking place through cut aways, flash backs, etc... The thing that really sucked was the acting, Cary Elwes was never meant for drama, I mean isn't this the guy who did Robin Hood Men in Tights? I kept looking at him thinking ""He looks kinda like Will Ferrel, I bet Will Ferrel could do a better job""... They say there are a lot of twists and turns but really its just two hours of two guys chained up in a bathroom and them finding out how they're intertwined...Jigsaw was a pretty cool villain with a pretty sweet name but in the end I came away wondering why people were hailing this movie and why people, teens especially, feed into all these torture movies... Also, if you've ever seen the Twilight Zone, there's an episode called ""The Jeopardy Room"" with elements eerily similar to this movie... All in all, don't buy into hype unless you're ready to be let down"
"archerohio","5","1","1","29 November 2006"," Good idea done in by horrible acting
","First the good. The idea of a terminally ill man forcing others to re-evaluate their wasted lives is a solid premise. The sets were sufficiently dingy and creepy.

I understand what the director was going for in using it, but I didn't feel it worked. As for the acting, that's this films Achilles heel. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover are way over the top. Between Cary's blubbering and Danny's bug-eyes, you would swear you were watching a high-school play."
"bmoredlj","4","1","1","28 October 2006"," From what I SAW, undeserving of hype.
","Now there's three ""Saws"" with a fourth on the way...I don't really see why. I just saw the first saw, and I can imagine why a small company like LGF wants to make as many saws as they can, they make lots of money. However, this film is not very good. In fact, I consider it quite ungood, though not abysmal. Here are a few reasons in LIST form: LOL! <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting WAS fairly abysmal...A sub-par performance by Cary Elwes...not even up to par with his performances in ""The Crush"", ""Twister"", or even ""The Cat Returns"", which were respectable performances. When he truly hams it up, you'll know where, and his voice will change completely. I will say as little as possible about the other guy, the Leigh kid, who doesn't belong in a high school play let alone a friggin motion picture. I understand he's the director's buddy or whatever but he's not an actor...I've seen actors; actors ACT. He's more of a bartender. Keanu Reeves should school' dis young-in on this fine art.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cinematography was full and i mean CHOCK full of fancy-pants camera-shaking'n'baking, spinning', flashing, bass booms, camera shutter sounds, hand-held, reversed WHOOSHES, more flashes, and all that other silly camera stuff all these new silly movies that are trying to be scary are chock full of. It's all a bunch of fluff, like an guitarist with three dozen pedals at his feet to do all the work for him; meant to convince the unsuspecting cinema-goer that he's watching something of substance or artiness, when that's far from the case. Just hold the cameras still for a sec and think b4 you shoot.<br/><br/>Thirdly, The movie tries to be non-linear, with layered story lines, jumping to and from the past at odd times, making half of everyone's lines preludes for silly montages, flashing by random scenes summarizing the film at 30 frames a second, forced foreshadowing - revealing you ""surprises"" a Labrador retriever figured out as soon as the blatant hints were first dropped...It's all VERY clever, but it all adds up to a big muddled mess.<br/><br/>Last and most upsetting: I read on the rating label ""STRONG GRISLY VIOLENCE (SGV)""....hmmm. The first half of the movie is nearly friggin DEVOID of that SGV altogether (I thought horror movies are supposed to have lots of SGV! Is SGV in the first half not artsy enough??) I'm not totally desensitized to blood and gore, but an average episode of DEADWOOD had more gore than this movie, and that's just sad and inexcusable when the label promises SGV. From the way it was edited, the director/cameraman/editor seemed to be getting queasy while I just sat there saying: ""Okay, we're an hour and a half into the movie, WHERE'S THE FRIGGIN SGV?!"" I'm sorry, but if your movie is called SAW, and if advocate groups are going to protest it for its violence or whatever, it should CONTAIN violence, not just unmaimed people describing it.<br/><br/>Pant...pant...sorry, Don't mean to be longwinded...I just forgot; it's stupid to use all caps to represent yelling. I just hope saw 2 or 3 are better than this. 'Cause from what i SAW they'd better RETOOL (LOL) their whole friggin operation..."

Well, this movie is often compared to Se7en or called ""the best psychological thriller since Se7en."" Let me just say this, Saw is ripoff of Se7en. The killer's motives and method of dispatch are almost identical. There is a major difference, though, Se7en is a thrilling masterpiece. Saw is nothing but an average at best thriller that doesn't really go anywhere or provide any decent twists or thrills.<br/><br/>The basic plot is this: we open with two guys chained in a bathroom. They have absolutely no idea where they are or who the other person is. Neither do we. Slowly, we unravel who they are and what they're doing there. Through a series of flashbacks we discover more about the killer and some of his victims.<br/><br/>People may ask why I don't really like this movie and I always give them these reasons:<br/><br/>1. The acting is terrible. I hate to be picky but there was no one in this movie that could really act.<br/><br/>2. The annoying MTV feel the movie had. The editing was sloppy and quick, accompanied by MTV style rock music and lots of flashing which really got on my nerves.<br/><br/>3. It was nowhere near as original as claimed.

The acting wasn't very good, I felt it was ""twisted"" at the end for sake of ""wow, didn't see that coming"" rather than any real significance to the plot (like Saw II had). The inconsistencies bothered me.... it wasn't a case of human ignorance that led to deaths... it was a case of them being out of luck from the start. The man in the razor-wire...he WAS completing his task to survive...yet still died... Amanda's situation involved no physical self-sacrifice (no wonder she survived!), the key was lost at the start of the movie, so there was NO way they could get out of the bathroom to begin with.... it was just all very inconsistent with the premise of the film.

"Polaris_DiB","6","1","1","5 July 2006"," Good premise, mediocre actualization
","This movie starts out very strongly. Two men wake up in an old, isolated bathroom chained to pipes and with a dead body between them. As they slowly start to figure out what's going on, they discover clues to a puzzle that they must get out of; if they don't in time, they'll die (in various ways). It's all an elaborate scheme thought up by a serial killer named Jigsaw who's out to do something about people who don't appreciate their lives in the way he feels they should.<br/><br/>The plot--and general creepiness and scare factor--are weakened once we start playing the ""flashback and twist"" game. The doctor fellow knows who this killer is, because he used to be a suspect in the case... and thus the story gets told directly to us. And from there the movie loses most of its power. Instead of working out a great mystery over how this all came to be, we're just TOLD it (but with twists, see, because twists a good horror movie make). Instead of being confined, literally, to this room to find all the clues, we're taken on asides to other characters, one of which was completely superfluous (Danny Glover's detective character... seriously, could have not been in the movie at all and probably wouldn't have changed anything). And then we get some weird form of selective memory: ""Oh gee, I just now remembered what happened to me yesterday! Now that it's important for the audience to know!"" So it's definitely not what I would call the most tightly wound thriller, but the premise is a very good one. Knowing the way sequels work (and the fact that there are two already), I doubt they'll pump much more strength into the loose ends of this first one, so it's a shame that this great idea turned out pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>However, it was fun to watch anyway. It made up for superfluousness by inventing even more crazy traps and characters. One scene was so full of glurge it was ridiculous: ""And did you? Did you turn out a better person?"" ""*Cries* He saved me!"" I believe these situations would do a lot more to permanently damage people's lives than make them realize how important life is. I think that's part of the point of having him, is that he has this great idea but is too insane to realize that it would backfire, and just ends up hurting and killing people.<br/><br/>So ultimately, fun to watch, not the greatest slice of horror pie ever.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Here we have the cancer-ridden Jigsaw Killer, kidnapping weaklings and failures, and subjecting them to horrific mental and physical torture, in order to teach them the value of 'life'. Isn't that terrific? It's just like the story of Job, only better, because in Job we don't get to witness a pathetic drug addict carve open a live man's stomach and remove the key that will unlock the explosive device strapped to her head! And, like Job, she is now a better person! It's better than Sunday School! If only there were more Jigsaw Killers around, the world would be a better place and we would all be happy!<br/><br/>Saw is a mess. It's not particularly well shot, the acting is mediocre, and several jerky MTV-style camera moves and montages, accompanied by appropriately stupid speed-metal, strain one's patience to the breaking point. Almost every character is annoying, crazy, or selfish. Its one red herring makes no sense: the orderly initially has been shown to be empathetic, caring, and concerned, just the qualities that the Jigsaw Killer would likely appreciate in a person. So why does the Jigsaw Killer end up blackmailing him? Did he jaywalk? Bungee jump? Have unprotected sex? Give me a break.<br/><br/>In the terrifyingly brilliant Se7en, Saw's obvious model, the religious fanatic dealing out his own twisted brand of justice is obviously insane. Morgan Freeman, the decent cop, is the moral center of the film. In Se7en's shattering climax, Brad Pitt's choice of revenge over restraint is correctly seen as a moral failure, and the killer's posthumous triumph leaves the viewer feeling disgusted and defeated. On the other hand, in the stunning black comedy, Hannibal, the brilliant, cultured cannibal, Dr. Lector, who only eats ""the rude"", tempts the righteous, heroic Clarise Starling (""would you like me to...hurt them for you...Clarise?""), and fails. Again, the film's drama arises from the choice that a decent character is given between good and evil. Evil is appropriately seductive, because, if it were not, there would be no temptation, and no drama. <br/><br/>Saw has no such complexity. It appeals simplistically to the uninformed post-Christian self-righteousness of an audience that fails to see how complicit it is in its own degradation. <br/><br/>Pay attention, all you hipsters out there who are cheering this film on. More likely than not, you are the type of person that the Jigsaw Killer would like to chain up in his dank, green basement.

","When two men who seem to have nothing in common find themselves trapped in one of the worst bathrooms, (one that rivals the toilet from trainspotting), they come to realise they are at the hands of the serial killer Jigsaw. The irony of Jigsaw is that he isn't really a killer; he hasn't killed anyone. Instead he sets up 'games' which will either kill the victim or they have to fight to survive. Adam and Dr. Gordon are chained either side of the room and in between them is a dead body. Not long after they find their messages from Jigsaw and the game has started. The aim of this game is for Dr. Gordon to kill Adam before 6 o'clock; if not his wife Alison and daughter Diana will die. There are clues everywhere for them to escape, they have to figure out the clues to survive.<br/><br/>The idea behind Saw is great. It's twisted, macabre but overall its a step away from the mainstream thrillers. The idea though was brought from the draw back of having a small budget, yet stripping it back to a simple one location and a small cast makes to more focused and the concept can flourish for it. You can see though that there is a mix from other films that have influenced Saw. The killer teaching people the preciousness of life; Seven. People waking in a strange location and need to figure out how to escape; Cube. People thrown into a situation to fight for their lives at the cost of other lives; Battle Royale. Though Saw has a very solid foundation, it does have its flaws, which does effect the overall impact.<br/><br/>The acting is the least desirable factor. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover are so way under par; its nowhere near their best job. Danny seemed really rigid and Cary was to over the top in the more dramatic scenes. Being his first major role, you can see Leigh Whannell doesn't have a lot of acting experience yet he still does alright. Monica Potter while having a minor role just walks through the steps without much enthusiasm.<br/><br/>The intensity of Saw has a problem of keeping it at a constant pace. There are times when the intensity blows through the roof and you find your hand is searching for something to grip onto; Amanda cutting into a mans guts to find the key to her head trap and Paul stuck in the razor wire trap are very intense, but then it falls flat and takes awhile before it starts to pick up again. The feel of Saw though is very dark and bleak. There isn't that sense of hope that lies within many thrillers. All the games that are quickly looked upon in flash back are some of the most macabre situations ever. Though it would have been so much better if they were developed and fleshed out more; adding more dimension to the world of Jigsaw, instead of the quick glances. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with Saw is due to the small shooting schedule that James Wan had. He had only eighteen days of shooting and not a lot of time in post production. Give that if he had more time, he could have made those touch up and been able to fine tooth the over all product. Yet credit has to be given to Wan and Whannell for getting this done on such a short schedule and a small budget.<br/><br/>Though it has its flaws, Saw is still a great watch. It has one of the best twists that comes right out of left field and punches you so hard that it resonates in your mind for days."
"lichtbogen","4","1","1","7 May 2005"," sick plot, so-so acting
","as others mentioned before, this movie is full of those stupid victims, whose actions do not contribute to the movies tension, but rather annoy the viewer. cinematography is technically fairly good, but the performance of the actors is not. especially the main character, a surgeon, does it really trashy. it's a pity that movie makers put so much effort in achieving technical skills, disregarding the fact that to tell a really good story, it's necessary to know a lot about human behaviour, emotions, vileness and probity. I'm afraid this is not going to change unless the consumer strongly demands higher standards. Showing off one's really sick ideas is just not enough. I read a lot about the dazzling plot of this motion picture, but seeing it was one disappointment."

","Saw would have been somewhat good if the plot was developed thoroughly enough not to remind us that we are watching this movie and not ""Seven"" or ""Identity."" It is about psychopath whose victims kills themselves out of desperation, or by an inexcusable act of irony and selfishness saves themselves. There were also too many inconsistencies with the story and the directer really took too much liberty in creating loop holes for the characters to fall into and borrowing a lot of Hichcock's famous movie moments similar to one in ""Rear Window"" and hoping we do not take notice.On the subject of characters.... How many times do we have to see Danny Glover as a cop? Really? I bet it was a huge stretch to act out a character who has no importance in the movie and little dialog. The acting was just poor but I do not blame the actors because it is pretty obvious that the director was in the corner explaining, ""okay in this scene the psychopath is watching you on tape and you have to pretend to play a game that tricks the Psychopath into thinking that maybe he sees you dead then just lay there for awhile because we might cut out the game part in the editing room and you are really dead because you have seen the Mothman, okay?"

"Nigel St. Buggering","4","1","1","1 November 2004"," An industrial-grade disappointment
","The marketing teams behind the ad campaign for this film are to be commended, and I hope they received a raise. They took an extremely silly and nonsensical film, and made it look like the horror event of the year. This act of alchemy, while deceiving and underhanded, shows world-class talent that the film-makers themselves sadly lack.<br/><br/>Simply, ""Saw"" is a mess. It starts with one of the most promising concepts we've seen in many a year; a serial killer who never actually kills anyone, but engineers situations in which the victim or victims kill themselves/each other. It's unfortunate that this movie has laid claim to the subject, because a truly great movie could have been made of it.<br/><br/>The writers are clearly great fans of Dario Argento (the jaw trap was particularly evocative of Italian horror), but they are obviously much more infatuated with ""Seven"". This film is edited and art-directed to within an inch of its life, leaving us with something more like a Metallica music video than a thriller. The other serious issue lies with the plotting; the film is packed with flashbacks that illuminate very little, and serve only to confuse the actual timeline of events. The final moments are rife with revelations that are apparently intended to be chilling and significant, but instead elicit a series of ""so whats"". ""Oh, it's that guy"". ""Oh look, it's that other guy"". There isn't half enough set-up to these moments to really merit the reaction the creators want.<br/><br/>Rent some Argento. Watch ""Seven"" again. Or better yet, take this basic idea and write your own movie. Unless your name is Dean Devlin, it will make more sense than this, I guarantee it."

","Cary Elwes was not a good choice for this role at all. Firstly, he reminds me so much of his roles in ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"", it's distracting to watch him. Secondly, Cary, make up your mind! Are you American or British in this flick?!<br/><br/>Danny Glover had better go back to a Wes Anderson movie or reprise his role in ""Lethal Weapon"" to make up for butchering this role.<br/><br/>I guess overall, the beginning of the movie compared favorably to ""Se7en"", however, the last 10 mins. ruined the plot for me (...a little predictable...) and the horrible acting/casting did it in.<br/><br/>4/10 (I didn't walk out of it and the beginning was cool.)<br/><br/>ps---This isn't a horror/gore flick...it's more suspenseful than anything else.

","When they announced at the start of the screening for SAW at Austin Film Festival that there would be no Q&A, as the director, writer, and star (Elwes) could not make it, we were disappointed. After screening it, we decided they were probably in hiding. <br/><br/>SAW had a lot of potential, but less of it realized than the hype. A little more restraint with the flashbacks and fast edits, and paring down of the melodrama would have made for a lot more tension, and lot less laughter during scenes I'm convinced weren't intended to be humorous. <br/><br/>SAW features Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, two actors who can turn in solid performances. However, here, they are flat, and melodramatic. The best acting is done by the lessor players here. <br/><br/>Despite all the twists, too many in fact, SAW is disappointing.<br/><br/>I had high hopes, and they were dashed.

"danielmiller1985","8","1","1","7 October 2004"," Twisted, Disturbing, Very Original & Clever
","I SAW it last night expecting it to be a very good film, and it certainly was! It's the kind of film that looked amazing in the distinctable trailer that looked disturbing. Without giving anything away, there are quite a few NASTY concepts in the film that make you cringe - some of the memorable ones are: a jaw snapper, an automatic firing squad, spaghetti junction in razor, barbed wire, but for me the moment that most affected me and made my skin crawl was when Lawrence resulted to shoving a shirt in his mouth to decrease the volume of his screaming & cut off his bloody supply leading to his foot, and then he CUT his own FOOT OFF with the SAW!!! There was something about the way Lawrence said to Adam he'll get help that made me Laugh, maybe because of how OVER THE TOP he acted it - to a point of making the scene CHEESY. The SCRIPT writing of this film was very carefully thought of and it actually included some very humorous sentences. The conclusion was quite confusing for me because somethings weren't fully explained in an easy way to understand, but after the film and I started thinking about it, it was such a CLEVER & ORIGINAL film, that at times was genuinely SCARY & JUMPY. It is without a doubt one of the best HORROR in a long time! I'll recommend it to anyone who wants a film that is so TENSE all the way & a film that makes you THINK & of course someone who wants a REAL FRIGHT! I will never look at a saw in the same way ever again, & surely neither will you! Two final words, SEE-SAW!!!"

","I didn't really know what to expect from this film, I had seen the trailers and the posters and thought it would run along a similar line to Texas Chainsaw Massacre with plenty of POV chases, lost limbs and psychos, but I was wrong. The way the story unfolded left me guessing constantly, and most of my guesses were wrong which left me feeling more intrigued. This film works more on a psychological horror level than a gory ""o my life his heads been blown off"" level, it makes you think and it constantly begs the question, ""what would you do?"" Excellent film, best I have seen for ages, very original and very scary. One let down was a piece of editing, where a fast forward technique was used, and did, to me at least, look a bit out of place in such a class film. 10/10!!!"

","When this movie started it looked like it might be a gritty adrenaline pumping nail-biter. It opens well with two guys waking up prisoners in a room. How did they get there? Why are they chained to a wall on opposite sides of the room and who is the stiff in the middle of the room lying in a pool of blood. <br/><br/>Sadly the film, which is innovative for the genre in several ways, lets itself down by some plodding performances, poor pacing, mediocre lighting and mirth inducing scenes where the action is sped up.<br/><br/>So what's to like? The gory deaths are inventive and there's one effective suspense scene where a character illuminates his surroundings using a camera flash while searching for an intruder. I also liked the bizarre jaw breaking device which looked something out of an Edgar Alan Poe tale of Gothic horror. The obligatory twist ending did catch me completely by surprise and almost made me forgive the movie's shortcomings it was so well done! (oh - the score was good too - as was the acting by the younger prisoner who wakes up in the room at the start.)<br/><br/>The movie shows a lot of potential so let's hope the director's next project has better performers, cinematography and tighter editing. To come up such innovative ideas in a genre that's this old means the creative force behind the movie certainly has more to offer. <br/><br/>6 out 10"

","SAW was the final film of the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness program, and the most anticipated. I think it was the first, though not the only film to sell out Ryerson's huge (1200+ capacity) theatre. My hat, if I were actually wearing one, goes off to Colin Geddes (Festival Programmer) for always knowing exactly how to end the film fest.<br/><br/>This film has everything you want from a horror movie. It has a few laughs, it's scary, extremely original, with interesting characters, a wicked soundtrack, and enough gore to make some audience members turn away. There aren't many films that have ever kept me guessing, and this is one.<br/><br/>The first feature film from Australian director James Wan (written by himself and buddy Leigh Whannell, who stars in the film as Adam) was completed incredibly with only 5 days of pre- production and 18 days of filming. The, also Australian, Spierig Brothers (UNDEAD) even sent the SAW team a letter congratulating them and telling them they were in good hands with the Toronto audience. Australia is quickly becoming known for creating some of the best cult films in the world.<br/><br/>I've also never wanted a movie prop, the reverse bear trap headpiece, so badly in my life. Too cool.<br/><br/>SAW was so unbelievably good that it left me wanting more, and luckily the creative team hinted at a sequel featuring the twisted ventriloquist dummy that appears throughout the film. Hopefully, the big budget version of THE PUPPET MASTER that I always hoped for.<br/><br/>DO NOT read or listen to anything about this movie, or someone might spoil it for you. See this movie as soon as possible! (10/10)"

What have we learned? Guns don't kill people - jawbreaking, head-crunching helmets do.

","This is a very strong thriller (not really a horror movie: though it has some horrific elements, I felt the movie is mostly a puzzle of who's doing what and why) and shows tons of potential for director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell. There are some very original ideas, and some stylish direction. Nothing in this movie really felt like a 'gimmick' (ex: non-linear plot, static editing) stylistically (except for maybe that puppet thing), and for the most part this is a real well made movie. The thing that is a minus about this movie, though, is the acting. Across the board the acting felt 'flat,' and didn't really sell the characters for me. It was not a huge disctraction for me, but it did take away from the film. Also, this movie has some nice plot twists, so stick with Saw until the end!<br/><br/>Don't give up early if you think you know what's going on and become disappointed with what you think is an obvious 'twist.'

","Saw was one of the best horror movies that I have seen in a while, it wasn't your horror film in the cinema today, more along the lines of Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. It was very well thought out, which I could tell because when ever I thought I knew something or how it would turn out, it switched around to be something that I would never suspected. It also didn't make things too obvious (which it wouldn't have mattered anyway due to the sudden changes in the movie) but it did a good job by just doing things just right. For example, I was certain that during the scene where Dr. Gordon was demonstrating surgery to show the medical students, that Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) was the killer due to his shy mysteriousness and the way that the Doctor kind of embarrassed him, but it so happened to seem that it wasn't him behind the whole thing ( or at least with out a choice) but the madman was lying in the room the whole time with the doctor and the photographer, which the killer's identity was not given, leading you to watch the sequel due this Halloween which I am definitely going to see."

Those movies actually have things like a story that makes sense and decent acting. The lead in the movie is Danny Glover, and he really is useless to the story. Carey Elwes did better acting in Liar Liar, and the other guy who was in the bathroom with Elwes was equally awful. I don't buy the motive of the villain, or why he lays face down on the bathroom floor for an absurd amount of hours laying in poison blood. I don't think that America does want to see garbage movie's like this one. Anyone who is remotely entertained by this should really consider seeking help. I would be more entertained watching my clothes go round and round in the dryer than ever see this movie ever again. James Wan should never be allowed to direct a movie ever again and the entire writing staff should be fired. It already says that Saw 2 is already in pre-production. Let's all hope that this is one of IMDb's movies that always stays around saying it's scheduled to be made, but never is made. If a Saw 2 is made, I can't even imagine how they could make it more terrible. However, this time I won't be stupid enough to lay down money for such a piece of trash."
"andrewp-7","1","3","6","29 March 2005"," One of the worst films I have ever seen
","The movie 'Saw' like many others these days attempts to shock us with cruel and sadistic violence. The sad truth is that these desperate attempts don't work anymore. There is nothing remotely interesting about this film and the stupid story and twists it tries to shove down our throats. All I can say is that this film was a complete waste of my time. I also wonder what on earth has happened to Danny Glover's career. For someone who is such a great actor, Glover deserves to be in better films then this because his role in the film is unnecessary and a complete waste.<br/><br/>It's not even worth mentioning the story because it is so ridiculous and full of meaningless twists. The only thing to say about this film is how cruel and sadistic it is. Film makers should know by now that using gore and shock tactics DO NOT scare people! This is without any doubt one of the very worst films I have ever seen and a complete disgrace for a film. Just like all the other garbage out there, 'Saw' will soon be forgotten. This film has a very short shelf life."

","I have to say that I have just finished watching ""Saw"" and I'm ill. Not because of fine special effects, gory death scenes or mind-bending psychological plot lines. I'm ill because I spent an hour and 40 minutes of my precious time on this tripe. A poor shadow of ""Se7en"", ""Saw"" lacked both the skilled writers AND the skilled actors necessary to create a thriller of such magnitude. While Danny Glover is a formidable actor in any script, Cary Elwes has no place in horror. Don't get me wrong, his comedy is fabulous but, a shaken victim - he is not.<br/><br/>I felt that the the timing of many of the scenes was poorly planned and much of the gripping detail that could have made this film at least tolerable was out of place. The scene in which ""Larry"" cuts off his own foot only adds shock value, when (if placed at another moment in the film) it could have been a gut-wrenching scene of desperation. A truly human moment. As it was, it was barely interesting enough to keep me from turning off the DVD and watching re-runs of CSI.<br/><br/>Any self-respecting horror fan will run screaming...from the rental store if the management is pushing the viewing of this film."

I can't really say that there was any one obvious thing wrong with it, but weak acting (I didn't buy that guy as a doctor for one minute), holes in the script, and odd lighting and sound production, did not live up to my expectations. Maybe someday a more skilled horror director and a producer with better resources will remake this movie with better actors and scare the daylights out of us all. Please?"

Unfortunately I didn't count on the poor acting, the clichéd ""wife and child in danger"" scenes and the botched attempts at suspense. Two men awaken in an abandoned men's room... their ankles chained to opposite sides of the room. They have been put there by a bizarre serial killer who likes his victims to actively participate in their own demise. So each man gets a saw to free himself... the catch being that the saw blade isn't strong enough to cut the chains... to get free they would have to cut through their own leg. There is a time limit... and one man has to get free and kill the other or his family will die... yadda yadda yadda. Too bad the suspense inherent in this situation is put on hold to emphasize less-interesting sequences like a little girl who isn't believed when she says there's a man hiding in her closet. The movie isn't a total write-off... there are a few well-done scenes and some interesting red herrings... but ultimately the film is a big disappointment."

","**SPOILERS HEREIN**<br/><br/>Worst. . . movie. . . EVER.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with bad movies. In fact, I usually love them. That is, so long as the movie wasn't written, directed, edited and acted by mentally deficient chimpanzees.<br/><br/>Not only was every aspect of the movie done incorrectly, the movie as a whole was so incredibly uninteresting and totally not scary that I considered several times leaving the theater, walking up to the manager, kneeing him in the groin, and demanding my money back. From the very start, when they decided to open with a cheesy flash-back that quickly got lost in the myriad of other bad movie techniques, I had the distinct feeling of being ripped off to the tune of one movie ticket.<br/><br/>The very biggest fear I have in life (as in, the thing I actually think about and fear on an active basis) is being tortured. Not tortured in that POW kinda way, where someone is trying to get some information out of you, but tortured in that 'hee hee hee! I'm going to pull your arms off with a come-a-long' kinda way.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie did absolutely nothing to scare me. For something to be scary, you actually have to believe on some level that whatever is happening on screen could possibly happen in real life. And it's not that what happened to those poorly acted characters was totally absurd, but the once you string the whole craptacular mess together, it was just so totally. . . bad.<br/><br/>BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD<br/><br/>The only reason I'm going on and on about this is because I really wanted to see this movie. I was actually excited. It was billed as the scariest movie since Seven, and I was so ready to see it that I ignored the fact that it was a direct rip-off of Seven.<br/><br/>Oh? A mean shadowy figure forces 'innocent' bystanders into situations that replicate their own base and shallow existence? How original! They even got a well-known black actor (Danny Glover, though not classified as a 'good' actor, is still well-known) to play the part of the detective.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, neither Danny, nor what's-his-face (you know, the guy who played Wesley in A Princess Bride, (which was an excellent movie)) displayed any sort of the acting ability that got them compared to Brad and Morgan in the first place. This was like a fun-house mirror reflection of those. Except instead of making them fat or skinny, it made them stupid and empty. I'm not quite sure how a mirror would do that, but maybe the director could shed some light on that.<br/><br/>The only possible tourniquet that could have kept this movie from hemorrhaging out suck would have been a real good twist at the end. And, in the fall-short fashion that this gem carried throughout, they tried. It's just too bad that the twist seemed to come from an entirely different movie. Not only was it non-sequitor with the rest of the film, it was completely and unabashedly IMPOSSIBLE. Even if by some act-of-god had the twist fit into the story-line, it still sucked.<br/><br/>There is so much more to this movie that merits degradation, I just don't have enough time or energy or memory retention to pick out every piece. Maybe when it comes out on DVD, I'll buy a copy just to throw it in the microwave. I'd be doing the world a service by getting rid of one copy of this awful piece of celluloid.<br/><br/>Two very enthusiastic thumbs-down."

Having his name associated with such an awful film. And Cary needs to revisit acting classes. Badly. His accent was slipping through so much it became seriously distracting. And the over-the-top acting was cringe inducing.<br/><br/>It's movies like these that make me believe I could become a screenwriter. They are so ambitiously horrible. They steal ideas from movies before them and are shot and edited by crack monkeys. No amount of words can equal the disappointment I felt watching this film unravel into a tangle of illogical inconsistencies and horrendous acting. Not a single 'jump scene' even made me blink. No plot twists that surprised me. The audience was laughing heartily at this wretched film. Laughing because that's all they could do. They were trying to make the best of a bad situation. <br/><br/>I couldn't laugh. I just sat there feeling empty, knowing that my hard earned cash is lining the pockets of people hellbent on creating more of this cinematic drivel. <br/><br/>I expected nothing of genius... just something slightly amusing.

","I am not real sure when people that didn't pay real attention to movies started using IMDb, but not thanks to them I wasted 16 dollars, and I suppose part of my girlfriend's time. Saw seemed to be on a very low budget because the acting was horrid, and the use of special affects were even worse. The trailer really got my attention but I should have known better because the movie was produced by twisted pictures which is a company I have never even heard of before. Therefore, this no name company could only afford horrible actors and cheap props, ""exit wounds,"" etc. EVERYTHING was cheap. Carry Elwes and Danny Glover should have known better than to take on the roles for a first time director who would end up ruining the entire film. Not to mention, their performances were sub-par. The movie was clearly intended for modern day teenagers that wouldn't know any better. Sadly I sat with all of them and almost walked out of the theater because of my disgust. Those of you that have seen this terrible movie should all go out and rent Se7en, and see what it takes to make a real movie. The movie is NOT worth a 7.5, and I can not believe it is ranked that high on a most respectable website. I'm rating this movie lower than House of a 1000 corpses.

","Mild Spoilers<br/><br/>Two men wake up in a filthy bathroom. They don't know how they got there. They don't know why they're there. They can't remember much of anything. They try to move, but realize that their ankles are chained to metal pipes. Someone else lies dead in the middle of the room, a handgun still clenched in his pale left hand. In his right hand is a tape recorder.<br/><br/>The two men check their pockets. They each have a tape, their names  Adam and Dr. Gordon  scribbled on the outside. They grab the tape recorder and play their messages. A muffled voice tells them the rules of the game: They have mere hours to find a way out of the room by unscrambling a sequence of clues. If they run out of time, they'll look like the third man lying near them. If they win, they go free.<br/><br/>This is the setup for James Wan's disturbing killer-thriller 'Saw'  a movie that will frighten, shock, and disturb you all at once.<br/><br/>I liked the plot  I liked how deliberate the movie was, how forced its opening was, drawing us into its world immediately. There is no build-up. There is no character development prior to the credits. It starts, and it never stops. There is not a single boring scene in this movie, and not a single moment where I felt as if they had run out of ideas and resorted to flashbacks as a convenience. The movie does have a large number of flashbacks -- however, they are used as a narrative tool and not a cheap way of re-capping events  some movies use flashbacks because there isn't enough plot to spread across for an entire runtime, but 'Saw' never gave me that same cheated feeling. I always felt the flashbacks were a way of making the story even better, and more compelling.<br/><br/>The movie is a mix of many genres  it has the appearance of a serial killer film but its plot unravels in a fashion similar to that of a constrained buddy movie, its flashbacks are disturbingly simple (like that of a normal drama with a dark edge) and the twists remind one of something complex such as 'Memento,' 'The Usual Suspects' or 'The Sixth Sense.' Then there's also the cop genre thrown into the mix, as we see scenes in which a frustrated police force tries to solve the numerous murders.<br/><br/>The two lead actors are Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay). They spend a vast amount of time sitting inside a dirty bathroom talking about how they're going to get out of the nasty situation. Elwes is the doctor Gordon, a surgeon who suspects that 'Jigsaw'  an infamous unnamed sadistic serial killer  is responsible for the events. Jigsaw has left a flood of bodies in his wake  all of who technically killed themselves by trying to escape their surroundings (in one of the more technically-fascinating scenes a man wakes up enclosed by barbed wire, and must claw his way through it in order to escape).<br/><br/>Five months prior, the police held Gordon under suspicion after one of his tools was left at the scene of a crime. Even though Gordon had a solid alibi, one of the officers (played by Danny Glover) always suspected that the doctor was responsible and never gave up the pursuit.<br/><br/>The movie's only flaws are probably the dialogue and hammy performances  Cary Elwes has always been good at what he does, but here he seems to be trying to channel the talents of a greater actor  and totally fails. His American accent is laughably bad and uneven  his performance towards the end of the movie is similarly disappointing. Audience members began to laugh at one point, which is never a good sign. I can't help but think his performance actually softens the impact of what should be the most vital scene of the movie  its finale.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie is bad by any means. The way 'Saw' manages to disturb is in a very simple way. What's ironic is that unlike many other psychological thrillers, it is quite exploitative  it does show us quite a bit of gore. But it's not a boogeyman movie -- it relies on psychological shock tactics rather than the now-common cheap shock tactics, where someone jumps out of the shadows and kills the victim and we're supposed to be scared.<br/><br/>Like other low-budget shockers, I'm almost positive that 'Saw' will travel by word-of-mouth  it has already gained a slow but steady audience in the United Kingdom and its intake will surely increase in the States. It premiered at Sundance and garnered some great reviews and critical accolade -- inevitably the resulting hype is a bit strong for such a modest movie (every commercial ad features at least one reference to 'Se7en') but I purposely avoided reading anything about the movie, and now  in retrospect  I'm very glad I did. If my assumptions are correct 'Saw' will become another cult classic thriller and its popularity will gradually increase.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say without giving away too much: if you are tired of all the clichéd teen-slasher-flicks being released through Hollywood on a regular basis, 'Saw' is a great delight  it may not be a masterpiece, and it may not always be as solid as it seems to think it is, but it shocked, disturbed and entertained me. If you're looking for a likable Saturday night matinée and/or you're a queasy viewer, forget it. But if you're a daring viewer with an empty stomach then 'Saw' is a guaranteed delight. Highly recommended, and worth seeing more than once, especially if you're a fan of the genre.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

","Why do I want to write the review now on SAW ? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. I saw this movie for the first time in 2005. I have yet to see a movie that has brought such intensity. The music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it. An excellent soundtrack that keeps the heart racing as the victims running outta time. Da da daa. Da da daa was perfect for this kinda flick. Pretty low-budget and filmed in just a few days. Kudos to the makers James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Subsequent to my viewing of 'Saw', I went on to watch all 6 sequels. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one except for the 6th, which was decent.<br/><br/>It has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. The best ending since Usual suspects. Many ppl will complain that Sixth sense had it but I wud difffer as Stir of echoes had similar. At least the story for Stir of echoes, appeared long before The Sixth Sense, in Richard Matheson's 1958 novel. Saw ain't no torture porn like many ppl believe. It's one of the best mystery thriller.

","Saw (2004) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The film opens in an abandoned bathroom where two men are chained to opposite sides of the room. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) don't remember how they got in this room but soon Gordon begins to fear this is the work of a serial killer the police have labeled ""The Jigsaw Killer"". This serial killer doesn't actually kill his victims but instead puts them in a life or death situation where in order to live, the victims must kill the other person or instead, kill themselves. Gordon and Adam have just under eight hours to figure a way out of this puzzle before their untimely death occurs.<br/><br/>I remember reading a review of Wes Craven's Scream when it was first released and the reviewer, whose name I can't remember, mentioned that the opening scenes were so intense and it took no time to reach that high level of suspense. Within the opening minutes of Saw I felt the same way because, just like a fast car hitting zero to sixty miles per hours in a few seconds, this film takes off just as fast and is pretty relentless in its scenes of torture. However, the film with its wonderful start and finish is like two great pieces of bread without any fillings in the middle.<br/><br/>There is so much to admire in this film that I only wish the middle sections were half as brilliant as the rest of the film. The opening scenes have a certain dirty and grungy look to them that sets the film up perfectly. The idea of a serial killer who forces someone to kill themselves is another interesting idea that goes all out. Unlike many other horror films, we've actually got smart people thinking out their situations and trying to come up with the best way to live. We've also got an incredibly haunting ending that has such a claustrophobic feel that I was automatically reminded of the dinner scene in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br/><br/>Another high aspect to the film are the performances by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell who for most of the film are strapped to a pole. These two are the ones telling the story and it's up to them to get the viewers drawn into the story and make us want to care whether these men live or die. I was rather shocked at how much development was allowed in the screenplay for the Elwes character to really grow on us. Elwes has many emotional scenes in the film, especially towards the end when he begins to fear he may never see his wife and child again. The actual look of fear in his eyes is quite remarkable and I'd be curious to know how Elwes got himself to that level. Whannell is the more quiet of the two but he too makes for an interesting characters as does Danny Glover who plays a detective trying to track down the killer.<br/><br/>I mentioned the middle section of the film really doesn't work and I think it's mainly due to the fact that the intensity level from the start, once it hits the sixty miles per hour, slams into a brick wall and stops the film cold in its tracks. We get to see some of the serial killers previous victims but this really doesn't add too much to the story when we're supposed to be concentrating on the two men in the bathroom. The side story dealing with Elwes personal life isn't too interesting either but I guess this was somewhat needed in order for the viewing to understand why he was selected to play this game. I think the film would have been better off without all the back story and instead focused on the two men trapped in this game. I personally feel their acting was strong enough that it could have carried the film a lot further than any of the flashbacks did.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film hits full stride again towards the end with a finale that is downright shocking. I'm not going to give anything away but I wouldn't mind comparing the ending to this as being just as shocking as the ending to Psycho forty-four years earlier.<br/><br/>Not only does the shock ending work but so does the climax to our two characters fate.<br/><br/>Again, the feel of dread, torture and pain are so agonizing that I'd rank this higher than what was seen and felt in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film certainly isn't for the faint of heart and I'm sure those with prejudice attitudes towards horror films will be left sickened but hey, that's the point. Saw gets a marginal recommendation due to the wonderful start, ending and performance by Elwes."

Electricity no longer requires a path to electrocute a human (or maybe it was ""the force""). Cops successfully track down the correct killer's lair even though they're tracking the wrong man (who also doesn't know who the real killer is).

The character development was poor at best and I didn't care one bit whether they lived or died, which really kills the suspense. Not surprisingly, the cinematography stunk, as well.

I have to say i was shocked at the end when the man on the fool between the two guys was alive and he was the jigsaw. It freaked me out.

","FIRST REACTIONS: In the beginning, I wanted to kill myself. By the end, I only wanted to kill someone else. This 'movie' is a truly disturbing story about a truly disturbed man. It was made, ironically enough, by someone truly disturbed. Who else would produce something like this?<br/><br/>The opening scene is just God-awful and it takes its own sweet time to get any better. Midway through the film you begin to feel less sick to your stomach and by the time your 3/4 done you feel less like you're going to yak and more like you could go for a post-flick drink...and then they get 'cha with the ending.<br/><br/>I'm not going to include any spoilers on here, because the movie needs all the help it can get. I will say this though, the last five minutes of this movie are THE DUMBEST I HAVE SEEN SINCE SCOOBY DOO! It is quite possibly the weakest story of the year.<br/><br/>...and that's a wrap."

","I went to this movie with high hopes. I know not to get to excited when a movie is talked up, but this one looked so good. The plot was pretty good. The idea was really good. The writing was awful! It was as if one person wrote the beginning - decent writing - and one person wrote the end - Cheesy writing. It was absolutely hysterical. While horrible graphic images passed in front of me, I couldn't help laughing at the acting and the dialog. I would recommend this movie only for the idea of it, just be prepared for the dialog. As for the actors - Danny Glover served no real purpose, any one could have played that part, Cary Elwes didn't stand out at all. Monica Potter was just about the only one who was believable. This movie would have been better with a smaller budget and Indie actors."

","I may be the only horror fan left on the planet who hadn't ever actually seen a single entry in the ""Saw"" franchise. I had plenty of exposure to it in the form of parody - there's an unending supply of parodies of this film, many of which were just as bland, uninspired and unoriginal as I always seemed to believe the franchise itself was.
Today I watched the first entry for the first time, and i was pleasantly surprised. Was it the greatest horror film of all time, or the greatest franchise kickstarter I've ever seen? Not by a long shot. But it was a pretty interesting idea that you really need to watch for yourself to get invested in. It's not the typical ""person locked in a room with a time limit to get out because there's someone waiting outside to kill them if they fail."" This movie presents a killer with a coherent and interesting back story, even if they don't take the time to fully explore it in this film.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful; spot-on when it needs to be, cliche when the time is right, but always moving the plot along nicely. It's a non-linear story, which I also really appreciate. It's a film that demands your undivided attention from start to finish, and it's interesting enough to justify doing so.<br/><br/>While it's far from a perfect horror movie, I think it's a pretty decent entry into the genre that everybody should see at least once. I'm just disappointed that I put it off for so many years."

"Sachin_Patil","8","2","4","14 July 2019"," Fantastic
","This is one of the greatest psychological horror films of all time. Although it's sequels lost track of what made the original so great, the orginal is fantastic. This is a must see for film fans.

"kluseba","10","2","4","22 January 2019"," Perfect combination of grisly and intellectual elements
","Despite its limited budget, the participation of numerous amateur actors and the Australian writers' first attempt at creating a script, Saw became an unexpected massive success that has sparked a total of eight entries in the franchise so far. While other popular horror franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street had their share of significant ups and downs, Saw is one of the most consistent franchises of its kind. It represents horror cinema of the new millennium like nothing else.<br/><br/>There are numerous reasons why this first film of the franchise is nowadays considered a contemporary classic. The bleak settings get you into the film right from the start. The plot gets increasingly complex, surprising and twisted as it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The acting performances are surprisingly solid and intensify the movie's grisly emotions. The sinister special effects touch a profound survival instinct in the viewer that is repulsive yet inherent. The haunting soundtrack blends in perfectly. The camera work is calm and precise as it can be interpreted as an antithesis to the highly emotional story. A particular element of this film and the franchise in general are its concise flashbacks offering important background information adding continuous depth to the story.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with the movie's content, the film revolves around a photographer and a doctor who get kidnapped and awake in the restroom of an abandoned building. They soon realize that they are being held prisoners but are offered clues in order to find out why they have been imprisoned and how they can find a way out. The protagonists also realize that the person behind their fate is a philosophical serial killer known as Jigsaw. Meanwhile, the wife and daughter of the doctor also get involved in this deadly game. Frustrated police officers as well as a desperate private investigator try tracking down the anonymous serial killer separately before time tuns out for the two victims.<br/><br/>The combination of desperate survival instinct and grisly gore elements on one side and the detailed film-making and intelligent plot on the other side make Saw completely unique. Splatter film enthusiast and supporters of intellectual psychological thrillers will be equally drawn to this film and its ensuing franchise. Saw even deserves a better reputation than it has as it's often reduced to its visually shocking elements which neglects one of the best stories one could ever witness in a horror movie. No matter what kind of cinema you prefer, you should know that Saw should be considered the type of movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime. Having hesitated a long time to give this franchise a chance because of its unjustified stereotypical reputation, I have ended up discovering a modern cinematic masterpiece and the greatest horror movie franchise ever."

Then again, it wouldn't have been called ""Saw-1"" at that time since there's been about 27 additional Saw movies since. Okay. Well, only six additional ""Saws.""<br/><br/>I read that the shooting budget was $700,000. They went a tad over at 1.2 million smackers! But Saw took in just over $103 million worldwide! That's a nice ROI! BTW, 55 million of that 103 came from North America. Not unexpected.<br/><br/>SPOILER COMING!!<br/><br/>They set up the way Saw (Saw-1) ended, believing there almost HAD to be a sequel (or six!) Ironically, good old Jiggy (Tobin Bell), spent 99.73% of camera time taking a nap. That part was quite absurd. Look, these aren't amongst the most credible movies, but the idea the Jiggy could lay there face down with a pool of ""blood"" around him and not even pass wind once in the hours he was idle, and not even be seen breathing, is just way too much for me. I guess he would have had to have Depends on.<br/><br/>The story go somewhat dull around 60 percent in before it picked up pace when Danny Glover started chasing Zeppers towards the end. However, all-in-all, as stated, the film wasn't bad for its genre leading me torn between 6.5 and 7 on the rating scale here.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I suppose you may not.

","Saw is a grisly film that puts too much emphasis on the graphic scenes rather than the development of characters. I believe that gore in some cases adds realism to some movies and Saw is one of them. I do praise the art direction and the makeup in the film. But the film has many noticeable flaws if you pay attention. This is an example of the idiot game. If people in the movie actually had a brain, the problem would be solved and the movie would be over. One such example is an escaped prisoner of Jigsaw not telling the police where he is located. The police in the movie are relatively weak. I challenge their logic of having two people chase down Jigsaw with a pistol rather than a whole army. Another question that arises is, how does Jigsaw drug his victims? Does he simply knock on people's doors and drug them? According to many audience reviews, the grand majority have seemed to enjoy it. Well, I am not afraid to go against contrary belief. Saw was a decent film that got too carried away with dull scenes in which minimal items of importance occurred."

If you read a little bit of back story on these two, they decided to try to make a film fresh out of high school. Saw was the result and what a result it was!<br/><br/>Saw has so many twists and turns that I will say nothing about the plot.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","2","4","3 October 2013"," Yeah, I saw it. That is to say I seen it.
","Saw really should be exempt from most criticism as James Wan managed to pull of a helluva trick considering the innumerable restrictions and compromises that made the shoot very hard for the first-time feature director. Who'd ever believe that such a tiny movie would be the first to re-invent horror for the 21st century? Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell play Doctor Gordon and hapless jerk Adam, a mis-matched duo who wake up in a disgusting bathroom chained to the piping at either end of the expansive room. A dead body lies between, blood and gore on the floor around it. Doctor Gordon suspects that it is the work of the infamous ""Jigsaw"" - a madman known for subjecting lowlifes to brutal tests to prove their desire to live.<br/><br/>A series of flashbacks follow which build a greater story around the plight of the two men, culminating in a climax that is still as unnerving now as it was nearly 10 years ago. Saw is a very clever film, but is let down by overly filtered cinematography, choppy editing that is full of stutter cuts, and a sound design that is bloated with far too many cheap stingers. The acting is a little weak at times too but considering the conditions, and the fact that there was no rehearsal at all so the footage you see is sometimes the first attempt by the actors to get it done means you can't judge it too harshly.<br/><br/>The production design tries to emulate David Fincher's Se7en but ends up looking like a cheap 70s porno. But the whole film was shot in one big building, so you just can't pick faults. Like I said, what Wan managed to pull off with the time and budget he was given is nothing short of remarkable. The sequels were given more money to crazy with, but the first Saw movie should be viewed as a different entity.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan."

"ilovelctr","9","2","4","6 October 2010"," Very underrated. Perhaps the best horror film ever made.
","Overlooked by many so-called film critics as a low-quality horror piece with no taste and no so-called depth, Saw is one of the best horror films ever made and perhaps even the best among the best.<br/><br/>The greatest part of the film, on the contrary to what most people believe before seeing it, is its highly logical and carefully arranged ultra-complex story rather than its presentation of blood and gore. It is the kind of movie where there are tons of totally unpredictable twists and the ending itself stands out as one of the most twisted ones in movie history. In my opinion the story is miles better than that in The Silence of the Lambs, and this alone makes Saw one of the greatest mystery drama films ever too, alongside Memento.<br/><br/>Acting on the other hand, is sometimes a little contrived, but sometimes it becomes excessively vivid. Almost every actor/actress does average in average scenes but when horror strikes, their performances become highly believable all in a sudden.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it's not trying to teach you something or to educate you something helpful to being a better man (and forget it, because most films don't), it's a classic that everyone who likes plot- heavy dramas and who doesn't dislike gore/blood should see!<br/><br/>Story: 9.8/10 Presentaion (sound/visuals): 9.5/10 Acting and directing: 8.3/10 Atmosphere: 9.0/10<br/><br/>Overall: 8.8/10"

","The whole movie is soooooo bad. The most annoying scene is when the 'crazy' cop stupidly shoots himself when fighting with a male nurse. Give me a break. This was the last bit that pushed it over the edge to make me laugh. Here you just see a big mess of plot lines that are 'nicely' interconnected to make the movie look well thought through. I do not care about the guy in the chair with the drills, I do not care for the women who has to kill another guy, I do not care about the cop being shot. Seven is the real one you should watch. The actors are better (Freeman, Pitt, Spacey), the script is better, builds up incredible tension, and really explains WHY the victims are chosen."
"Two_Pieces_of_Christina","5","2","4","14 May 2006"," Well, I never Saw that coming.... (contains mild spoilers)
","I should mention, before you read on, that I'm not much of a fan of Seven (please don't call it Se7en) which, due to Saw's comparison to the aforementioned, should be some indication I may not have found this as enthralling as other reviewers.<br/><br/>It's an interesting premise. A young photographer, Adam (played by relative newcomer and co-writer Leigh Wannell) wakes up gasping, pulling himself out of a bath in a dark, disused, run-down bathroom. As he struggles to remove the shackle chaining him to the wall by his ankle, the lights flicker on and we realise he's not alone. Surgeon Lawrence (played by Cary Elwes, who I'd always thought was considered quite the thespian) is on the opposite side of the room, also chained, and a dead man lies between them in a pool of blood.<br/><br/>It soon becomes apparent, via clues left and via Lawrence's history, that they have been trapped by Jigsaw - a notorious serial killer who is infamous by not killing his victims directly. Rather, he places them in situations that they must either escape or meet their maker. In this instance Lawrence must kill Adam (with a gun helpfully provided by the corpse) before 6pm or his family will be killed, and he himself will be left to rot. The title 'Saw' comes from their captor (obviously), and also from the possibility of severing their chained feet with hand-saws left, by Jigsaw, in a toilet cistern for them to find.<br/><br/>Other examples of Jigsaw's captures are told in flashback sequences. One particularly vivid situation features a woman who must escape a contraption round her face, that will break her jaw in both directions if she doesn't remove the key for it from her (still alive, but drugged) companion's stomach.<br/><br/>It's a good plot. But it was let down by the acting and sheer implausibility. For example, why oh why did two off-duty policemen go directly to Jigsaw's lair in the middle of the night, without requesting back-up? It's worth mentioning that one of the cops investigating the murders is Danny Glover - I think he only smiles once throughout the whole film. His subtle performance of a good-cop-gone-crazy is a welcome relief after the hammy inter-play by our two men trapped in the bathroom.<br/><br/>There are twists, but don't expect not to get it. Go with your instincts and you'll know what to expect very early on.<br/><br/>Despite some of the most cringe-worthy performances this side of Grease 2, and some unintentionally funny moments, it's a good watch, with some memorable scenes. Just don't expect a horror masterpiece."

","Some things were OK in this flick. The actors (except Cary Elwes) did a competent job and the horror (especially of the maniacal clown and the reverse bear jaw trap) was as good as any. However, after putting in ones time watching a movie the viewer should expect to leave the theater (or the sofa) with a feeling that he understands why and how the scenes construct a logical plot in which the motivations of the characters are somewhat explained. Among other things I never understood is why Adam was selected as a victim. This thriller-horror film is ruined by an ending which doesn't tie up loose ends. It creates them. I have never felt so exploited by a bad movie - waste of money and a couple of hours."

","Saw's trailers and teasers are full of misleading clips which make you believe that the story is about a maniacal killer who has a grouping of puzzles that the person captive must solve in order to stay alive. What the trailers do not tell you is the depth of emotion and psychosis that was put into the movie itself that has you actually caring about those possible victims.<br/><br/>This film was a hair-raising thriller to the worst degree as you see characters trying to figure out how they are going to get out of a dire struggle for life and more time to figure out their future after the day that they get put into such a situation. The shots were very stylish and moody as anything released before this film. There has never been a horror/thriller quite like this before, which is amazing because so many thrillers released within the last 5 years have either copied each other in certain shots or stylistics, or they steal from the problems of the main villain of other films. This does neither and it's amazing.<br/><br/>The music was on par with movies like 8mm and Se7en and that sort of heavy metal meets unknowing timpani sets of action movies' past. The film was very stylistic, but given the time that it was shot in (18 days!), the film seems better directed knowing that they took less time to do it in. The film was written and directed by the same man (with help from another guy writing), and hopefully we'll see more from the director. The whole puppet thing was odd, and it didn't need to be in this film for anything else than a visual creepy thing, and later on, it served a purpose to tell detectives where the murderer was, but still... I was kind of angry about the fact that there was no in-depth behind-the-scenes on the DVD, and instead it was replaced by an extra-long ""making-of"" of a horrible Fear Factory video. (the video is basically the movie, but more green-screens and cheesy effects including a fake heart, a model who couldn't act, and a lead singer who couldn't have cared less about him being in the video) So I gave this film 7/10 stars. I also would've casted a different doctor actor (from the beginning, he seems to be overacting a lot of the time). But Danny Glover was amazing and a class-act amongst a lot of no-name actors in the States (I might've seen the doctor actor before, but he looks like every other straight-character-actor). But those points are the only I could find wrong with this film. It is a definite buy if you have a chance because of everything I said up above."

","This was a pretty decent movie (compared to others in the genre) but the plot holes, flawed logic, and small annoyances really keep it from being great.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it will definitely surprise and shock you. There are some great plot twists, even for the most cynical film buffs. It is engrossing and has a tendency to trap you in the claustrophobic terror along with its characters. In most ways, it delivers what you are expecting and wanting after seeing the trailers.<br/><br/>The worst thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it falls short of its potential. The fright and excitement dies down when the plot goes limp a few times. The characters lose your attention when the script goes weak at points. If you focus on these aspects too much it will only frustrate you and take away your enjoyment of an otherwise good movie.<br/><br/>The saddest thing about these shortcomings is that with a little ironing out ""Saw"" could have been a really great movie instead of merely good. However, for something that was written by two new screenwriters and shot in 18 days, it is commendable.<br/><br/>Better than average? Yes. Worth seeing? Yes. Fun? Hell yes.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Different from your regular day horror movie. ""Saw"" will have you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning till the very end. Jigsaw has a mind set of Hannibal but more creative and twisted. How he chooses his victims. What twisted things he has them to do in hopes that they will survive through the personal hell he is putting them through. Just when you think you have it all figured out....there's another twist. It's been a long time since a good horror movie has been made. Kudos to James Wan for his excellent job on his first movie. Definitely look forward to Jigsaw's next horror. We will definitely be waiting for the games to begin."

","I have seen many horror, and crime dramas, ""Saw"" was quite unique.<br/><br/>I found many similarities to Hannibal sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs The culprit here believes in himself as sort of an avenging spirit of sorts. picks his targets among people who at least in his demented mind are guilty of some form of wrongdoing, in one It's a botched, suicide attempt, which he feels was done only to get attention. In others It's anti-social behavior, or criminal acts.<br/><br/>This killer, if the reader cares to indulge me in letting me clarify, is not a killer. That's right , well OK by a legal definition yes he would be considered a murderer, but his Modus operandi is to place the intended victim, in a position in which he or she must carry out certain tasks that usually result in death by the same means the victim used in committing his/hers own wrongdoing.<br/><br/>Unlike other Horror/Crime films the police , and/or authorities play a very background role in the investigation. Most of the dialog , and scenes are between the victims themselves. Even the killer makes only brief appearances. The killer unlike Hannibal Lecter is not as resourceful, or intelligent.<br/><br/>My summary , yes this film is worth watching."
"jplastinumb","5","2","4","20 February 2005"," full of holes
","Though not the worst movie I have ever seen, the disappointment came from having such high expectations of what this film could and should have been as well as major plot holes in the story.<br/><br/>When 2 men wake up chained to a wall in a psycho's game they quickly find out that they are not randomly picked pawns. Each person is linked and as the two men discover that they have only a few hours to either escape or kill the other they also discover how they (and others) are linked and why they have been chosen to play this game the ""jigsaw"" killer has put them in.<br/><br/>The movie's premise is definitely not new or original but I heard time and time again how this was to be the next SE7EN or even better. Not gory or really that psychologically thrilling it lacked the dark atmosphere and foreboding ..as well as ""reason"" for the killer's motives that SE7EN had. Though all in all you shouldn't always have to know who or why the killer does what he does..the randomness of it is sometimes the only scary part. The acting is alright. The thing that bothered me the most were two major plot holes that just eat away at me until I can't stand to watch the film now. If you haven't seen the movie..don't read on. Firstly, the supposed real Jigsaw (as far as the movie divulges, but he may also be a pawn much as the orderly was) was the guy laying in the floor the whole time between the 2 captives. O.k. now if I remember correctly they had until 6:00 to do what they were supposed to do..you mean to tell me the killer laid there, unmoving, unflinching on a cold, hard ceramic tile floor for 8 hours?! IMPOSSIBLE! No one no matter how crazy could lay immobile for that long face down and not look like they were breathing, or needing to move. That really bothered me but wait there's more! The same guy lying on the floor was also the guy in the hospital when Elwes is interrupted by the orderly saying he had a name. Now if you noticed Elwes was hanging up X-rays that showed this patient had an inoperable brain tumor. O.k. so maybe that's what prompted his madness or caused him to become jigsaw but um..what..he just checked himself out of the hospital as he pleased and then would return? No one noticed a man leaving the hospital, no one noticed his EKG not reading? Lastly and though it is minor compared to the 2 previous flaws Elwes is a surgeon, a SURGEON, and he decides to hack his foot off at the ankle to escape..firstly he should have known how to make a better tourniquette, secondly if I were faced with chopping off something to get out of a shackle I think I would have just taken a bit off the heel of my foot and then the blood would have worked as lube to slip out..no need to hack off my whole foot and bleed to death...not too smart for a M.D. At this point I could throw a few other things out there but that alone is enough to go..OK watch this movie, you won't be scared or thrilled, don't try to think too much about it..save it for a date with a timid girl night or something..or rent SE7EN."

","Let me start by saying this is the only movie I've ever watched that left me saying ""Holy Sh*T!"" I knew about 25 minutes in the man wasn't dead in the middle of the floor. He was obviously playing a big part in the whole thing. But when there's someone like that and there's no attention being given to him it's a bit strange. Next I didn't KNOW this but it was pretty much a go in my mind about 99% sure John was the killer the first time I saw him. I mean in movies they always give you a glance at the killer, a quick one. They give you some info about him like his name and what's his condition. And when I saw the whole Apartment scene where Sing is killed I was positive it was John because of the ""Sick"" comment. Next I knew as soon as the cigarettes were pulled out they were supposed to be dipped in the blood. That part was pretty ""well duh"" They gave you the reason of death which was POISON in BLOOD. So if you SMOKE the POISON you're dead too. And last I knew Zep wasn't the killer for a while. Something about the looks he got on his face just said, he's just as scared as Adam and the Doc.<br/><br/>Now I want to talk about a few other things. Some people said Jigsaw was drugged so he could see and hear everything but just couldn't move. Well then how would he press the buzzer for the electrocutions? He clearly was awake and not drugged. Another thing is with Adam's key. The game was handed to Adam on a platter that he threw away. One more thing is with Jigsaw. The ex cop was on his way to the crime scene. Wouldn't he catch Jigsaw trying to escape???? And last, If Jigsaw had a brain tumor why was he out and about at 1 am without any attendants knowing?"

It seemed there were inconsistencies in the character profiles, like people reacting to situations in ways that they would NEVER react or people doing things that they would NEVER do (unless they were psychotic and evil or they really wanted to die, in which case, who cares if they die?) Ultimately, I was aggravated that some aspects of the movie seemed so unreal to me. Overall, these holes in the plot and the characters ruined this movie for me.

Something I found a bit funny though, is when the doctor decides to cut his own foot off because he can't reach the phone. I'm pretty sure he could have reached that phone had he use his own shirt to get it...an advice he actually gave the other guy in the beginning of the movie but hey, when you're in that kind of a situation you probably don't think straight.

The answers are: it doesn't matter, you aren't told, and with a big yawn. Our two heroes, Adam and Dr. Lawrence are supposedly at the mercy of a notorious serial killer who gives his victims the chance to escape his elaborate torture chambers at the expense of immense physical and emotional pain. How Danny Glover was roped into acting in this load of rubbish I'll never understand, he must be desperate for work. Anyway, Glover plays an obsessive cop who has encountered the killer once before and is determined not to lose him again. Glover plays a very small and totally insignificant role. If he or his part hadn't been included it wouldn't have made any real difference. The director prompts us to suspect Adam, then Lawrence... which one is telling the truth? Are they really as unfamiliar with each other as they claim? Will they give in and saw their feet off in a bid to free themselves of their restraints and attempt escape? Yes, you've guessed it! -Who cares! Not the director obviously. Because all this doesn't matter a bit to the story... if you can call it a story that is. It seems hard to believe that the director's actually got a sequel lined up! Another hour and a half of abject boredom.

Normally after a lousy movie concludes, my friends and I joke sarcastically and poke fun at the film we just 'endured', but after viewing the 'suspense, horror, thriller, whatever' movie ""Saw"", I can honestly say that cinema cannot get any worse. In fact, the movie actually changed my life. I am an aspiring screen-writer, and the simple fact that a script/story so horrible can get funded, produced, and made into a Hollywood film gives me hope for my own future in Tinsel Town. If this movie can get made, than why not mine? I suspected at times during the film if the persons involved in the making of the movie even viewed the final version before distributing it. I am not being sarcastic when I say that I laughed more at this movie than I do at some of todays most high profile comedies being released, and I was not the only one in the theatre. I choose not to comment on any specifics of the film, for I do not want to ruin the experience for anyone that has not seen it, and it is indeed an experience. I will leave you with this note; Cary Elwes performance in this film should be the example used in acting classes across the world of exactly what not to do in your profession. He was so embarrassing, I felt uncomfortable watching him. Poor Danny Glover needs another Lethal Weapon movie if these are the scripts he's accepting these days. Enough said, enjoy."

Two strangers woke up in a toilet, who later find themselves as the part of a deadly game by a psycho named 'Jigsaw' who is actually a very clever. He didn't directly kills his victims but sets deadly traps instead. His philosophy is simple, those who don't value life, either of themselves or others, must be taught a lesson. Now the movie is low budget so some cheap computer effects can be ignored (especially that car chase scene). Otherwise, the cinematography is watchable. Acting is good too.

","Well, it took me long enough, but I finally caught up with the 2004 hit ""Saw,"" a film so influential that it practically jump-started a whole new subgenre in the horror field: torture porn. It was the first film in what is currently a seven-part franchise, but I don't know if I am interested in seeing any more, although I did find this first installment impressively well done and very, very intense. In it, two men (Cary Elwes and ""Saw""'s screenwriter Leigh Whannell) awake in a dirty disused bathroom of sorts and find themselves chained to the walls. A dead body lies between them. Eventually, the two realize that they are the victims of the so-called Jigsaw serial killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims per se, but rather puts them into situations in which they are compelled to do monstrous things or kill themselves. Via multiple flashbacks, we learn the two men's backstories and learn of the police investigation into the Jigsaw killings. We get to see several of these killings, too. In one, a man is compelled to run through a razor-sharp maze or be locked in a room forever. In another, a woman has a reverse bear trap attached to her head, and to get it off, must knife through the stomach of a living man to get the key to release herself. In another, a man has his head clamped between two approaching drills. Pleasant stuff. The film is supremely well acted by its impressive cast. Danny Glover plays one of the cops on the case, one who grows a lot more unhinged than the cop character he played in the ""Lethal Weapon"" films; Monica Potter (future star of TV's ""Parenthood"") plays one of the victims; and two of the future stars of TV's ""Lost"" (Michael Emerson and Ken Leung) add fine support as well. Director James Wan does an incredible job of helming his film; hard to believe that this great-looking picture only cost around $1.2 million and was shot in only 18 days! In all, I heartily concur with reference book ""DVD Delirium 3""'s assessment when it calls ""Saw"" ""a stomach-knotting exercise in physical and mental anguish."" Still, as I say, I'm not exactly eager to subject myself to even more unpleasantness in this series, which, from what I hear, gets a lot more gruesome than this initial installment. Weirdly enough, this was the second film that I watched last week, following ""The Ruins,"" that features a man getting his leg sawed off, and if I never see a scene like this in a movie again, that will be fine by me. It's hardly the stuff of a Fred and Ginger film, but for some people, I suppose, that's entertainment...."

A film quite different than your run-of-the-mill cat-and-mouse game, but plays a lot like your daily CSI episode. I really appreciate the movie for its script because that is what really makes this movie stand out. There were some solid twists and turns, and the whole ride is very interesting. It's just that... the direction wasn't quite up to par with the script. Not to mention the performances are very substandard, and some scenes can be a little far-fetched.<br/><br/>Let's start out with what made this film come out strong: the concept. This isn't a torture porn like so many are claiming it to be. ""Saw"" uses its gore when necessary, and honestly, I don't think it's that graphically violent. If there's one thing you'll get out of ""Saw"", is that you'll be entertained. Another aspect is the gore. When the gore comes on screen, granted it's not sickening, but the effects are well-done. Not to mention the traps are very invented. You can tell James Wan, the director, was very dedicated to this project.<br/><br/>Now where this film went wrong: the acting. The two protagonists in this movie aren't very likable, and personally, you really don't care what happens to them. Amanda and John are the only characters that really gave a strong performance. To top it off, some areas are a little far-fetched. Which is fine, but comes a little too close to becoming a cliché.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Saw"" is a tough movie to review. I really liked its atmosphere, but I don't think the film reached its fullest potential. I still advice that audiences see it because it's probably the best thing out there. Not to mention the traps are pretty cool."

","This was the first 'SAW' movie that spawned many sequels. The movie gained tremendous success and got a big fan following which led to sequels releasing each year since 2004. The director James Wam is talented and created a totally original character for the horror genre. However he has not managed to add much to his resume apart from the Saw franchise. Being the director and writer gives one the opportunity, freedom to apply individual knowledge and ideas to practise. Upon viewing I was receiving deja vu of the movie 'Seven' and 'The Cell'. Though in this situation there is quite less focus on the detectives. There is a flashback giving an account of a woman's ordeal that she encountered with the 'Jigsaw' killer.<br/><br/>SPOILERS We begin with being introduced to two men whose legs are chained to steel pipes in a unknown location. Between them there lies a dead man with a tape recorder. They play the tape and they are given instructions by the 'jigsaw killer'. The doctor has to kill the other guy by 6.00 or his wife and daughter dies. Initially they attempt to free themselves but their efforts fail. Simultaneously there are two detectives that are trying to apprehend the killer. They come face to face with him on one occasion but it only leads to demise of one detective. Meanwhile time is at the essence and the two chained men decide to be devious and fool the killer but they fail. Eventually fate intervenes and the doctor becomes desperate after time has run out. END OF SPOILER <br/><br/>I did not get the impression that this was a horror movie as it also had elements of a thriller and suspense combined. The theme itself is very Korean and Japanese cinema influenced. The innocent characters forced in a uncontrollable situation was very reminiscent of Asian cinema itself. I'm very sure that the trend of Asian horror remakes has certainly inspired this franchise. The movie wastes no time in progressing with the plot, however the constant flashbacks do sometimes deter the attention away from the main narrative. The idea of a serial killer who places people in to letting themselves getting killed is very unique. It was convincingly shown. But the look of the killer was unconvincing and I was expecting a evil looking person. Danny Glover and Cary Elves stand out in the performances. Glover goes in to his 'Predator' mode and it was good to see Elves in a challenging role. Adam Faulkner was funny on a few occasions."

","First, when i say classic i don't mean that in a 'Star Wars' way, i mean it in a 'Ghost Dad' way. Though i hate all Saw films with an undying passion, i must admit that the first is with no doubt the best of the bunch. I was about 13 when this film first came out and i may have been the last person in my school to see it. If you can imagine for a second the mind of a 13 - 15 year old. It is underdeveloped, will laugh at simple things like 'your mum' and is about ready to jump on any band waggon that rolls on by. Now imagine when this mind sees a film that features horror and ideas that it has never seen before, and then goes and tells it's friends. I would like to apologise on behalf of my entire generation for the creation of the Saw series because this film was almost as big as pokemon cards.<br/><br/>Now that my mind is at rest - when you watch this film from a critical perspective you will notice things that will put you off the series forever, And sadly it happens to be one of the most important aspects- camera work. It feels like they ran out of money when it came to the camera because it never gets put down. Even when people are just having a conversation you will get motion sickness. Now, i understand the hand held effect in films, but there's a difference between technique and someone turning up drunk for shooting every day. The same can be said for the horror scenes. The repetition that continues throughout the entire series is brain numbing. Screaming. Quick flashes. Screechy sounds. Close up! and repeat.<br/><br/>Im sure a lot of you will think that i am completely wrong about this film but if you watch it again you will notice these things, i don't want to stand in the way of anyone enjoying any film, but if you want a film that doesn't rely on flashy gore and dark rooms try 'The Shining' 'The Thing' (1982) '28 days later' So next time you go rent a film, try expanding your horizon a bit and you will be pleasantly surprised. ... great my brother just put Saw 5 on sky *BANG*"

A movie can be too predictable or just have so many twists it makes no sense, this movie is one of the few that meet the happy medium. I was surprised to see more than simple gore, oh that is there no doubt, but that wasn't all there was. Not a big fan of horror movies, this is at least new and interesting, the plot was interesting is the best I can say."

","The Movie ""Saw"", written and Directed by James Wan is a small, ambitious and gruesome art house film that succeeded in theaters purely because it showed blood and guts. It's this shock factor that brought people to the theaters in the first place.<br/><br/>By no means is this a good movie. It's plot is thin and it becomes repetitive after it's first half hour. But still this movie succeeds, and for only one reason. It's ending.<br/><br/>The movie throws a twist so well thought out and so unexpected it makes the whole movie ten-times better. If only the rest of the movie can be as well done as the ending."

","This movie is probably the most unique horror movie I have ever seen. It very cleverly tricks you to think that there is a killer, but he really isn't exactly killing people. I, though, thought this movie could have been much, much better. There were many boring scenes, it lacked gore and action. When I first heard of Saw, I heard it was a gut-busting gorefest. There is very little gore in this movie, I do not mean that I want a gorefest, I just want some. In my opinion, I think this movie could have been a wonderful movie, the flashbacks got a bit annoying and I was tired of anticipating gory action sequences. Overall, this is a good movie to watch for those of you who don't like too much gore. Everyone's like ""How can you say there isn't much gore?A guy cuts off his own leg!"" Well, it doesn't show the leg as he is cutting which is just disturbing, not gory. It is sortof disturbing. The end was excellent though, it had drawn me in to want to see the next one, which is very unique. I give this movie a <br/><br/>3/5"

The twist at the end thought was brilliantly thought of, it was something I never even expected. That shouldn't give anything away so hopefully no spoiler required.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave it a 5 because as much as the I felt the story was decent, the acting was nothing out of this world and this genre of movie isn't my cup of tea anyway.<br/><br/>Worth a watch though."

","Like everyone has seen this movie. So finally, I rent it. ALl the hype might have hurt my response.<br/><br/>SAW was good but not great. Cary Elwes (?) did not act scared enough for me. His wife, yeah, his daughter, yeah, his bathroom buddy, a little better. Explain to me why this was called SAW... Jigsaw would have been better. So someone saws their foot off... big deal. I still have no idea why these people other than the doctor were pulled into Jigsaw's evil plan.<br/><br/>The guy from LOST (Zep) had nothing to do with this... he was actually nice to Jigsaw and was repayed by involving him. Also, the guy who took pictures of the good doctor was loosely related. He was hired by Danny Glover's character but he didn't know why he was taking photos and he only wanted to pay the rent. The notion that Jigsaw never actually killed anyone is stupid. He kills the last guy by not letting him go.<br/><br/>The acting was by the main characters was average and I didn't believe they were scared half the time. The plot was decent but the writer failed to really give reasons to include some of the characters in the twisted game. I will be watching the rest of them soon but I will be going into those hoping for improvement."

However, I found this film to give nothing more than a feeling of disappointment before the film had even finished and then once it had finished I was wishing that I had done something more worth while with the time then watching a film that could have been so much better. The film is a mess, it's jumpy the camera work isn't all it's cracked up to be and the gore..well sorry but I've seen more gore when i've cut my finger when cutting vegetables. I'd heard so much hype over this film, and people telling me how gory it was, but gory wouldn't be the word I would use, yes it was sadistic, a little bit sick in places and prehaps yes just a wee bit over the top with graphic scenes, but the only bit I would consider to be anywhere near the phrase 'GORY' would be when Lawrence is chopping off his foot.<br/><br/>The plot isn't much better either, however, as I've repeated, it could have been fantastic all the fittings were there they just didn't fit into the right places in my opinion. How on earth did that 'dead' guy on the floor stay playing dead for so long without breathing or making any kind of noise at all, everyone knows that if you try and hold your breath for too long, you start to choke and come back up for air. I know this is Hollywood but you can't just make out that a living person can just stop breathing and still have a pulse.<br/><br/>Why they have even bothered to make a third film, let alone a first doesn't makes sense to me, for this film sure as hell wasn't a hit for me, and I'll give everything a chance."

","Saw sets off with a very interesting premise and from there grows to a very intense thriller that will keep you glued to the screen. The gritty aesthetic of the film sets in in the first shot and keeps up throughout the entire film, placing you in a world that is uncomfortable and unsettling. The well written plot moves along at a good pace, keeping you interested and the inevitable twist works well.<br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws, however. My biggest gripe with this movie is that the camera work is simply too fancy in several places, particularly the flashbacks (of which there are many in the first act of the film.) Tricks like fast motion and circular camera tracking belong in MTV music videos and not in psychological thrillers. The acting is also not fantastic. Neither of the two main characters are all that likable and at the start of the film the actors playing them seemed to be unsure of which direction to take them. However, by the end of the film when the real intense stuff kicks in the performances are cranked up and improve a great deal.<br/><br/>Saw is definitely worth seeing. It is an often grisly, always unsettling and carefully made thriller that packs some punch and is, most importantly, very entertaining."

The first time I saw it I was blown away at how perfectly everything fits together, but now after around my fifth viewing, that is the main thing that bothers me about it: Everything fits together TOO perfectly. If the characters had done a single thing differently, the whole plan wouldn't have worked. The movie is still fun to watch and everything, but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. The cop played by Danny Glover is easily the best part of the movie, especially near the end. Though I wouldn't say the actors are as bad as reputation dictates, Glover puts everyone else to shame. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, just don't think about it too much. Too many ways that the plot could and should have gone wrong.

"Slack_Er","6","0","0","25 February 2006"," Uhhh...thank you M. Night Shyamalan for making Hollywood forever think it will create the next ""Sixth Sense"" ending
","The movie tried, I'll give it that. It went for the psychotic thriller surprise ending, with a final dramatic music score to boot. The only problem is I was already asleep by the finale and had stopped caring how the movie ended. There's something incredibly annoying about a serial killer who thinks he's going to teach the secrets of life to his victims when they're not screaming and begging for their lives. But I'll tell you what the biggest drag of all was in this average horror flick. Not ten minutes into the film and we already know who the killer is! If it isn't obvious by the pointless but eerie five second cameo he makes in a victim's background story, it becomes even more apparent during the brief head shots as we see someone watching a security camera. Showing the killer so early means that either: 1) this movie is incredibly lame because we've already figured out who the killer is, or 2) this movie is incredibly lame because we know that no screenwriter would be dumb enough to reveal the obvious killer this early and it was just a tease to warn us of a surprise ending. And boy did this movie try to brag about its clever surprise ending! I think the obligatory ""Sixth Sense highlight reel"" that showed us all the clues we had missed lasted almost two hours! The only problem is that I had already been warned of a surprise ending by the movie itself and the hostages in this movie were so uninteresting, I was ready for Mr. Jack the Ripper to quit playing his games and finish them off. I mean... really, could there be a dumber set of victims? At least in ""Friday the 13th"" we get hot co-ed babes jumping their camp counselors before they are murdered. Apparently, in the world of ""Saw,"" cops no longer call for backup and women have the guts to get into a fist fight with their abductor but freeze when they have to fire a gun. I think I saw this movie ten years ago, only it was called ""Seven"" and it was a heck of a lot more interesting, and that's my recommendation: Rent ""Seven"" first and then give this rip-off a shot."

The police (Danny Glover) finds the hideout thanks to the video shown to the surviving victim. <br/><br/>Did she take it with her when she escaped? Did she figure out where she had been kept and given the info to the police; the killer not minding leaving the video (Don't forget the doll was later found at his hideout and not where she had been kept). This seems to be strange given the TV had no vcr either. <br/><br/>2. After finding the hideout thanks to that video, as someone else says, no backup is weird. With the classical American don't 'shoot to immobilize' psychos, Danny Glover's partner runs off after killer. He gets killed by a rack of shotguns on a tripwire which are on the ENTRANCE side. Would the killer not leave them on the inside , hiding it from intruders rather than 'extruders' :)<br/><br/>Also, would he at all gone upstairs when after all the police break into the entrance (from how it looked for a moment the lock was on the inside but nah, fair enough was on the outside.)?<br/><br/>Strangely enough, he had a victim as it happened to be at his place of operation even if he was setting up the next kill (they find the scaled model of the doctor and the photographer) (INCONSISTENCY, the killer would have ot get rid of a body from his own HQ, which so far he hadn't done).<br/><br/>3. the doc takes out what turns out to be a total of 3 cigarettes from the box. He gives Adam one of them without the blood on it, but later on you can see him lying next to two cigarettes both without blood. <br/><br/>I think I had 1 or 2 more minute ones like these but I just saw it and now saw some Olympic medals results and forgot :)<br/><br/>hf"

","This is not a ""don't bother to see"" movie, but it seems to me vastly over-rated by most commenter's. I did not think of Seven while watching this because it is not in the same class. From many years of watching horror/slasher movies, I don't expect logic from them and you do not get it here. Even given that it is hard to predict how one would react in the situation Lawrence and Adam find themselves, it strains credulity that, handed a hack saw you would start trying to saw through those very thick chains (in spite of their thickness they don't seem to be very heavy) when the shackle around their ankles or the rusty pipes to which the chains are attached look more vulnerable. Poor Danny Glover is stuck with playing one of the dumbest characters in the genre. The scene where he and his partner track the killer to his lair is laughable and seems to have been staged by the killer on the assumption that they would come and not bring any backup. And when he comes in in that ridiculous hooded cape I could not stop laughing. Movies which feature ""killers"" with infinite technology at their disposal (is Shawnee's ""gag"" available on the Internet?) are a cop-out. If Zep was told he had a slow-acting poison in his system (that would take at least 8 hours to work) wouldn't you go to the hospital? It is next to impossible to sort out the time frame: when was the picture of Zep looking out the Doctor's bedroom window, which was in Adam's bag with the saws, taken and by who? I will give them that the situations created by the killer are disturbing but have the filmmakers ever been in a bathroom in a factory? I have and I have never seen one that size with just one toilet and no urinals, not to mention a bathtub. And why would it be placed in such an inaccessible location? Maybe the killer built it himself, he seems to be able to do as he pleases. Out of room."

I have seen many movies with bad acting, and usually did not finish watching unless the movie was unpretentious horror, so as to be funny. The acting in this movie is just about as bad as I've ever seen in my life. I live in Holland, and us Dutch can take a real beating when it comes to this: the Dutch are inherently terrible actors.

I agree with the filmmakers in releasing it to theaters because it is a little better than the usual straight-to-video flicks, but just a little better. <br/><br/>The story is interesting and the puzzles are clever. But somehow this film is missing something. Maybe it's the casting. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Cary Elwes or Danny Glover, and after seeing this film, Leigh Whannell either. I don't find Cary Elwes interesting to watch. He just seems bland. Danny Glover is again playing the role that made him famous, although without his partner, Sgt. Riggs. Because I still identify him with that role, his presence just lightened the mood up too much in this film. Leigh is a little irritating, but that could be due to his character and the script. But somehow I doubt that. The casting director should've spent more time looking for more interesting actors to watch.<br/><br/>Then there are the scenes that are too unbelievable and Hollywood-sy that they lessen the suspense even more.

I've read several reviews which cited some of the influences but have yet to read one that mentions the very obvious, and I assume intentional, Hitchcockian references (Rear Window and Dial M). I have, however, read many reviews which stated that the twist ending, while indeed surprising, presented more questions than it answered (again, let's hope the sequel addresses these). The co-writer/co-star Leigh Whannell did an excellent American accent, however I couldn't discern any reason for his character to be American (other than allowing the actor to practice his accent). Okay, that's great, but the time/effort spent on that could have been put to much better use considering the film's constrained production time. I think most genre fans will appreciate the freshness (which is lacking in most contemporary horror films) but be frustrated by the flaws.

They are the latest prisoners of the ""Jigsaw"" killer, who sets elaborate puzzles for his victims, basically pushing them to see what they would be willing to do to survive. On the killer's trail is a cop who wants to avenge his partner, a victim of the killer. As the film wears on we find out more about the characters and their personal lives and why they were targeted by the killer, who sees himself as a giver of life lessons, however sick they are!

I feel that 'SAW' has the potential to spawn many sequels because its plot is so versatile.<br/><br/>The acting in 'SAW' is solid and convincing. Leigh Whannell surprised me with his competent performance. The mother and daughter who are gagged and tormented by their captor at gunpoint, both give gut-wrenchingly realistic performances.

","Imagine waking up in a strange, dirty room with your foot in a shackle, a stranger in the same predicament across the room, and a bloody, dead body in between the two of you. That is the situation Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) finds himself in, along with Adam (Leigh Wannell) in James Wan's surprisingly good second film, ""Saw"". Gordon and Adam soon discover that their captor is a now-notorious psychopath who puts people into horrible situations as a masochistic life lesson, the results being that most of them have died, with the exception of a drug addict who wakes up to find her head encased in a huge metal helmet that will blow her jaw apart unless she takes the key to the device out of the stomach of the dead man on the floor of the room. The real trick comes when she realizes that the man isn't dead after all, but has to kill him anyway in order to ensure her survival. The two present captives now have to follow the clues given and try to trust one another, even though Gordon's instructions are to kill Adam in order to A) Survive and B) Ensure the safety of his wife and daughter, both of whom are being held at gunpoint at their home. Trying to track down the killer is detective David Tapp, a man who has become obsessed with the case (as they usually do in these films) and, because of circumstantial evidence, believes the killer to be none other than Dr. Lawrence Gordon.<br/><br/>""Saw"" begins abruptly, when the two men come to in the strange room, leaving the audience with no idea what is going on. This was an excellent move on director Wan's part because we know as much as the victims know at that point, and for the most part, with a few exceptions, throughout the film. There are no real scary moments, but there is a lot of creepiness that brings to mind the film ""Se7en"", though it isn't nearly as fantastic. The tag line for the film states ""Every piece has a puzzle"" and that is definitely true about the film. It is intricately done and really made me consider and reconsider several theories, because once you think you know the answer, it turns out that you probably don't. The cinematography was very stylish and flashy, (I wouldn't be surprised if Wan honed his skills as a video director before making feature films) and the pacing was very tight. The only real complaint I had was Danny Glover's performance; not that he was ever a fantastic actor, but I've seen him do so much better than in this film, so I don't know if it was an issue of direction or he's just kind of hit a wall in his craft, but I found myself rolling my eyes a bit during some of his scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Saw"" though it's one of those films that you really don't need to see a second time because once the shocks are over with, there really isn't a whole lot more to experience upon repeat viewings. I think the fact that I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of the film pushes it to a 6/10. I look forward to seeing Wan's future work.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","A not-particularly-creative sick fantasy, Saw emulates the usual ""sick villain goes mad with philosophically based condemnation of human vice"" style psych thriller that started with the movie Seven. The movie's various facets don't convey too much originality. There has obviously been a lot of thought put into the unique and novel ways that the characters die and suffer. About the only sentiments that Saw left me with were the regret of a misspent rental fee and the disappointment that its authors are relying more on gore and jack-off fodder for sickos to sell their product than they are any real creativity.<br/><br/>By and large it had amazing acting and very well done cinematography - its redeeming features. bravo actors and cinematographers, hopefully next time you'll find some better writers."
"scotty-37","4","0","0","6 May 2005"," A Contrived Movie with Some Interesting Ideas
","This movie relies heavily on disturbing imagery, chilling violence and fast cutting to make its point. If you just want to see some very disturbing things, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Some reviews and the description on the DVD box try claiming that the killer is trying to teach people something and do some kind of therapy through his violence. These moral posturings are about as thin as tracing paper. The ""teach a lesson"" conceit comes across as a plot device to make more disturbing and creative violence rather than a need in the story telling.<br/><br/>It also follows many of the same old clichés. Hiding the killer's face. Making him go around in a scary skull/clown mask. It's not particularly original except in the conception of violent ways in which to kill people or force them to kill themselves or someone else.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that shows killing and death in a gruesome and disturbing way, enjoy your blood feast. If you just need to fill your gore or violence needs, maybe this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>There are some elements with promise but they aren't followed up on well. There are also holes in the story. Its internal consistency and believability is threatened.<br/><br/>It is often scary, gut-churning, and vile. If you mostly want to focus on these elements then you may really like the movie since it presents these elements strongly. If you're looking for any motivation, uncontrived plot elements or useful characterization then I suggest watching something else."

","While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment. I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over. Saw successfully accomplished this task. While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments. It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions. What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films. That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode. I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality. That is what pushed this film from your average ""serial killer"" film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.<br/><br/>I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was. I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering ""B"" to ""C"" grade actors of our generation. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability. After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights. So, you are not dealing with the crème de la crème of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment. While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched. You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing. I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.<br/><br/>Outside of the acting, this film impressed me. The originality of the story shocked me. I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans. Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed ""killer"" is doing to his victims. The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window. While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open. Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time. Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence. To me, it worked.<br/><br/>I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning. Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job. Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good. I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film. Those films are a waste in my book. Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking  wow, but what does this mean? How did this happen? Where are we going from here? Yada yada yada  (did I just yada yada yada Saw?) I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed. Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book  and Saw earned it.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film. While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about. Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.<br/><br/>Grade: **** out of *****"

","I suggest those who haven't seen the movie to stop reading. This post describes a possibly critical part of the movie.<br/><br/>When Gordon turned off the lights, and started discussing his plan with Adam, what was actually the plan? I don't think that Adam was supposed to be 'killed' by the cigarette. Instead he was supposed to pretend poorly that he was killed. I believe that the deal was something like Gordon cuts off his leg, and Adam gets shot. In that way they both survive. When the killer enters the room to free Gordon (since he has shot Adam), they would attack and kill, as it happened. The whole cigarette scene was intended to be only a distraction.<br/><br/>What do you think about that?"

","OK, I just finished watching movie and it was very intense! It was a scary movie that actually had a great plot. The movie begins with two characters waking up to discover they are locked inside an old bathroom, each chained to the plumbing on either side of the room, with a dead body in the middle. They soon discover that it is all part of a sadistic man's 'game', which involves them finding how to escape the room alive.<br/><br/>Like I said, I found this to be very intense, but also very fascinating to discover how the plot unfolds with its flashbacks and multiple perspectives. One scene in particular was actually quite disturbing, and I think most people will know what I mean when they see the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it's well worth watching if you're not too squeamish...rest assured that there are a few 'breathing space' scenes, so it's not horrific the whole way through.<br/><br/>An aside for Australians: whilst I wasn't too surprised seeing Leigh Whannell acting in this movie, it blew my mind to see him appear as the writer in the credits! For people not familiar with him, he used to be the co-host for the ABC (Australia) alternative youth music show 'Recovery' from 1996-1998...being quite a funny co-host.

","SPOILERS! ""Saw"" is something of a testament to the power of genre films, a marker of how low-down, gritty, and generally unpleasant a plot can be, while being mercilessly intense and suspenseful at the same time. It also is a testament to why most film critics simply aren't cut out to critique such films--in an era of feigned PC cuddliness and romantic comedies with Brittany Murphy, it's downright MEAN to splatter our fine multiplexes with the type of morbid bloodshed found in ""Saw."" Shame on you, Mr. Wan and Whannell! Have you no courtesy for the real-life suffering of human beings?! Perhaps that's the point said critics are so slow to acknowledge. Downbeat, gut-wrenching, and intricately crafted, ""Saw"" is pure escapism that takes us to a dark place that we never hope to visit in reality. The plot begins deviously simple--two men awaken in a disgusting, decaying bathroom with their legs shackled--and becomes increasingly complicated as the film progresses. In the vein of a true thriller (however B-list), director James Wan (working from costar Leigh Whannell's script) has a knack for keeping plot details hidden in order to build suspense, so that their inclusion later on will make sense (poor Zepp!). The grungy visual style is an obvious nod to David Fincher (the atmosphere and plot is pure ""Seven""), and the plot--which could be taken from any one of a million serial killer pics--actually forgoes the POV of the murderer and instead focuses on the two characters (Cary Elwes and Whannell) trapped in the room.<br/><br/>I have viewed ""Saw"" several times, and must say the quality of the acting improves each time. Whereas I found Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter (okay, not much of a stretch there) to be hamming it up to an insufferable degree the first time out, I have lumped this eccentricity in as a contributing factor to ""Saw""'s morbid charm. Though at times overwrought, Elwes's performance seems to accurately reflect the neuroses of an average man put in an unfamiliar, oppressive situation--there is even a note of horrifying tragedy in the decision he winds up making. He and Whannell are an unusual couple, but their interactions have a certain grace and are not dull. Michael Emerson, who plays the patsy Zepp, is probably the film's standout--a performance that depends heavily on nuance to trick the audience into seeing him as a cold-blooded killer and, ultimately, a pawn. Tobin Bell, a character actor who has spent his career playing lowlifes and killers, phones in his minor role as the murderer Jigsaw.<br/><br/>Though drowned in a sea of hype months before it hit theaters, ""Saw"" is a solid reminder that true horror and suspense is still alive and kicking, even if it is only with one foot..."

","-Among many are those who live normal, healthy lives with very little worry. However, there are those that take that blessing for granted... and there are those that despise that ignorance, and will do what is necessary to show it.<br/><br/>A film by James Waan and Leigh Whannell, ""Saw"" surrounds the untold fate of two ordinary men with every-day lives, who are thrust into a twisted game for survival at the hands of a psycho-path. Dr. Lawrence Gordon(CAREY ELWES; ""Twister"", ""Princess Bride"") and a young man named Adam(LEIGH WHANNEL) awake in a forlorn bathroom, chained to opposite ends of the room at their ankles. The clues of how and why they're in the isolated chamber are limited, and the motives of the game soon become clear as their only chances of escape and survival lie within the hands of a disturbing and macabre menace's agenda.<br/><br/>With the eerie oddities of ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and ""Seven"", ""Saw"" delivers a fast and disturbing story of a mad-man's relentless pursuit to take down those who don't appreciate their blessings, and what he can do about it.

","I have to admit enjoying this, even with the flaws that others have mentioned. I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere, and dark sense of foreboding that the look of the movie conveys. I must agree with earlier remarks about the acting, though. It was atrocious. Especially disappointing was Cary Elwes. He won't win any awards, but he has at least done a decent job with most of his other films. He really didn't seem to know how to approach this, so just resorted to a by-the-numbers performance. You didn't get the feeling of honest claustrophobic terror from him, which made his actions near the end of the film hard to believe. I have never seen or heard of the guy in the bathroom with him, Wannell. He did not impress whatsoever. Danny Glover's detective character was hard to pin down; he was obviously seriously mentally disturbed after his encounter with the killer, but this is glossed over briefly.<br/><br/>All in all, much of the movie is excruciating and horrifying, but it was dragged down by haphazard story-telling, and terrible acting."

Misanthropic exercise in distinct unpleasantry and pretentious visual style about a nihilistic sicko who devises hideously intricate scenarios for his victims to kill themselves. Elwes plays a doctor who wakes up shackled in a decrepit bathroom with another man; their captor's instructions order the doctor to kill the other in eight hours, with his family's lives on the line if he fails the task. Inconsistent performance by Elwes who's believable at first, then hams it up in the final third. Loaded with grisly strategems of torture, which are scary and ingenious enough for the squeamish to be warned, but it's messy, overdirected, and ugly to no end, capped off by a ridiculously impossible twist.

Between them is a dead body, and they soon discover that they are the stars in a very twisted game. The game isn't limited to their little arena, and soon a wider picture is drawn, showing that quite a few lives are in the balance here.<br/><br/>This is not really a serial killer film in the traditional sense. We aren't following an investigation trying to find the killer. We're seeing two people in a tightly controlled situation, and more than anything, we're following their quest.

Think of it as a mixture of Cube, Panic Room and a dose of Seven for good measure.<br/><br/>However, the film does have its fair share of plot holes.

","To start with I'd like to recommend this flick to everybody who's searching for a mentally gripping horror movie. Here it is. <br/><br/>But to say it aloud I don't really recommend it in every sense. Again it succeeded to open a mental wound and stray salt in it to gain such a hype around a low budget movie which was in fact solely entertaining but sometimes not consistent in its meaning.<br/><br/>In my opinion the idea of setting up such a scenery is something innovative but in order to scare the viewer it should have stuck more to rational sense of logic. For instance the scene where Detective Sing shotguns Jigsaw in the back, the killer slams to the floor, recovering and then continuing his escape from his hideout. The irrationality of it, is firstly that Jigsaw had sustained a serious wound in the back which should have restricted him in his plans, secondly that this hideout was from this point on known to the cops but as we all know was later reoccupied by him or Zeb in one later scene.<br/><br/>Well, at least for me it has decreased the dread-factor of the movie along with some other twists which appear rather illogical to me. <br/><br/>Why do I rate this movie 6 then?<br/><br/>Evidently the message of this movie is ""what would you do to survive?"" or better formulated ""Do you appreciate your life? If you can't answer this I have to show you how horrible it could be by exposing your weaknesses to depict how beautiful life can possibly be.""<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I thought ""Hey this movie conveyed a true message, we all live like numb primates and have all individual weaknesses without knowing them.""

"Tinkerfolly","7","0","0","20 March 2005"," Make it all connect......
","Alright, so I saw the movie for the first time last night and I'm still tripping off the ending. I consider myself a reasonably smart person and I had suspected that it was a patient but I never took a real second glance at the body on the floor. Very good ending! But here's what I have to say...<br/><br/>So I thought that some parts of the plot were a little thin or under-explained in the film. First thing is... how does he find his victims? You find out that Amanda is a drug addict but how does a man with a tumor in his frontal lobe find her? I thought it would have made a little more sense if she was a nurse, it would have also created a little more twist if she had been an interest of the doctor. The man in the barbed wire... he could have been a patient in the same hospital. I know I'm being picky but it just seems to me that the ties between jigsaw and the other victims should be as strong as the ties to the doctor and Zep.<br/><br/>Now when it comes to Zep heres what puzzles me... how does he know? Since he is not the one that created the situation in the room, how does he know where the room is? Does jigsaw set up the camera system in the doctors house? When? How? Does jigsaw give him directions on how to get there? Why wouldn't Zep just go to the room in the beginning and force the doctor to kill Adam? Was he given a warning by jigsaw first? I guess I'm just curious as to the inner workings of the setup.<br/><br/>So, with the whole detectives find his hideout (ps: how does he know what they will be wearing in that room? he doesn't, so the dolls should not have been wearing the exact same clothes)...... What the hell happened to the man in the restraints.... you know the one who almost got his brains drilled out? Obviously he was saved (Danny Glover lived through a slit throat, this guy had to have been saved) but did he never see jigsaw's face? was he always under that sheet? had he been there long? It looked like he was a janitor possibly....maybe from the hospital? Anyway, I'm just curious as to the role that this man played after he was found. I hate when there are dangling characters in a movie. Hopefully he will be addressed in the sequel.<br/><br/>So in that room, he is lying there on the ground, dead supposedly, yet he still uses enough muscle movement to press a button on a remote to shock the doctor and Adam? which hand is it in? I guess this is a small discrepancy. So when Dr. Gordon gets out of the room, he is dragging his severed leg trough a hallway that had a sign that said ""raw sewage""... is it even a possibility that he survives the contamination let alone makes it out of the tunnel? Since he didn't meet the time limit does jigsaw just walk down that hall and kill him? I'm glad they didn't clear that up in this movie though, I think it made the ending more impactive.<br/><br/>In the beginning I had suspected that the key was in the drain but I don't think it would have helped Adam much in the long run if he had gotten the shackle off...... he would've still been stuck in the room. It would have changed the story drastically and probably for the worse. <br/><br/>Here is what I really enjoyed about the ending...... HOW SICK AND TWISTED THIS MAN REALLY IS!!!!!! He's dying, he has a severe type of tumor, and seeing others waste their potentially happy lives just pisses this man off to the fullest. But the most disturbing part is that he wants to be there... he wants to be there when the doctor saws his foot off, or when the man burns to death. But I think that the movie is very impactive because in the end, wouldn't you be grateful to be alive?<br/><br/>Personally, because I'm an optimist, I believe that Adam will live. He was left in the room to rot, just as promised, but I believe that somehow someone will get to him. What the writers do with that will be the interesting part..."

","This was an incredible film. An independent and low budget film that was filmed in one building and has only 3 actual outdoor scenes. Filmed in LA because the funding of sponsors couldn't be found in Australia. I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie after I had been extremely disappointed by ""The Village"" and ""The Door in the Floor"". I was even more surprised when I went back and watched the scenes with the commentary. This movie has a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions which constantly keep you thinking throughout the movie and arguing with others long afterward. You wouldn't know this was a fairly low budget film and that it was filmed in only 18 days. You even miss a lot of the bloopers along the way until you actually listen to the directors commentary and they go into it for you. Although they simply don't answer questions about how we are supposed to interpret the movie they do give some great insight into the thought process behind it. Give it a listen the next time you see this."

","What is certainly peculiar here is the mechanism of telling facts. The viewer, at least is what I felt, finds himself trapped in watching this deadly competition; the director reveals clues, surprises and deliciously twisted moments. The general feeling is of something rather revolting, coz some nauseating scenes give a very strong visceral impact; on the whole I would say that its stronger point is the originality. Not a serial killer movie, but a game created for these unlucky victims on a basis impossible to predict for the audience. Apart from Danny Glover and Monica Potter, other actors are quite unknown but they didn't play so bad."

","I put this disc in expecting no more than the average slash flick that seems to be in mass production during the last few years, but was pleasantly surprised at just how much this movie not only surprised me, but at how much I enjoyed it. Right from the start you get thrown into the plot and are caught up with each character's situation or background through the trusted flashback. Containing some interesting ideas, well paced, and some moments that should have you looking around the room wondering about that odd noise from down the hall. My only major gripe with the film lies directly with the overacting (or lack of) by some of the major actor(s) in the film. This problem, not enough to wreck the movie, but enough to remove some of the tension/emotion from some of the scenes can be distracting. Most likely a rental for most, but worth at least worth one watch by anyone the least bit interested in the genre. (7 out of 10)"

","I only give it a 6/10 for reasons that I can't go into too much detail because of spoilers. Spoilers that I won't post and ruin what is potentially a good movie for other people who might think the movie is great.<br/><br/>I can say I took off points for it being un-resolved at the end. Sorry, but I think a movie should be made for the intent of making one movie for one story and then finishing it off. I don't like movies that are obviously made for a sequel (Saw 2 is already in ""pre-production""...) Also, several comments were made during the movie that were never followed up on, while just about every other small detail was tied back to a previous occurrence. I kept seeing things and saying ""What the...?"" and then later on they would get explained, but a lot of stuff wasn't, and I felt the writer/director should have taken the same care with the other stuff too. And, more points taken off because some of the ""jump""-in-your-seat sequences weren't really all that ""jumpy"". They could have been done a lot better. Even some ambient sounds/music used at the right places would have been much better, but some of the scary moments just left me ""ho-hum"".<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good movie, but I don't think I'll be watching it again. Maybe these guys will grow into something spectacular one day and not turn this franchise into another ""Jeepers Creepers"" fiasco."
"Brent_P","7","0","0","18 February 2005"," Finally, an innovative thriller worth watching..
","It's amazing how easy it is to create an original screenplay when somebody puts their mind to it. Director James Wan and friend thought up this idea and put it on paper and then put it to film in 18 days. Why can't the major part of Hollywood get it right? Anyways, this thriller is based on a somewhat serial killer who terrorizes his victims buy setting them up in some type of ""trap"" similar to ""Se7en"", but he leaves them with a small chance of survival, but with the cost of something. That's why I said a ""somewhat"" serial killer because he doesn't actually kill his victims, they mostly kill themselves. The main part of the film surrounds two victims who are chained up on the opposites sides of a bathroom and are given two hacksaws, and the hacksaws aren't meant for the chains. The one victims is given a slight advantage and has to escape and murder the other victim to save his family's lives. There are also various clues on how to get out, why they are there and a few side tracks to hide the true identity of the killer.<br/><br/>The film is very interesting at first, but starts to fade as the story develops as it's gets boring just watching these two guys just sit in this bathroom for an hour and a half. That is until the movie ends, which really makes the movie such a good movie. Since most good movies are sometimes soured by poor endings, this is just the opposite. This was an above average movie with sweet satisfying twist at the end that will NOT you hanging and yet disturb you at the same time. No spoilers here, you have to watch this one yourself."
"K-Slicer","8","0","0","19 February 2005"," I ""saw"" this movie and it was demented
","""Saw"" is a film that be revered as one of the better serial killer-slash-mindscrew films of this decade. While ""Saw"" obviously suffers from a lack of logic and experience, it's hard not to give James Wan and Leigh Whannell pats on the back for making such a twisted, bankable flick. I was left chilled to the bone by the ways that the Jigsaw Killer operated. I have to say my favorite torture game was the one with the safe, candle and the red numbers on the wall. For me, it appeared that these guys must have studied their inspirations in order to make a film that would leave you saying ""That was a scary movie"".<br/><br/>There were three areas of success in ""Saw"". The gritty, demented and all-out distressing setting for the core scenes of the film is the first success. Elwes and Whannell's characters both agreed they were caught in a really crappy situation and the rotten restroom helped fuel that idea. I don't think there was any other possible setting that could have been used to play the game where those two were the victims. The second success was the pacing of the film. It was slow at first but it was accelerated up toward the climax. It set the perfect mood up for the lesser astute viewers to be enthralled by the inevitable twist at the end. The third success was the twist. The twist is one of the best realized moments in recent cinema history. I must say the killer was the last one I ever expected. Even if anybody expected anything about the third person in the bathroom, I don't think anybody could have possibly known whom it was. Those three things make this movie a worthwhile viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>Like any movie, there are a few off-putting things about it. The violence is sadistic and killer is deranged; this is a movie for those with strong stomachs. Cary Elwes did a 180 on me (going from killer in one movie to victim in this film) but his performance was scary to say the least. He may be the most unintentionally annoying on Earth. I think his heart was in this film but his acting style is a taste that many will never acquire. He failed in 'Saw'. Speaking of Elwes, the acting for this movie was all over the place and I blame the inexperience of the filmmakers. They were out to make an entertaining film and acting was probably second to plot, mood, and theme. There are also too many parallels to Seven and Silence of the Lambs in 'Saw'. I did not really this movie as an homage to them as much as I 'saw' it as an almost-intentional rip-off of both films.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Saw' is a better written and better made serial killer-slash-mindscrew film. It isn't as good as 'Seven' or 'Silence...' but it's far better than the likes 'Twisted', 'Taking Lives' and 'Gothika'. While these boy wonders have made an imperfect debut film, I see them becoming better with time. For what it is, it is dark, demented, moody, fearful, and above all impressive. In the great realm of cinema, expect this to be lodged under cult classic. 'Saw' deserves a score of eight."

","After seeing the film and reading the reviews that other people have submitted i'm beginning to doubt myself!

Don't read what others have said about the storyline, if you like thrillers with a bit of a twist this is your kind of film. It is a must see film that is so much better when you go into it with an open mind, this perhaps being the reason for the almost blank poster for the film. Try to forget everything you've read about the storyline, expect the unexpected and remember that low budget and bad acting doesn't always have to mean bad film.

"MatBrewster","7","0","0","18 February 2005"," Imaginative horror, that loses steam in the middle
","I knew very little about Saw before I watched it yesterday. It came out during the time I was too busy moving out of my house and preparing to leave for France to pay much attention to upcoming movies. In France I heard a little buzz on the internet about it being a very captivating and scary thriller. I tried not to pay much more attention than that because there is nothing worse than learning too much about a scary movie before you go see it.<br/><br/>Yesterday, while Amy (who doesn't like horror movies)was out all day in class, I took my chance and sat down to watch it. Upon first viewing I thought it was a really top notch piece of horror (well all except that ending.) First time director James Wan does an excellent job creating a dark, creepy mood. The set pieces are continually dirty and slimy looking, which is perfect for the setting. The story is intriguing enough to keep you from paying too much attention to the sub par acting and the numerous plot holes. It's the kind of movie that kept me still for an hour after seeing it thinking it over. And there lies the problem. After putting some thought into what I had just seen the movie crumbled.<br/><br/>But first, a little more on what is right about the film. The opening sequence is one of the more imaginatively openings I have seen in a long time. The movie opens in a rat hole of a bathroom buried deep in some long deserted public building. The two main characters, Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannel are on opposite sides of the room shackled by the ankles with a short chain connected to rusty pipes. They have no recollection of how they got their, or why. Oh, and there is a dead guy with his head blown off laying in the middle of the floor. I won't give any other plot details away than this, but the remainder of the film centers on those two characters trying to find a way to get out of the room while playing a vicious game with a mad serial killer.<br/><br/>The design of the killer is also done quite imaginatively. Throughout the movie, we get brief glimpses into several other victims and the games they had to play. The killer's design and the games he creates are quite frightening and original. Unfortunately they are also quite implausible. There is no conceivable way that the killer could create his deadly games in the places he does without being noticed and eventually caught. I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but I believe a portion of the horror in this film is meant to be that this kind of sick killer could be quite real. He is not Jason, or Freddy, or Mike Myers, but a more realistic psychopath. In as such his killings are so complicated as to make them absurd.<br/><br/>There are several similarities to the superior piece of cinema Seven. Both films are set in the seedier areas of a large city. The cinematography is both is dark and moody. And both feature a moralistic serial killer who creates inventive and complicated murders. Yet where Seven succeeded in making a classic thriller all the way through, Saw fails about 3/4ths of the way in. The easier part of a horror/thriller is devising an original killer. Where the plot gets difficult is finding resolution of why he is killing and how he is caught. Saw tries to be original by first giving the viewer a cliché fake ending, only to give a real surprise ending later. I wasn't amused.<br/><br/>In order to fill out the plot and, I suppose, take up some time. The filmmakers create some characters that have no use. Danny Glovers subplot adds to the 'whodunnit' episodes to a movie that doesn't need to be a 'whodunnit.' Detective mysteries, cop shows, and murder plots create tension by giving various clues to who the villain could be. In a horror/thrill such as Saw there is no need for the audience to figure out who it could be. We only need to be thrilled by the murderer and grasp with the victims for escape.<br/><br/>You never expect the acting to be brilliant in a small budget horror film, and this film won't surprise you in that area. Cary Elwes was a surprise to see in such a film. Though I know he has done similar fare I will always remember him for his role in the Princess Bride. He doesn't add much to the film in acting. He is also almost too pretty for the role. It seems as if the filmmakers recognized this because as the movie rolls on his make up got more and more dirty and grotesque.<br/><br/>Overall Saw creates an unusual situation that is thrilling enough in the first viewing. However, after a truly good beginning the movie sinks into implausible and isn't smart enough to figure out how to end itself.<br/><br/>Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more."

","Is there any chance that the performance of Cary Elwes sucked? In my (non-acting, humble) opinion it seemed that the majority of his lines were forced. I didn't feel like he delivered a performance that was convincing enough to make us care about his character. Obviously this would take away from the movie as a whole. But maybe I'm wrong. If one of the main characters performance isn't believable than why should we care what happens to him? Should we care about any of the victims in this movie? As far as I see it, they all got what they deserved. Expedited Darwinism, if you will. I guess, it just comes down to whether or not you felt compassion for the people in this film, if you were able to than, it was decent, I guess. If you just saw them as what they were...cheaters, drug addicts, and people with no appreciation of life, then who cares about their fate."

Apparently, this maniac has been doing this sort of thing for a awhile and he an obsessed detective (Danny Glover) is hot on his trail. The plot sounds very interesting and for the most part the film doesn't disappoint. The main actor in this film is Cary Elwes who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon and plays his role effectively. Danny Glover plays the obsessed cop and also does very well. Monica Potter plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon's wife however she isn't in the film for very long. There are some truly horrifying scenes in Saw and one scenes that almost made me want to throw up. Saw is similar to Seven and even though it isn't as good its still worth a look. James Wan does a great job of directing and hopefully will have more opportunities to direct in the future. The ending is done very well and I didn't see all the twists and turns coming. However in the end you don't really care about the characters because they do bad things. I found it hard to have sympathy on some of them but that's just me.

I wanted to begin my comment with something like ""when its bad there's always room for worse"", cuz i thought, when the policeman dies in the end, that things will go bad, sorry for those who will read this before actually see the movie, but it got better.

Nevertheless, a remake MIGHT be good, it's hard to see how they could do any worse than this one! There is a twist at the end, but it's not interesting enough to save the movie from the Razzies.

For two young Australians who practically just started in the film industry this is a brilliant piece of work. The only touches they fell down on were there lack of subtlety. They needed the violent scenes to be more subtle and artistic. A few points they should pick up on for the sequel. Apart from my criticism I loved the massive twist which topped the movie off. I don't think anyone expected it. It gave me such a tingle down my spine when it was proved.

Cary Elwes & Leigh Whannell are excellent in their roles as Dr Lawrence & Adam respectively, so are Danny Glover and Monica Potter.

The knowledge of the viewer is built step by step, until the final twist in the end, which made me a bit surprised (although I could guess it if I would pay notice more on the small details). Of course, there isn't a decent horror movie without some supernatural elements, especially these that belong to the sadistic killer.

","Well, without being too patriotic as a fellow Aussie of the filmmakers, i think the boys did a fair job with a limited budget and first time effort. I can't think of any films of this type coming from Oz Land. Heres a few things i think about the film.<br/><br/>I don't think the jigsaw man would have killed Lawrence in the end. He would have bled to death (he looked in bad shape at the end) or jigsaw would have just closed a door on him too. Remember it was noted earlier in the film that the killer was not a killer, he made them kill themselves. This is basically why you could eliminate Zepp as being the suspect, because his job was to kill Lawrence's family if lawrence himself didn't kill Adam before 6.<br/><br/>Obviously the suspect who had the irreversible tumour (jigsaw) was probably pissed at the treatment he was receiving at the hospital, being his motive to get back at the doctor and the orderly.<br/><br/>But then again its just a movie and thats how it goes. I mean if anything went awry for the jigsaw (things didn't go as planned) remember he had the only gun in the room, yet this would defy the premise of him not being a murderer.<br/><br/>Good job team i was entertained with the movie, and thought the plot and twist was pretty good, without digging too deep into what made the movie entertaining."

","This one had been hyped to me by just about everyone I know as being quite brilliant. Indeed, the Second Coming got less airtime than this one, so I've finally settled down to watch it. Now, we're talking about a true horror connoisseur here, someone who holds Ring (The Japanese original) in such high regard that it's the benchmark for anything else.<br/><br/>So without further ado, how did this one go down?<br/><br/>Saw is, primarily, set in an archaic dungeon style room, with 2 strangers separately bound by chains and unable to remember how they got there. They begin to realize, through an amount of clues provided, and by recollection, that they're here at the behest of some kind of madman whose game insists the only way out is by one killing the other.<br/><br/>Danny Glover is the cop who's pursuing the 'Jigsaw Killer', a killer notorious for never actually killing anyone directly. It seems to be the same person responsible for the situation the 2 strangers find themselves, but no one knows where they are.<br/><br/>Through anecdotal conversations between each other, and continuing discoveries in their 'dungeon', they try to figure out how to get out of the cell. They're given 2 saws, but are unable to cut through the chains.<br/><br/>To say any more would possibly spoil the plot.<br/><br/>There's really very little more I can add to this synopsis to effectively review the film, other than on a technical level. Essentially, for a potentially scary film, it was decidedly short on fear. Maybe it was just a gore-fest, but even then there wasn't a great deal of visceral stuff. The best way I could describe it would be a slightly psychological thriller mystery with a hint of violence. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with it is I got absolutely nothing out of it. It wasn't really all that good at anything. No fear, little tension, ineffectual psychology, etc etc. There was just very little to make me sit up and take real notice here.<br/><br/>By all means it entertained, and the characterisation was decent enough I suppose to warrant the desire to know what happened to everyone, but truthfully there was just a lack of punch here. The direction was decent enough without any frills, and there was also a huge lack of cinematography. Even though the confined space of the dungeon was small, there wasn't much claustrophobia going on. This was probably due to the counter-balance of the flashback scenes of the outside world.<br/><br/>Overall, it was just *there* and isn't anything I haven't seen before. For fear, check Ring. For blood, check any number of gorefests. For thriller go with Memento. There are a lot better films out there than Saw."

","**WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!**<br/><br/>I was anticipating this film ever since I first saw the poster. When I saw the trailer I anticipated it even more. I'm a BIG fan of psychological thrillers (anyone expecting this to be, or saying this is a horror film is wrong), and I was certain that this would be on the level of some of the classic thrillers of this kind; i.e. Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, etc. After seeing it I must say that it met my expectations and is one of the best films I've seen this year. I honestly left the theater with my mouth dropped, it was an exhausting and exhilarating feeling at the same time.but it was a GREAT feeling. I don't think I've seen a movie begin and end the way 'Saw' did, it jumps RIGHT into the action and right back out of it. And as far as the ending: absolutely genius. No one could honestly say that they predicted that the killer was who it ends up being in the end. I've read other reviews criticizing the end, saying 'why would he lay there for 8 hours' who cares?!?! What's baffling and mind-boggling is that he DID! I love how everything was done.the movie was smart and nail-biting, it gave me the feeling that the aforementioned thriller classics did; but what it also did was make its own mark on the whole genre. The only thing preventing 'Saw' from getting a perfect score is the ASININE actions (or lack thereof) of Cary Elwes' wife after getting the upper-hand over the guy holding her hostage. Why in the HELL didn't she shoot him once she got the gun from him? That was so ANNOYING to watch, it almost ruined the movie for a second. All in all, 'Saw' is truly a great, great film that I will HAVE to own when it's released on DVD. A classic thriller film, it's nice to see that people can still make good thrillers nowadays.<br/><br/>*** ½ out of **** stars."

I never once felt emotionally connected to the characters...I couldn't care less if they succeeded or not. I was upset with how nearly every character seemed to die, but amazingly enough, were still alive. The worst part, by far, was the ending. It was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh. I am thoroughly convinced that they threw it together at the last second, while trying to add twists...none of them worked. It made the entire movie feel like a waste of my time.

","In a time of tired gore and predictable thrillers that are anything but thrilling, Saw brings youthful creativity and exuberance that has long been missing from the genre.<br/><br/>Equal amounts of time are spent in a claustrophobic bathroom and in flashbacks that give context to their predicament. The aesthetic choices made by James Wan recall the spare, grating minimalism of Cube, the frenzied cinematography of The Cell, and the dark grit of Se7en. These elements are masterfully combined to create an altogether immersive, disturbing feel. The protagonists are largely straight men, but manage to come off with some type of depth. The psychopath, while not really a developing character, is brilliantly conceived. He places his victims in situations designed to make them decide (or perhaps realize) how much they want to live. In a sense, the serial killer is something of a apolitical Tyler Durden. At one point in the film we are acquainted with someone who survived one of his orchestrated tests. Cognitive dissonance has brought her to 'appreciate' what the psychopath did to her. At the same time, it's not entirely clear that in the absence of the experience she would be better off. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Wan has gone beyond Rob Zombie's boring caricatures of inbred southerners, beyond gimmicky blair witch devices. He's created a singularly engaging film that breathes new life into domestic horror."

","SAW the movie was a amazing movie. The storyline and plot behind it was remarkable. I love how the director really made you think about who was behind all of it. To me honestly, I wasn't as scared as a lot of the people who I saw it with were. I'm really into these types of thrillers but even thought this movie is a thriller it still gives you chills and makes you jump out of your seat a few times. This movie lets you see in the mind of a serial killer and you are wowed by it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. It was a great movie and at the end it really surprises you.

","I can't believe some of the reviews this movie is getting, and I'm speaking to the harshly negative reviewers. I mean C'mon; OK the acting was really bad at the beginning and the near end. But the movie looked good, and used cliché's that we are obviously not sick of. This film is enjoyable for people who like horror/psycho thriller movies. I was impressed to see it was made for 1.2 mil, and I can say that for that much it was far more worth my dollar to see a movie with an ambitious idea, then to see some of the 100 million dollar crap coming out. So if you are in the mood for a good thriller with a not so obvious ending, I definitely recommend it, you will laugh a little, get a little scared, and scratch your head at the end. If you are looking for the perfect movie, rent the Godfather or something.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for me."

The millionth serial killer movie since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS throws in every single genre cliché imaginable (how many times are the main character's wife and daughter going to be threatened in a movie like this?) not to mention surprisingly bad acting (except Glover) and an twist that is obvious from the opening minute. A doctor and a photographer are chained to pipes on opposite ends of a filthy torture chamber, victims of the Jigsaw, a serial killer who plays games in order for his victims to kill each other. Of course, the doctor's family has been taken hostage and time is of the essence. More gruesome than scary, with the all-too-familiar Hollywood shootout climax (isn't this supposed to be an independent film?) but there are some tense moments here and there. RATING: 5 out of 10.

Thirdly, several scenes were much too funny, like when Adam fakes getting poisoned, I just laughed through that entire scene. Also, the bad guys in movies should be somewhat intimidating, not some little doll with a stupid mask that rides a tricycle.

","Spoilers. I noticed a few comments about the ""over-acting"" of the Doctor guy. I wonder how it is that people that write those comments actually know how a human being who is under extreme stress, and whose wife and kid are in the hands of a sadist would actually behave? Are you critics of such acting speaking from some kind of experience here? Or are you just looking, as one insightful poster pointed out, for an understated performance. To have enough adrenaline to saw off your leg in the hope of saving your loved ones does not call for a bullshit Keanu Reeves style grace under pressure turn. Understated performances are actually rather cowardly, easier to do and are certainly dull. That's why ""stars"" underact. Sadly people now think that under-acting is good. If you have ever seen anyone stressed to the point that they crack up and panic, then you will not describe their behavior as stoic and understated. I'm no expert in psychology but I know enough to say that it is difficult to say whether such acting is realistic or not. But it was good enough for me. Saw steals from various movies, yet it manages to have its own personality and has more creativity than a million mainstream flicks. It is often suggestive, occasionally genuinely gory. And, SERIOUS SPOILERS, the twist ending is a corker! I enjoyed this movie, it set up an amazing initial scene and then kept up the suspense aside from the woefully unsatisfying detective scenes, which felt tagged on and pointless, badly acted (""you need a girl friend"") and cliché (noticing a detail on a video tape, why they didn't spot that earlier leaves the mind boggled). The movie, at it's core, is influenced by computer adventure games, I suspect. Here's a situation, solve it or die.

Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--The ending is actually surprising, somewhat, it was fairly original.<br/><br/>--The creepiness is decent.<br/><br/>--The story wraps around itself and everything is relevant, and that's good.<br/><br/>--Some decent violence/gore.<br/><br/>--Set design.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--The writing and direction seem amateurish.

The only good part is that it's not exactly predictable.<br/><br/>The Inevitable Ugly:<br/><br/>--The acting is pretty damn bad, I mean, it gets pretty awful pretty often. ...From every character except maybe the killer and Monica Potter (but she has about 4 lines).<br/><br/>--The story is filled with holes and questions that, if you think about them, may really annoy you... ""How did he get audio enhancement from a video he was just watching?"" Little things like this. And if you've seen CSI, the police work seems just ignorant and unsophisticated.<br/><br/>--The director clearly didn't know how to make really intense scenes, so to make up for his lack of artistic vision, we get to deal with putrid ""crazy fast motion"" camera work. This occurs A LOT and is about as annoying to watch pretty much all non-Matrix bullet-time.<br/><br/>If you're a horror fan, you might want to take a look.

"velasco00","Null","0","0","9 November 2004"," Why does the horror genre continue to disappoint me?
","Let me preface this rant with the fact that I'm no Horror film buff - And that my viewing of Horror films is limited to the occasional ""mainstream"" title. But I AM a film buff - and enjoy watching them... and occasionally making them, immensely. If there's anyone in Hollywood that desperately deserves some sort of award, it should be the Trailer editors. A good trailer alone can make it seem worthwhile to drop down your 9 bucks and sit through just about anything. So it was the case with ""SAW"" for myself. The trailer looked raw, provocative... veiled in mystery... Sadly, the film did not live up to the trailer. Now, my intent is not to bash this film, because I found the premise to the film so very interesting. Of its obvious flaws - the horrible acting of Cary Elwes and his bathroom sidekick were devastating to its legitimacy - as the film's climax was reduced to an awkward ""who done it"" comedy routine. But as I left the theater, what I really felt was disappointment. That this film, with such promise, failed to deliver. Which brings me to my subject... modern Horror Films. Is there anything ""scary"" anymore. I'll say - the one moment in Saw that I actually felt that twinge in my heart, was the sequence where ""Adam"" is going through his apartment using his flash... looking for an intruder. For me, it was the subtlety of the scene that made it ""scary."" No unrealistic gore... No slick special effect... Like the trailer, it was veiled. The anticipation and the restraint of the director to let me fill in the gaps in my head made my heart beat just a bit faster. And I think that buried in that feeling is the essence of what made us all cry in the night, as children -an absolute fear of the unknown. What what was a stuffed animal by day to us could seem like a lurking beast at night, cast in shadowy moonlight. Any of the Horror movies I see today are over the top, cliché ridden spectacles. Even the ""shocking ending"" has gotten a bit old with M. Night's tired yarns. Modern Horror lacks the subtlety that allows our minds to fill in the details from our own bag of nightmares. Show me some sort of creature in all its Hollywood glory and my mind quickly looks for features that reveal it as being fake... my mind rationalizes that this is some fictitious entity put before me on display... now... only show me a few aspects of this creature or perhaps only sound... a whisper.. a hint of what is to come... and that I will touch on something. I can only remember once in my adult life that I felt my heart absolutely skip a beat in the movie theater - and that was at the climax of the Blair Witch project. I actually found the middle of the film boring - except when the tent was rattled but for much the same reasons... but that final shot... a blurred, dark POV of the man in the corner.. and then black... There was no cheesy monster, no over the top effects, no canned acting... girl in distress... no menace chasing a bunch of teens... it was simple, and yet it shook me up - because it played before me like my own nightmares... laced in that ""fear of the unknown,"" in that darkness.. (and not purely in the literary sense). I think H-wood, or any serious horror film producers need turn the dial back a bit and bring subtlety back to their craft... because I've anything you show me outright - I'm not going to buy. Which, brings me back to Saw - though part seemed to be some derivative of se7en - the idea of waking up in a bathroom with another man.. a hacksaw.. etc.. is nightmarish... MAKE IT A NIGHTMARE for me... Let me know what you think..."

In an interesting dynamic or dialectic, Dr. Lawrence Gordon initially approaches his dilemma with cool, calm logic, only to descend into a maelstrom of madness. Adam, his fellow prisoner, starts out as impulsive and unthinking, but grows increasingly cagier and slyer. The shift in the dynamic between them genuinely proves to be a see-saw battle (pun intended).<br/><br/>However, ""Saw"" woefully wastes the thespian talents of the likes of Danny Glover.

","OK. So here's the deal with Saw. The movie itself was really good. I think it was a fantastic idea and it kept the audience right there with it the entire movie. But Cary Elwes really really sucked. I mean, you didn't believe him for a second. He wasn't horrible until the climax of the film when he was supposedly in agnoy and really going crazy and crying and all that...then he was just awful. I mean in the theatre i was in, everyone was laughing at his inability to actually look in pain and mad. He just looked stupid. And it was really funny. So, all in all good movie and Cary Elwes was really really really bad. But i still like him because he was in The Princess Bride1"

","I went to see ""Saw"" last night with my best friend. Both of us are big fans of horror movies, no matter what the type (i.e. psychological, slasher). We arrived at 10:15, and the next 2 hours for us were truly exciting.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a tense credits scene. A man is submerged under water in a rusty tub. He suddenly awakens and pops the drain cork, letting the water drain. He crawls out into the darkness, chained down, unable to move very far. A voice begins to talk to him. The lights blast on, and another man is revealed to him across the room, also chained to a pipe in the wall. They are in what appears to be a rusty old bathroom: With a dead body in between them. They panic and begin to talk to each other, to try and find clues as to who did this and why. They each find a tape recording in their pockets. Each one has a message. They each explain why the two men are there: For committing sins that the killer thinks are wrong.<br/><br/>Enter Jigsaw: A smart killer, much like Hannibal Lecter, only this killer is likes to play games. If you win the game, you survive. If you lose, however: You pay with your life. The purpose of these Death Traps are to teach the victim a lesson about life: To value it. <br/><br/>This movie progresses, telling the story if Jigsaw, alternating between flashbacks and real time. The cinematography is amazing at points, and the music very well compliments the eerie, hellish atmosphere. The movie mostly uses fast-paced, macab scenes to scare you, but a warning for all who think this is only a psychological thriller, it is not. there are about two ""scare"" scenes, which are slightly predictable but still very intense.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10. I think it is safe to say this is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. The build up of the retellings of Jigsaws sick games plus the unfolding of an ongoing investigation into the mind of the insane adds up to one of the most shocking twist endings I have ever seen. My friend Sean who is a whiz at predicting the ends of movies was even blown away."

This movie is like Se7en, because its about a psycho who chooses people that are involved in one vice or another and tricks them into killing themselves or others; leaving them messed up for life and maybe better off dead. The main gripe I have about the movie is the Killer's reasons for choosing his victims was pretty weak. But, this lack of a decent reason for the complicated design for madness the Killer put his victims through, also made the killer more interesting, mysterious, increased the belief that any average ordinary person could be next. I was surprised about the ending. It is the reason why this movie got a 7 instead of a 6. I went to see this movie hoping to be disturbed. I didn't get disturbed, but I was entertained.

There were moments when the suspense was completely ruined by horribly delivered lines that made me chuckle.<br/><br/>The twist at the end was a great idea, but I think it could have been better. A so-so thriller that is worth renting just so you know what happens and can dog it out when other people are discussing.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I was a little freaked out at the end of the movie--walking out through the dark theater.

Such movies as Cabin Fever, They, Darkness Fall had me leaving the movie theater feeling cheated outta my $8.00. Before Saw the last decent horror movie was The Ring, which really doesn't count cause it was based on a Japanese movie. But anyway back to Saw. <br/><br/>This movie was anything but predictable, and is able to jump along a timeline where you aren't really sure how far back this took place, but it doesn't even matter. The scenes flow together well and make sense.<br/><br/>Why Danny Glovers character was created I'll never know. He seemed to be a side character in the movie which never amounted to anything. Is there even any real loss if you take him outta the movie? <br/><br/>I'll skip the usual talk of the actors, just to say, they are all believable enough. It's not Carl Elwes fault that regardless of who he plays I'll always see him as the Princess Bride. <br/><br/>This is James Wan's directorial debut (or at least listed as his debut) and what way to start off.

","i consider myself to be a good fan of horror movies, and therefore a fairly adequate judge of a film such as Saw. <br/><br/>However i found it to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. The acting seemed forced and unnatural, and very ""read"" rather than actually acted. I had previously held much respect for Cary Elwes, but now it has almost diminished. As for the rest of the cast, relatively unknown with a few exceptions, and probably never to be heard from again in anything memorable.<br/><br/>The concept of the film was a good one in my opinion. Perhaps with different directors and producers this could have been more of a success. While watching it, i found it laughable more than scary. I was with quite a few people when i went to see it, and i was appalled and ashamed that most of them (mainly female) were terrified. The ""killing"" scenes were for some reason sped up in fast motion, which i feel took away any chance they had to be effective. There were many moments also which i assume were meant to be serious that i laughed out loud at, particularly Cary Elwes scenes where he had to appear upset, or dramatic. <br/><br/>When i came out of the cinema, i was very angry at myself for having spent £6 on this mess.

I am not a violent person but very soon into the film i wished most people in it would in fact hurry up and die as it became more like a manson/bauhaus video crossed with Seven and a dashing of amateur dramatics.

Everyone was telling me that it was an awesome movie and that I had to see. It was an adventure to see it because every theater me and my friend went to it was sold out. We finally found a theater and we couldn't believe what we saw. The film starts out a little slow but after the first 30 minutes it picks up and sends you on a roller coaster. I found myself a little confused throughout the whole then, then in the last ten minutes everything comes together and I was very impressed.Saw is the story of two men who awake to a highly confusing and often scary game. Together they must put together the clues they have and solve this terrifying mystery. The acting in the film could have been a little better in my opinion, but everything really worked well together. The suspense was great and the ending was just plain amazing.

I don't think I'll be able to get Jigsaw and his brutal philosophies out of my head for a while. The only reason why I would downgrade this film is that, at times, the acting was extremely horrific, mainly on Cary Elwes' part. The script also seemed slack near the end.

It wasn't nearly as gross as I'd thought it would be (Did they cut some stuff out for American audiences? If so why? I would have preferred it to be Unrated and a little more gory.) <br/><br/>Leigh Whannell (Adam), and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) did an excellent job in the lead roles as two men trapped by a serial killer. Danny Glover (Detective David Tapp) also gave a fine performance. I have heard some say the acting was a little over the top. I didn't see that at all. The actors made you believe they were ordinary people facing very extreme situations. I thought the acting was dead-on.<br/><br/>The plot and the script were pretty good also. Every moment your learning something new about the characters, their situation, and the plot. In fact, there is almost no dead-time. Everything is building to a horrific crescendo which fills in all the gaps and makes you shiver. I actually heard several groups of people, leaving the theater afterward, say they thought it was an excellent movie and I have to agree.<br/><br/>So, is it a classic? I'm not going to go that far.

","This is an interesting movie - especially for those who like psychotic killer with amoral conscience as the antagonist.<br/><br/>(SPOILER below)<br/><br/>The way the killer let his victims tries to save their own life in nearly impossible matters and then eventually let them die is both sadistic and graphic. The movie shows that the killer, who is bitter about his terminal brain tumor, wanted to kill those around him, making him taking control of other people's destiny (their life/death) and therefore allow him to have a sense of control of other people's life even if he can't live much longer himself. This movie uses the tactic of showing an alibi and fools the audience into thinking that he is the real killer. It does this well. At the end, the real killer is revealed.<br/><br/>The only problem about a killer who plans an ingenious strategy to make his victim suffers and then dies is the plan has to hold up. This requires detailed planning and able to predict what the victim will likely to do. And especially at the later scene where the killer uses another victim (Zep Hindle) as his fake alibi and forces him to do his bidding. This part would be next impossible to do as Zep is outside of the set up environment. The others victims are confined in a chamber, close room, or a place that were escape is not possible and they've make the choice the killer is given to them or die. Also the fact that the killer is playing dead in the room while victims never realize that he was alive was kinda unbelievable.<br/><br/>(SPOILER off)<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for people wanting a psychological thriller rather than a horror movie. Horror movie is when after you watch it, you'll not be able to sleep well at night and become extremely fearful to your surroundings. This movie develops mystery but is too far fetch to be completely believable. The setting and elaborate setup to kill of the victims is not typical and requires many hours of planning. Therefore the horror only affects the viewers during the movie and not if they're alone in the house at night."

Even though 'The Grudge' was considered the scariest movie of 2004 also, which it might have been, Saw wasn't as scary as it was sought out to be.<br/><br/>This movie can't be considered a Horror film, but in the commercial, they compared it to SE7EN (Seven) and Silence of the Lambs. I agree with this, because it was entertaining and hard to follow too, which agrees with both these movies.<br/><br/>The plot is mainly head games. Even though we don't really find out who the main culprit is, 'he' puts his victims into mind-boggling situations that cause them to panic, and fail their task. For example: A woman named Amanda was locked up with a metal contraption on her head. This was attached to her upper gums and lower jaw. In a certain amount of time, the machine would rip open her mouth and her head would have basically torn apart (yay). The only way to get it off, was to cut open a dead cell mates stomach, to find the missing key.<br/><br/>Although it may seem extreme, this movie is worth owning. The more times you watch it, the better you will understand. The ending for Saw was better than the ending for The Grudge, so be happy.

"lunalight22","5","0","0","4 November 2004"," a review of the film as an effective scary/horror movie
","The release of saw brought chills and twists to the big screen. The film begins with two men chained up in a dingy room with a dead man lying between them. The movie then continues on through a series of flashbacks as the men try to find a way to escape. In Saw the murderous tyrant comes off more as a game master rather than a blade swinging slasher. This killer puts his victims in situations where escape is possible but only through severe sacrifice. Such as crawling through razor sharp wire or cutting through a man's stomach. The scenes that take place are both visually and mentally disturbing. The gore factor in Saw also makes use of the viewer's imagination. For example the act of sawing into a man is not visually demonstrated but is alluded to through blood splattering and camera framing.<br/><br/>This technique can make violent scenes even more gory and atrocious. Another disturbing aspect about saw is the dreadful performances given by most of the actors. Even though the characters do have their good moments, most of the time they are overly dramatic and barely seem to show real emotion. Another disruptive aspect of Saw is its failure to maintain continuity between different camera shots. For example items may not be found where they were left or actors will be positioned differently form shot to shot. Amateur mistakes like these can pull the audience out of the movie making it less scary. Luckily what Saw lacks in acting and technical skill it makes up for in creative story line and style. This will make a good rental for those nights when a movie that is a little scary and disturbing is desired."

I hate movies like those. This is a newer horror movie that was done differently than the rest, kind of like Butterfly Effect, it was different and brilliant. I don't know what that guy was thinking with saying it was dull and repetitive, apparently he does not go out and see a lot of movies. This is a first in a new genre of horror. The story keeps you guessing until the very end, and I do mean the very end. The ending was a complete mindblow, it surprised the sh$! out of me. It would be more accurate to go off of the commercials than to go off of his review. The only thing that sucked was the fact that they edited some of it to get it down to an R rating, (originally NC-17). One other thing, if you do not like lots of blood and gore, or you get notious at the sight of blood, then do not go. There is so much blood and gore and violence in this movie that it put Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and all the famous slashers to shame. Just don't go if you don't like blood, you'll thank me for it, trust me. If you have not watched the movie stop reading at this point for the rest will spoil the movie for you, if you read on, don't complain, I warned you. <br/><br/>There is only 2 things I don't understand about this movie, 1st off, how did the guy with the disease get out of the hospital to go do all of these killings? Since he was the jigsaw killer. 2nd, if the jigsaw killer was in the middle of the freakin room the whole damn time, wouldn't they have seen him breathing and knew he wasn't dead. Well, I guess I thought he was dead too, real question is then, how did he breath throughout the entire movie, without being detected???????

One of the first things I would have tried.<br/><br/>Then at the end when he couldn't reach the phone with the box, and he started taking off his shirt I figured he was going to retrieve the phone with it as he instructed Adam to do to get the tape recorder at the beginning. Never mind the actual saw he used to chop off his foot, which would have also reached the phone.<br/><br/>There were also several times when the killer should have been shot...by the cops and by Adam at the end, while the wife should have shot Zep when she has the chance as well.<br/><br/>I also didn't like it when Glover's character chased Zep. One minute they were in the apartment and the next they were in a high speed chase in cars ????? WTF<br/><br/>And the last question...WHY ZEP? He actually showed some compassion for the killer in the Patch Adams moment near the beginning when he told the Dr. the patient's name was John. All of the other victims were shown to be not living their lives to their potential in some way or another, but I can't recall why Zep was chosen.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of potential, but it looked like they just ran out of money and said frig it. I hope they do a better job on the sequel."

","Eh is pretty much the most emotion this film dragged out of me. The acting was poor, the editing was terrible, and the writing was lacking. The sets were well done and the ending was surprising (I think everyone has gotten that much out of all the reviews). As far as the acting goes, I could hear the trace of an English accent in American characters and was laughing in key moments because the characters were so unbelievable. There were so many things wrong with the editing that I don't know where to begin. The flashbacks gave the film an amateur feel and took away from the trauma at the moment, certain ""scary"" scenes were broken up and the suspense was drained, and the transitions from scenes using voice-overs were nauseating. In the area of writing, there were underdeveloped characters (such as the psychopath and his motivation) and the ""huge"" twist at the end was merely that a man stood up. If the audience cared about this man and knew why he chose to dress up as a pig and use a scary puppet, maybe there would be more closure. Or maybe the twist is that there will never be closure when the sins of man are involved. Probably not though."

","While this is a movie that depends very heavily on mystery and concealment, sometimes to the aggravation and annoyance the viewer, there is substance behind all the grisly gimmicks and despairing scenes: this is what one would call an ""existential"" film, and not in the pretentious sense.<br/><br/>I can fully understand the criticisms of the film. The ""flashbacks"" that the acidic and whiny surgeon have are indeed a little bit of a cop out, as you sort of come into the movie expecting a Hitchcockian kind of experiment, a film made in one room in the tradition of ""Rope"". If that was the idea that turned you on to this movie, it might not live up to your expectations, as most of the important parts are outside of the bathroom in which the two men are imprisoned.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning we know none of this can end well. The two leading men are irritating, amoral, and unsympathetic characters to say the least. The surgeon is a workaholic and solicitor of prostitutes, and Adam, the young photographer, is a burn out moron in the vein of early Keanu Reeves. It's hard to care about either of the characters at all, but when wife and children come into play, we do.<br/><br/>You may think that you have the film when it is halfway through, but you don't, so stick with it. The ending of this movie is one of the only genuine, ""I'd have no idea until I saw it"" shockers I've seen in years. In fact, the *ending* (by no means the entire movie) of this one probably transcends ""Se7en"" in terms of the level of sheer surprise it generates.<br/><br/>There are seriously unforgettable scenes. Each one with ""the puppet"", for example, will not leave your mind for quite sometime. There's something so inarticulately horrific about it; if your friend showed up at an intense Halloween party with it on it would not be cool. The killer is trying to teach his victims a lesson which is in many ways deeper than John Doe's rather conventional, Biblically inspired message. He tries to get a drug addict to feel some value for her body by putting a metallic, explosive ""Man In the Iron Mask"" type thing on her face and promising her that if she doesn't get the key in five minutes her head will be blown apart by it. The way that she obtains the key ain't for the squeamish.<br/><br/>The only huge flaw this movie really has (aside from some laughable dialogue between Adam and the surgeon) is that we never really get to know the killer, who despite being a psychopathic monster seems to have some real lessons to teach. It would have been interesting to hear him comment on his own crimes in his own voice, not the baritone, digitially altered, ominous scratch which narrates it's own atrocities.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, this is a gut wrenching film, almost flawlessly blending horrendous gore and morality. Recommended."

Anyway I went to see it and though I don't know much about acting...what I do know is that this was, by far, the worst acting I have ever seen. The two locked in the bathroom are the biggest nancies I have ever seen...and each line becomes so over-dramatic...it's terrible. Yet what I will say is that, contrary to most comments, there are no holes in the end...it would be pretty hard not to piece the whole thing together. I think it's very easy to understand. Also, the killer's ideas were very cool and the torture contraptions were great. I was a big fan of the puppet, as well...pretty spooky, especially from growing up in the era pf Puppet Master and Child's Play. Had the acting not been so poor, this movie could've gone somewhere."
"santorini8","Null","0","0","3 November 2004"," Movie imaginative, but melodrama caused laughs.
","This movie is imaginatively written by a first-time screenwriter and actor. This is a great lesson for actors - write your own movie and refuse to let it be made until they cast you in the lead role. Vin Diesel did a similar thing. This actor seems to have established himself with this movie. The actors are competent, the writing intricate, and it's shot well. Only one problem - the melodrama in one climactic scene caused the audience to laugh at some inappropriate times. They weren't suppose to laugh, they were suppose to be riveted. Good choice to open this movie on Halloween weekend as it fits in the horror theme. The theatre checked ID's on the way into the theatre to make sure the kiddies didn't buy a ticket to something else and try to sneak into this movie. That was necessary as this movie I think should have been NC-17 rated just for the gore and intensity. There's nothing sexual and no nudity, so they gave it a R-rating, which was too little. The box office might actually have been higher had they given it a NC-17 rating, as I can't see too many parents taking their under-17 kiddies to this one. I heard that it was originally NC-17 but they cut it down to get the R-rating. Must have done that to get the widest release possible, as some theatre chains won't run a NC-17 movie. Danny Glover's character is inadequately developed and utilized, he seems out of place in this film. They could have used an unknown, but I guess they needed a ""name"" to help sell this film. I would recommend seeing this film, but don't eat before you go."

The entire premise of the movie as shown in the trailers is based on the whole idea that two people stuck in a room have a choice of dying or cutting ones own limb off.

"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","0","0","1 November 2004"," Jigsaw Thriller
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Saw"" is one of the most original, twisted, grotesque, and perplexing suspense films I have ever seen. It contains a gruesome, sadistic premise that is designed to keep the audience's interest at least out of sheer curiosity and question: two men find themselves confined inside a hideous building, chained to the floor and having only their recollections, thoughts, and a few perplexing signals by the man responsible for their abduction, who is apparently notorious for this style of execution. The direction is rather blurred, tumultuous, and frequently frustrating: as we learn of important, curious details of the backgrounds of these two unfortunate men as well as the madman, the director feels that ""pieces of the puzzle"", in order to fit (perhaps in the constraints of the film's running time), must be hurried and even graphic: sometimes we aren't even aware of what is happening, particularly and most disturbingly in the ""revelation"" towards the end, and one can only become dazed and lost when they cannot follow a hundred pieces suddenly said to come together! The tone and setting are depressingly bleak, dark and twisted, perhaps to enhance the element of fear, of gratitude for not being a ""pawn"" in this madman's ""game"", which is ultimately more horrible than it might initially seem as is revealed throughout the film. We can only immediately assume that the two men (Cary Elwes- Lawrence Gordon, Leigh Wannall- Adam) are merely subjects of their captor's design, and try as they might, can ultimately only beg and plead to the circumstances of their contingent demise. There are indeed many surprising twists throughout the film, including the identities of Lawrence and Adam, which of course, are pieces to the jigsaw that is the film's plot. The meaning of the film, if it could possibly be fully conceived, would be brilliant, if not for the consternation created by the dizzy editing and twisting developments throughout the manic story. Every detail of the story, including every character that is included and revealed, is a ""piece of the puzzle"", and while the jigsaw itself can be quite ""puzzling"" even by the end, the film does manage to put everything together and consummate on a rather admirable and satisfying note. A dark, convoluted, twisted, perplexing thriller, ""Saw"" is at the very least, one brutal ""jigsaw"" of a concept. *** out of ****"
"Robert_duder","Null","0","0","31 October 2004"," Almost the best movie I have ever seen...almost!! Spoiler Alert
","Nope, not kidding here ladies and gentlemen, the words brilliant, amazing, entertaining, intriguing and a worthy film come to mind. The words slightly flawed, under used, mainstreamed and poorly casted also come to mind. But for director James Wan's first time around, it is truly a remarkable piece of film. It almost made the status of being the greatest movie I have ever seen. Comparisons to the amazing Seven w/ Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are not unfounded. The world created by Wan in Saw is a gritty, dark underworld of murder, lust, and twisted imagery and interestingly as David Fincher did in Seven, they never once mention the city or state or any other location in the film. It's just people who exist on a dark playing field, caught in a game of terror.<br/><br/>Saw is the story of an incredibly sadistic terminally ill killer who plays games with his victims that ultimately end up in them ending their own lives so that he never actually kills anyone himself. He is a voyeur into the lives of these people. In his first round of murders a detective played by Danny Glover and his partner played by Ken Leung track him down after finding his first victims. He narrowly escape and in the process cleverly murders Glover's partner. Glover then becomes obsessed in tracking him down and ending his murderous spree. Fast forward an unknown period of time, the killer kidnaps a young married surgeon and a washed up photographer and chains them inside a small bathroom type area. Together feet apart they must unravel the mystery of this killer's plan in order to escape with their lives and the doctor's family's life. <br/><br/>First the unfortunate side, bad news before good. The plot line for this film has been mainstreamed in order to bring the teenies out. It's still much more than a slasher flick but they put in the necessary elements that almost ruin the film. The inappropriate humor in the film takes away from the tension, and ruins the perfectly terrifying atmosphere of the film. At times you wonder if you're supposed to laugh but can't quite help it anyways. Leigh Whannel's character of Adam is inappropriately funny and it's a shame really. Danny Glover's character of Detective David Tapp is perhaps the saddest part of this movie. In his acting caliber with this character they had an unbelievable, memorable presence left completely un-""tapped"" no pun intended. A washed up, removed from duty, emotionally disturbed detective who has become maniacally obsessed with tracking down a serial killer that ended his partner's life. This is a whole movie premise on it's own. And yet Wan chooses to barely touch on it, and Glover's role in the movie is instead pointless and unused. What a complete shame!!<br/><br/>The cast of the film was not brilliant. Whannel leaves much to be desired as an actor although this appears to be his first ""real"" role so we can cut him some slack. Cary Elwes as the imprisoned Doctor, who has been around for a long time in supporting roles really has no excuse. This could easily have been his break out role and although he has several shining emotional moments, there are also times where the over reacting and the under reacting is too much to bear. In the hands of a much more skilled actor, this role could have brought tears to my eyes. Monica Potter does alright with what she is given in the ""Gwyneth Paltrow--Seven"" type role. The daughter of the doctor and Potter's character is played by Makenzie Vega who has had several small Television roles. She does a great job as the terrified little girl.<br/><br/>On from the bad news and what makes this film ""almost"" the best movie. There is another person who posted a review on here ""The Unemployed critic"" who absolutely despised this movie. I wonder after reading his review if he was asleep through this film? This is Wan's first time out as a director and there are few if any who are given the opportunity and ideas that this movie presents. You have the most complicated, terrifying story of two men in desperation, first not wanting to be together, then having to work together, then hating each other for being there, then caring for each other, then relying on each other, and finally they just have to be together in order to survive as shown by Whannel's plea to the doctor ""Don't Leave me"" in the final scenes. Their desperation and terror is reflected in their constantly changing moods and emotions. The whole story for these men is carried out on a four foot chain, locked in a giant puzzle. On the outside you have what seemingly appears to be another man who is the killer, watching them, terrorizing Dr. Gordon's family but in actuality he is only a pawn in the game himself, being terrorized and forced to stay alive as well.<br/><br/>The room is filled with clues, the dead body, the telephone, the photograph, the neon X, the heart, the saw...it all leads up to one terrifying climax that will leave one man with the decision to live or die. Wan does not resort to the cheap thrills jumps of other slasher type horror films and instead instills a feeling of dread and terror in the audience as he builds up the climax and we are revealed each step of the puzzle as the characters are. I do not believe Wan fully used the characters to the best of potential and although I do believe Serializing this film would most likely ruin it, it would do very well to reveal more of the back story on this character. Why does he kill? When did he lose his sanity? The murders are clever and unique and it has been such an incredibly long time since I have seen a original story such as this. I highly recommend anyone wanting to see a terrifying murder mystery to check out this film and Seven as well. Both these movies stand alone as truly great piece of cinema and will stand the test of time as classics. 8.5/10"

Just a long boring thriller that has no gore, no jumps, and hardly a plot. You cant even feel bad for the characters because they are so stupid. This had to be the most pointless movie Danny Glover has ever been in. Seriously what was the point of him being there? Oh yeah to score an easy paycheck.

Also who would be able to sit still for that long i mean the guy has a serious issue and he was able to sit still for what was it 6 hours.

","Since when did the prerequisite for being a serial killer require a BA in graphic design and an extensive knowledge of spot welding? The murderer in SAW seems to have a flare for the dramatic and time on his hands, never a good combination. As the film opens we find two men caught in the thinly constructed web of said psychopath. They are Adam (Leigh Whannell, who co-wrote the script) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes, THE PRINCESS BRIDE), and they are chained to the walls of an abandoned bathroom. There is a dead man in the middle of the floor and a clock on the wall, it's a pretty nice clock. Anyway, they each listen to a micro-cassette on which the voice of the killer explains his wicked hedge maze of deceit and horror. They are given clues and begin to piece together what little they know about the situation they find themselves in. Oh, and there are pointless flashbacks to the killer's previous crimes and of two cops (Danny Glover[?] and Ken Leung) who hang around because a movie like this needs cops who do that. We learn more and more about the two men as the clock runs down towards the hour of our killer's ultimate evil crescendo.........<br/><br/>I blame several previous modern films for the the likes of SAW and its ilk. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for creating the hyper-intelligent icon of killer as genius; THE USUAL SUSPECTS which launched the ""twist ending"" that doesn't have to make sense as long as the movie is stylish; and SEVEN, which spawned the serial killer as moralist avenger. SAW uses all these conventions and mixes them all together and adds some irritating MATRIXesque CGI set-ups for, seemingly, no reason because they undercut the tension by speeding up scenes which, if played straight, would have been grueling and dramatic.<br/><br/>Truth is is that SAW is just another film entry in a group that includes such films as MINDHUNTERS and THE CELL, where whatever loosely constructed plot gets buried in a wash of the screen writer's own prescient cleverness and some production designer's fetishistic vision of the ""mind of a killer"". SAW isn't as bad as either of the two films mentioned above (a movie has to have ambition for that, which SAW doesn't), but I can't help thinking that Hollywood dragged the fetid lake of quickie psych-horror flicks so they could make a few bucks on the Halloween crowds marching through the theaters over the weekend looking for knee-jerk thrills and high volume musical stings. And if SAW is sold out there is always THE GRUDGE. 3/10."

","genius, absolutely genius. Horror Fans will go nuts for this brilliant, wickedly dark thriller. Homage is paid to everything from Evil Dead II, to Todd Mcfarlenes Spawn, and obviously, to Seven. And that seems to be the biggest criticism of Saw, that its just a big rip off of Seven, well its not. while it focuses on a similar idea- a killer tries to make profane people see the light by torturing them mentally and physically- but these films are very different in there execution and story telling style. The other comparison to seven, is that both Saw and Seven have surprise endings... well let me tell you this....<br/><br/>Wow. while seven's ending is very good, and a nice twist, its not all that shocking... but Saw will keep you guessing until the very end, it'll make you think you've figured it out over and over, but then prove you wrong.. not until the last few shots is the surprise revealed, and its quite a doosy.<br/><br/>If your looking to get the poop scared out of you this Halloween, or if your a horror film buff looking for a new favorite, go see this flick.<br/><br/>Writer/director James Wan has the potential to be the next Clive Barker, he really knows his horror, almost never going for the cheap scares (thats when instead of working towards a moment of fright, a guy in a halloween costume with a knife pops out of nowhere and chases the double D blond.) and his horrific and yet sickly entertaining methods of death throughout Saw are absolutely inspired. so Kudos to James Wan, i cant wait to see whats next from this guy."
"hoelo","9","0","0","1 November 2004"," Stylishly Reminiscent of Seven
","Saw is an interesting movie that is, stylishly, an amalgamation of what one sees in other films. In a sense, the film is very reminiscent of films such as Seven, Along Came a Spider, The Bone Collector, etc.. The movie is dark, dirty and ugly. Flashbacks are interspersed with the stories of the victims both for illustration and also as shock value. The great thing about Saw is how deviously simple a story it is. Saw is no 'onion' with layers and layers of plot and sub-plot to twist the mind and confuse the viewer. Instead, it is a very direct movie that presents the viewer with a brutally effective story.<br/><br/>However, this is also a weakness. I found both the beginning and the end of Saw to be extraordinarily good; however, the middle was quite lumbering and distracting. It is as if Whammel did not quite have enough in mind to flesh the story out to full length. Instead, certain scenes are rehashed without adding anything really new. The viewer learns little tidbits here and there by viewing the same scenes from a different perspective; however, there is not enough of a difference to make the viewer step back mentally and say ""Hey, wait a minute.. I thought... "".<br/><br/>While I have commented on the style, one cannot rate a movie without commenting on the acting. A friend of mine and I have a debate going about whether Cary Elwes is intentionally trying to 'camp it up', or is in fact severely out of place in a horror movie. The jury is still out for me. Having long been a fan of his work in comedies (Princess Bride, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Hot Shots, etc), I am hesitant to simply say he did a poor job.. However, few scenes in particular seem to support this theory; these are scenes in which the audience at my showing laughed. However, coming out, I heard people discussing whether or not those scenes were SUPPOSED to be funny; no one seemed quite sure. Combined with Danny Glover's *terrible* acting, it does seem possible that parts of the movie were rushed (understandably with a budget < $10 million).<br/><br/>All in all, though, Saw is a very effective movie if you can be a little patient in the middle. The end of the movie makes the whole thing soooo worthwhile; you will leave the theatre grinning your ears off. I am thrilled that Saw 2 has already been announced for Halloween 2005, what with the movie making a profit in its first weekend of over 80% of its production costs. Time will tell if Saw 2 will be able to preserve the magic of the first without giving in to 'sequelitis'."

But acting and holes aside, this story is just riveting. <br/><br/>Everyone is comparing this movie to Se7en. I think they are completely different. Se7en had more gore, and much better acting. But Se7en was slow at times and this movie doesn't have a slow moment. <br/><br/>This movie is also extremely unique. Can you think of a movie in which a killer did no killing? Instead he makes his victims kill themselves or other people in very elaborate and twisted scenarios. His whole purpose is to punish people who don't appreciate their lives. <br/><br/>Ebert and Roeper trashed this movie. Sundance loved it. I loved it and IMDb users loved it. I think that's enough to convince you to go see it. You won't regret it. In fact I am pretty sure you will end up buying the DVD.<br/><br/>My rating is 9/10"

","Saw has it's flaws but when you look at the budget COME ON. It was the directors first movie and it's better than Jeepers creepers and Blair witch I see big things for James Wan. Not just a one movie low budget wonder like Blair Witch was. The movie has over acting at it's best but it made the movie really entertaining. It was also very funny in some parts. The gore reminded me of Dario Argento horror movies without the great camera work, not many of his movies made money, this one will. I've seen tons of low budget horror movies and this one kicked ass. I can name so many horror movies that are worst then this. All the people hating this movie are not horror fans they don't like horror movies. They only like the big Hollywood horror movie or a horror movie with hype (Blair Witch). I can say that this movie isn't the SHOWGIRLS OF 2004 and it deserves the 7.5 rating and the mixed reviews on ROTTEN TOMATOES."
"vaebeneequus","10","0","0","1 November 2004"," Awesome!
","This movie will chill any audience right to the bone. A serial killer is on the loose. However he is not like any serial killer we have ever met. He plays his victims in the most sick and twisted way imaginable. He never kills his victims, but causes them to kill one another. His games feed off man's most basic and primal instinct: survival. The story opens with a man, Adam, who awakens to find himself chained to a pipe in a grungy basement. He is not alone however. Across the room is Dr. Lawrence Gordon, another abductee in the same predicament. Lying in between them is the bloody corpse of a man, with a .38 caliber weapon lying besides him. Each is given instructions via an audio tape, to the rules of the killer's sinister game. Bottom line? Kill or be killed. This movie was sick; sick and brilliant!! Not since The Silence of the Lambs have I seen a script that tight and so well written. The way Adam and Lawrence try to reason their way out of their seemingly inescapable predicament was so terrifying and fun at the same time. The bond they create is only matched by their rising suspicions of one another as time is running out. The killer, nicknamed Jigsaw, plays the characters in his game perfectly, just as he plays the audience. We are as much a prisoner to Jigsaw's games as both Adam and Lawrence. As the clock ticks down to the final hour, so does the tension, and we are practically ready to leap from our seats. This is what classic horror movies should do and Saw does it perfectly. AWESOME!"
"Uncle Buck","10","0","0","1 November 2004"," Best psychological horror film in years.
","SAW proves you don't need a multi-million dollar budget and heaps of special effects to make a great film. It's more psychologically graphic than visually, and the great ending won't be guessed by anyone (unlike the Sixth Sense which about half the audience figured out 20 minutes into the film). SAW is a slick film with the lead writer also being the lead actor. There's virtually no big names in it, but that helps it more than anything. This film would flop with big-name actors and Hollywood cash behind it, because it would have been formulaic. Better than Sixth Sense, better than Seven, better than Unbreakable. Jigsaw masks should be a big seller for Halloween 2005."

The acting was good for the most part and the jigsaw killer was a pretty creative character. The jigsaw's methods were pretty disturbing, especially the girl with the reverse bear trap on her mouth. I liked the clown manikin and the voice kind of reminded me of Sweet Tooth from ""Twisted Metal Black"" which was pretty cool.

"sixtwentysix","Null","0","0","1 November 2004"," Wasted potential - Horrible acting
","This movie had such promise, with an interesting trailer (which if you've seen you've pretty much seen the entire film) and an interesting premise they easily squander all of this with poor acting, worse editing and just an overall unpolished film experience. If you're reading this review, you've probably already read the premise so let's move right to the good and bad of this film. <br/><br/>Bad - First, the casting of Carry Elwes was the first strike against this movie, his overacting is not only hammy, it's just plain laughable. Need proof? See this film in a theater and check out how many people laugh at parts that are neither funny or meant to be scary. Danny Glover's character is decent but completely out of place. He disjoints the film but does add a bit of excitement into the climax. The pacing of the film felt entirely disjointed, you weren't sure the order of real time events and some of the plot seemed a bit ignorant. This film was not as smart as it thought it was. Comparisons to Se7en really should not have been made because it doesn't really even approach the level of intensity Se7en does. It's truly hard to care for ANY of these characters so I suppose in a way, the killer is the anti-hero of the film.<br/><br/>Good - Overall look of the film was gritty and honestly, the climax was predictable and unsatisfying but very tense. This is one of those ""don't ruin the ending"" films. But unfortunately they take a decent one shot script and decide to make a franchise out of it. How Hollywood. Overall this film is worth a single watch for horror fans and maybe even some discussion after but not much else. 6/10"
"Yngperfrmr@hotmail.com","8","0","0","31 October 2004"," Great thriller!! ****SPOILERS****
","Oh Wow! I remember reading about this movie a while ago in EW and just knew I would have to go see it. The trailers on TV only made me want to see it more. Even though I missed opening night, I still got to see it in a crowded theatre the next night. The energy in the audience was great - everyone was so into this movie that it was dead silent unless people were screaming or whispering ""oh my god"" when something crazy was about to go down. Although the whole movie maintained a dark mood, there were some scenes that stood out as being some of the most disturbing situations I have ever seen. The first that comes to mind is that poor woman who had that device on her jaw that would essentially split her face open in an instant if she didn't retrieve the key. I thought the machine would gradually open her mouth --- needless to say me and the rest of the audience jumped out of our seats when ""Jigsaw"" demonstrated what would happen when the machine was triggered. Not only did this thing spring open fast, it opened so fast on the dummy's head that it basically exploded!! We were all as terrified as the woman in the movie! Another scene that messed with my head was when Whannell had to search his pitch black apartment for an intruder with nothing but a camera flash to temporarily light his path. And then when the doll started laughing!!! Oh man, I was too through! <br/><br/>Yeah there was some overacting in the end and yeah I was upset that no one ever just shot the bad guy when they had the chance, but overall, I think the movie will be worth the 20 bucks when it comes out on DVD. it aimed to be a dark thriller and for me it was just that. Not to mention, the plot twists were so unpredictable (i mean, Sing getting shot after stepping through that trap? no one saw that coming. Not to mention the ""dead guy"" in the bathroom was Jigsaw!!!) --- by the way, I felt so bad for Whannell in the end:-( But at least Dr. Lawrence had help on the way right? ...right?? well maybe not.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars"

","Saw (5/10)<br/><br/>I usually don't make user comments on a movie, but the great reviews for this film must be remedied.<br/><br/>It is quite refreshing to see a, well, ""fresh"" concept hit theaters near you. In that realm of movie-making, ""Saw"" is a smash-hit. The plot line, well covered by other reviewers, will keep you guessing until the very end. There are a decent amount of plot holes, too many to make the storyline a 10, but not enough to take away your suspense of disbelief.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Saw"" is the acting and camera-work. There are some scenes acted so poorly in this movie that I could have sworn I was watching ""Detour"" again. If a film bases itself around two characters and devotes itself to making the audience care about them, the director better find some good actors. ""Saw"" failed miserably in this regard. Why not let Danny Glover have one of the main roles? Why not find the guy who voiced Alf and let him have a main role with Ernest? It would have turned out better than this. Truly horrible acting that completely takes you out of the scene. And even if the acting somehow keeps you compelled, the laughter from the audience at the pathetic ""emotional"" scenes will make sure you lose interest in whether these characters survive. In fact (Spoiler), I even forgot one of the main characters escaped at the end of the movie--I just didn't care.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A great story with horrible execution. I know horror fans haven't had a decent story to work with since ""The Ring,"" but this acting was flat-out inexcusable.<br/><br/>Recommendation to avoid. Hard to laugh at because of the story, but hard to take seriously because of the actors...not a lot of fun to be had here."
"JamesCanz","10","0","0","28 October 2004"," The Incomparable Movie
","If you haven't seen Saw, or at least have, this is the review you are going to want to read. For some of the illiterate people out there, incomparable means so outstanding as to be beyond comparison, or unsurpassed. There's no definition that could greater fit the movie. This review will include no spoilers for the fact that if you plan on seeing this movie, knowing what happens would be the worst thing for you. Let's focus on some of the great feats of Saw.<br/><br/>First of all, there haven't been any good horror/thriller movies out in so long. I'd have to say I did enjoy the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this is a whole different movie. Mostly everyone knows how the storyunfolds. Adam and Dr. Gordon wake up in a place that is a mystery to them, as well, another mystery is how they got there, who put them there, and most importantly why.<br/><br/>Throughout the 2 characters going back and forth trying to figure what is going on, a series of events if brought up to help you piece together the puzzle. But this is definitely one movie that you will never know what happened until the grande finale, and let me tell you, this had one of the best endings I have ever seen in a horror/thriller movie, even in any movie. There are SOME plot holes, but for most of the part, everything falls together perfectly...<br/><br/>As for the violence/gore factor, it is indeed a horror movie, and therefore is a semi/good amount in it. Enough to make a little kid throw up, but almost not enough to satisfy die-hard horror fans. Overall, I guess that would be an opinion question because I did hear about people throwing up when seeing it. <br/><br/>Everyone sees movies their own way. That's why you get a lot of different opinions on if a movie is scary or not. Unlike cheap horror movies nowadays, Saw uses many different styles to keep you interested, or furthermore to ""attract"" you more into the movie. Watch any horror movie and the only reason it would be scary is because you know that person or something is going to jump out, you just don't know when, and when it does, it always seems to make you jump, but not in Saw. The environment of the movie is the creepy part, with good camera work and lighting every now and then, the movie is a constant chill.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think Saw has the perfect twists and turns waiting to be unraveled. When I first saw Scream many and many years ago, I thought that was crazy. How there were 2 killers, but to Saw, that is nothing, nothing at all. The end is breathtaking and jawdropping. It will leave you speechless, but at the same time wondering, and putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. Seven can't compare with this movie. The only thing Seven has on this is the cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey (and of course the acting.)<br/><br/>So go see Saw, it's worth every penny of the ticket price, and if you're looking for the horror film of the year, here it is."
"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","Null","0","0","31 October 2004"," something missing
","My expectations for ""Saw"" were reasonably high. I have been disappointed in the weak period horror had been in during the late-90's, and have begun to see a shift in the execution of horror in the early-21st century. ""28 Days Later"" and a few other recent horror films have re-set the bar once again on the visual and psychological levels of the genre. Things are changing, and I expected ""Saw"" to ride that same wave. In a lot of ways ""Saw"" really works, as it rekindles the memory of ""Seven"" and all of the twisted gruesome killings devised therein. It also works decently well as it deals with the isolation of the two major characters. The interplay between the two is mostly interesting. The major problem of the film is that it gets claustrophobic. Or should I say, the film plays out as if the first twenty minutes solely devoted to screen time in that isolation was too much for the audience to handle and we just needed a change. This isn't the case really. I think the build up of tension is really the kind of horror that was key in this film. Throwing in a myriad, and occasionally poorly segued, flashbacks really felt kind of awkward. The shift of focus seemed somewhat unnecessary. I think what really worked for this film was its simplicity, and that big question mark that plagued its main characters. Overall I did enjoy this film. It was hardly in the league of Fincher's ""Seven"", but I really don't feel that I wasted my hard earned cash."

With two men chained at opposite ends of a filthy bathroom and a suicide victim in the middle any movie goer knows they are in for a surprise, and they are. It is more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror but it's all good, the only downside is Danny Glover is put to waste and it's all too relative to seven, but the plot twists and an amazing twist at the end make up for all of that. The best part about everything in this film is that it all fits together beautifully, I know that all I am doing is promoting this movie and how amazing it is but I do not want to give anything away, see this movie!"

","I went into ""Saw"" with hopes of a thriller/horror movie that would challenge my mind and my stomach. Although it succeeded fairly well at the latter, it completely failed in the former. After hearing several reviews lauding the performances by Danny Glover and Cary Elwes, I had also hoped to witness a finely acted movie. Elwes had the chance to shine -- spending most of the movie in a secluded room with only one other actor present (who, as silly as it seems, put in one of the better performances in the movie...and he was the screenwriter of the movie, not a professionally trained actor). What Elwes gives us is an over the top (not in the Oscar worthy way) performance that at times, caused the audience to laugh out loud. An actor such as himself should know better than to go overboard on the whole ""slipping sanity cries and yells"". Glover's character was not given the best lines, either. At one point he laughably dedicates catching the Jigsaw murderer on behalf of his fallen comrade...once again, rather over the top. This brings me to another point...what was the significance of Glover's character? And so we might be able to disregard Glover's performance as a fault of the script, but Elwes's performance was just plain terrible. A disturbingly thought out concept, ""Saw"" fails miserably in its presentation. If you want a horror/thought provoking movie that isn't so mainstream and ""Hollywooded Up"", I would suggest renting something along the lines of ""Session 9"". ""Saw"" 2 out of 5"

This movie probably has the best ending in a horror movie I have ever seen. Yes, I loved this film, and I am very glad I SAW it.

I know that there are some sick people out there, but come on, it's really far fetched, i believe. Anyways, the ending did help pick it up, but it seemed like too little too late. It just seemed like, if you didn't figure everything out by the end, they force fed you the truth and that left me more confused than if they wouldn't have done it.

"bgfield","10","0","0","31 October 2004"," An original, highly scary psychological horror flick
","If your idea of a horror movie is a guy who just wont die chasing around a bunch of idiot teenagers with those jump-out-at-you-and-make-you-scream scenes that so many horror movies rely on these days, save yourself your money and don't see Saw. If you're looking for a unique horror film (unique, despite some similarities to Seven) with plenty of twists, this may be the best eight bucks you ever spend.<br/><br/>The first two minutes of this movie take place in almost total darkness. In most movies, when there's a scene that takes place in darkness, it's bright enough for the audience to make everything out; the darkness is more implied. In Saw, you'll barely see a thing until the lights go on. A small touch, but I liked that a lot. You'll quickly realize this movie isn't like others as a big chunk of it takes place in one room.<br/><br/>Before I get ahead of myself, let me break down the basic plot. Two men wake up in a room, chained up by the leg on opposite sides. One of them, a doctor, believes he knows of the person that's responsible. A killer - though technically he hadn't ever killed anyone - despises people who take their lives for granted, so he places them in sick trials where their fate relies heavily on their desire to remain alive. In the case of Adam and Lawrence - the two men in the room - Lawrence has to kill Adam, or his wife and daughter will die. There's little more to be said without spoiling parts of the plot. I feel it's always best to see a movie knowing as little as possible about it.<br/><br/>As I said above, there are very few (though some) jump-out-at-you scenes. Saw is more a psychological horror. There's not some scary guy with a knife following the main characters wherever they go. It's a movie where if you were to imagine yourself in the situation of the main characters, you would be truly terrified. There's nowhere to run, nobody to get help, no way to stop the man trying to end your life. The only way out is to do what he says.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes with fast, jerky camera movements that you'll likely get sick of two seconds after you see them. Though this camera trick is used too much, it could have been used a lot more and I'm sure everyone's thankful that it wasn't. I've heard complaints about the acting from Carry Elwes, but I didn't notice it. There's also a rather major plothole that I can't go into without spoiling the movie, but to be honest it didn't bother me at all. Otherwise, there's little to complain about with this movie. When seeing it, my friend said he wished there was more gore, so that's another thing to take note of if all you want from a horror movie is blood and guts (though, don't worry, there is definitely some gore).<br/><br/>Typically, I don't enjoy horror movies. I find them for the most part to be unoriginal money-makers, that rely too heavily on special effects. Saw is most definitely an exception, and despite many mixed reviews, I'm confident it'll go down as a classic, remembered in years to come as movies such as Seven and Silence of the Lambs. You may love it or you may hate it, but it's one of the most original horror movies to come out in years, and for that fact alone it's worth seeing at least once."

","Having see ""The Grudge"" a couple of days before, I welcomed the opportunity to watch ""Saw,"" as a more psychological, rather than supernatural, thriller.<br/><br/>Although I did not think the film was great, I liked the main idea, and didn't find most of the twists and turns to be predictable to the extent that I groaned when they'd occur. At the least, I wasn't spending my viewing time thinking about what would ""obviously"" happen next, because there were definitely some surprises in there. <br/><br/>But while the idea of two men waking up trapped in a dingy bathroom while a puppetmaster pulls their strings was a good one, the performances were generally not that good. They were passable, but the dialogue is very poor, and no one was going to parlay that crappy script into an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The psychological thriller styles itself after ""Se7en"" and ""The Cube"" but the execution pales by comparison. (although the dialogue in ""The Cube"" wasn't exactly fresh). I thought it was probably worth full price admission for the story, but the dialogue will likely keep you from truly being drawn completely into the film."

The plot was much too shallow to support the depth of the twist and I never really got to know the characters as much as I wanted to. On many occasions, the substandard acting distracted me from the anxiety and panic I should have been feeling. There were also too many annoying fight scenes featuring hesitations that lead to the escape of the ""bad guy"". <br/><br/>It wasn't a waste of time, but I can't say I will rush out to buy the DVD when it's released."

","Hands down one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not because it is disturbing, in fact most of the violence is funny. Most of the film is funny for that matter and not in a good way. This movie is so bad, plot less and plodding (it's at least half an hour too long) that the entire theater was laughing when I saw this.<br/><br/>I can't really go into the inane plot here without ruining it for people who never saw the film. But SAW is just like The Ring in that it rips off a bunch of things that worked for other movies and images that ""should scare you"" and slaps it together in a souless movie. Also the acting is horrendous. Danny Glover's character is particularly brutal and Cary Elwes should win the William Shatner Award for over-acting."

","This movie has a good plot and a good flow. Unlike some movies, you don't get mixed up with the flashbacks. The set-ups that the jigsaw man reminded me of SEVEN's serial killer, not ripoffs, but just as clever.<br/><br/>There is some humor in odd places. You will find yourself laughing pretty hard and thinking at the same time if you should be laughing at all. At times, you won't know if the acting of Carey Elwes is so bad it is making you laugh or it is intended to be that way. Leigh Wannell is a pretty good new actor. Monica Potter and Danny Glover are the two biggest stars in the movie and they seem like second string.<br/><br/>So here it is... The thing that is missing in this movie is a CONNECTION with the characters. You really get no connection with them in any way. In SEVEN and the RING you felt a connection with the characters so you felt for them. In this movie, they don't really set up a connection with them, so you really don't come away from the movie caring what did or didn't happen to them"

Sure, there were a couple of intense scenes but nothing truly horrifying. I was a little bit disappointed because going into the movie, I thought ""Saw"" was going to be a Horror film, rather than the Crime-Thriller it ended up being.<br/><br/>End with the good: The writing and directing in my opinion was superb.

"tosucks","8","0","0","30 October 2004"," A Suspenseful, twisted, pseudomasterpiece
","This is the first film to be made by the production company; Twisted Pictures. I can certainly attest that not only is this an appropriate film to associate with the word twisted, it is a fine debut for all involved. This is indeed a twisted little indie flick that'll give you chills.<br/><br/>Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also penned the script) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes, in his best performance in years) have woken up in a dingy room that they've never seen before. They're both chained by their feet to thick pipes. There is a man in the middle of the room who has apparently blown his own brains out. He's holding a gun and a tape recorder. They each find a tape in their pockets, with instructions on what they have to do to escape alive. Let the games begin.<br/><br/>What follows is a nail-biting, tense cat and mouse game between the two prisoners, and their sadistic captor. Inter spliced between the scenes of the two in their grungy dungeon, are scenes that reveal the back stories of the killer, the captors, and the detective (Danny Glover, possibly the most underutilized actor working in Hollywood today) obsessed with finding the killer known only as 'Jigsaw'. The back story scenes are every bit as interesting as the scenes in the dungeon, if not more so. The film works so well because it keeps you guessing, and just when you think you've figured something out, the movie laughs in your face, and shows you what you thought was true to be completely false.<br/><br/>The real reason the film works so well, is because of the superb performances that unfold on the screen. Elwes and Whannell share an excellent chemistry, and not only play off each other extremely well, they both demonstrate a great sense of doubt of the other. The rest of the actors do a fine job as well. What makes the performances all the more astonishing, however, is that the director (James Wan), is a first time director. Wan demonstrates an eye for style that would be deemed impressive for a 20 year veteran director, much less a rookie. Wan manages to craft a very tense, very unsettling film. Much like Silence of the Lambs before it, Saw is a twisted, yet very substantial piece of work, and it has a moral that can apply to everyone at the end.<br/><br/>Speaking of the end, while the movie doesn't cheat the audience for the most part, there are a few plot holes in the movie that I just can't let go of. I won't reveal them here, but there a few definite: 'Um, excuse me, but just how the hell does that work' moments, especially during the movie's climax. <br/><br/>Furthermore, despite Wan's obvious talent behind the camera, there a few decisions in the movie that I find baffling. One, for example, is the mass amounts of comic relief, and lack of gore. When I saw the trailers, I was expecting a gruesome and dark excursion into the depths of depravity. What I wound up getting, however, was a fairly gruesome (although, really, there isn't as much blood as you'd expect from this sort of movie), suspenseful tale, with just a little too much dark comedic relief. Whannell's character does begin to grate with his constant one-liners by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There are also a few bizarre editing choices in the film too. For example, there is a car chase towards the end of the film that is so poorly thrown together; I wonder why they would even bother to include it in the movie, at all. I know that this movie was made on a shoestring budget and all, but this is just ridiculous! The whole chase is merely the faces of the drivers getting closer to the camera, in a clear fast forward of the film. They don't even show the cars on the road! It's so ridiculously cheesy, and feels distinctly out of place in a (mostly) serious thriller. Cheesy car chase aside, however, the director manages to get squeeze every penny of his budget, and puts it up on the screen in a surprisingly glossy manner.<br/><br/>The reason that semi-high profile actors such as Danny Glover and Cary Elwes agreed to do this film in the first place, for a low salary, is because of the strength of the script they read. The script is tight, filled with shocking twists and turns. The characters are all believable, and they say and do what most people would do (or what I think they would do, anyway) in whatever situation they are put in. However, with that said, the movie does fall into a few of the generic horror movie clichÃ©s, such as hiding the killer's face until the end, or having the killer looking at his victims from computer screens. Also, for some reason I find it quite doubtful that a killer with that much time on his hands would have the resources or the intelligence to pull off the elaborate schemes he sets up for his victims.<br/><br/>But I digress. The film for the most part is extremely intelligent, and doesn't pull too many punches. Most of the pieces fit, and considering some of the wretched thrillers to come down the pike lately (Taking Lives, anyone?), that's a lot more than recent thrillers can boast.<br/><br/>A word of caution however, this is not a film for a squeamish, and if you've ever closed your eyes in any movie, you will do the same in this movie as well. <br/><br/>Overall ****: If you like thrillers, this is one of the best in a long time, with a genuinely interesting plot, and deep, developed characters. It's funny, this movie has what a lot of big budget movies (Again, Taking Lives, I'm looking at you!) lack, Heart and Soul. I really look forward to see what else these talented rookies can pull off in future projects."

","I sit here and tell myself i will not pick this movie to pieces, much as I want to. In my short lifetime, i have seen thousands of films, and consider myself a fair judge of movie form.<br/><br/>That said, ""Saw"" is appalling. And intriguing. And nail biting. I have never, not once watched a movie with such laugh out loud bad acting, that actually kept my attention and had me riveted to the seat. It reminded me of a low-budget horror film made by college students, and acted by the students themselves. The problem is, only the writer acted in the film, the other roles filled by what I thouhgt were real actors. Cary Elwes put in a performance my High School drama teacher would have laughed at. It is not good in a thriller when the audience starts laughing during a tense, climatic scene.<br/><br/>OK, thats out of the way. Onto the rest.<br/><br/>The story is actually original. Sure, it steals from other films, but is not a complete knock off like ""The Grudge."" It is not a terribly engrossing, complex story. It has its twists and turns, but is told in a straightforward, flashback ridden type of way. <br/><br/>The scenarios the folks found themselves in were, to me, disappointing. They were short, and breezed through, and not all that gruesome. Now, the thought of having my jaw wrenched the wrong way definitely had me squirming, but it wasn't the gorefest its made out to be. By far the scariest part was the mannequin. <br/><br/>So the question you must ask yourself is this: Should I pay to see this movie. Regrettably, my answer is yes. The idea is so original, you have to see it. <br/><br/>I sit and wonder what this movie could have been if Al Pacino was in it.<br/><br/>6/10"
"brother_d_73","8","0","0","30 October 2004"," Seeing 'Saw'
","I've been looking forward to this movie for a while, and when I learned it was going to be released for Halloween weekend, I was ecstatic. I stumbled across an interview with director James Wan, and as he began describing the beginning of the man, he started giggling maniacally. I had to turn it off as I didn't want to ruin the movie for myself.<br/><br/>The film opens with two men - Adam (played by screenwriter Leigh Wannel) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) locked in a dingy, dirty bathroom. They're barefoot and chained to pipes in opposite corners of the room. Between them, face down and just out of reach, is a man with a gun in one hand and a mini-tape recorder in the other. Oh, and there's a bullethole in his head. The story revolves around the two living and chained up men, how they ended up in this bathroom, how they're going to try to get out, and why.<br/><br/>For a first-time director, Wan hits most of his marks. I remember thinking to myself that the film did drag once and could have used a bit more judicious editing to pick up the pace. In contrast, in a sequence near the end of the film, the editing and pacing is jacked WAY up, and felt almost a bit forced, but necessary to keep the entire third act of the film from bogging down.<br/><br/>The brutality of this film is pervasive and definitely leaves an impression even after leaving the theater. The film is rated R, and the intensity of some of the violence (some seen, some implied) definitely leaves its mark. However, I never felt it was exploitive. I did find myself cringing, but I think I would have felt cheated if I didn't.<br/><br/>Danny Glover and Monica Potter also appear in the film; the former as a police detective pulled into the story and the latter as Dr. Gordon's wife. Glover turns in an atypical performance and watching his character fall into the drama was a treat. Potter, however, didn't seem to bring much that any other actress couldn't have brought to the project. This may not have been her fault, however - the character of the doctor's wife felt the least developed to me. (There is a moment at the end of the movie where the doctor's wife really could have done something very different than what she actually did in the film. I justify this to myself by saying that sometimes we watch movies to watch what other characters would do in adverse situations and see what they would do instead of ourselves, but still . . . I'm being intentionally vague here as I don't want to ruin anything about the film, but this didn't take anything away from the movie.)<br/><br/>There's sometimes a tendency to pack a lower-budget or independent movie's audio track with contemporary music or ""edgy"" soundtrack filler, and I was pleased to not hear much, if anything, like that here. The sound editing and sound mix of the movie worked very well. I don't even recall hearing any incidental music to distract me.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Saw. With the amount of twists and turns throughout the film, I'm eager to see if a DVD release includes any exciting special features (and there's a part of me that wants to know if any of the material excised from the film to bring the rating down from NC-17 to R might be included is worthwhile). If you can see the movie during it's theatrical, I'd recommend it.<br/><br/>A very well done movie, especially for a newcomer."

","SAW could possibly be the best horror/crime/thriller movie since the magically works of David Fincher when he created Se7en. SAW delivered in every way possible, from the intriguing plot, to the gruesome scenes of torture, to the moderately good acting. Did it live up to the hype? It did more than you ever thought.<br/><br/>Right off the bat we get into the problem where Adam (Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a bathtub in the dark chained up with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained up on the opposite side of the wall already awoken. The room is a rundown, drenched, shabby bathroom with a dead body lying in the middle of the room with a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Both men discover a tape in there pockets, and when they play them, the message says either to play my game or face both men discover tapes in their pockets, and the message is: Play my game, or face a grievous repercussion. Let the game begin!<br/><br/>The plot was something very fresh and unique. We haven't seen this kind plot in a very long time. The man behind all of this, which has been named 'Jigsaw,' is a one of a kind mastermind that puts his victims in a set scenario that makes them give up something for their life. It was highly enjoyable to see how Jigsaw came about with using flashbacks of his previous crimes, all remorseless in there own way.<br/><br/>I don't know if anyone else noticed, but the Muppet did have a symbol behind it, which is like Jigsaw is the ""Muppet Master"" and all the victims he picked are his Muppets. So in a way he controls them by giving them a choice to make, which is basically live or die.<br/><br/>What I can say made SAW standout was the setting. Everything was perfectly set so you could feel the dark, gloomy, creepy setting. In that bathroom, you actually felt like you were in another world, in another dimension, if you way. The whole movie felt dark, which created the perfect atmosphere throughout the whole movie, so you never actually felt like smiling during the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was far from perfect. An underused Danny Glover, who played the part of Detective David Tapp, didn't help the acting situation either. However, it was decent enough to get by in the movie, and the rest of the good things in the movie helped out cover the bad performances.<br/><br/>SAW in the end works out to be a very disturbing film that delivers in more ways than imaginable. SAW took us to a place where we haven't been in a long time, and it was refreshing to see a film with the likes of Se7en being made. SAW had one hell of an illogical ending, but I just didn't care, because it all made scene in the end. James Wan gave us one hell of a twisted movie, and after it was all said and done, SAW kills.<br/><br/>Story: A+ Acting: D+ Visuals: A Cinematography: A Overall: A- (Not an average)"

It's a total rip-off of movies the Seven and The Game, but nowhere near as good. Also, the director clearly aspires to produce music videos as there are way to many moments where all the action is sped up to a frantic pace (complete with spinning camera), backed by a thumping techno soundtrack - and this is supposed to be a psychological thriller??

","OK, as was probably the case with most horror fans, I have been looking forward to this since the early days of the Fangoria teasers and interviews.<br/><br/>I went in hoping for another indie classic and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Granted, it wasn't a classic, but it was a very clever film to say the least. All of the bad reviews on this page have obviously come from folks who cannot seem to follow the one simple rule that every horror fan must be held accountable to, and that is the requirement of suspending disbelief. If one can't observe this simple commandment, one shouldn't be watching horror movies.<br/><br/>Now, to the movie. As far as acting goes, I give it 1.5 out of 4 stars. Elwes and Whannell are simply atrocious. Even the staunchest supporters of horror films, which are notorious for bad thespians, cannot possibly justify the casting in this movie, although Whannell was the screenwriter and probably conned his way into his role. They just weren't convincing as characters. I simply couldn't connect with them. Danny Glover was the one high point, and his part was so small that it couldn't lift the others from their acting stupor. <br/><br/>The film itself was very original. A serial killer who, in the midst of a struggle between life and death himself decides to play God with his victims, allowing them the opportunity right their wrongs while coming to appreciate the value of life, is not the most original concept. However, the way he provides options for his victims seems to show us a sort of macabre compassion for his fellow humans. Each victim is given an option and clues as to how to escape his horrific puzzles, but it lies within each to determine down which path they will proceed. With nods to Argento (music and style) and some of the realism that we've come to expect from a Tobe Hooper film, the film seems to be another brick (albeit not quite a foundational support) in the rebuilding of the genre as a whole. It is films like this, which come out with balls to the wall suspense and no regards for the squeamish, that are going to be the savior of our beloved franchise. <br/><br/>Granted, we have a ways to go, but if little gems like this keep popping up every three or four months, and they continue to improve on each other's mistakes, then the future looks very bright indeed. <br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Robin Hood, The Crush, Liar Liar, all rather successful performances. But this was by far the worst acting I have seen in a long time. We're talking worse than Sofia Coppola in Godfather III. And I'm not even sure if it was intentional.

","Okay so in all fairness I watched The Grudge last week, which was absolutely freaky and VERY scary. I was looking for the same scares in this film but it definitely is more of thriller/suspense than horror. I liked the way the story is told and the visuals definitely set the mood. The colors and music are gripping, and you feel desperate by the time the characters/story reaches their/its climax. Elwes was a bit funny at times when he was supposed to come across stressed and worried. The guy playing Adam (sorry I didn't look his name up yet) was very good. I liked him and actually found myself cheering him on as opposed to the character of Lawrence. The graphics aren't very gruesome, which makes me wonder how much they edited to bring it down from a NC-17 rating--if it was indeed ever going to get the NC rating. I'll be looking forward to the (hopefully) unrated DVD with deleted and extended scenes (again a hope of mine). It definitely has the ""feel"" of Seven but I would've liked to hear more of the music rather than feel it. There were some great songs in Seven but I can't really remember any songs used in Saw. I just remember the melody, no lyrics. The twist was entertaining but a tad predictable.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a good, suspenseful, ""who's the bad guy?"" movie then this is it. Very entertaining thriller that was worth the ticket price but like I mentioned above I'll be looking forward to its DVD release."

","If you want to be shocked, and see a lot of gore this is for you. If you want to see some twists and turns that don't simply come from past thrillers, go see it. If you want a tightly wound movie, don't go. Finally, if you want to see another Seven , don't bother.<br/><br/>First of all it is not a film noir. The detectives are not the main characters. Secondly, the acting is somewhat disappointing. Danny Glover's character is initially a lot like Freeman's in Seven so I won't blame him. Overall, though the movie was worth seeing if you like the genre (more of a suspense thriller than a horror). You will come out thinking, ""Okay, at least it tried to be different."" I wish Wan didn't bother with those insanely fast edited sequences between scenes, and it would have been much improved with a better score. But I'm happy he did take risks.<br/><br/>Don't go into the movie with great expectations, and you may be pleasantly surprised (at least as pleasant as a film such as this allows). Of all the movies out right now, I think it might just be worth it (although I have yet to see Ray)."

","The premise was good, the idea was good, the opening was good...that was about it. Two guys chained in a bathroom are given a certain amount of time (Like 8 hours I think) to find a way out. one is told that he has to kill the other to save his family, the other just has to escape. It was a good idea. But the two spend the said amount of time reliving flashbacks of the past few days. Sitting there. On the floor. Doing nothing.<br/><br/>Sure the flashbacks were to tell backstory, but then again they didn't really tell too awful much about what was going on. Some psycho was going around making people kill themselves. Same psycho has them locked up. Then flash to a memory that isn't even theirs, but an ex-cop's (danny glover) who lost his partner (the only character I really liked) to this guy.<br/><br/>What really annoyed me most with this movie, however, is the terrible acting. Seriously...Elwes should stick with what he's good at. Pure simple comedy. In the few serious roles he has played he has done terrible in.<br/><br/>If you want to save money, don't watch. If you're into bad movies that try too hard and flop really bad, go watch. For me, this movie gave me a headache more than it did anything else."

","I have been beyond psyched to see this flick since I saw the previews for it during the abysmal ""Open Water"". And when I found out it was opening Halloween weekend, I figured, could this be the best sign ever? This movie must be kickin'.<br/><br/>Well, I saw ""Saw"". Now, I will give it up for James and Leigh, because the concept and how they shot the movie was awesome. They're VERY creative and they're wicked talented when it comes to bringing stuff together. And I loved the industrial score by two of the former Nine Inch Nails men.<br/><br/>But something was just......missing. I liked it and thought that it was pretty good for the most part, but it just didn't have the kick I had been promised in ads and in reviews. Even though the elements are all right, they just need to learn how to deliver.<br/><br/>Was it the absolute most scary and bloody movie I have ever seen? Eh. Definitely not the absolute final word in horror and gore movies.<br/><br/>Really, my biggest gripe that I can think of now would be the acting. Cary. Cary, Cary, Cary. What has happened to you, Cary Elwes? You used to be this awesome actor. I mean, you were ""The Princess Brides""'s Westley, for God's sake. To say that his acting was the worst I have ever seen wouldn't even cut it. I could have acted better, and probably would of been a better guy. His screaming towards the end just made me red with embaressement. I'm sorry, I love you, but not like this. Just stick to comedies.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a movie to go see this very spooky Halloween weekend, I guess this would be decent enough. If you're a person who doesn't handle horror well, you'll probably freak out halfway through it. If you're a hardcore horror fan like me however, you might not flip THAT much.<br/><br/>But I would say though for at least one viewing, this movie would be alright.<br/><br/>Let's just hope the upcoming ""Hush"" for Universal these two fine up and comers (yes, I'd still say they are promising guys) are making is just a bit better."

","A sadistic serial killer known as 'Jigsaw' by the police is kidnapping people to teach them the value of life by making them choose between losing a part of their body and/or hurting someone else to survive. One of his victims is a young man named Adam (Leigh Whannell) who awakens in a bathtub to find that he is chained by the leg to a pipe in the basement of a crumbling building. Adam sees another person chained on the other side of the room; his name is Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). They both discover a dead man, who committed suicide, laying between them in a pool of blood with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. Dr. Gordon finds a tape in his pocket with orders to kill Adam within eight hours or both men will be killed, and Dr. Gordon's family will also be killed. A police detective named Tapp (Danny Glover) is on the trail of Jigsaw, and he is trying to capture this serial killer before he plays his murderous game again. As time goes by, both men try to figure a way out without someone dying. Jigsaw has left two dull metal hacksaws for his victims to use, which can't cut through their steel chains, but they can cut through flesh and bone. This is one psychological thriller that will put you on the edge of your seat at times. The movie shows what a madman can make you do to others and yourself, when your life is at stake. The storyline was good, but as a horror movie, it won't scare you that much. It does have a surprise ending. (Lions Gate Films, Run time 1:40, Rated R)(5/10)"

","Let's pretend the preview audience wasn't populated with juveniles who wanted to see blood instead of a good story. <br/><br/>Saw is a strong effort featuring an incredible ensemble cast, and Elwes' strongest work as an actor. Dimming down the ""superman/british hero"" side of his performances, and toning down the storybook side of his character, Elwes steals the movie away with his performance. <br/><br/>To give away too much of this film would be criminal. See it during the day, so you can step out into the sunlight and appreciate it all the more. That, and it will minimize the juvenile comments or chants of ""SAW! SAW!

","I had the chance to view SAW last night at a sneak review presented by a local ""hip-hop"" station and a local ""alternative newspaper."" I was hyped to see this film because it seemed to be something original. I could not have been more wrong. Take Se7en, add the Usual Suspects, toss in one fubar way to die, add some cheesy camera work, bad lighting, and a touch of comedy and you have SAW. That this movie is something original is laughable. That this movie is scary is hilarious. The film drags at the beginning, hits a high note with the Jawtrap, and then falls flat for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I read the article in Script Magazine that Leigh Whannel penned...he wrote about using flashbacks to tell the story. And even had the gall to hope that this film was on the same level as MEMENTO! Memento was a film that remained one step ahead of the viewer. Memento, as did the Usual Suspects, kept the viewer on edge until the end where all was revealed. SAW, on the other hand, laid everything out on the table. Nothing was left to doubt. There was no astonishment at the film's final scene. <br/><br/>These two cats from down under hope to take everyone for a ride...perhaps optimistic about SAW's chances at the box office given the grudge's take last week and that SAW is opening on Halloween weekend. This film is not for the intelligent...for you will have the entire story figured out before you finish your popcorn and drink. This film is aimed at the typical movie goer - someone that suspends all disbelief and immediately forgets the aspect of any film they have ever seen once the credits roll. <br/><br/>Jason Wan wasted his money on film school. He should have bought a camera and just started making movies. Shoot, edit, re-edit. Learn by doing. Film school is a waste of time and it didn't do this movie any good.<br/><br/>Leigh Wannell did a number on whoever approved this script. It's one thing to watch movies like Se7en and The Usual Suspects and then think ""I can do that."" It's totally another to actually do it. You have to watch them over and over again and then read the scripts. And then re-read the scripts. You have to pick up on how the stories were told and then realize that is has already been done. The killer is preaching!!!! Se7en did it. The killer selects people to serve as examples of the his message!!!! Se7en did it. The clip montage at the end that's supposed to bring the film altogether!!!! The Usual Suspects did it. <br/><br/>Turning the film into Hawaii Five-O meets Hannibal Lector and they go to eat breakfast with The Manson Family....come on!<br/><br/>This movie insulted my intelligence and almost bored me into a coma.<br/><br/>I am saddened by the movie watchers that were scared, flabbergasted, and even cheering during the final moments.<br/><br/>Of course, the filmmakers are delighted by these people as they are the ones that will be filling in the seats this weekend. <br/><br/>My hope is that the drop-off for the second week's take is similar to the percentage drop-off comparable to the hulk or catwoman. Word of mouth broke those films and I can only hope it does the same to this one. Yes, SAW is bad enough to be included with these two duds.<br/><br/>There is nothing scary, frightening, surprising, or even puzzling about SAW. If you can make toast than you are too smart for this film. And if you need the film explained to you than you are the target audience."

","I just ""saw"" this movie last night, and I've got to admit, it was really entertaining. Just sit back and let the movie take you for a ride, a very wild ride! I can see many people comparing this film to Seven, but it's not quite as intelligent or haunting as that film. Just the fact that the two can be compared is quite the compliment. It felt more to me like ""Cube"" meets ""Seven"", although leaning much further toward the later. With the exception of one glaring story hole, which I can't reveal without spoiling, it is fairly well thought out, and a few of the scenes are wonderfully shot and arranged. I see a bright future for writer/director Wan and his film is most likely destined to be a fan favorite. I also found it refreshing to see a very racially diverse cast being used. Hopefully we'll see more of this type of mixed cast in other films."

I'll initiate this by saying the film was a bona fide delight, for I was immersed in laughter for at least 75% of the taxing 1 hour and 40 minutes. I hate to express this it, but there IS basis we have not seen Cary Elwes for a while (Twister, perhaps?)  'Saw' definitely confirms why!<br/><br/>Was it a preconceived notion for this movie to be scary? I can only speculate it was (scary) for people who had not taken their Tegrital in a few days! Despite the half-way decent plot, this collaboration should have never been allowed to come into fruition. If the objective was for spectators to imagine they were a piece of a tangible jigsaw puzzle: mission accomplished, for I left the theatre in disarray.<br/><br/>The incessant camera work, very much reminiscent of Natural Born Killers, became almost unbearable.

The plot is fresh, our killer is original, and of course there are twists to keep you interested and guessing through the entire movie.<br/><br/>I would give SAW a perfect score for originality in the thriller class, but some of the plot elements were intentionally exaggerated to help decive the viewer. Its best to lead the viewer in one direction, but without adding or embleshing elements that will be unexplainable after the final conclusion, which sadly there were a few.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, you are missing out on a true gem!<br/><br/>9/10"

","*thanks to my friend who helped get me quotes for this* *my review at the bottom*<br/><br/>So this guy named Adam wakes up in a bathtub. He gets out and finds himself in a pitch black room and the lights are off. There is another guy in the room and he tells Adam to just shut up for a second. Then the lights turn on, and the other guy in the room reveals that he is 'Dr. Gordon.' They are both chained by their ankles to metal pipes on opposite sides of the room from each other. They have no idea who put them where they are, or where they are, or why anyone would do this too them. There is a dead guy laying in the middle of the room, with a gun in one hand and a cassette player in the other. Adam finds a cassette in his pants. He takes his shirt and manages to pull the player towards him. Adam plays It and it tells him that:<br/><br/>'You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do players see when they look into the mirror? Now I see you as a strange mix of someone angry, yet how pathetic, but mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch your self die today Adam, or are you going to do something about it'<br/><br/>Adam has no idea what the tape means and has Dr. Gordon (I'm going to call him Gordon from now on) throw him his tape. It says:<br/><br/>'Dr Gordon. This is your wakeup call. Every day of your working life you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. (Dr. Gordon is a doctor) Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this gameis to kill Adam. You have until 6:00 to do it. There is a man in the room with you (the dead guy), when there is that much poison in your blood, the only thing left to do is kill yourself. *guy on recording coughs loud enough that your obviously supposed to notice it) There are ways to end this. Look around you, just rememberX Marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00, Allison and Diana will die (Gordon's wife and daughter), and I will leave you in this room to rot. Just remember, follow your heart<br/><br/>Gordon sees a heart drawn on the toilet in the room. Adam finds a bag containing 2 saws inside the toilet. He tosses one saw to Gordon and they both go to work trying to cut through their chains. They both discover that the chains are too thick to cut through, and give up. Adam gets p***ed and throws his Saw at a mirror and breaks part of it off. Gordon notices that the person who put them in the room wants them to cut through their feet, not the chains. Gordon says that he thinks he knows who put them in the room, only because he was a suspect.<br/><br/>Gordon explains a flashback where he is the suspect of several really nasty murders. One consisting of a guy in a razor wire cage who dies from blood loss because he gets cut so much when trying to get out, another consisting of a girl with a thing strapped to her head that will rip her jaw off once the timer runs out and must get it off by retrieving a key from her supposed-to-be-dead husband's stomach (she survives), and another where a guy wakes up in a room with glass on the floor and he's covered in a ""flammable substance"" and the ""key"" to get out of the room is in a safe, and the combination to the safe is written on the wall's of the room he's in. And the room is all dark so he can't see the walls, so he has to carry a candle around while he is covered in a ""flammable substance"" and try and read the numbers off the wall without catching himself on fire, and he steps on some of the glass and trips and burns himself to death.<br/><br/>The flashback ends and Adam starts thinking that Gordon is the one that put them in the bathroom, and could be the cause of all of this. Adam picks up part of the mirror he broke when he threw his Saw, and threatens to cut Gordon with it if he doesn't tell him what's going on. Adam notices the glass shard is part of a 2-way mirror and chucks rocks at the rest of the mirror until they discover a camera behind it<br/><br/>... ; )<br/><br/>I'm almost at the word limit (1,000) if you want the rest email me?<br/><br/>My Review: I would give this movie a B+. Some of the acting was down right bad (Adam acting like he died from poison was some of the worst acting I have ever seen) and they kind of rushed the end, though it did make it more interesting and fun to watch. The camera angles they used (the twisting and turning around the girl) was quiet cool, and something new. Any fan of horror movies should see this. If you are looking for ""The Grudge"" type of movie, where things pop out and make you jump as the sound shrieks loudly, this isn't for you. Nothing pops out, but this movie manages to be extremely scary without that (Though I could've gone without seeing the inside's of a guys stomach). Like I said, B+"

Your leg is chained. You cannot escape. How far would you go to survive? This is the main element of Saw, and the situtation we kick off from. Cary Elwes plays Dr. Lawrence, a man with marital problems and a mistress, now he must survive to save himself and his family. Leigh Wannel plays Adam, a voyeur who hasn't thought of his life to be anything special until today. Danny Glover plays Detective Tapp, a character not-unlike his previous role as Murtaugh from the Lethal Weapon series, he too hunts the killer.<br/><br/>From the first frames, Saw provides plenty of thrills and shocks for the unsuspecting viewer. The mood is constantly suspenseful, with a controlled color, creating a bleak Sevenish view of the room and world the characters inhabit. <br/><br/>Saw is not a violent movie. It's disturbing yes, but the violence level is surprisingly low, with very little blood or gore. A untypical decision to make in the current world with teen slasher movies creating the mass market of horror movies. The main power of SAW is it's atmosphere, constantly troubling and deeply twisted, it manages to create scares and genuine shocks without fancy cgi or blood splattering effects. Not since Seven has there been a movie with a atmoshpere like this, one can almost touch it.<br/><br/>Saw is a brilliant debut from first time director/writer James Wan, and hopefully we'll see more movies from this talented new filmmaker.<br/><br/>*****"

","Just finished watching it, and I think it's one of the better movies that I've seen in quite a while. Perhaps one of the best. <br/><br/>I've read quite a few reviews in various places where people complained about the pacing of the movie, personally there weren't any points where the movie dragged for me. <br/><br/>As for the acting, well... I've seen much worse. Yes, Cary Elwes has a tendency to go over the top at times, but that's pretty much his acting style. Not that he's a bad actor, he's just much better suited to comedy than drama. For my money, he's a terrific comedic actor. Was he miscast? I don't know. Maybe I'm biased in that I just love looking at the guy, heh, so I can forgive mistakes more easily than some. <br/><br/>The ending... ah what can I say about the ending? I'll say this. I LOVED it. LOVED it. Whether or not you ""saw"" it coming (ah, forgive the pun, I had to), I think it fit the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>The movie is made all the better given the low budget and relative inexperience of the writers/director. For a first effort, I think it's absolutely outstanding. <br/><br/>I think part of the problem people have with this movie is that they were expecting a gruesome horror, when I'd classify it more as a psychological thriller. For me, those are the best kind.<br/><br/>Regarding comparisons of this movie to Se7en, I don't think it's an apt comparison. Do they have a common meeting ground? Yes. So do a lot of movies that are vastly different from each other in execution and style.<br/><br/>One last comment, on the subject of plot holes. I've got three words - suspension of disbelief. Learn it, live it, love it. <br/><br/>C."

The film started with the sequence of answers and later send the questions to the audience. while we try to find out who really is behind the set up, the events take place inactual fact very differently then we all expect. if we could split this film in to three different parts as the start, the middle and the end then we can easily identify the up's and downs the film SAW. SAW had a good start i think. because the director gave you the responsibility to find out really what's happening to these characters. Coming to the middle part of the film, well disappointing for me, because the film was jumping events one on to the other in a very quick pace and while the film director should give more chance to understand the characters the film went back to how and why things got there. i also thought there was use of very bad dialogue. I thought the dialogue was too simple no sense of deep conversation and lack of feelings to release itself to show what they really felt like at that moment. coming to the end of the film i thought all the answers at the start came flashing back and some great twist in cinema term came to make this movie look too good. film SAW obviously will attract the young adults. in conclusion like with all typical ending comments, i advise you to watch this movie, i think you probably like it."

","****SPOILERS**** ****SPOILERS****<br/><br/>I liked this movie, interesting storyline, nice twist towards the end, acting was OK. Would have been nicer to have seen the previous people killed actually having a short role leading upto their demise. For example, the chap with the candlelight should have had a role like a delivery person, comes home, subsequently taken and then we find him in the small room. <br/><br/>But the storyline kept me going, following, nice touches with the effects and detail (dirty, dank WC, blood, dead body) and while not exactly frightening, the 'scary' moments were intriguing. I liked the moment where the doctor steps out his vehicle to make a call and while doing so the main guy approaches on all fours surreptitiously, keeping low behind another vehicle. <br/><br/>So I'd give this film 8 out of 10."
"Lev821","Null","0","0","19 October 2004"," What I saw, was good.
","I thought this would just be another average horror film, going for scares rather than story, and was pleasantly surprised as the story itself was the main strength of the film, and didn't need to resort to shock tactics. Without a credible plot, this would have collapsed, and even though the story is rather unrealistic and, I suppose, far-out, it is after all, fiction, and is allowed to be. This is one of the most enjoyable horror films I've seen in a long time. It wasn't too gory, and the performances were decent, and more importantly, it was kept fairly simple. There's no convoluted plot lines to fathom. These films are rare these days, although that's not for the want of trying, it's just that a lot of them are just average, basically, trying for scares rather than plot. Saw goes for story, and is much better for it. Certainly recommended."

","There hasn't been a decent psychological thriller since ""Se7ven"". Yet ""Saw"" has all the hallmarks of a grade A picture. With it's dim lighting, claustrophobic camera angles and a dark, grainy look.<br/><br/>The movie opens with our two lead characters awaking in a dark and dingy bathroom, chained at the ankles with a dead body lying between them. They have no recollection of how they ended up there. Then they discover tapes hidden in their pockets. Using a tape player situated in the dead bodies hand, they discover they are the pawns in a sick game concocted by the sinister ""Jigsaw"", who tortures his victims into killing themselves. Queue flashbacks of the killers previous victims, including a guy trapped in a maze of razor wire. <br/><br/>The movie is very fast paced, and uses extreme lighting for maximum effect. Take, for example, the young girl with the ""reverse bear trap"" on her head, which if she doesn't get it off, will rip her jaw off. As the sudden realisation dawns on her, the camera spins around, catching the immense tension and pure fear. The music score of the movie is bold and brash, very heavy metal, and adds another layer to this deeply complex movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't just about the shock value. Sure, the movie does contain some graphically violent scenes, and contains several shocks and scares, but it's also a clever and deeply intricate look into the bowels of the inner psyche of an insane criminal, with a sick and twisted pleasure of watching fellow humans suffer.<br/><br/>Over here, the movie was passed with an 18 certificate, with a few cuts. If you are a hardcore horror movie fan, the dark and grimy sets, the intriguing plot with it's many twists and turns and deliciously macabre story telling will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing right up to the very last frame. If, however, you are just your average movie goer, then I would recommend you steer clear of this movie.<br/><br/>The twist at the end of the movie does leave the door open for a sequel, but don't count on it. A movie this good really only will work once. A sequel would ruin the amazing originality behind it."

","I am not an easy person to please when it comes to films. I am picky, I gripe at minor points, I'll happily rant about something for hours. So it was an incredibly nice surprise to see this low budget shocker. Having gone to the cinema on a whim, I had the choice between this or Resident Evil 2. I stand by my choice. The acting, whilst a bit shaky, seemed to fit the mood of the film. The story was inventive, the bad guy the most interesting movie villain since Se7ens murderer. In fact, probably more interesting. The camera work was amazing, using fantastic techniques to highlight panic, and the film was filled with enough misdirection to keep me guessing throughout. And then we get to the ending. Wow. I'm not sure I've seen a better ending. As I was walking to the cinema, I was even moaning about conclusions in recent films, and how difficult it is to end a story in a satisfactory manner. But then having seen this, my faith is final acts has been restored. As the credits rolled in the cinema, I was sitting there, open-mouthed, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It took me most of the walk home, it was that good. Put simply, this is easily the best film made this year. And to not see it is an act of masochism. 10/10"

"theojhyman","7","0","0","18 October 2004"," Intense, scary & gruesome but goes a little OTT !
","Funny to see an American film come out in the UK well ahead of its US release - SAW is doing pretty well here in the UK. Starting off as a claustrophobic little horror film promises intensity and intrigue, it starts off well as a mystery, as both the viewer and the characters figure out where they are and what is going on. But when the film steps outside of its primary location - a dirty basement cellar - it tries to become a 'Se7en' style murder-mystery, going off at random tangents, introducing many new characters and spreading out its story over several locations, with images of ever-more gruesome murders, dead bodies and extreme trap situations. Some of them are clever, some scary, but others become silly and way over-the-top, both in the scenario and in the script. Anyway, it's still worth waiting around to find out what the hell is going to happen. Definitely more interesting than most horror films have been for a long time, and if you forgive the cheesy script, it's definitely worth watching although the detective part of the story lets it down (is it a horror film or a detective thriller ? - please choose one category - don't try to be both). This is also very gruesome, quite disturbing, and perhaps unique as it introduces the viewer to some disgusting images that have never been seen before in cinema. Go and see it. You may even want to see it a second time as it is crammed with a bit too much for its own liking. Would have worked better if it stayed as a tight, little claustrophobic horror film but it tries to be far more than it really is. Anyway, very ambitious and promises many more things for the director."

"aeo","5","0","0","17 October 2004"," Great premise but it lacks a strong story and script to make it a great thriller.
","I had a chance to see this movie before it is released in US. I have to first start off by rating this movie five stars out of ten. I would have love to given it a higher score but the story, script, and acting did not live up to the movie's great premise.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is about two male characters who awake to find themselves chained in one leg to a plumbing pipe in a large locked room. Both are on opposite sides of the room and cannot reach each other. They are given clues to follow by a serial killer in order to escape imprisonment.<br/><br/>The story and dialogue leaves one unsatisfied due to holes in the plot and acting in the movie. You could tell that SAW takes some of its inspiration from the great thriller SEVEN from the style of the movie as well as the ending but unlike SEVEN, this movie does not have strong character development to get one into the mind of the serial killer. The movie instead focuses mostly on the killer's acts until the very end , when you finally discover the reason behind these killings but instead of evoking sympathy or hatred toward the killer, you are left with a feeling of ""so what"" or ""is that it?""<br/><br/>My next criticism is the characters and the actors who played it. I felt there were too many characters in this movie. The writers should have concentrated primarily on those few characters so that the audience can have more time to relate to them and feel some sort of connection with them. I also thought certain actors should not have played that specific role because they do not fit that part. I won't name that person because I have been told by a studio friend that some studio executives do read some of these posting and I like that actor and would like to see that person in future movies but just not in a thriller. Danny Glover plays a police officer in this movie but again, I felt nothing for this person and it is not due to his acting because Glover gave a solid performance except the story and dialogue was just too weak for even Glover to overcome.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent movie with great potential but failed in story development, lackluster dialogue, and mediocre casting. That being said, it is a good attempt for the Australian film grads Wan and Whannell."

","This opened in the UK on October 1st, the billboard advert read will you see, then in massive red letters SAW!! There was no press screenings of this in the UK, i think to give the film more suspense and for people to guess what it was all about. However it has been a film that word of mouth has got people singing its praises, and now the radio adverts are comparing it to se7en with the usual this is the best horror movie event of the year. The film was shown at the sundance film festival, and i think opens in the USA on October 29th. When hype like this gathers for a movie, it normally go s hand in hand that you will leave the cinema disappointed. Not this time, what we get is a very clever hour and 40 mins of excellent editing and direction. The cast are all but unknowns apart from cop played by Danny Glover, this i think helps this movie as a horror, surrounding it in mystery without big named stars doing the red carpet, and telling you all about it. The se7en comparisons were always gonna be made, and once you ve seen saw you ll understand why. But i think its more a nod to se7en rather than a copy of it, the film does leave a lot of questions to be answered, and has some very genuine surprise twists! I hope they don't go down the usual Hollywood way and try to answer the questions left posed, by making saw 2, time will tell. For James Wan directorial debut, this film marks a good start from him, i am sure he s a director we will see more from in the not to distant future. Highly recommended, go see on opening night to cut down on spoilers. 8* out of 10!"

","After expecting to see a horror movie, i was remarkably impressed to witness one of the finest spoof horrors made in years. Every cliché that exists in the serial killer movie genre was fantastically well sent up by a superb script. It all starts with the tag line ""Dare you see saw"", an awful pun that only makes sense once you've seen the film and realize its actually really funny. Cary Elwes managing to keep a straight face when putting in one of the greatest over-acting spectacles in many a long year. Danny Glover as the lone nut cop still out to solve the case, after seeing his partner die of course. The farcical end twist of the cancer sufferer out to teach the world a lesson. The writer(s)have taken the sentiment that existed in Seven and ripped it to shreds. The film is simply wonderful in its editing (the car chase scene where Danny Glover goes after the supposed killer is near genius) with some excellent cheesy lines thrown in along the way. The fact that the whole thing is played straight and never for laughs just adds to its deserved reputation as a great spoof. Where the average serial killer movie falls to pieces because of the awful reasoning of the plot, Saw embraces this trend of questionable logic by making the storyline, characters, motives, just everything absolutely absurd, but still manages to never turn into a farce. It perhaps reaches its pinnacle when toward the end of the film Cary Elwes is lying on the floor desperately attempting to reach his phone that lies a few mere inches away. He picks up a saw and rather using it to drag the ringing mobile towards him, he decides to cut off his foot! The film really does nail the whole serial killer genre stone dead."

For the twenty minutes I watched before I left I could see it had a certain style, and it was certainly strongly emotive. I'd say the acting wasn't good from the fellas in the room - reminded me very much of 'Cube' (which I did enjoy).<br/><br/>Violence. Die Hard, the Matrix, Terminator et al. are not violent, by my definition (they may well be by yours). Showing extreme suffering in lingering closeup, with all the emotions writ large, is true violence for me. Tim Roth in the second half of Reservoir Dogs. 'Sloth' in Seven. Chris Ecclestone's grim duty and descent in Shallow Grave. I find that seriously hard to watch. In those instances I managed because the hard scenes were infrequent. In this movie the first twenty minutes was at the top of that scale throughout, and I couldn't see any let-up, so I called it a night.<br/><br/>Of course, many or even most people may not agree, which is cool by me :) <br/><br/>But my simple recommendation would be that if scenes of personal suffering and sadism (if you'll excuse the dramatic term) played out for entertainment isn't your thing, I'd avoid this one.<br/><br/>P.S.

Cary Elwes, one of the two focal characters, puts in a potentially career-destroying performance. I've always thought he was pretty good in films like The Princess Bride and Kiss The Girls, but in attempting such an emotionally meaty role for once, all he succeeds in doing is bringing his limitations into uncomfortably sharp relief. He's really not up to the job, and ultimately people started laughing during our showing too. Including us.<br/><br/>Worst of all, one of the scenes at the end, which was probably intended to be the most harrowing in the whole film, is totally undermined by the preceding comedy of Mr. Elwes' 'emoting'.

Never the best of actors, Elwes collapses badly as his character becomes increasingly complex.<br/><br/>At the same time, in a minor role as an obsessive police officer, Danny Glover is deranged and just falls apart.<br/><br/>Aside from acting, this film also fails because emotionally it is inconsistent. At times this is an incredibly intense film which leaves our hearts beating, but at other times it drags and makes us bored. It sometimes gives us clever, well thought out moments of panic, yet it also lowers itself by featuring irrelevant moments which make us jump. One key example is where Adam is walking around a dark room using his camera for lighting when a man jumps out on him. This moment is so quick that it makes the entire audience jump, but this is not anything special, it's just obvious and dire.<br/><br/>In the end of the day, ""Saw"" has so much going for it, but it just never quite delivers.

The other poor bugger has got no real aim in the killers sick game other than to pray he's locked up with a nice guy. Heres where the film gets original. Both men have been left a hacksaw.

Seven redefined filmaking when it came out, and rightly so. It shocked audiences everywhere and got Brad Pitt a job. But it focused too much on the Law than on the victims of the killers Heinous crimes. Saw excels because it shows you more of the victims suffering than that of the efforts of the Law. But when we do see the Law it is in good taste, showing the psychological effects chasing a killer can have on the mind. Hats off to Danny Glover for shying away from the Lethal Weapon Role he is so often pigeonholed. Here there are no one liners, no humorous violence. And most of All, no happy endings.

Never before have a been to a film where there has been so many different emotions, from laughter to sheer panic and everything in between. Nor have a seen a film where the audience has become so involved. Many places make you jump, while others make you laugh but don't be fooled this film will get you thinking about it for days after. You will never look at a SAW in the same way. Absolutely Fantastic!!!"

","I was pretty hyped up about this film and it would have been so easy for me to be disappointed by it but i am happy to report that it is actually pretty damn good. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it has its flaws but it has just enough flair and originality to pull itself through. I believe most of you will have a vague idea of the plot so i wont waste time explaining that. <br/><br/>A large part of the film takes place in the large bathroom, that anyone who saw the trailers will be familiar with, and plays out like a sadistic 'point and click' adventure and is, excepting the ingenuity of the killers ""games"", probably the films strongest point. A lot of the story is played out from this point through flashbacks, which is where Danny Glover's character comes into it and plays out a fairly conventional detective story.<br/><br/>The film is being marketed on how extreme and sadistic it is, which i feel does the film a disservice as it is a well crafted little thriller which will have fairly strong appeal outside of an audience only interested to see if they can stomach it. It does cut close to the bone at some points but it is by no means a one trick pony, it is a very engaging film throughout and even kept my mum entertained. <br/><br/>The only things i can think of which lets this film down are a bit of below par acting from a couple of the principal characters and possibly the soundtrack, which although i like and feel worked some people may be put off by another industrial metal score. <br/><br/>****"

","This film left me mad and frustrated, if that was the intention then well done! But i didn't like the fancy camera work, it didn't fit in with the rest of the film i thought. I also thought the two guys acting was a little suspect. As for the comparisons to Seven i couldn't really identify it. Although this was a psychological horror of sorts it wasn't in the same vein as Seven. It definitely wasn't particularly gory or as scary as it was hyped up to be either, i went in expecting to see some pretty horrific things and didn't. It was also full of flashbacks which weren't confusing but it added to my frustration with the film.<br/><br/>The little twist at the end though did leave me a little stunned for a second, which was obviously the intention!<br/><br/>I just feel it could of being a lot better than it was, but it definitely left an impression on me so they did something right!"

","I registered specifically to comment on this film, because I can't understand why people are rating it so highly - it was a great concept and could have been a great film, but the directing is poor, Elwes delivers the most wooden performance since Pinocchio, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese. Most people like a jumpy moment, but they're not hard to create. It seems loud screeches are an acceptable substitute for ropey acting, poor directing, and an ending that seems to have been made up at the last minute - and what's with the Benny Hill style fast-forward car chase? To draw comparisons with Se7en is crazy, to give it 10 out of 10 like some people have done is unbelievable - check the all time top 20 films on this site, some of these are tens, Saw isn't half as good as any of these."

","Just back from seeing Saw and oh my god what a dire excuse for a film. The acting was awful, hide your face Mr Elwes. For a thriller (wouldn't call it a horror) there were NO thrills, no suspense, no shocks or jumps. I also would have thought that to get into the film and have sympathy for the captives they should actually be likable characters who you care about even if they seem to be a couple of whiny, self-involved humans at the start of the movie. <br/><br/>How on earth anyone can compare this with se7en is beyond me, did anybody start laughing at anything in se7en? No, didn't think so; unlike Saw which had the entire auditorium laughing outloud at the utter nonsense on show.<br/><br/>Only positive from this thing was the 'bear trap' head device scene but a five minute segment that was OK doesn't make up for the fact that every other second was lousy."

","I watched the Saw late last night in Birmingham. At the time, it wasn't my first choice of movie , it was however the only movie that was still available to watch at short notice. As a result, I had no idea of what to expect other than it was horror movie (so I didn't have any high hopes of expectation!).<br/><br/>The focal story revolves around two men (a doctor and a young photographer) who wake up and find themselves individually chained to the foot in some abandoned, industrial style bathroom. I don't want to give too much away since this is a movie fueled by twists and turns. But very quickly you realize the lives of these two men are dictated by a mysterious and perverse psychopath known as the ""jigsaw"". This sick individual does not kill his victims with his own hands but carefully positions them in twisted, moral scenarios where they have to perform horrendous acts to themselves and others in order to survive.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The Saw is very much a psychological horror film, there are some scenes that are genuinely disturbing (the situations in which some of the victims are placed in and also the mechanised clown-like mannequin!) but you also have your fair share of ""jump out of your seat"" moments. The story is fast-paced and I was left constantly guessing as to what was going to happen next. The comparisons of this movie to Dave Fincher's Seven are obvious (for a start, the same writer). Despite this, the director ""uses"" the underlying ideas of Seven to create an exciting, disturbing, frightening and bloody movie in its own individual right.<br/><br/>The acting is generally fine, though there are some scenes where the two central actors don't quite pull it off (the Doc got a few unintentional giggles). This movie is not for the squeamish - my girlfriend couldn't bring herself to look at the screen at some points. There are some great twists in this movie but this in turn diminishes the believability of the story, however I thought this was quite necessary in order to sucker punch at the end.<br/><br/>If you were a fan of Seven or someone who likes to watch movies for the scares then the Saw is highly recommended. 9/10"

","I watched SAW on Saturday morning and was completely alone in the cinema. It was very scary and gripping. It had me on the edge of my seat all the way through. I found the relationship between the two police similar to that of the two main characters in se7en, but this just added to the dark mysterious nature of the movie. I was satisfyingly shocked at the climax of the film and delighted with the horrifying twist at the end. It's refreshing to see a gritty and truly gripping thriller, that actually does thrill the pants off you. Also I'd like to see more 18 certificate movies where film makers are constructively thinking about shocking scarring and giving audiences the much needed wake up call to all that is horror, rather than going for ratings by wussing out with the content and going for lower certificates to increase audiences!"

"meako1973","Null","0","0","30 September 2004"," The writer Saw Seven
","This is the film which everyone has been hearing a lot about recently. The original poster campaign was deemed 'too disturbing' and pulled. All the critics are fighting over who can create the best tag-line (see saw or saw saw?). Everyone is whispering about how it is 'that film where people hack their limbs off!' Well, if that is all you are expecting to see prepare to be either a) disappointed, or b) very pleased depending on what floats your boat.<br/><br/>Saw can be compared to David Fincher's Seven, as both tackle the same subject matter in a similar manner. In Saw two men awaken in a room, chained to pipes, with a corpse lying in a pool of blood in between them. As they try to work out how they got there they flashback to news about a serial killer (nicknamed Jigsaw) who is putting people in situations where they end up killing themselves. From barbed wire, to broken glass, the manner in which the killings take place are clever, well plotted, and very disturbing. Can the two men find a way to beat the killer at his own game and survive? Will the cop (Danny Glover, who is, to be honest, getting too old for this s**t) who has been trying to find the killer solve the mystery?<br/><br/>Comparisons to Seven go further than the tone of the film. The manner in which we, the audience, are given small pieces of information about killings, and are left to visualise the true horror ourselves are very reminiscent of Fincher's masterpiece. This time around we are given speeded up footage of events, but not enough to see the graphic detail. In addition the look of the film is similar to Seven, the lighting, the set design. In fact, had Morgan Freeman been in the Glover role it may very well have been a sequel. As it stands it is a similar film, and it works well.<br/><br/>Saw isn't a brilliant film, and it most certainly isn't the 'great horror' that everyone seems to be raving on about. Overall it is a good quality genre film which doesn't offer anything new to the table, but succeeds in doing what it set out to doentertain for couple of hours. If you want blood, guts, and gore as people hack themselves upgo elsewhere."
"shulmanator","6","0","0","19 September 2004"," Awesome for a newbie. Awful for a pro.
","I saw a free screener copy of this film after having seen the trailers. What I got from the trailers is that this film was going to break new ground in suspense and shock-value.<br/><br/>It didn't. It's no more suspenseful than ""Psycho"" (1960), and less shocking than Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"".<br/><br/>What worked for this film enough to get it sold was the original concept. It breaks the typical barriers of they cliché' serial killer genre. In this case, the villain doesn't kill. He forces people to kill other people or themselves. There is a reason the killer does this, and it will actually make sense to the audience. He's not just simply crazy. That would be bad ""cop-out"" writing, otherwise. The directors are not afraid to show disturbing images, and knows when to cut away from them before it becomes cheaply gratuitous. The mystery unravels itself cleverly, keeping the audience guessing at what's going on, and just when the audience is sure the mystery has been solved, it turns out there's more to learn.<br/><br/>However, this is a new young director and it shows. It shows terribly. The editing is paced far far too slow. There's probably 5 minutes of film that could be cut out, where the audience is not gaining any new knowledge, and there's no anticipation for anything. For instance, there's a scene where one character asks his partner to come over and look at something. It takes the guy a good 10 seconds to get over and have the audience look at it. I was tired of waiting by 7 seconds. Gotta shorten this stuff, guys.<br/><br/>Also, we see a car chase (or race) in which everything is in fast-forward, MTV style. Why? It's distracting from the story, and it looks laughably silly. There's other parts of the movie that do this fast-forward technique, as well as a circular track around that does nothing logical for the audience's intake of information. It's just silly, and obviously done for style, and the style is NOT subtle enough to get by without the audience questioning the director's decisions. A good director is taken for granted while people watch the film, and are appreciated after the film is over.<br/><br/>Ever notice in some films that an actor who is usually great is suddenly a bad actor? That's when a film has a bad director. Well, a bad director as far as directing actors or finalizing the editing ADR dialogue. This film manages to make Danny Glover suck. The dialogue is at times trying too hard to be colorful and creative. It tries so hard that the audience can hear the writer in an imaginary flashback, talking to himself about how to make the dialogue more fresh. A true master can keep it colorful, yet natural and logical.<br/><br/>6/10 Good in originality. Poor in technicality."

","""Saw"" is a fantastic film.  Not just for the brilliant cinematography, the thrilling, well written and disturbing plot.  Not just for smashing editing and amazing use of sound and music to create the ultimate height of suspense.  It is a fantastic film mainly because I hated to watch it and yet could not look away.  ""Saw"" brought on feelings of horror, intense intrigue and at points near physical nausea.  At times I was unsure whether I could make it through the rest of the film, as I watched ten to fifteen percent of the audience actually walk out during the showing.  However, I was relieved to hear the gasps of dread and groans of horror from other audience members as they blended in with my own.  ""Saw"" is truly the most vile and disturbing film that I can say I have ever personally viewed.  The only possible comparison is if ""Seven"" had actually graphically shown the killings and all the other insinuated gruesome carnage.  ""Saw"" is absolutely a film that I can say I loved to hate."

","Well, what can I say? The movie is simply a reinvention. With all the crap being thrown at us from the Horror genre it's very hard to tell whats decent or not. All horror movies these days are just hack and slash, poor dialog, poor execution, token hot people and flashy camera's. Oh yeah, and the occasional girl screaming. What you get in Saw is excruciatingly painful scenes that will have anyone averting their eyes at some point. Coupled with this, the means of torture, both physically and mentally, are excellently crafted and incredibly imaginative. There is a genuine unnerving feel about the inventiveness of the various instruments used to bring his victims to insanity.<br/><br/>The superb thing about Saw I feel, is that it actually has a great plot, one you don't expect and particularly NEED in a horror, but Saw delivers a brilliant one anyway. The psychological killer behind the whole thing, AKA Jigsaw, doesn't simply torture his victims, but uncovers their deepest flaws, exploits them, and punishes the person for them. They are given choices, often both ending in some sort of tragedy, but the sheer cruelty is just mind-blowing and a breath of fresh air to the boring, formulaic route most Horrors these days take.<br/><br/>The fact is, Saw is clever. Saw is psychological. Saw is thought provoking and Saw is excruciatingly hard to watch at times.

"poolandrews","Null","4","13","4 October 2004"," Awful, I hated it.
","I went to see 'saw' (oh dear!) the day it opened here in the UK, three days ago, last Friday in fact. The film opens with a guy in a bath of water, he wakes up and manages to save himself from drowning. He is chained to a pipe in a room somewhere and its pitch black. As it happens another guy is chained to a pipe on the opposite side of what turns out to be a large bathroom of some sort. He finds a light and turns it on. They have never met each other before, or so they tell each other and there's also a dead body in the middle of the room. They both find audio tapes in their pockets which they play. Turns out some psycho has locked them in there and one has to kill the other or they will both be locked in the room and left to die. The films also jumps to the outside world periodically to focus on the bad guy and the police trying to track him down, hes done this sort of thing before you see. I hated this film, it tries to be clever but ends up being the most stupid piece of rubbish I've seen in a long time. The 'plot' has so many holes in it its unbelievable, you need to throw all logic out of the window if you want to convince yourself this is at all feasible or possible.<br/><br/>*WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS* <br/><br/>How did the guy in the bath not drown? He was totally submerged in water. Yet when he woke the Doctor on the other side of the bathroom was up and walking around. How did the killer put him in the bath and set the scene up within two or three minutes before he would have drowned? And surely the Doctor would have heard what was going on and therefore his plan and that ridiculous twist ending couldn't have possibly worked in reality. Which ever way you look at it it just doesn't make any sense, and to me is totally laughable. Why do they spend so much time talking about whos doing this to them? I'd have thought at that point in time it was totally irrelevant, they were on a tight time limit, I'd have thought trying to escape would be far more important. It would be to me. When Danny Glover finds some hard evidence as to who the killer is why does he just take one cop and not tell anyone else? And why couldn't they just arrest him? Shoot him in the leg anything but to just let him run away when they were both armed? The one cop runs after him and fires his shotgun into his back. The killer falls over but there is no wound or damage to his clothes. What happened to the gunshot that was fired straight at him? Even if the killer was wearing protection surely his outer clothing would have been ripped by the shotgun blast. The killer was supposedly ill yet he managed to overpower a young man with a baseball bat quite easily it seemed. Why was Danny Glover paying the photographer to take pictures of the Doctor? How did the killer know this? When you think about it it simply doesn't make any sense. And other thing about that awful twist ending, what if the third man involved in the game didn't turn up or something happened to him, how would the killer escape? There was no way to open the door from the inside, or so it seemed. Why did the Doctor not see that there was no empty shells in the gun when he picked it up and opened the chamber? The dead man couldn't have committed suicide, he was calm enough to take aim and shoot the photographer in the shoulder only wounding him. So it wasn't like he had gone insane or mad, he was still sane and alert. And the reason they were both chosen was a let down. One because he was having an affair and the other because he took photographs of people, wow very exciting, not. I could write about the stupid plots holes in the film all day if I wanted but I'll stop now.<br/><br/>*END OF SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the beginning when everything is a mystery, as the film develops the stupid plot twists take over and pretty much ruin the whole film. Very poor, stupid, tedious and boring. And don't be fooled by the graphic posters, there is no gore whatsoever, a few after the event dead bodies, a hand full of guts that stay on screen for about three seconds and a couple of gunshots, thats it. Very tame. I've heard this film compared to David Finchers Seven, its not even in the same league."

","It's a bit odd to say that the thing I liked best about Saw was that there was true suffering in it rather than detached horror movie gore, but that was the case with this movie. I am reminded of some of Wes Craven's early films like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, which were essentially about people doing horrible things to other people. It's a lofty effort for a couple of first time filmmakers and is very good as a debut horror/thriller/crime film, and the almost universal comparisons to Seven are to be expected. They are, after all, perfectly justified. The problem is that Seven never stops being interesting, while Saw makes no sense on a second viewing. <br/><br/>My roommate watched the movie after I had already seen it, and I sat and watched parts of it and was reminded of the supplemental documentaries included with the Vista Series edition of The Sixth Sense, in which it is explained that they went to great lengths to make sure that they were making the movie honestly, that you could go back after you knew about the ending and see that the movie still made sense. This movie has no time or interest in that, because while the twists and turns are great during a first viewing and it is tremendously successful at making almost every single character look suspicious at some point or another, if you watch it when you already know the end the entire thing falls apart.<br/><br/>Adam and Dr. Gordon wake up to find themselves locked in a filthy restroom of sorts, each chained to opposite sides of the room with a dead body between them holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. They each have tapes in their pockets, and once Adam gets a hold of the tape recorder (by using his shirt to help him reach it, and at Dr. Gordon's suggestion, which will become important later in this review), they listen to the two tapes and are given instructions by the killer. Adam is a voyeuristic photographer, his job is to prevent his own death, while Dr. Gordon's job is to kill Adam or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left there to die. <br/><br/>Thus begins a lengthy series of ever more complicated events set up by the killer which are very convenient for a structured screenplay but make no sense in reality. Then again, the application of logic is a great way to dismantle a movie like this, and it should be noted that the movie is, in fact, highly entertaining during that first viewing. I like to think that it's not until the second viewing that you realize how much you have been cheated. <br/><br/>(spoilers) Because of the shock of the ending, for example, you forgot that Zap, the hospital orderly, at one point holds a stethoscope to the daughter's chest while he points a gun at her mother's head, listening as the child's heartbeat speeds up in fear. Was he enjoying himself? Kind of cancels out some of the sympathy you felt for him after he got killed at the end despite not being the kidnapper, didn't it. Then there was the issue of the objects just out of reach. Early in the film, it is Dr. Gordon that tells Adam to take off his shirt and use it to reach the tape recorder in the man's hand in the middle of the room, then later in the movie Dr. Gordon finds himself unable to reach the cell phone, which is ringing, so he takes off his shirt andÂ…uses it as a tourniquet to cut his foot off. What?? Given that the phone was about 8 inches out of his reach on linoleum, he may have been able to save his foot had he used his shirt to get it, like he suggested to Adam earlier. He must have been under a lot of stress.<br/><br/>There is a good scene early in the movie where Adam finds the two saws and tosses one to Dr. Gordon and they both start sawing frantically at the chains around their ankles. Adam breaks his saw and Gordon soon gives up, realizing that it's not the chains the killer wants them to cut through, it's their feet. Reminds me of a great short story by Stephen King called ""Survivor Type"" where a man is stranded on a desert island and quickly finds himself with very, very little to eat. <br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed the movie, it had a good surprise ending despite the fact that the path leading up to it was heavily and clumsily manufactured. It is an entertaining horror film, not a great one. Cary Elwes provides a bit of star power, but sadly delivers the worst performance I've ever seen him do, it was even worse than Liar Liar. If there is one thing I learned from this movie, it is that Cary Elwes can NOT cry on film. WOW. His emotional scenes were some of the worst I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood can cry better than this guy, and he makes Samuel L. Jackson look like a care bear. Schwarzenegger can cry better than this guy, for crying out loud. Maybe that's why he was so convincing in The Princess Bride, because Wesley was completely devoid of all emotion for most of the film.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, this is still an interesting film. Fans of the great thrillers like Seven and The Sixth Sense may find themselves unimpressed if you go into it expecting more of the same level of quality, but horror fans are sure to get a kick out of it. At least the first time."
"edwarddfrankenstein","1","2","5","19 October 2019"," Normally I love horror, but this was just inane
","Few films have had a more negative effect on the horror genre than Saw. It's inexplicable success led to the genre being flooded with even worse (which one wouldn't expect to be possible) imitators, creating a period where virtually nothing interesting came out in the genre. The problem with this type of film is simply that it just isn't interesting. It's not scary, it's basically just a long boring catalogue of ways that people can be injured, with no suspense or speak of. Despite the superficial similarities to the slasher genre, the two styles are worlds apart, in that slasher movies build up tension between the deaths, while torture films are flat and unengaging. Also, the whole aesthetic style associated with genre (lots of rust, muddy camerawork, annoying soundtrack) is ugly, I much prefer older horror aesthetics, with their lurid colours and unconvincing effects, which still manage to be more frightening than the tedium of post-Saw horror. We need a return to the style of real horror directors like George Romero and John Carpenter (ideally with exclusively practical effects, none of the CGI rubbish that dominates the industry today; a VHS revival would be nice too) instead of the ridiculous claptrap that gets marketed as horror today (there are a few good directors working now, but my point still stands)."

","The Story: A photographer & a surgeon awaken inside a basement, chained to pipes. They are the victims of the Jigsaw Killer, who abducts people & places them in situations where they have to make a ruthless choice in order to survive. Meanwhile, a former police detective is on Jigsaw's trail.<br/><br/>A conceptual blend of ""Se7en"", where a killer commits crimes in order to make a point about morals, & ""Cube"", where a group of people are trapped in a booby-trapped prison, ""Saw"" is perhaps one of the best films to come out of the new century. With a premise that pulls you in from the word go, as well as a slew of ruthless plot twists, the film uses the main concept to transform the serial killer film into something entirely new. The acting is outstanding & the script is full of surprises, which are designed to push the envelope in terms of torture, something which is taken in a major way by the sequels. The situations the victims find themselves in are utterly gripping; there's the man who has to crawl through a room full of razor wire, another victim who is covered with a flammable substance & told to open a safe but given a candle to read the numbers, & in the film's best moment, a drug addict who has to kill her cellmate in order to find a key to unlock a boobytrap placed on her head.

Also the main line that Jigsaw does use in the film, ""Those who do not appreciate the blessings and lives they are given, are not worthy of that they are given"", It really opens people's ears and make you think.

Second, the plot and story is nonsense and unreasonable. The movie wants to sell only violence. Why the doctor had to cut his leg, the time was over, so in his mind his family all dead. It seemed like the director want this scene (cut the leg) to happen. And I just know that the detectives this day use flash camera. This movie is very shallow, the bad guy's motive is not good.

","THIS DEFINITELY HAS SPOILERS SO BEWARE!!!!<br/><br/>Considering its tiny budget and short filming time, this movie was excellent. There is definitely a ""Se7en"" feel to it, but not so much that it's repetitive. The story itself is quite original, especially in its execution. Granted, the killer making others do the killing isn't that original, but ""Saw"" is by no means typical. OK, so I really enjoyed the movie, but, as always, I have some griping to do. <br/><br/>SPOILERS!SPOILERS! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! <br/><br/>First - the ending - I was a little annoyed. Not so much by the unveiling of Jigsaw, but the implausibility of him being in the room the entire time without a trained oncologist realizing he was not dead. Second - the Zep or Zap factor - his 'game' seems a little convoluted. I understand this is a movie, but it could have been done a little better. Why make him a part of all this, when he seemed to defend John at the hospital as a person? Third - the sawing - why wouldn't the Doctor use his shirt to get the cell phone and tell his wife he was still there? He could have found out that she was safe. Did he really think he could saw off his foot and save himself? That bothered me. It could have been a different twist, like the wife was OK, but Jigsaw was on his way to finish the Doctor off or something like that. Fourth - Cary Elwes in general - I don't know. At times he just seemed out of place. His hair was too blonde and he was almost chunky. Maybe he was supposed to seem pompous and yuppie-like, but at times I found it unbelievable. Fifth - the loose ends - Did the Doctor actually die? Granted, he was dragging himself out of the bathroom at the end pale as a ghost and he probably made it only ten more feet, but who knows? Do they later find his body? A loud thump five seconds after he crawled out would have done it. (Maybe there was one and I missed it, so I apologize if I did). Do they later find Adam shriveled and dead with Zap or Zep (I am unsure which it is)? Are they leaving the loose ends for a sequel? Didn't Jigsaw have a frontal lobe tumor, so he was dying before all of this began? <br/><br/>All that being said, I still rated this movie 9/10. Why? Because it was that good. So good, in fact, I found myself picking out the aforementioned little things. Why even nit pick like that? Because it could have been perfect. ""Saw"" had all the potential but only came through about 95%. And that is why I was a little annoyed at the end. Again, still a great movie. One of the best horror/suspense films in a LONG time. Original, creative, scary, freaky, disturbing, etc. <br/><br/>Despite what I have said, I highly recommend this movie. Be warned that it can be quite graphic, but it is definitely worth it."

","This is a very good suspense thriller. Great acting, great idea for a story with some OK writing and directing. I am a person that really likes character development, even though most movie-goers like a plot that moves, and moves quickly. So I was a little dismayed for the first 30-45 mins where I was hoping that we would get to see a little depth put into the great characters that they had created, but instead was treated to a fast-paced plot. Not really surprising since all producers edit their movies to remove character development in order to have a quicker moving plot (just watch any DVD's deleted scenes and the director will tell you that the reason the scene was deleted was because people were saying that the movie was dragging a little long and the plot had to get going).<br/><br/>The direction was good, but it always felt a little like a really bad David Fincher rip-off. David Fincher has a really great, unique directing style, and I don't mind if a director uses him as inspiration to develop their own style, but in SAW, he just wasn't able to pull it off.<br/><br/>And about the ending. Don't worry about it. It's not about any surprise. It is just a really cool ending that put all the pieces of the movie together.<br/><br/>Without the ending I would give it a 3/5, but with it, it gets an easy 4!"
"Custard_Cuchillo","10","2","5","6 November 2004"," See Saw while its in theaters! (Spoilers)
","Probably the most refreshing horror movie to grace mainstream America in many years. Owing some obvious influences to both Se7en and Tetsuo the Iron Man (an incredibly effective scene involving a lethal helmet reminded me of the visually disturbing blend of humanity and metal in the 88' film) Saw is in its own class.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws, most notably being the cheap looking makeup for Dr. Gordon later in the film when he is pale from a loss of blood and teetering on the edge of sanity. Continuing on the subject of Dr. Gordon, Cary Elwes made some interesting decisions as an actor in playing the character. The result has divided viewers. Most of them see Elwes performance as blatant overacting. The others, a minority group including myself, see the performance as spot on. Elwes overacted because that would be the human reaction to such an insane, horrific, and hopeless situation. I think most people have become conditioned to appreciate the subtle, minimalist acting style that has been deemed ""good acting"" in contemporary film and anything that strays too far from it is viewed as incorrect. If you don't think the accepted style of acting has changed, then you haven't seen enough old films. Plenty of today's established actors would have never have been successful in the 1930's, and vice versa. <br/><br/>Overall, the film works because it is scary. It made me feel in a way that I hadn't felt since I was a kid in a haunted house ride. It didn't matter that it was just a movie; it had lured me in, shackled me down, and sent me on its course. In that sense, it is a ride. You are strapped down, compelled by its magic, and so have no choice but to see it through to its conclusion. I appreciated, not necessarily enjoyed, this film and therefore rated it a 10. <br/><br/>Many will not. If you don't, I ask that you reflect on your motives for feeling as you do. After viewing the message boards, and the various people trying (and failing) to expose what they see as obvious plot holes, I am beginning to suspect that many have been scared stupid by the film. They wanted a pleasant, agreeable ending, the kind they have been brought up on. That is one thing this movie will not deliver. Instead, it will repulse you, terrorize you, play with your expectations and hopes, and perhaps even make you reflect on your own appreciation for human life. <br/><br/>If all of that isn't worth $8, and two hours of your life, I don't know what is."

Which can pull you out of the film.<br/><br/>3) I hated the rock video type effects (I.E. the lock jaw spinning thing)<br/><br/>4) I'm looking forward to see what the directors of SAW does next.<br/><br/>5) I didn't see the twist coming....but I should of done.<br/><br/>6) Cary Elwes got his British accent back for the last few minutes. Weird.<br/><br/>7) I want a DTV squeal to see more crazy setups the killer can think up. In fact, a franchise would be nice.<br/><br/>8) SAW is a poo title.<br/><br/>9) Wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be. I wanted it to scare the crap outta me, but all I got was one jump.<br/><br/>10) Reminded me of OLDBOY. In style and the whole imprisonment thing."

","Well, what can I say about this particular species of farmyard fowl?<br/><br/>In many ways, it doesn't surprise me that the Director and Writer are twenty-somethings, because the film has a very distinct 'recent film school graduate' feel about it.<br/><br/>Basically, lousy script, lousy casting (what's up, Danny Glover - running out of money? You just ran out or cred, too), a plot dynamic that will have you sitting on the edge of your toilet bowl, and not a single sympathetic or believable character. To talk about it alongside films like 'Seven' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' (both hugely over-rated, but at least competent) is like comparing 'Psycho' (the original) to some inane slasher flick like 'Friday 13th'. Robert McKee will probably use this film as an example of how NOT to do it.<br/><br/>So... save your money. Don't even bother with it. Do something more rewarding, such as stay at home and watch the 20th re-run of 'Frasier'. Even that's better than 'Saw', which is saying something."
"TxMike","Null","3","11","31 March 2005"," Works as a parody of the genre, but not as a legitimate thriller.
","Thanks to my public library, I was able to see ""Saw"" on DVD and, while I am glad I saw it, I could not recommend it to any of my friends. The plot is simple -- people are abducted and placed in a position of grave danger where they have a very limited time to do something drastic to avoid their own death. The ""something drastic"" may involve killing someone else. The main of the story deals with two men who awake and find they are chained on opposite sides of a very dirty room with the dirtiest toilet in North America, and have a few hours to do something about it. Clues are given and the men discover two hack saws hidden in the toilet tank, the saws that give the movie its name. Little of the movie is terrifying, the visuals are mostly disgusting. After it was over, and I thought about it, the only reason to see this movie is to experience the agony of the various characters. There are no sympathetic characters so I didn't care that much what happened to them.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. At the end we find that the real fiend has been lying in a bloody mess in the room imprisoning the two chained men, witnessing their grief first hand. He was a cancer patient (we see him briefly initially) of the doctor (Cary Elwes) and this was his revenge, to have the doctor saw off his foot to escape from the chains and save his own life and his wife and child who had been held captive. The plot is a bit more complex than that, but twists were added simply to keep the viewers guessing. This quote from the critic Ebert's review is telling, ""A movie that conceals the identity of a killer is of a lower order, in general, than one that actually deals with him as a character. """
"Stoopz7","2","3","11","3 November 2004"," If anything, one of the funniest movies of the year.
","Sometimes life just treats us unfairly and we spend $7.50 on a steaming turd of a movie. In this case, that steaming turd is Saw. <br/><br/>From the first trailer that I watched online, I was really excited about this movie. That whole trailer really unfolded about the first twenty minutes into the movie. I don't really want to get too much into the plot of the movie in case you are set on going to see it. So, what I will do is clue you in on the reasons that you shouldn't waste your time with this movie. <br/><br/>Carl Elwes (the dude from the Princess Bride) puts on one of the greatest worst performances ever. His over acting defiantly becomes the most painful part of this movie to watch. I know, it's a horror movie, there notorious for bad acting. That's not the case; he acts as if this Shakespearian play and just over does the majority of the scenes he's in. <br/><br/>Then you have good ole Danny Glover. Wow, he hasn't been this good in a movie since Predator 2! O wait, that movie was horrible. At least he gives us one good thing in this movie; one of the greatest lines ever:<br/><br/>'Well at least we'll be shielded by the night' Â– What? <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is like a broke ass version of Se7en. They couldn't get Morgan Freeman to play the detective in this one so, they settled for Danny Glover. This movie really just becomes hilarious towards the end. <br/><br/>I really can't bust on the plot of the movie that much because, for this being the guys first try at writing a movie I thought his ideas were pretty good. It's just unfortunate how bad somebody messed up when they cast the characters for this movie."
"melovegrapes","10","2","6","28 February 2017"," This is actually a great family movie!
","I was a bit hesitant at watching this at first, I thought it would be about a pervert (hence the name ""saw"" like a peeping tom) but I was so wrong. It's about a dying old man who makes a toy doll & lives his life through the doll, called Billy. Billy/the old man play a lot of games with people, & he manages to make a lot of friends through Billy and some even die for him! It's upsetting at first but it's really beautiful to see such a strong friendship. I would definitely recommend this as a family movie night!"

","So, this is more of an essay about the series as a whole, and my belief as to the fact that at its core, the films are supposed to be philosophical. Each one tackles a different philosophical question. Although, granted they did lose some of this quality after their original director and writer left after films one and three respectively. I'll go film by film. <br/><br/>1. Would you kill to save yourself/your loved ones? If you've seen the film, you know the plot, and you know the big twist at the end. And while the characters of Adam and Lawrence have become two of the better known characters in the series. But it's ultimately not about them. It's about the audience having to answer that question for themselves. And it's also a parody of the ideals of masculinity (Adam means man, and he is portrayed as an angry, testosterone fueled @$$hole... incidentally, my first name is also Adam. Not important, but felt like sharing, because what the hell, this is my review.) Lawrence means blessed, and yet Lawrence doesn't see how blessed he is. Finally, we have the killer John Kramer (aka Jigsaw.) Biblically, John wrote the book of Revelation, which is about a destructive message from God. All of his victims receive a destructive message from an omnisentient being. <br/><br/>2. What would you do to survive in a hostile situation? That's what the group of people in the death house have to ask themselves. Ultimately, this film is my favorite of the series because knowing about the monster doesn't decrease the fear you feel for him. It makes him scarier. Same thing with the names. Daniel means God is my judge. From the beginning, Daniel was protected by Jigsaw and Amanda. Eric consequently means ruler, suggesting his authoritative, but ultimately flawed nature.<br/><br/>3. Would an eye for an eye make the whole world blind? A man seeks vengeance for the death of his child and (at the end) the death of his wife. Similarly, one can note that Amanda means: worthy of love. This plays into her character as she is a jealous character who has been hurt by everyone she's ever loved. <br/><br/>Then, they got crappy, so I'll speed up a little.<br/><br/>4. Is apathy ever an answer?<br/><br/>5. Basically a very long, gory argument for collectivism. <br/><br/>6. (My favorite of the post original trilogy.) If you had the power to kill with impunity for profit, should you? (The answer, even outside a fictional world is no.)<br/><br/>7. Is it wrong to capitalize on others misfortunes? (Yes. Very yes.)"
"yosemitesam-1","3","2","6","26 February 2005"," One mistake! (spoiler)
","I really loved this film. The acting, the plot....all of it was marvelous. But during the last five minutes of the film, the writers made a terrible mistake and lost my respect. Cary and Danny did a fantastic job in their roles...especially Cary (I'm sorry we haven't seen more of him lately). Everything in the film was believable, right up until the last five minutes when the writers give you a surprise that ruins the entire film. Two men, chained to pipes and locked in a small room for 7+ hours. Between them, one man lies dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. During the last five minutes of the film, the dead man gets up. OK, well...sorry, but unless the two men chained to pipes were complete idiots, I just can't see it. Neither of these men saw him breathing? He was able to lie absolutely still and never move once? He also had a little remote control that he clicked a few times to give the two men electric shocks -- he did a marvelous job of not moving at all while doing this. The twists and turns of the movie were simply wonderful and believable...right up to the last five minutes."
"asafko-96168","8","1","2","12 April 2020"," A necessity for horror enthusiasts
","I do think this is a smart movie; it started the ""strangers trapped together her and have to work together to get out"" concept. Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like ""omg totally makes sense now"". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films. Definitely a necessity for horror enthusiasts to watch!"
"educallejero","7","1","2","11 April 2020"," The best horror villain ever (It's not even close)
","The movie has a really well written story, with every detail esencial for the plot, delivered slowly (maybe too slowly) through the lenght of the film. Dialogue just ok. Acting, not even that.
The ""torture porn"" aspect is of course off putting to mainstream audiences, and apparently even a portion of horror fans, but for the rest, we appreciate the smarts on how and why is introduced, not only justified, but neccesary to the whole point of the saga (that yes, it has a point too).
Also, Jigsaw is the best horror villain ever. Of course, is not as important as the first ones (Freddy, Jason), because those were pioneers, but overall, there is no debate. Philosophically and psychologically, Jigsaw is a real character, not a fantastical one. It's as real as it gets and as brutal and efficient as the others without the magic/fantasy aspects. He's just perfect, including how iconic he's visually too (the doll, the laugh, the pig mask).<br/><br/>Having said that, talking just about this one and not the whole saga, the policial procedure and the dramatic (based on the personal stories of the people involved) parts of the movies that aren't about Jigsaw himself, are pretty mediocre (probably in part because of the acting). They take too much time, slow the rythm a bit too much and make the movie, good, but not great."
"amullen34","8","1","2","27 March 2020"," Don't confuse this movie for its sequels- this one's actually good
","The Saw movies tend to get a pretty bad rap. Most people think of them as senselessly violent and overly gory torture fests with no actual interesting plots or characters. Granted, some of the movies are like that. But, when you watch this 2004 original, leave those expectations at the door, because this movie is just a genuinely good thriller and mystery.<br/><br/>This movie has an intriguing premise of two strangers waking up in a room, handcuffed to pipes. As the move progresses, this mystery unfolds as we learn more and more about these two characters and about the situation that they are in. There are many twists and turns as the movie unfolds, but they never feel forced. These twists feel organic and are truly shocking. Because of this, I don't think of this movie really as a horror movie. It feels more like a mystery thriller, and it draws you into its premise. However, it is a very tense movie and there are some frightening scenes, so it does succeed as a horror movie as well.<br/><br/>If gore is the main thing keeping you from watching this movie, I would give it a try. Granted, there is gore in this movie, but it's not nearly as much as you would expect from a movie these days with Saw in the name. The gore is never intrusive or over-the-top, and it certainly is never meant to be the point of the movie. If you cannot watch gore at all, there may be a couple of scenes where you'll want to close your eyes, but there is still so much to enjoy from this movie outside of those moments."
"MorrisBuck88","10","1","2","7 February 2020"," Simply amazing

"tdrish","8","1","2","18 January 2020"," Damn good movie!
","This is it. The only movie I know to date that correctly laces mystery, drama, and horror, and leaves you with an ending that will leave your jaw dropping to the floor. Saw is incredibly great, patiently paced, and well made film. The movie opens up with two strangers, bound by chain, in a room. Get used to this room, they're going to be here awhile. The one who put them there has given them a puzzle to figure out. There's a way out of the room, they just need to put their heads together and figure it out. Along the way, some major tension, major disagreements, and major meltdowns. Saw is anything but uplifting. I'll say this, you are going to stay glued to your seat throughout the entire movie, I guarantee it. You're not even going to want to get up to go potty, trust me, so anything you need to get, snacks, calls out of the way, because NOTHING is going to tear your attention away from Saw. Got that? You've been warned. And yes, it's that freaking good."

","I love how James Wan used his perfect plot twist in a horror movie. This movie has no jumpscares at all which is what i hate about watching horror movies. The movie doesn't need jumpscares to be scary. It's people's minds that make the movie and the franchise scary. They can do everything to survive, to keep their live, no matter what it takes. That's also something i don't see much in horror movies-the philosophy. The movie uses great plot great plot twist, smart way to lead the stories, smart way to trick us and cool traps to send a message to everyone about lives, death and their choice how to live their life."
"peterguitar","10","1","2","4 January 2019"," The best of the series
","If you are into blood porn but you still also prefer the movie to mess with your head in spite of the gore - this is the deal. From Saw II on I lost all sense of mystery, suspense, drama and could not stay involved in any way. I did not watch another in the series from beginning to end. The gore and splatter were very pointless (to me) in those movies. Just like sex-porn, I guess most don't watch blood-porn for the story. I get that. I guess that means I'm not a blood porn enthusiast but I will put up with some screaming and splatter if there is something clever wrapped around it. The characters here are well developed, the set pieces are clever, and a lot of the torture does happen within your head and in your imagination. Some here have made reference to Cube and I see the correlation with regard to the scares happening in your head or out of sight. I feel it takes real skill to do that. So, if you are not really into wall-to-wall, relentless, mindless carnage without absolutely any story you might consider this blood porn 101 (blood porn with training wheels?) and you might find it pretty good."
"tohkwongweng","9","1","2","17 November 2018"," Crazy good!
","I watched this one again after a 14 year absence and was reminded what an excellent scary movie this is. The sick ways in which the victims all succumbed or in the case of Amanda, nearly succumbed, was truly from the mind of a genius in the genre. Plus the ending was absolutely killer and THAT is what makes a truly great scary movie. I also liked the message that Jigsaw wanted to tell his victims: Be grateful. The story was not so complex that I had to ask questions and any questions that I may have had were so very neatly tied together in the final closing minutes. Definitely one for any scary movie aficionados' collection. 9.5/10"

"areatw","8","1","2","7 October 2018"," For the shock and fear factor there aren't many better
","This is the first time since I set up my IMDb account that I'm struggling to decide on whether to give a film a positive or a negative rating. Despite having seen 'Saw' multiple times, the truth is that I still can't decide if I love it or hate it. Each time I watch it, I find myself thinking 'why am I watching this trash?', and yet it manages to keep me completely engrossed - and entertained - from beginning to end. It's one of those films that you struggle to enjoy in the moment, but once the credits roll you realise how good it was.<br/><br/>Horror films are all about the shock and fear factor, and 'Saw' has that in abundance. The viewer is on edge throughout and the tension literally never lets up. 'Saw' probably goes as far as any horror film has done to satisfy horror fans. It ticks just about every box there is to tick, as well as a few others that didn't exist before 'Saw' came along. Whether you love it or hate it, or both as in my case, 'Saw' will always be a classic of the horror genre."

","I have all of the movies made in the SAW franchise but this is not for the faint of heart. That said, a lot of the footage takes place in a very large and decidedly dingey type of ""public""bathroom (but enough to sustain suspense) - enough suggested faecal matter and dirt/rust to put you off any pizza you may be planning to eat. But it was an excellent piece of writing with a few twists along the way along with just enough gore to interest the cult viewer.<br/><br/>Naturally there are scenes along the way that feature prior events for the two men locked in this bathroom and chained to opposite pipes which are relevant to the developing story. Highly recommended."

"Rickting","7","1","2","7 May 2016"," Does this horror cult classic live up to the hype?
","I have finally got round to seeing Saw, one of the most popular and commercially successful horror movies of the 2000s. In Saw, 2 men wake up in an abandoned bathroom and are put through a sadistic, grisly test. While the sequels evidently ramp the gore and violence up to 11, this is a low budget movie (As is clear and not in a good way during certain scenes) which makes heavy use of just one location. Saw doesn't live up to the gore hype, but that's a good thing. It actually shows a bit of restraint. It still earns its 18 certificate though. It's a full-on, brutal and nasty horror film but here much of the horror is psychological, which makes it more effective as a whole. I rate James Wan as a director, and he directs the film pretty well even if it looks like a music video at times. The writing is a bit uneven, with plenty of bland dialogue and illogical moments while the acting really isn't great. It can feel, as a film, fairly cold and emotionless, and it takes a little while to get going. Still, Saw is a smart and twisty treat for horror fans and the famous twist ending will really get you if you don't know it (I, unfortunately, did). Saw is a pleasant surprise and an absolutely solid thriller that deserves more credit from the critics than it gets.<br/><br/>7/10"
"vishaal811","6","1","2","5 June 2015"," A One-Time Watch
","Saw is highly regarded as one of the most influential horror movies of the 21st century. If the role of the movie is to disturb the viewer and make them question their own actions, then it succeeds in its goal. However, any movie even if it is a Horror flick, must have characters which you can root for, who are able to enable the viewer to feel the emotions that the characters are feeling. Due to budget constraints, the filmmakers decide to lock the two leading characters inside a room which ensures a claustrophobic atmosphere that complements the paranoia engulfing these men. Due to its short run time, the characters feel underdeveloped and because of that we can never truly feel any sorrow for them. A common problem to all the movies to the horror genre is that most of the plot is filled with clichés which have already been done in other movies. Saw is no exception and it can get a bit irritating to see things that you have seen in countless other horror movies. The movie is not very simple to understand and will confuse some viewers. I did not particularly enjoy watching this movie but everyone should watch it and form their own judgement."

Monica Potter plays Elwes's wife who uses brains to gain freedom and a mother's will to fight back. Shawnee Smith plays a victim who had escaped a trap thus spotlighted in hopes of getting into the psyche of the killer. Directed by James Wan with graphic violence yet clever writing.

","Every decade, the horror genre becomes re-defined. In the 50s, it was Universal with their giant bugs. In the 60s, it was Alfred Hitchcock with PSYCHO and then George Romero with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The 70s saw a dramatic spike in wild and woolly films, like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, HALLOWEEN, and countless others. The 80s had their run of ""dead-teen"" flicks. Followed closely in the 90s by the ""copycat killers"", like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Right before the start of the millennium, along came THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. While I personally didn't find it as scary as they made it out to be, it certainly paved the way for a sub-genre of ""shaky-cam horror"", like PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES and REC. Finally, in the mix, came what could best be described as ""puzzle bloodbaths"". And that's when SAW came into being. In the world of film, the simplest way to make a movie is take a camera, two actors, and put them in a room for 90 minutes or so. And that's pretty much what SAW is.<br/><br/>The story: Adam, a photographer, and Lawrence, a doctor, wake up in a dark room chained at opposite ends. Through a series of harrowing flashbacks, they try to piece together how they ended up trapped. It turns out there's a devious killer on the loose, nicknamed ""Jigsaw"". See, he likes to put people into elaborate traps and then the victims have to do increasingly-horrendous things to be set free. The occasional deviation outside of the room, focusing on other characters, is a little distracting and unnecessary. Because both actors inside the room give such authentic and believable performances. I particularly liked Cary Elwes. Apart from that, fellow blood fiends will not be disappointed in the special effects department. Let me just say that SAW lives up to its name. But please, gentle maniacal viewer, don't bother with any of the sequels. They're just blood messes without any of the finesse of the original!"
"lawstua","Null","1","2","30 August 2011"," Nothing new here
","For a film that supposedly spawned the entire 'torture-porn' sub-genre, 'SAW' turns out to be surprisingly conventional and lacking in gore . After an ingenious set-up, the plot quickly unravels into a mess of implausible plot twists and horror clichés. Any horror film that shows heroes that are too stupid to put away the bad guy when they have him cornered, or bad guys that just get up like nothing happened after being shot, or serial killers that are permitted to operate in a vacuum with no effort by the city authorities at a man-hunt, runs the risk in this post Scream world of being viewed as a mere rehash rather than a reinvention of the genre."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","2","27 March 2011"," Was this drip really necessary?
","Saw is an unpleasant, macabre little piece of business that, for ninety minutes wallows in illogical nonsense and human suffering. It might be a total washout if I didn't admire that fact that the screenwriter obviously spent hours and hours over his word processor trying to weave this clockwork plot into something better than your average horror movie knock-around. Where most horror movies are simply brainless trash, this is a hard working screenplay that isn't brilliant but at least gets some points for effort.<br/><br/>It opens with an interesting idea. A man wakes up submerged in a bathtub and emerges only to realize that he is in a large filthy old bathroom in an unknown location. He is Adam and he finds that he is chained to the wall. On the other side of the room, also chained to the wall, is Dr. Laurence Gordon (Carey Elwes), a man seemingly in the same predicament that may likely have the same ending for them as the poor soul who's corpse lies between them in a pool of his own blood.<br/><br/>Clues comes sporadically over time as they are given instructions from a killer called Jigsaw that Dr. Gordon has seven hours to kill Adam, lest his wife and daughter be killed instead. Laurence, the smarter of the two seems to be better at deducing than Adam and he quickly figures out some of the clues to their escape. Problem is, this scenario is so tricky that if he makes one false move it could mean a gruesome death for all involved.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, out in the world, two detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are trying to crack the mystery of Jigsaw. They begin by investigating the death of a man who was forced to crawl through razor wire to exact his own escape. Currently however, their only witness is Amanda, an emotionally shaken heroine addict who survived one of Jigsaw's traps. Long ago she found herself tied to a chair with a large metal device locked to her jaw and was instructed that she had only a few minutes to get the key, lest her head be wrenched apart. The key: Hiding in the stomach of the man lying on the floor in front of her.<br/><br/>These horrifying elements all eventually converge on one another into a bucket of red herrings and twisty plot turns that seem clever at the moment but seem less and less logical the more you try to reason them out. It may not be necessary to understand why Jigsaw conceives of these traps but one does have to wonder about the time, the patience, the planning and the resources needed to construct such terrible traps.<br/><br/>On the outset, the movie plays with our senses. This is a grungy little thriller that often makes us squirm, not for what is happening but the concept of what it happening. Who will the killer turn out to be? What is the motive behind it all? Will Dr. Gordon kill Adam? Will the killer murder Dr. Gordon's family? What happens when the clock runs out? Who is the dead man in that bathroom? What is the point of all this? The movie weaves together all of these questions and more but, sadly, to very little payoff. What comes of these devilish tricks and traps is a movie that seems intriguing the less you think about it. The pain and torture and human suffering is fine from a surface standpoint but gets more mean-spirited and depressing the longer it goes on, until it reaches and ending that was a nice surprise but, wow, left me feeling sad and miserable."
"fearfulofspiders","4","1","2","27 September 2008"," The Buildup Leads to a Lackluster Ending...
","What to say about Saw? Probably that as thrilling as it may come off from all the sequels, there's nothing that makes these films, nor this one, remotely good.<br/><br/>This is a very ugly, grotesque, and disgusting looking film. From atmosphere down to the settings, this movie has no aesthetics. The acting is terrible; why on Earth Danny Glover is in this film is beyond me. I was sincerely shocked that Michael Emerson was in this, but at least he provided an ideal performance; one that all the other actors could look up to. Karl Elwes is very uninspired, as all he does is talk in a raspy voice and yell a lot.<br/><br/>The terror that is in this film is hardly terrifying. Is it thrilling? At times, yes. Is it at all memorable? No. With all the running around and yelling, it all builds up to one of the most lackluster endings of the decade.<br/><br/>James Wan's story and direction would make Se7en quiver with flattery, as this film contains no depth, nor reality to maintain it as a memorable thriller. In fact, the screenplay is so limited, that when these guys are given a time limit to escape, all they do is reminisce about what they were doing before they ended up in Hell's restroom; very silly and highly stupid.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly advise anyone seeking a movie with thrills to watch it, because, after all, that is the intended search. Then again, those impressed with films like Se7en or The Silence of the Lambs, will find no film equivalent to them. Instead, they will get a mediocre story that has spawned numerous, unoriginal sequels that one can only pray ends sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>Skip this film, please."
"stewiefan201","6","1","2","6 March 2008"," Saw has an interesting fresh story, but it's very unrealistic.
","The Saw series has really come impressively far with 4 sequels in just a minimum of 4 years. They mostly got worse as they went along but never mind that for now. Saw is about 2 men who wake up chained to pipes at different ends of a dirty abandoned warehouse bathroom. They cannot reach other but in the middle of the room is a dead man, with a gun with one bullet in his hand. One is named Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes) and the other is a young guy named Adam (Leigh Whannel). After finding tape recorded messages they realize they are being held captive by the elusive Jigsaw killer. Dr Gordon is told he only has a few hours to kill Adam or his wife and kid will die. The Jigsaw killer is explained in the papers as kidnapping people he finds undeserving of life, and puts them through grisly tests which they can survive if they try hard enough. While Adam and Dr Gordon try to work out their game, 2 other stories are occurring at the same time. Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) is a discharged cop obsessed with finding the Jigsaw killer, and his main suspect is none other than Dr Gordon. Meanwhile Dr Gordon's wife and daughter are being held captive in order to interlock with his game. As the hours tick down and time gets shorter, the two strangers must fight for survival before it's too late.<br/><br/>Saw is a grisly film with a script full of twists and turns. The plot itself is original and kept my interest, but if you ask me there's no imaginable way something like this could happen in real life. The characters become more developed and shady as the film progresses. The actors playing these characters are not great, in fact some of their acting moments are down right laughable. This is probably Danny Glover's worst performances since I was shaking my head at some of the lines he had to say. Saw is not very scary relying more on suspense and shock moments. However the Jigsaw villain is quite interesting as with a sinister motive and a mysterious allure. Now for the blood and gore levels. The movie is really not as gory as it was made out to be, but that does not mean it doesn't have its nasty moments, because believe me it does. The traps are intriguing and creative, but not realistic at all. Jigsaw would have to be an engineering mastermind and have lots of available money in order to create them. Since he's constantly on the run from police and is such a shady person, it is very hard to believe.<br/><br/>The writer of the film Leigh Whannel, who also plays the role of Adam, shows talent in the horror genre. His story creates an eery situation with more going on than meets the eye. The one most believable point of the movie is the two men chained up in the room, who react exactly how anybody would if put in a situation like this. However I don't think Leigh Whannel should have been a main character because he's not very good at acting, he's okay in some parts but when he has to scream and yell I'll bet anything the theater laughed their heads off. The director James Wan also seems to be very talented. With the help of the cinematographers he creates an extreme, and I mean extreme, sense of style to Saw. However it really starts to get annoying after a while. For instance every time we get a flashback to one of Jigsaw's past traps the camera changes angles at lightning speed, spins around the victim real fast, and flashes bright lights and colors in your eyes. I thought I was going to go blind which obviously meant the editing and cinematography styles went way too far over the edge. It would have added a lot to the creepiness if they kept everything still and relaxed, but instead the filmmakers abuse this technique style and ruin any scary aspect of the film, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Saw was very suspenseful to the point where I had to see it to the end. It draws you in with its strange atmosphere, and the characters evolve to the point where I got pretty interested in how it would all end up. Believe me the climax of the movie is really fulfilling and a true ""I never saw that coming"" moment. Although the movie is not great it will still please horror lovers. I give Saw a 2.5 out of 4. I expected blood and gore but got more than that. The sequels however are a whole other story."

","with all the hype surrounding this picture perhaps i expected too much; but without any narrative structure and frankly woeful acting performances (with special recognition going to Cary Elwes for what has to be the worst acting ever) The plot is weak, it's is almost like the script was being written as they went along.Danny Glover's performance is just confusing and you could have cut his part from the film and nobody would have noticed.In theory this is a great idea for a horror movie but it never hits the marks it sets for itself. The editing just confuses the audience rather than add to the tension, and by the end when the inevitable ""twist"" arrives i just thought, ho hum. Not as bad as Hostel, but not a great deal better either."

I know you are probably thinking how can a girl who hated Hostel like the Saw movies. It might be because i saw Saw(ha ha)first but it might be because Saw has a story and isn't a piece of crap that should be burnt ASAP.<br/><br/>The twist was amazing. I didn't see it coming. When the twist is revealed you will be sitting there like OMG.<br/><br/>Unlike the twist the acting was not so amazing. Cary Elwes was great but he had moments of over the top acting. Actually he had a lot of moments. Leigh Whannell was pretty crap.

","Sure, there have been several films like this before where some detectives are investigating serial killer's minds and the murders that follow. There was first, ""Silence of the Lambs,"" then there was ""Se7en,"" then ""Kiss the Girls,"" and the French series of ""Crimson Rivers"" films. <br/><br/>But here we have a bit more horror elements borrowed from over-rated films that weren't good to begin with like ""Texas Chainsaw"" and ""Mindhunters."" But while that might be original, the film can not escape seclusion from being just ""plain-out loud stupid"" and while I know this genre is meant to scare or thrill people, I couldn't enjoy the film in a ""popcorn"" sort of way.<br/><br/>Also, the actors are wasted here big time! Cary Elwes is trapped with another guy and his connection with this entire case is explained thru flashbacks, but he never really stands out, he just kinda looks frantic, but bland at the same time; Danny Glover ( Lethal Weapon series, Shooter) and Ken Leung ( Rush Hour, X3, Spy Game, Inside Man) have nothing really to do with their detective characters who just stand around on monitors just looking at what the killer is going to do next; Dina Meyer ( Starship Troopers, the awful ""Saw"" sequels) only says dialog that what the viewer is already thinking, but doesn't move the plot forward at all with what she's given; Monica Potter has nothing really to do as the wife of Elwe's character; and the only real standout is Tobin Bell as the serial character who is playing mind-games with everyone and would return as the character in the sequels to cause more mayhem and carnage!<br/><br/>And last of all, the ending is so predictable and lame, it made me want to cringe! It was pretty darn obvious that Jigsaw was the ""supposedly dead"" guy on the floor, who then locks up Cary Elwes in the cell forever. Elwes starts to scream, ""NOOOOOO!"" Cut to end credits and there is no music, but there is a rhythm of screaming agonies. <br/><br/>This leads me to say that the people who created this flick should go to jail for actually thinking such disturbing thoughts. Seriously, this is so callous even for a horror flick. Plus, who roots for the bad guy to get away anyway?!? That's just plain out wrong!"
"conmech","10","1","2","1 November 2007"," Best Thriller Ever!!!
","In the recent years, the horror movies have evolved and finally stopped trying to ""scare"" the audience. No matter how gory, loud or jumpy a movie is, it is almost impossible to scare an intellectual scary movie enthusiast with clown dolls or simple ghost stories, because he's just seen tens of them. Because of this fact, the new generation of horror movies entertain the viewer with either the element of ""surprise & shock"" (like ""Identity"", ""Others"") or ""beautiful shooting & fx"" (like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""28 Days Later""). ""SAW"" uses the ""surprise"" element, and does it all the way to make me say ""Holy CRAP!"" out loud. The plot is beautifully written, makes you more curious by each second that passes by, and fully satisfies the horror-lover in the end. Furthermore it does all these with a budget of 1 million dollars and an inexperienced director! Indeed there will probably be wannabe intellectual people who will try to find flaws in it or tell they don't like it, just to create controversy and to look different. Other than that, I can't imagine any horror/thriller lover dislike this movie."

This special effect is not hard to do. The story was also extremely ridiculous. No one could ever sit there that long in the middle of the floor. Everyone else that was a victim was there for a reason, but there was no reason for him to be there. Vincent Price is rolling in his grave for someone making such a horrible horror/thriller.

","It really does give people bad ideas, not to mention a built-in disposition for fearing their fellow man. I mean, seriously, who thinks crap like this up? And why are they not in an insane asylum? That being said, the plot was a bit contrived, and I felt it was kind of obvious what was going on -- no single person could be manipulating all of the scenarios presented. There were too many contradictions to find this plausible (let alone mysterious).<br/><br/>The gore is typical; the direction was interesting. Perhaps the small budget made for the stop-action scenes for a car chase? It just took too long to get where it was going, and all the backstory information gave everything away. Movies like this make a living off foreshadowing, so the clever eye sees all.<br/><br/>Will I bother see parts two and three? Not sure.

"mythosloki","4","1","2","20 October 2006"," What could've been a good movie is destroyed by poor casting, poor scripting, and mediocre directing
","I didn't understand the reason why people all screamed about how good this movie is. Clearly the director did not feel that the movie was successful since he only became the producer for the next movies. I saw the premise of the movie to be near the lines of Se7en. The story follows the serial killer, showing shots of his previous crimes while at the same time show the current crime with the two people in the locked room. There is also the detectives trying to solve the case. Se7en didn't share the same level of importance on the victims... except for the last four, however the script, actors, and directing was perfect. Saw would've been a good movie if instead of just skimming over past crimes and half heartedly following the detectives and the victims, choose one group to follow. Then you have to cast good people to play the roles. Directing will then follow and be at least much better. It was a huge disappointment."
"Phantasm01","2","1","2","2 August 2006"," Sorry but after 3 viewings I still do not get the hype...
","I usually rewatch films several times when the general consensus says they are good and I don't initially agree, just to see what exactly I missed (if anything). Well, I've watched Saw three times now (most recently, a few nights ago) and I am still trying to figure out what's so great about it. Possibly it is ""decent"" or ""promising""... but classic? I just don't see it. Instead of getting better with each viewing, the problems of this one just become more and more apparent the more times you watch it.<br/><br/>I don't want to go on a HUGE rant but this movie is just too uneven all the way around. First off, any film that uses generic industrial metal on the soundtrack and ""flashy"" editing just to be ""edgy"" is automatically annoying out of the gate as far as I'm concerned. The general premise is fairly good (at least better than most), but the plot is full of holes and riddled with coincidences. In fact, in many ways Jigsaw's plan will completely fall apart if people in that cast don't do incredibly stupid, implausible things, which they of course do. And while we're on Jigsaw; he's basically just a less interesting version of Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell's acting was uneven, downright bad at times. And don't get me started on Elwes' wife in this movie. What a stupid twit. Danny Glover's detective character had muddled motivations to be sure, plus I just didn't care about him and was basically annoyed and bored with any of the scenes that cut away from the bathroom. The dialogue was poor a good deal of the time as well. And the ending... whoa boy, no comment.<br/><br/>It's cool if you love this movie. I don't want to be a complete ass about it but I just don't really understand its popularity, its reputation or its 7.6 rating on IMDb, which implies its one of the greatest horror films of all time."
"morpheous1286-1","2","1","2","21 July 2006"," I WISH it had been worth my time.
","I remember being extremely excited for this movie to come out in theaters. I flocked to see it on the first day. The concept was great. But I was hoping to go to a reasonably intelligent story about a serial killer. I was prepared for joyous blood and violence, what I wasn't prepared for was Saw. In about 80% of American Horror films, you can find a number of cliché's used because they are said to work. But I was hoping that Saw would be one of those films that would step away from the things that I had seen, show me something new, no matter how small. Serial Killers are very interesting characters, and their M.O.'s generally tie back into their mentality somehow. What was so disappointing about Saw was that the killer's method was interesting, but his motives were crap. The best killers(see Se7en) get inside your head, you find yourself rooting for them, even identifying with them, THAT is what scares you. Jigsaw's motives felt like something tacked on JUST so he would exist, he had no real purpose other than driving a movie. Bringing me to the ending, the ending of the film is so stupid, cheating so badly that literally 20 minutes into the film, after examining the setup, I thought to myself, ""now what is the most contrived, and horrible way that they can end this?"" I guessed correctly, but dismissed it giving the movie the benefit of the doubt. I was right... not a great feeling. In fact, I probably would have forgiven the contrivances in the middle of the film if only it had not ended the way that it did. Let's face it; the best serial killer movies are those in which we see the killer in all of their bloodthirsty glory. All in all, I went in hoping that I could put Saw among films like Se7en, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer or Silence of the Lambs, instead it will forever remain a monumental waste of a very good chance at something disgusting, depraved, and yet, intelligent and chilling... DON'T EVEN ASK ABOUT SAW II (the same method used to guess the ending was applied, and paid off.)"
"Sccrream97-1","5","1","2","13 July 2006"," Saw: A Movie in Search of a Brain
","Horror films have become simulated Hollywood snuff in recent years: mean, baseless violence that does not revolve around an engaging plot. If you want to see a REAL horror film that ""Saw"" ripped off, then go see ""Seven"". In contrast to Saw, Seven was brutal for a purpose...there was no inkling that indicated David Fincher to be a nihilistic, twenty something with nothing better to do than shock people. His work since has further shown his interest in emulating Hitchcock, rather than the makers of ""I Spit On Your Grave"". Seven did not actually show the tortures while Saw picks this up as the basis for a movie, not realizing that NOT seeing them is exactly what makes these scary in the first place. Is SAW entertaining? Yes. But I think we should examine after wards how good we feel about ourselves for thinking so. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, pop culture has a memory of only five to ten years, and since Seven is about that old, it's no surprise that it's been forgotten in favor of Saw, which inexplicably got over a 7 on IMDb, something I find very telling about our culture. Seven was smart, instead of just acting like it. It had some reasonable logic, with a realistic enough serial killer.<br/><br/>However, Saw does not rely on any character or villain that interests you, but a vacuous machine of one known as ""Jigsaw"". Ironically, this ""character""'s real name is ""John""; a name that is indicative of what he really is: a ""John Doe"", a character with no life, purpose, or back story. But of course, as some readers would point out, Jigsaw does have an origin. True, but it is no more realistic than say, the Incredible Hulk's. In that sense it takes away a great deal from the very pseudo-realism that is supposed to propel the chills in Saw.<br/><br/>The main problem with Saw is its maddeningly illogical logic; it's as if someone has given you a Jigsaw puzzle to solve, one that should open up the secrets of this plot, yet they've failed to give you all the pieces. It would be better if it didn't feel like it was done not on purpose, but because of the sheer incompetence of the writing.<br/><br/>***Note: I did like Saw II, but only because it didn't attempt to insult my intelligence by pretending to have one.***"

"mentalcritic","8","1","2","12 December 2005"," Not the classic people say it is, but quite good, nonetheless
","With the film industry reportedly experiencing major downturns in its intake, and studios contemplating bankruptcy, stagnation is the order of the day in mainstream film. Everything must be toned down in order to appeal to the broadest audience in a curious disregard for the fact that trying to please everyone ends up pleasing no one. Yet Hollywood seemed genuinely surprised that this film, made for a mere 1.2 million US dollars, made back fifteen times its budget and then some on its opening weekend. I can sum it up quite simply. Saw is the first horror film in over a decade to recognise that its audience will almost exclusively be made up of adults, and plays its material accordingly. In case some glass-eyed film executive reads this comment, I cannot stress enough the difference this makes. Saw and its sequel (which I actually watched first) are the first two horror films, at least if you go by production date, that have actually made me horrified since I was in my teens. Perhaps its success will finally mean the end of all the I Know What Your Breasts Did Last Summer types.<br/><br/>Yet for such a remarkable film, Saw's premise is amazingly simple. Two men wake up in a filthy bathroom, unable to remember how they got there. As one begins to fearfully wonder if one of his kidneys is missing, we learn the other is a surgeon. Slowly, we are filled in on the existence of a bizarre serial killer whose chief delight is in testing how far his victims will go in order to preserve their lives. In so doing, he puts his victims in traps, then very casually explains to them how they can get out. The kicker is that he does not lie to them or hide the salient details from them. He gives them a very good, and very obvious, clue. So obvious, in fact, that our victims often overlook it. In the case of the two men in the bathroom, for example, he leaves them chained to pipes against a wall, with hacksaws to be easily found. The pipes and the chains are too strong to be sawn through in the time it would take them to starve to death. Those who have seen the original Mad Max will know exactly where this puzzle is going (one has to wonder if this was a deliberate reference).<br/><br/>Surprisingly for a film with such a low budget, Saw also contains a few recognisable faces. Danny Glover is the most famous man to appear in Saw, and one has to wonder exactly how such a cheap production secured his services. A Nicholson-like promise of box office percentage comes to mind. Shawnee Smith gives a brief turn as the one victim of Jigsaw to get away, and it is remarkable that for a character whose vocabulary mostly consists of screaming and crying, her performance is quite watchable. Dina Meyer fills in for a scene as a detective, but her role probably amounted to less than a day's work on this set. Her role is considerably expanded in the sequel, which was green-lit the weekend that this film opened. But it is the performance of Tobin Bell, the man who plays Jigsaw, that really hooks the viewer. For the most part, one only hears his voice, and I am not going to spoil the surprise, but suffice to say that you see him throughout most of the film. When it is finally revealed who he is, you will not know whether to laugh, cry, or throw up.<br/><br/>Yet, for all its simple charm, Saw is not without problems. The cameo-like appearances of some actors is somewhat jarring, and plot threads that feature them often seem to go nowhere. Shawnee and Dina get about five minutes of screen time at the most, and some of the scenes they appear in leave one to wonder what happened to this or that plot idea. It is also very difficult to make a film that focuses on two men in a room retain its tension, and the director seems to recognise this, too. There are an awful lot of sequences outside of the room showing the situation of ancillary characters where leaving it to the viewer's imagination would have worked so much better. I suspect that the director realised this in the sequel, too, because aside from moments of the police trying to find where the victims are, the entire film focused instead on seeing the situation through their eyes. So yes, there are some flaws to Saw, and it is not a ten out of ten film, but it comes so much closer than anything else the majors have the nerve to call horror these days.<br/><br/>In all, I gave Saw an eight out of ten. It is truly deserving of the cult and mainstream following has, even if it is not a masterpiece. If Saw and its success does not wake the MPAA up to the fact that people are sick of their modern Hayes Code, then they ought to be cast aside."
"morphion2","8","1","2","7 January 2006"," Gets The Job Done
","It's not often that we see young Australian film-makers exploding onto the scene with a film as popular as ""Saw"". The 2004 horror-thriller of choice is the work of two Melbourne-born film graduates, Leigh Whannel and James Wan, whose project was picked up by Lion Gate Films on good faith when they took it to the states. The pair managed to pick up some moderately big names for the picture (Carey Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter) and co-writer Leigh Whannel even landed himself a starring role. However, impressive as their skill and success may be, does the film itself stand up to its hype? <br/><br/>We begin with two men, Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) and Adam (Whannel) waking in a dirty underground bathroom, chained to the walls with leg manacles and supplied with one hacksaw each. They soon learn that they are the latest victims of the notorious serial killer known as Jigsaw, whose methods involve putting his prey into situations in which they must either suffer horribly or die. Given a deadline for their escape, the two must attempt to outwit their psychopathic captor and save Gordon's family, as well as their own lives.<br/><br/>The film is very much in the vein of ""Se7en"", David Fincher's famous horror-thriller in which a serial killer punishes his victims for being excessive perpetrators of the seven deadly sins. Both films use the same dark, gritty color scheme and both excel in graphically horrific but admirably imaginative torture scenarios. Teenagers will have a ball with ""Saw"", which is steeped in violence and disturbing imagery. The plot itself has the indefinite quality of ambiguity, the tipping point of which would be what the writers' true intention was. If they were having a bit of fun with the whole ""crazed serial-killer who comes up with self-righteous justifications"" shtick, then they've done well. If they were serious, then the plot should not and could not be analyzed to any serious degree.<br/><br/>Strong points of the film include a premise and approach that is both more thoughtful and more mature than most films of this genre. Whatever the flaws of the film, it should not be dismissed as a mere blood fest. Rather, it is a genuine and fairly effective attempt to bring the horror genre back to its roots. Take one look at the masters (Edgar Alan Poe, Alfred Hitchcock) and you see that their intention was to deeply disturb their audience, not simply disgust them, and this is something that Saw definitely has over its fellow horror-flicks. Not wanting to lose its teenage demographic, it takes pride in its modernity but still remembers why horror fans go to the movies.<br/><br/>Its success as a horror movie aside, if horror is not your type of movie, then ""Saw"" is about as far from your cup of tea as you can get. Obviously it's nice to see Australians getting out there and making it happen, so good on Wan and Whannel for their efforts and success, but have no illusions about their vision: they want to make the bottoms drop out of their audience's stomachs, so if you'd rather have a few laughs, either develop a pretty warped sense of humor or go see something else."

","Hi, I'm from Czech Republic and I love this film!! It is the best movie in psycho thriller genre!!!! And I love the end of this movie and the music playing with. Adam is so handsome:-) But I don't know, if Adam really died. We can just presume it. Do you know, that Leigh Whannell, who played Adam is corporate author in the movie Saw 2? You can answer me, what do you think about my grammar:) and about this movie. And I like English quotes of this movie. I hate dubbing in movies, which are nerve-wracking:) And..I have some questions for you. Have you ever seen anyone famous?? I mean..Some Hollywood star, or TV star. There are, in our state not much actors. In USA are so much famous people and actors. Amerika had so many movies and TV series.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen some Czech movie?? Do you know for example movie Zelary?? Zelary was nominated up to the Oscar in category the best foreign-language movie. But, it won not.<br/><br/>I don't know, what I have more write:-) What I want to write, it isn't in my English learning:-))"

","This movie has an great potline but it ain't an horror movie. It is a thriller. The idea is very great. Two men at bathroom dared to kill the other one. It is said that its very horrifying and scary. But when I watched this I could watch this without even changin look on my face. It is very terrifying as you're made to watch something very twisted. I don't name it, I don't want to spoil this movie. The plot line was so great. If you think what is going on it turns and confuses you. And the ending was great. I never expected an big fight at the end but never thinked that Jigsaw could even be him. But I say that those ""scary horror"" parts were lame. They didn't work. But if someone gets scared I can just laugh at him. How someone over 18 years gets scared about this movie as 14 years old boy wont???? Yeah, I am 14 years old and I watched this movie from the very beginning. And I wasn't scared. I was amazed how good the plot line was. How it could keep you confused from the beginning to the end. I say this. Why they bother making a sequel for this when the Jigsaw gets known in th end of this movie. Or isn't that guy the Jigsaw? I don't know but I must watch the sequel and hope that it wont ruin the greatness of Saw. I am on a search for scary movie with great plot line. What I found from this movie was only great plot line and that sucks as hell. I am saying that go rent this great thriller and get amazed how it can be so great. Get amazed how great the plot line is. Get amazed how terrifying this movie can be. It left me to hold breath in some very twisted moments. Oh yeah, here comes some minuses. It has very quick ""mtv"" cuts and it looks pretty ridiculous. And there is too much flashbacks, even flashback in a flashback."

","The list goes on and on. Saw is one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. And I've seen my fair share (Saving Private Ryan,The Passion Of The Christ,Saw II). I knew there would be twists at the ending-and I'm not just talking about the ""corpse"" in the middle of the bathroom-the one twist that really got me was that Zep himself was a pawn. The twist that really got me was the one with Tapp and the pics-I thought to myself ""What the f---?"". Another twist that stuns me was that Gordon actually cut off his freakin foot! Anyway, this is a really great movie. It really makes you value your own life a lot, at least a little more. If this was based on a true story, I would sit up and think about this sadistic bastard late at night. I saw this before Saw II, but I wouldn't miss either."

","I've watched Saw on DVD three times already. And it gives me the chill every time I watch it. Although, there are some critics about the storyline and how the whole movie plots are connected. Overall, Saw is a good slasher/thriller I'd say. At first, i thought saw was gonna be another bloody gory slasher similar to other original thriller movies, but as the plot evolves and complexes, it really gets me into watching it till the end. I liked the unprecedented ending, that the real ""killer"" was found lying on the floor in a room where the two victims were stuck in. And this gives the entire movie a good remark for its uniqueness."

","The reason i only give a nine is because the film reached not a tenth of it's potential. Due to no name actors, a low budget and some rushed directing. But the story is unbelievable. I won't go into it but the twist was genius. I thought James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer, Actor) were gonna be sick freaks but i listened to the audio commentary on the DVD and they're just typical teenage Australians with some serious talent. I'm looking forward to SAW III which i'm pretty sure has been announced and also silence which i don't know much about but i'm sure it'll bring those stories and twists of pure Whannell gold.<br/><br/>Rock on boys and keep those films coming.

"lostgallifreyan","10","1","2","27 November 2005"," The 'final twist' is NOT the last.
","*** SPOILER AHEAD, a big one. Don't read if you want to see this movie, as it will kill almost ALL the plot at once. Watch the movie, then come back to read this. :)<br/><br/>OK, everyone's looking for reason in this, it's the way thrillers work. There is one that over-rules the rest. There is no killing, not even a set-up. It's all in one guy's mind. We are even told whose mind that is. He lies there, still alive in the midst of the rotted pipework of his own brain as it decays while he is still trying to use it. We've seen the proof, his x-ray is shown by Dr. Gordon to be a mess of terminal cancer, the entire frontal lobe is consumed, pretty much. We are led to think he gets out of hospital and later becomes fit and mentally coherent enough to outwit and out-struggle all those who interfere with his plans. Nonsense! That man would never have left a bed! He is dying, and probably has days or weeks at most remaining to him. What we are seeing is his deranged and resentful visions as he puts together the pieces of the lives of those around him while the basis of his own life is falling apart. He probably learns of Dr. Gordon's wife and child through words heard during phone calls made in his presence, and fantasises, voluntarily or otherwise, ways in which they become part of various scenes acting out his increasingly extreme revenge on all those who still have their lives intact. He's falling to pieces, he was an inventive, intelligent man who liked complex models and puzzles, and all he can do with that skill now is dream his revenge on life in fragments of increasingly desperate images. They don't even have to make that much sense, the thing that really cuts deep is the realisation that maybe the enforced derangement of a brain being eaten away can do that to someone, so that they finally die, and the end of the game is nothing but one tormented piece of his own mind witnessing the departure of another. That is a truly terrible and subtle plot, and spelling it out at the end would be pointless, given that the clues were laid clearly throughout the movie. Actually, by revealing the guy in the midst of his own terrible creation, his modelling of events, they pretty much did spell it out. Once you remember that even that derelict toilet was modelled in advance, as shown in the earlier scenes, I'd say the plot was laid on with a trowel. >:) Which makes it very strange that I haven't seen anyone else see what I have seen in it.<br/><br/>To those who said it wasn't scary, I say it was. I've seen Cannibal Holocaust, Ichi The Killer, Battle Royale, and several other notably shocking movies, and Saw was more genuinely harrowing than most. I didn't figure it out till after the end, and had to watch bits again to confirm the clues were really there as I suspected. They were. But what I'll remember is the feeling that went with it, the way rationality gives way to fragmentation, and the terror that comes with that. Most horror movies are a harmless escape. This isn't. And trying to find ways to avoid its core won't get you off the hook.<br/><br/>So many naysayers, and so many stupid reasons for disappointment! One says the plot was full of needless exposition, another said it totally lacked explanations. Yet another complained about the nonlinear plot, saying that recounting the earlier captures lacked suspense because the characters had already been shown to be 'fine'. I wonder if he'd feel 'fine' chained to the rusty pipes of a forgotten toilet under some derelict building. I think these people lost the plot, and believe me, it's not a plot for the meat-brained to get. Even those who rated this movie highly seem to have missed the final turn. Maybe I'm imagining this, but as I see it, it makes a terrible, inevitable sense of the entire movie, and might explain why it was so unsettling that it left the naysayers desperately grasping for reasons why it anguished them to write here instead of being as truly indifferent as many of them claim.<br/><br/>I'm giving this the full ten, a plot like that would not have embarrassed a mature Alfred Hitchcock, so as this is the first movie from a new director, it deserves the full score. I know there were points where logic seemed to slip, points where any of us can see better plans of action, but a movie isn't a series of little exercises, it's a vision. It's only those who miss that who get caught up in the small rationalisations rather than the big ones. I ought to know, I was a terrible person to watch a movie with as a kid, I'd ask everyone around me to help me understand every little thing, and I am thankful I have lived enough to see more than I would if they could have told me. The only thing that would surprise me about that movie now is if the director said that they never intended any of what I saw in it. Which is doubtful considering the number of clues they laid for us all to see."

","The concept is pretty sadistic. two men are chained on opposite sides of a filthy room. they both have to play the game of a sadistic serial killer who ""teaches"" the value of life through his murders. One of the two men,Lawrence, has to kill the other, Adam. Adam could kill Lawrence first, but neither of them can accomplish this without first sawing off the ankle of which their chains hold them.<br/><br/>When i heard about this movie, i thought to myself ""Okay this movie is just an excuse to show sadistic, brutal and disturbing murders"". That might be true, but the story as a whole is quite interesting. before i continue, i'll come right out and say that most of the plot developments and concepts in this movie are either highly unlikely, or flat out bull s***.<br/><br/>this movie cares about the two men whoa re chained up. there is plenty of explanation of their lives, and we learn about the motives of two detectives as well. as a result, we the audience find ourselves caring deeply about them. I'm talking about the kind of ""caring"" feeling where you're begging the movie not to kill off your favorite character, although it's most likely going to happen.<br/><br/>The twists are, for the most part, unpredictable.<br/><br/>The acting is great. this is of course my opinion, but I couldn't see how some critics could bash the actors for not doing their job. Cary Elwes was fantastic. Danny glover was good, as he usually is. in fact I don't think i can say a negative thing about any of the cast.<br/><br/>Now, again, the plot concepts and developments are highly unlikely or flat out bull s***.

","It's been a long while since I was this scared while watching a movie and I have to say it felt great! I was never a fan of slasher movies, they always seemed to deliver (and still do) such cheap and short thrills it felt a waste of unexplored potential. Now ""Saw"" comes along, maybe the most thrilling, disturbing, horrific and fresh movie of the year, (plus immense kudos for making it on such an outstandingly small budget), and proves my previously mentioned point perfectly. Either way, I'll repeat it again-slasher movies are for pus.ies! Everything in this movie surprised me, and every surprise was more than welcome. Like the dreadful Jigsaw's mind ""Saw"" feels prepared in advance and knows exactly what it has to do. Set the trap, pick a victim (us, the audience), and leave everything else into our hands. I was genuinely petrified in every 'trap' scene, some work just because of great imagination and the main one because of the story and acting. I probably wouldn't have recognized Cary Elwes in his role, and somehow a combination of low budget meets known celebrity faces works really well. I will give you no gory details, you should go see this movie with absolutely no information whatsoever-just step into a world of senseless sense. I couldn't help but admire the crazy Jugsaw man, as sick and banal it may seem, but his character makes a lot of sense. Which, in the end, when we are let to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, makes this movie more than worth your while.<br/><br/>Perversely enjoyable, incredibly well paced and thought out, impressively acted(and I'm talking especially about Cary Elwes's character in the end) and directed with a fresh new approach and interesting cinematography, ""Saw"" is a pure cult classic. You will not forget about it, you will only appreciate it-just like Jugsaw wanted you to;)Can't wait to see the next installment!<br/><br/>9/10 - Recommendations: Anyone who's looking for much more than a cheap thrill"

","I find it depressing that so many people think this sad, laughable mess is a decent movie. Someone called it Se7en for Dummies, which does Se7en a real injustice. Well, at least it was better than Crossbones, which was Plan 9 bad. <br/><br/>Other posters have commented on the many, many flaws in logic, but here's the one that bothered me the most, because it renders the entire premise invalid. (If someone has already commented on this and I didn't see it, please excuse me.)<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>Jigsaw allegedly disapproves of those who ""don't appreciate life."" The junkie woman in the bear-trap device is told she can go free if she cuts into the body of another human being to find the key that will release her. It turns out he isn't dead, and she has to make a choice. She does. She kills the man, and frees herself. Her behavior is utterly selfish, and Jigsaw rewards her for her ruthlessness. She later says: ""He helped me,"" as if being forced to do this has made her a better person. As far as I can tell, no irony is intended. It would be cooler, and more logical, if she cuts him open and finds a tape that says: ""Sorry, wrong choice. You're supposed to appreciate the life of others, too."" Then her head gets ripped in half. So what Jigsaw really taught her is to look out for number one (he must have read a lot of Ayn Rand). Do any of the movie's fans even get this point? <br/><br/>On an unrelated point, note to director Wan: speeding up the footage so people run around in fast-forward mode is funny, not scary. It looks like Keystone Cops, and it made me laugh. If you wanted to eliminate all tension, you did the right thing. It was really hilarious near the end when Tapp is ""driving"" after Zep (Tapp and Zep? Where are Crackle and Pop?) in an obviously stationary vehicle. <br/><br/>What was with the gratuitous, endless scene of Tapp terrorizing the mom and kid for no reason? Cheap sadism? Padding out the running time? <br/><br/>This movie should have been an hour long, and on the sci-fi channel."

","Holy S..t (yeah with a capital S ).<br/><br/>It's got to be one of the most absorbing horror/thriller flick I've seen in quite a long time. Although the premises are far from being original ( a wacko trapping people to 'kill' them a la Se7en ) they manage to pull off a clever film. That's why I put the word kill under quotes in the last sentence. Because you see in fact the real drive and motivation of Jigsaw (our fuked-up psycho) is not killing people but to confront them with their wretched life and to give them the choice of either dying in a elaborate trap or finding a way out by solving the deadly puzzle. Sounds like a charmer. <br/><br/>Let's sum it up : <br/><br/><ul><li>We have a very unpredictable very clever killer ( hell I watched Red Dragon this week and I think both Hannibal and Red should take extensive lessons from him) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We have elaborate traps (and deaths) that are as fun to watch as any of your average Final Destination's deaths. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A lot of the movie takes place in a closed space ( which i think is a good way to build some tension between characters when it's cleverly done ) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We have the usual twist ( I loved it because I didn't see it coming. You see there are two ground rules in a thriller movie. The first rule is : the killer is necessarily one of the characters that appeared in front of the camera . The second rule is ALL the events have a meaning nothing is gratuitous . Knowing just that has made me able to guess all kinds of twists and events in movies so far even far-fetched ones (and no Identity doesn't count ) . And there...God it was simple but the movie is so well made that it totally distracts you from the real answer . I can't say more I don't want to spoil your fun but let me tell you that I think the end rules! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>a solid directing : not relying too heavily on hip camera tricks and editing ( don't worry there are some but only to help the story ). </li></ul><br/><br/>Yep that's it. They hit hard for a first full-length feature. Leigh Whannell is the man,dude,i tell ya.He writes he acts and he does a pretty good job at it ( even his American accent is good). <br/><br/>I can't wait to see the sequel.

","Saw is a very good thriller, with some excellent twists and good looking production design. It's got some absolutely fantastic set pieces and an excellent villain in the shape of the Jigsaw Killer. I enjoyed it, and saw it as a fantastic, slick piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>However, I had some issues with it. For one, the acting is pretty suspect. No worse than a lot of other indie thrillers, and streets ahead of some, but many of the actors turn in OTT or stereotypical turns that stopped me from truly immersing myself in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I found that I also wasn't as gripped as my colleagues when we finally sat down to watch the film. I loved certain parts of it, especially the girl in the reversed bear trap and the section in Leigh Whannels apartment, but most of the film I felt was too slick for it's own good. The movie lacks the suffocating atmosphere that makes films like Session 9, Seven and My Little Eye so disturbing and memorable, and plumps instead for a Hollywood-style atmosphere reminiscent of movies like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Red Dragon. This detracts from the impact of the horror elements.<br/><br/>Still, the plot is great, and I genuinely didn't work out whodunnit until the final reveal. Though the movie won't hold many shocks or horrors for genre vets, it's still a satisfyingly meaty film with a lot of gruesome scenes and dark ideas. Saw doesn't quite make the greatest hits list of thrillers or horror, but it's a good solid film nonetheless with a lot to offer."
"moose_hartigan","9","1","2","2 November 2005"," Few Flaws in execution but no flaws in the Idea and Concept= Good Movie
","I would like to start out by saying that this movie rocks. It was a great idea where the killer finally does more with his victims than simply stabbing them. That fact alone puts it ahead of most Slasher Horror Movies. But, to make it even better the script is brilliant. All of the deathtraps are great in concept. And certain things like the Puppet and Pig Suit {which by the way sound ridiculous} are made with great precision. The ending is very well thought out and give a great twist to the end of the film. Alas it is time for the bad. While this movie's idea is great there are some lacks in the form of direction, and budget. Although the acting was okay it would have benefited from more rehearsal and a few more takes. I mean my favorite actor on this movie was a debuting actor. Carry Elwes isn't that bad until the end when overacting kicks in to a whole new effect of horribly. Plus to be such an experienced actor Danny Glover really could've done a better job. Also Amanda's deathtrap seems just a little bit too much of a music video for my liking. But even with these problems the scares and the ending are perfected with great precision. So even with its shortcomings this is still one of my favorite horror movies of the new millennium. Watch it Now!!!!"

","Saw is a new and fresh kind of horror movie that I haven't seen before. I really liked the film, but there are 2 critical plot holes that can not be explained or forgiven and that keep this movie from being truly great. Firstly, Zep is the one person that stuck up for jigsaw and showed that he valued life. for jigsaw to involve him in one of his sick games ruins the reason behind the point of the entire film. OOPS!!! and just as ridiculous, Zep taunting Dr. Gordon's wife and kid while he has them tied up. Why? Seriously, even if it was part of Zep's instructions to cruelly play with the wife and child, HOW WOULD JIGSAW KNOW? he was laying on the floor the entire film. He didn't know what Zep was doing. He had no control over Zep at all. It was just pointless and illogical tormenting that was used to ""fool the audience"" into thinking that Zep was jigsaw. Not only do cheap tricks like that not work, but they end up ruining the logic of the film as a whole. Saw may be clever, but not clever enough to save itself."
"Lando_Hass","8","1","2","17 October 2005"," If the ending were a hamburger....bruh, it'd be the best, most intense damn hamburger imaginable.....
","About a year ago, I gave a my two cents on Saw when it first came out. Back then, I was being to critical towards it, and really stuck up about it. After watching it over about four times, I finally enjoyed it, and realized that there was some bad-assness in this movie. Now, I bring to you a better review, a bad-ass review, a review so good that my previous review is in this review's morning craps!!<br/><br/>Like I said, back then I didn't like this movie because I was looking too hard. I was expecting a deep movie with sharp plausibility. Then, as I watched this over, I realized, why the hell does this movie need it anyways? It's got a good story, a bad-ass ending, and lots of grungy violence. What more could you ask for, WHAT MORE?!<br/><br/>The story is this: Two men, Adam and Lawrence, wake up in a dirty, broken down bathroom, chained to the walls. In the middle of the room is a dead guy. In the dead guys hands are a tape recorder and a gun. The stench in the air..is misery, bruh. Lawrence is told that if he doesn't get out before 6 in the morning, his family will be killed. Adam doesn't have much to lose, except most likely his life. They don't really do much in the time they're given. They find a bunch of clues, they're called on a cell phone and threatened, and also, they're given a hacksaw. The only way to get out is to cut through their feet. Now, if I'm wrong, which I'm not, is that a good story or is that a good story? It turns out, a crazy bastard named Jigsaw is behind this. He kidnaps people, puts them in dangerous situations, and finds ways for them to kill themselves. <br/><br/>The acting isn't what you would call that great, but there's a legitimate reason: The actors didn't really have any rehearsals because the budget was so low, so it's forgiven. But, as the movie goes on, the acting gets better, especially in the parts that need good acting.<br/><br/>Now, Saw doesn't really have any scary moments, even though it should. But I figure, if the movie's entertaining, who cares? There's nothing really scary in this movie, but does that mean it isn't intense? No, it doesn't. There's only a few intense scenes in the movie: One involving a dude in his underwear tying to get out of a barbed wire maze thing, and the ending. My God, the ending. The ending is kind of like a slap in the face to the audience, but who cares? You absolutely do not expect to see what you're gonna see. When you see what you see at the very end, you're seriously wondering, ""What the F, bruh?! How's that happening?!"" The ending is so damn intense, you'll wonder how on Earth you can take it. <br/><br/>Even though there's some stupid dialogue and setups, the movie still does what it wants to: It entertains. It's not scary, but it has some intense moments, and it's grungier than something that's really grungy. Obviously, these people had fun making it, and it was an overall cool movie. Don't look for something deep when you watch it, either.<br/><br/>This is a cool movie. Hopefully, part 2 will be just as cool. Also, some Gwar tunes would have been good, but unnecessary, so don't hate it for not having any.<br/><br/>Score: 8 out of 10."

They will kill them unless you cut off your left foot with a chainsaw. Do this, and they will not only spare your lives, but also give you one million dollars. Would you do it?"" This is the premise of Saw, another in a long line of movies about cunning psychos who have unlimited time and resources. In this entry, the fiendish ""Jigsaw"" places people in seemingly hopeless situations, just to see what they would do to live a little longerand to make them appreciate living a little more. For example, a would-be suicide, who had once tried slitting his wrists, is forced to crawl naked through a lethal maze of razor wire. A young female drug addict is forced to cut into a man's stomach to pull out the key to a nasty bear-trap-like device strapped to her head, according to directions given her on video by a talking clown dummy on a tricycle.<br/><br/>Yes, Jigsaw is quite the tinkerer. He's Rube Goldberg channeling the Marquis de Sade after watching a fistful of Dario Argento and David Fincher movies. Yet he really just wants to help people. He's the Dr. Phil of psychos.<br/><br/>But the focus of the movie is two mena sleazy photographer and a doctorchained to pipes at opposite ends of what appears to be Hell's men's room. A corpse lies between them in a pool of blood, a gun in one hand and a cassette tape player in the other. Seems that Jigsaw will kill the doc's estranged wife and daughter, unless the doc kills the photographer. You're in for over a 100 minutes of head games, screaming, whimpering, whiplash editing, and enough nihilistic techno music to make Ozzy Osborne's head explode.<br/><br/>Yes, it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds. Your interpretation of the previous sentence will reveal just what kind of a movie fan you are.<br/><br/>I won't reveal much more, but note that these poor guys each have a hacksaw, not for cutting through their chains, but through their ankles. That's it, reallythe whole movie is about waiting to see some guy saw through his ankle. Oh, and there is the identity of Jigsaw, but when the revelation comes, you won't feel that you've been misdirected by a master storyteller as much as you've been rooked by a carnie.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.

But when the movie ended (and was ruined) and the person we thought was the killer was really a victim, I was disappointed. When you finish this movie, you're right back to where you started... cops and the good guys (presumably) die, and the killer gets away unscathed. The only good part of the ending was that the mother and her daughter weren't killed. I though that this movie had potential to be good, but after all of the twists that kept coming, the scary aspect of the movie was gone. I was very unhappy about the ending and I felt like I wasted two hours of my day watching Saw."
"MrBlondee","6","1","2","29 June 2005"," This isn't so great at all
","I just watched this movie in the theater with a girlfriend of mine. Well, good reviews, good rating on IMDb, good hope. I'm not going to spoil it for you but I can tell you the:<br/><br/>Acting was bad (really bad, especially the doctor was terrible). Story was plain (just some plain horror bull crap). Effects weren't there (the direction and filming was very simple).<br/><br/>So why does it still deserve a 6 out of 10? Well, the atmosphere in the film was GREAT, very spooky and gory, very nice indeed. The film itself does contain something interesting, though the story is very shallow and the characters aren't dephtened at all, it still is a reasonably good film, which with a few beers and some friends can make it a good night."
"Jess_87","10","1","2","3 June 2005"," The best film in the world!
","Saw is one of the best films I have seen ever, by far. 10/10. It is original, terrifying, and utterly brilliant. The filming and acting are both outstanding. I have never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>I was only 17 when I first saw this film. As soon as it started I knew it was going to be good. By the end of it, I found I was right. From the opening sequence where we first meet Dr Lawrence and Adam, to the chilling last line, I was clinging on to every word and every movement made. It was like no other horror/thriller movie I had ever seen before, and I have seen many. I love thrillers with lots of twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat. 'Saw' did not disappoint in that department.<br/><br/>There aren't many films, in my opinion that could live up to the standard set by this outstanding masterpiece, and has beaten all other standards set by past films, bar a very small number. One of them being Se7en. Se7en is another fantastic thriller, starring the rather nice Brat Pitt, and marvellous Morgan Freeman. Another film which is very high up in my favourites.<br/><br/>So, anyone like me who loves to stay in, sit in the dark and enjoy a good fright, 'Saw' will scare the pants off you!! I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, (unless you have a really bad nervous disposition,)..I didn't sleep for days afterwards!"
"yeisibellguardia","10","1","2","12 May 2005"," I need to see it again-- is there a second part?
","I'm very much into scary movies and this one wasn't just about dying or killing it was also about human behavior and how far can we get to survive. However about the website, I can say it's very cool also, but I think it shows to much of the movie and I don't want to say something I shouldn't like the end or something but the ones who SAW the movie know what I'm talking about. The actor Danny Glover was all right I guess but as a police I think they could have done better and the Chinese one too, probably just their characters are the only I would have changed some little things. But to be honest this movie is just awesome, and I'm not sure but my husband told me there's a second part is that right? <br/><br/>10 PLUS FOR THIS MOVIE!"
"ksondy","3","1","2","5 May 2005"," What can I say besides ""Bad""?
","Finally, a movie that ""almost"" makes the horrible ""Grudge"" look good in comparison.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 3. One star for each minute of the movie that is worth watching and all three of these minutes are at the very end. Read the summaries of the movie and then watch the last 3 minutes and it will be worth your time.<br/><br/>How can producers, directors and actors take such a well-written screenplay and destroy it so thoroughly? If not for Leigh Whannell's extensive involvement in this film beyond writing the screenplay, I'd suggest he sue them.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie reminded me of an old 70's horror flick. And although these films were classics and the best horror movies around, we expected them to be made cheesy because that was film quality back then. I don't know if the makers of this film were trying to imitate that or what but the result was just plain cheesy. The acting is absolutely unbelievable. Even Danny Glover's performance reeked. At one point in the film, the surgeon's family is in jeopardy and he is giving the performance of his life as a ""distraught"" husband and father and the result is laughable literally. I burst out laughing several times throughout this movie and from what I can tell, not a single moment of it was intended to be funny.<br/><br/>The acting is just plain horrific. The set is cheaply done with the exception of the basement bathroom. The characters take the typical ""horror stupid people actions"" to a whole new level. (I.E. If someone is about to kill YOUR child and you wrestle the gun from them, do you pull the trigger and shoot them dead between the eyes, or do you say, ""Don't move!"" and let him have the opportunity to get away? Umm DUH????) The acoustics are just plain bad only adding to the overall ""cheap"" effect of this film.<br/><br/>The storyline to ""Saw"" is one of the most creative and original ideas in a long time when it comes to horror flix. To take such an ingenious piece of writing such as this and turn it into the garbage that was produced here is downright sinful and should be against the law."
"JimD73","6","1","2","23 April 2005"," With Some Doctoring, Saw 2 Could Be The Next Se7en
","Ah, Saw. From the buzz, I was hoping this would be my gory ray of sunshine. It was supposed to be the successor to Se7en. Now, Se7en is the ultimate in detective movies. Nothing of the genre could stand up to Se7en. Could Saw be what I have been waiting for? <br/><br/>Plot: 20/25: The killer is loose. They call him the Jigsaw Killer, because of his calling card; a piece of skin cut from his victims in the shape of a puzzle piece. He isn't your typical serial killer. He puts his victims in extreme situation where, if they don't complete his outrageous challenges, they will end up killing themselves. If they make it out, they have a much bigger appreciation for life.<br/><br/>His current victims are photographer Adam (Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes). They wake up in a small, broken-down room chained to pipes and with a dead body in between them. They also find a pair of saws. They are each left a tape explaining what they must do. Gordon must kill Adam, and Adam must survive. If Gordon fails to kill Adam, his wife Alison (Potter) and daughter Diana (Vega) will be killed.<br/><br/>As they race for their survival, Gordon tells us the story of Jigsaw killer. Gordon was a suspect himself for a while, due to them finding one of his personal belongings at the scene of the crime. We learn of the previous victims, including one particularly nerve-racking one involving a reverse bear-trap attached to someone's head. We also learn of Detective David Tapp (Glover), a cop who becomes obsessed with Gordon and the Jigsaw killer.<br/><br/>The plot is better than most other horror movies around. There are some holes and it isn't exceptionally difficult to figure out the twist, but it keeps you interested.<br/><br/>Horror: 17/25: This isn't your everyday horror movie. It doesn't attempt to outright scare you. There are very few pop-outs. This one tries to unnerve you through gore and outright creepiness. In my humble opinion, it fails.<br/><br/>The movie is basically advertised as excessive gore city. In reality, this movie is no gorier than movies like Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill. In fact, it is significantly tamer than those. The reason this one is usually called gorier is because it makes you think about what you are witnessing. However, when you take a look at it, it really isn't too gory.<br/><br/>As for creepy, this movie can be creepy at times, but really, how scary is a robot on a tricycle? It's not scary, it's just weird and stupid.<br/><br/>This movie isn't nearly as unnerving as Se7en. In fact, it is only slightly unnerving. Maybe I'm just desensitized, but this doesn't work too well as a horror movie. It is more intense than most other horror movies today, so I give it credit for that, at least.<br/><br/>Acting: 6/25: To start off, Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) has gained a lot of weight. This guy needs a job. Unfortunately, this movie just won't look good on his resume. He is TERRIBLE. He should really stick to comedy. Whannell (The Matrix Reloaded) is below average as Adam, as is Monica Potter (Boston Legal). The only good performance is that of Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) who is given the only real character as an obsessive detective. The acting, overall, is the main weakness of the movie.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 16/25: Saw has an interesting concept. What would you do if you were placed in a situation where your life was a pawn in someone's sick game? Would you run? Would you cry? Would you just accept it? Looking at it from this perspective, Saw is a good movie.<br/><br/>Looking at it from another perspective, Saw can feel very boring at times and the acting ruins the believability a movie like this desperately needs. The directing is obviously trying to be Se7en 2 (or would it be 8ight?), and it doesn't measure up. The movie is obviously going for unnerving rather than flat-out scary, but it isn't as creepy as it could have been. This movie is an underachiever.<br/><br/>Total: 59%: Saw could have been a lot more. I could see the potential just oozing from this movie. The plot was good, and it had a creepy style to it. Unfortunately, the acting prevented a lot of the horror from coming to life and the movie holds few surprises. With some doctoring to the formula, Saw 2 could prove to be what Se7en fans expected from this movie."

","I'm sorry, but this one just doesn't cut it. When the characters are required to do stupid things to push the plot, you have lost me.<br/><br/>You have located the suspect's hideout and he doesn't know you are there... so what do you do? Hide to ""see what he does?"". Following this, you have him covered by a handgun and shotgun, yet let him escape? oooohh... some scary drills are going to get the victim... how about immediately: 1) shoot the drill, 2) shoot the drill cord 3) shoot the drill bit 4) break off the drill bit with the but of the shotgun, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Later, the wife has the other bad gun under the gun, but using one of the oldest and lamest clichés in movie history looks away just long enough for him to jump her... come on! Guy ties me up and messes with my daughter, I shoot him soon as I have the gun.<br/><br/>What gives with the lame argument about honesty, too? So, Adam was surveiling the doctor and he gets angry and indignant about it???! At a time and situation like that? That is retarded!<br/><br/>These are hack mistakes and the movie was hack too. oooh, the dead guy in the middle was the jigsaw all along! what a crazy twist! Elwes didn't do a good job, either.

After seeing it one time id say the ending made the movie, 4 of 5 stars, then watching it two times i saw the acting, that Adam guy wasn't too great and also Lawrence, i was laughing at one point on Lawrences acting skills, all the other acting was good though, i give it 3 of 5 stars for acting..now the big hub bub, ""i saw johns hand move"", ""why couldn't he use his shirt"", ""the phone was easily reachable""...people the director cant fix every single one of the flaws it was his FIRST movie debut and id have to say it was damn good for a 1st one, i see everyones points in the flaws but again wouldn't it suck if Dr. Gordon chained up two shirts instead of cutting his leg off, people wouldn't think its too great of a flick!

In fact, this film should work as a basic guideline for all people who are in the horror/thriller film industry, and I mean all of them, starting from script writers and ending with those who invest their capital in these beautifully worked out pieces of art. It would be my honour, frankly, to congratulate, and thank, those who wrote the most original and brilliant thriller scenario I've ever encountered in my entire ''fim absorbed'' life, in person.

","This is a film similar in tone to Seven. A plot unravels, whereby two men and the only name in this film Danny Glover, come to grips with an evil psychotic hidden mastermind. <br/><br/>The people in this film are faced with dilemmas and challenges so gory and unthinkable. What would you do, if your families life was on the line and you had to take another life, this is the evil game the villain plays with his victims. In turn scary, gory, and emotionally unhinged characters. The actors pull it off.<br/><br/>It is one of the best, most gruesome horror films I have seen, though Audition is fairly brutal. The interplay between all the different characters is good, and you are always wondering who the bad guy is, which I won't reveal here.<br/><br/>So if your not squeamish, enjoy a thriller and love twists you'll like this."

","Seven-wannabe they say. To begin with, ""Seven"" is rather overestimated and mostly a favorite among the chic film watchers. ""Saw"" is much more than a conventional horror movie and much more than ""Seven"".<br/><br/>The agony is for real. This claustrophobia hurts and it's hard to alienate yourself from it. This is a chamber play. It's interesting to follow what goes on between the men who are trapped in the bathroom. Both have had complicated lives before they got there.

There are some scenes that make your hard start pounding, you know when there's something about to happen.

","This is indeed the first movie that has kept me tricked, thinking and confused, all the way to the very end. Although I may not have believed in the one or two possibilities they provided early on, I still had no idea what the true twist would be. In most movies, that is very hard to do. (When also keeping in mind the plot and twists must make sense.) As others have mentioned, this movie is suspenseful, frightening, and a good thinker. It is also not so gory as to keep your eyes from wondering off the screen, yet gruesome enough to keep your full attention. It was so well thought out, I even had respect for ""Jigsaw"", the killer's awesome intelligence and puzzles. I recommend this movie for anyone looking for a horror mystery."

","i found this movie to be nothing short of brilliant. the only downer was in the acting but i found it very easy to look past the acting and be entertained by the plot. the twists and turns kept me guessing throughout the movie as i thought i knew the plot and where it was going 5 or 10 times only to find out that there was more. i was also reminded of the movie Seven throughout this entire movie, which is another movie i thought was outstanding. anyone who enjoyed Seven at all should consider Saw a must see. i wouldn't consider Saw a must see for anyone however, as there are many graphic scenes. i recently saw Texas chainsaw massacre and i considered this movie to be just as graphic so if you have a weak stomach you might want to pass on this movie but otherwise i would highly recommend it."

Not being able to get to the theaters to see it, then having to wait because blockbuster was sold out of their most likely 150 copies of this movie for almost a month, after finally grabbing that one copy they had in stock, I loved it. Aside from the grisly images, the outrages plot twists, and the most surprised ending I've ever seen in movie history, I was 90% satisfied. Although this movie was made in 18 days, that doesn't take an ounce of weight off the movie. The movie kicked arse. The ending will leave you questioning yourself, questioning myself for writing a good review about it, and leave you wanting to rip apart James Wan and Leigh Whannell heads. However, think about the movie for a few hours, watch it again, and you'll be sitting here posting the same great review.<br/><br/>Most people are so un-grateful for their lives, but not you, not anymore ********* - Nine stars :-D"

","There were a couple problems that should be pointed out. The acting, for one, it's a bit underdeveloped. Also, there are several minor, yet distracting, details left out of the movie.<br/><br/>I think that if this movie had been thought through just a little bit more it could have been quite the horror film. Danny Glover did a wonderful job, but I the other actors left a lot to be desired...They didn't really tug at the audiences emotions as much as they could have. There is no doubt that this film could have gone a lot further than it did.<br/><br/>That being said I can't really deny the creativity of this movie.

"silvercreature","5","1","2","22 March 2005"," a letdown in every sense of the word
","I've always enjoyed movies about serial killers and have been especially interested in the ones where the killers were original. Saw offers an enticing premise - and fails miserably in its delivery.<br/><br/>My main problem is just that this movie's situations start off as interesting then quickly degenerate into a mash of events that really aren't all that entertaining and finally end with nothing to feel satisfied about. I don't exactly have a problem with the film's ""twist ending"" so much as how it was executed. The other thing that really bugged me is that so much of the stuff had this really tacked-on feel that made me wonder why the hell I should care about any of it. The best example of this is Danny Glover's character, the obsessed cop who's actions make little sense and ultimately wind up meaning very little. <br/><br/>The coincidences this movie tries to pull off are boring which is even more terrible when you take under consideration just how bad the characters are. The main two guys in the room can be described as follows: the over-dramatic, annoying guy and the whiny annoying guy. The killer might have been an interesting character but he's never really analyzed. The movie's aim is to keep him shrouded in mystery - unfortunately, the mystery continues after the movie is over. It leaves one thinking - wow, that killer sure was sadistic and clever - I wonder who the hell he was?<br/><br/>The twist that the movie's main scenario was just one part of a bigger game is actually sort of cool. It's really too bad the audience has to suffer through a bunch of bland dialogue and predictable scenes to get there.<br/><br/>Saw really did have some things going for it. But the fact is that none of that stuff can really save it in the end, what with all the nauseating crap that surrounds it all. I didn't really think I'd like it once I'd seen it but I had assumed I'd decide that it would have been at least worth seeing. Oh well, can't be right all the time. Avoid."

","Okay, this movie has been out for a while and I all I heard was ""a surprise ending"". I would say ' okay man, don't tell me."" Okay, it was a surprise but a big let down. It had me going for a little while but I knew it was going to be a downer with so few suspects. A good surprise ending should have had a little more character development. Just look at all the opinions and justifications on the message board. that tells you that detail discussion and debates are necessary to sort things out. that's just too much for me to rate this movie any higher. It reminded me of the infamy's Al Pacino movie ""Sea Of Love"", which was a suspenseful thriller that you connect with the main characters but the ""so called surprise"" comes out of no where."

","As if ""Open Water"" wasn't bad enough, Lions Gate continues to embarrass with ""Saw"". Once again, a bad script ruins a good plot premise. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, although reasonably well-acted. I gave it a 5 out of 10 for the effort the actors put into it. <br/><br/>Like ""Open Water"", the ending is a surprise, but depressing and dissatisfying, leaving too many questions unanswered. Perhaps this is a new trend in low-budget films - leaving the ending ""open"" and the viewers wondering how the movie would have ended had filming continued (or how the sequel will go), but there is a fine line between intriguing and annoying, and I found the ending annoying.<br/><br/>From now on, I'm checking labels when it comes to films - anything by Lions Gate, I won't even bother to rent."

","I watch (and like) some crappy flicks. The acting in this one is hard to excuse. The dialogue and the way the two main characters behave when waking up in a strange room is idiotic. Elwes is just a little better than Whannell, which is sad, Whannell is a rookie by comparison. Danny Glover? Give me a break. We've all seen Lethal Weapon and How Stella Got Her Groove Back, we know what this guy is capable of. Not too darn much. Actually, come to think of it... I never watched ""stella"". The best actor(s): A toss up between the fat dead guy in the razor wire, and the screaming little kid with a gun to her head. <br/><br/>So on to the bad ending. A lot of questions we're raised. Not good ones, like ""Wow, how did they think of that?"" or ""Did so & so die or not??"". Here is my list... 1. How did a surgeon not know the difference between stage make up and a real gunshot wound to the head? Oh, thats right, the cancer victim also happened to be a special FX make up artist. 2. How did two men (again, one of them a surgeon) not notice the guy on the floor breathing for 6 hours? OR--- How did the killer sit perfectly still, not pee, fart, or breathe enough for anyone to hear or see for 6 hours? Oh, thats right... he's a zen master, too. 3. Why would Zap put a gun to the little kids head, then put a stethoscope to her chest and listen to her heartbeat? Seems pretty sadistic for someone who was 'forced' to do it. Oh, thats right.. he's a Pedophile. 4. Why wouldn't the 'obsessed cop' call the police when he thought the deranged killer he's been after is right in front of his face? AND 5. Didn't he get a good look at the killers face when they almost caught him and his partner got killed? Why chase him down saying 'you sick bastard' or whatever when he knew Zap wasn't the killer? OK, I'm as sick of writing those as you are of reading them. The way I see it, this movie had 3 possible endings. The dumb one the directors probably thought of... Zap is the killer, he dies at the end, hooray. The dumb one that Lion's Gate Films probably made them put on... (you watched it already..) OR the only one that makes sense... Glover dies, Whannell dies, the wife dies, Zap dies, and then Elwes bleeds to death after finding out that Zap wasn't the killer. Then the little girl continues her killing rampage at the orphanage. Kids love jigsaw puzzles. Gotta love em.<br/><br/>One last comment before I take this DVD back to the video store.. Isn't it odd that the first 50 comments or so are all one star except for about 3, then all of a sudden they become 8,9, and 10? Maybe they took some of that money they made from the theater and paid people to put some glowing reviews out there.. just in time for the DVD release! WOOHOO! Horray for capitalism, and hooray for anyone who thinks this movie does NOT resemble se7en.. at least not in any flattering sense. Worth a look, not a purchase."

The were Dozens of other ways this film could have ended without using this tired cliché. Just end the freaking story.

"whitefalcon79","8","1","2","14 March 2005"," It's different, and watchable because of it
","I will admit I have spent the past ten years or so developing a healthy intolerance for the modern thriller/horror movie. Gone are the days of movies like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (I'm talking about the original here) where we never actually saw Leatherface run the chainsaw through any of his victims... the true horrors were left to our imagination, the scariest place of all. No, it's all been replaced with buckets of fake blood and CGI heads exploding or whatever in the name of ""realism"".<br/><br/>So it's a pleasure to finally come across a movie that actually has the ability to creep into your mind and tell you something, staying with you after the credits begin rolling, rather than cheating you out of the admission fee by hacking up random bystanders for the sake of gore.<br/><br/>As a movie, Saw covers little or no new ground but it teaches us chilling lessons about ourselves, about life, about other people around us and how what we do with our lives will eventually come back to face us one way or another. You don't get that from your average serial killer movie; not even those that supposedly develop the character of the killer and make you feel like there might be a method behind his madness. The motives of ""the Jigsaw killer"" are out in plain view; his victims are punished for disrespecting their own lives by being placed in situations where they must endure the worst just to get out. In doing so, they find a new appreciation for the life that they have... at least, that's the idea.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about Saw is the way the story all comes together at the end. Of course, I'm not going to spoil it by revealing any details but even if you, like I did, find the first half of the movie laborious and the acting by most of the cast teetering on B-movie quality, there are no plot holes left and nothing but a very real sense of knowing exactly why it all happened the way it did.<br/><br/>Saw is not mind-blowingly brilliant, but it goes in a very different direction to every other piece of trash Hollywood has turned out lately with the tag ""thriller"" or ""horror""... and for that reason alone, I found it worth the skepticism I swallowed when I finally decided to rent the DVD after purposely missing the cinematic release.<br/><br/>Watch this movie expecting to be thinking about it - and yourself - long after it's over."

Leaving Adam to rot and die in the room. <br/><br/>The doctor who cut off his foot to get help, was dragging himself across the ground REALLY slowly. To get out of the game, you have to follow the RULES. the doctor didn't kill Adam..so he lost the game. Jigsaw most likely locked them in the building to have the doctor bleed to death, and Adam to rot in the room with a dead guy... gross<br/><br/>*SAW 2 COMING OUT FALL OF 2005!"""

The makers of this movie lost themselves good chance cause the script is really good.. An idea of a movie like this would put under pressure to get the best of your acting. For me i am not professional of this part but i didn't like the direction of the photography. Moving between some frames was awful. The decoration seems also to be so cheap and poor.

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","7","1","2","13 March 2005"," Saw (2004)
","A delightful little horror/thriller, whichever you like, with an interesting set-up. Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to pipes, with a dead body between them. The two then work on a way of getting out of their, while one of them recalls an investigation from five months ago. Some of the ideas in this film are morbidly brilliant, such as the ways in which the killed ""kills"" his victims. The razor wire, and the combination on the safe being two priceless moments. You may have already noticed however that this film borrows heavily from ""Se7en"", with original ways of killing victims, the whole purification of the victims, a scene where two cops nearly catch the killer and the overall dark and macabre feel. This is in no way an insult towards the film, as it does have enough originality to keep you interested, and if you are going to borrow from any dark serial killer thriller, make it ""Se7en"". Cary Elwes and newcomer Leigh Whannell are the two unfortunate souls stuck in the khazi together, and start off suspicious of one another and then forming a rather endearing bond. Things get a bit too intense for Elwes at the end, meaning he loses all rational thought, and starts screaming and shouting but with a high level of authenticity making the film very almost 'moving'. Some characters seem pointless in the film, and a lot of situations are shoved in purely for red herrings sake. Some of the actors are just underused, such as Danny Glover, which is a shame because apart from his character being pointless, he is very good. The film is good for at least a few watches, the first racking your brain to work everything out, the second to see what you missed and even after that it is still enjoyable. Do not expect anything too different, but with a little low budget class. Wan is a brilliant first time director, never showing too much (could blame the budget) gore, and keeping the tension high. He dos however give in to some music video techniques with spinning cameras, screaming heavy metal, and sped up footage. We can ignore this though, because we just want a dark, spooky and bizarre horror with more than a few memorable set-ups."

Danny Glover did'nt show up much in this movie, but he was deffinatley the best actor out of this movies' cast. The plot of the movie can keep you guessing up until the end, just about everything in this movie fits, except what I mentioned before, the acting had some flaws and some other things had few flaws.

","Although this film does not contain many new ideas it is a good mix of motives known from Se7en or The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>I must admit that the acting isn't convincing. However, considering that the film was shot in 18 days the performance is still good.<br/><br/>Despite some wrong decisions in the cut of the movie its strength lies in its visual effects and its shocking moments. In addition, the arrangement of the scenes makes it difficult to follow the plot.<br/><br/>I must admit the twist at the end was predictable to me. But I know a lot of similar flicks. So it needn't be predictable to the usual viewer. Nevertheless, it provided a good ending to the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Saw"" is a solid horror film despite the fact that it is little innovative.<br/><br/>8/10"
"flipgirl38","Null","1","2","9 March 2005"," One Of The Most Disturbing Films To Come Out In Recent Years
","What sets SAW apart from the usual slew of horror films is that this one gets into your mind. It puts you into the situations themselves and makes you wonder what you would do yourself. And, of course, a steady pace of creepy images such as scary clowns and spine tingling figures does not help you feel any better that you are watching a scary film of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Cary Elwes plays Lawrence Gordon, a doctor who wakes up trapped and chained inside a rundown, cracking, dirty bathroom with a younger man named Adam, who is played by SAW's screenwriter, Leigh Whannell. A dead body lies between them. As soon as Gordon comes to, he receives clues from his captor, saying he must murder Adam before a certain time or his family will be murdered. Elwes acts well enough in this movie, although in some scenes he tended to over act, or try too hard in some of the more terrifying scenes. Some takes would come off as forced, like he was trying very hard to impress the crumbling walls just how wonderfully he can play the part of a scare But it's not the acting that makes SAW work. <br/><br/>What DOES work are the filming techniques and camera work. The film's picture is grainy, shot with hand-held cameras to give a more realistic feel to the film's dirty, claustrophobic set. Visual style is something that has not been seen since David Fincher's Se7en, with outrageously mind numbing images. This is a wonderfully filmed picture, with a great score to intensify the mood.<br/><br/>SAW is one of the most disturbing, scary, psychologically draining films I have seen in quite some time. Compared to the other horror films being chucked out by Hollywood these days, SAW is for sure a horror film that will be remembered for some time and is very much something I would recommend.<br/><br/>MJR"

"peter_olsson_1","10","1","2","8 March 2005"," One of the better movies I've seen this year
","One thing to remember is that this is a movie where the essence lies in intelligent plot-twists. A lot of people have criticized it's jumpy-style of MTV cutting and flashy style.<br/><br/>In my opinion this was better than just an MTV monster-metal video, as it raised a lot of existential questions which few people seem to have thought of seeing it. Also its pure gore and suspense was at maximum.<br/><br/>So what drives us to do obscene and morally corrupt things and what does make them OK in the context? This is hard to answer and makes the movie more terrifying in my opinion.<br/><br/>Is the serial just a symbol for the net in which we all are stuck? Maybe not, but I thought about that, maybe Wan did to.<br/><br/>The third most disturbing thing is that the ""brain"" was in the room the whole time.<br/><br/>The fourth disturbing fact is that WE two are, since we're the voyeurs as much as the serial and the character ""Zep"". In a cinematic kind of view we're part of this until the bitter end. Maybe it US the killer is trying to please ;) A gruesome movie (in a good way). With some overdone things here and there (cutting and directing in general), but considering this to be a débutante this is extremely promising. Another negative thing may be it's similarities to other 90's movies, but I see this as contemporary. It's just a question of what we want to see. Seven was quite similar to a lot of other movies, so was Fight Club. As Oscar Wilde put it ""an amateur loans but a true genius steals"", just look at Star Wars (the old ones naturally), Matrix, Hitchcock and a lot of comedy writers/directors like the one of Shaun of the Dead - stealing from religions, philosophy, books, contemporary events and similar things.<br/><br/>The only thing apart from the acidous hummer in the movies which I thought was quite funny, was the man on the floor. If this would be put on a stage instead, like on Broadway, I would like to play him. It would be wonderful to lie down for two hours and earn a days salary, hahahahahaha."
"elitt","6","1","2","8 March 2005"," Didn't make a lot of sense, but I didn't want to saw off my limb either.
","I enjoy a good ""buckets of blood"" film every now and then, and when the film carries an original concept that makes it a lot easier to watch too. ""Saw"" isn't the gore fest that I thought it would be, but it's pretty close and lots of the film is disgusting and creepy. The creep factor is high in this one.<br/><br/>The film starts out with two guys chained to a pipe in a seedy bathroom. There is a dead guy in the room with his brains blown off holding a gun on the floor. The two of them are each given a tape to listen to and follow the instructions. Cary Elwes plays one of the guys and he is instructed to kill the other guy by a time deadline or his family will be killed. The men are also given a saw. the saw won't work on the chains, but it's there to cut through their limbs to get loose. The man behind this is a serial killer named Jigsaw and until later in the film, he never actually kills anybody. He carefully picks his victims and sets them up in precarious situations, that would make them want to kill themselves. All the victims are flawed people such as prostitutes and adulterers. This aspect reminded me of the film ""Se7en"".<br/><br/>The film is very scary at times and you never really know whats going to happen next, most of the time. It's well directed and pretty smart. My complaint is that towards the end of the film, you know whats coming. There is a twist ending that makes little sense and I suppose that most horror movies seem to all have twist endings nowadays. That's fine if they help the film. The movie also stars B-Movie horror queen Dina Meyer, Monica Potter, and in a bizarre role for him, Danny Glover. <br/><br/>I'm recommending ""Saw"" to people who like their films scary, full of blood, and creepy. If that's not your thing, you'll hate this movie. It kept my interest and I liked it. (***)"
"GoRo_TR","10","1","2","8 March 2005"," Nobody can guess!!!!
","I heard about this film by my friends. They told me that it is the most successful horror film they have ever seen for year but I was not so hopeful. I was not hopeful because I have never seen the actors in a horror film before. <br/><br/>Now I agree with my friends. It is the best in the horrors and it is the best scenario. <br/><br/>Actors are not popular but they were perfect. Especially the scene which the doctor was cutting his own leg was very very realistic. I was surprised with his acting and the make up (white face)<br/><br/>I am very pretentious that even if someone watched all the horror film, cannot guess the end of the SAW."

","If you enjoy horror films, puzzles and playing games, then you would enjoy this film. When I first saw the trailer on television (TV) it looked kind of stupid, not the kind of stupid that makes it so that I don't want to see but the kind of stupid that make it so that only true horror fans would enjoy but not someone who doesn't like horror.<br/><br/>Saw is about two guys who end up in a room with a chain hooked up to one of their ankles with the other end of the chain hooked up to the wall and they don't know how they got in this room. They are then told that they have until 6:00PM (which only leaves approx. 2 hours) to figure out how to get out of the room and if they fail to figure out how to get out of the room by 6:00PM, then they would die.<br/><br/>I liked that the fact that this was a thinking movie where the movie gets you involved (kind of). Sort of like the movies Cube, Cube 2: Hypercube and Cube: Zero (which I haven't seen as of yet but plain on seeing in the near future). If you have seen any of the Cube movies and enjoyed them, watch Saw."
"lumabean","7","1","2","7 March 2005"," Mix in some way cool kills, clever plot turns, and horrendous acting and you get ""Saw""
","Saw is a kick your ass kind of a movie. The kills are shown in full detail and each one is so creative and frightening. I also must give props to the writers for inventing perhaps the most terrifying contraption I have ever seen. Yes, I am talking of the reverse bear trap. The movie begins with two complete strangers who get one hell of a wake up call. They are trapped in a bathroom without any recollection of how they got there. The plot is similar to ""Seven"" with a serial killer choosing his victims for their sins of not appreciating life. Lets just say insanity and scary as hell puppet clown dolls ensue. The only rusty edge that Saw possesses is the TERRIBLE acting. There's a major plot turn in which a main character goes insane and it's handled so ridiculously that I ended up laughing instead of feeling the intended pity and horror. But aside from the acting Saw is one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Chromium_5","7","1","2","7 March 2005"," Not the best, but certainly not the worst.
","I never intended to see this, but when it came on TV at 12:30 am, I decided what the heck. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's a campy B-movie, with a lot of unintentionally funny stuff (it seemed like Whannell and Elwes were having a contest to see who could be the worst actor of the century), but it is creative enough to make you forget all that. The idea of these people being put in situations where they have no choice but to kill themselves is very imaginative, as is the killer's motivation (making them grateful to be alive). And I usually can see twists coming from miles away, but the horrifying ending took me completely by surprise. If you can get past the cheesiness, and just admire the script's creativity, it is an entertaining thriller that sticks with you long after you've watched it."

","One of my favorite movies of all time, as in the movie some things were obvious but flipped around to something completely different that you wouldn't expect. Although it was not that gory it was extremely clever and had its shocking moments. I won't tell you anything about the plot of this movies but I can only say that it had possibly one of the best endings I have witnessed in a movie which surprised me greatly. Although not one of your traditional blood-bathed movies of it's kind, it's stands out completely of the genre which is one of the factors that makes it so great. The movie also ends in question of a sequel to the movie, which I am sure that will not be as the original( as many sequels are) but who knows, considering that the movies had so many surprises. Deffinatley five stars!"

","I just 'Saw' this movie and it wasn't bad. It wasn't great either. It definitely was not on the level of Se7en. It tries it's best though, and many times, it seems that it wants to be just like Se7en. Nice try, but no cigar. First, the acting was okay. I've heard people say it was terrible, but I wouldn't go that far. It was average. Se7en had Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, & Morgan Freeman. Need I say more? Second, the plot was pretty good, and kept me going for the whole movie - until the end. My jury is still out on the ending. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but for me, if the ending doesn't stand up to the rest of the movie, then what's the point? Let's just say they could have spent a little more time developing a few things there instead of trying to be so clever. Of course, that's just my opinion - I could be wrong..."
"rangertimothy","8","1","2","6 March 2005"," Good Watch
","I found Saw to be a good movie to watch. It kept me guessing the whole way through. I don't recall being bored once with the show. From reading some of the review's on the movie and reading the back cover from the rental store, I wasn't too sure about it. I expected it to be nothing but a cut him, blood and gore movie. For me this type of movie does not interest me. With saw it's got some grisly scenes, but you actually have a story to follow. I think it's well worth the watch. Although it did star Danny Glover, he did not play as big a role as I thought he may. Overall, it's worth seeing. I don't think you will be disappointed."
"brennan79","10","1","2","6 March 2005"," sets a new standard for the genre
","Unrelenting, unforgiving, and most certainly unlike any viewing experience I can remember, ""Saw"" is quite possibly the best thriller in modern cinema. I pity the fool who happens upon this film thinking it will be ""just another Hollywood fright flick"" because it truly is in a class by itself. This is a thriller that will take your breath away in the first minute and not give it back until the end credits roll. It is a gruesome, grisly, and utterly evocative depiction of the darkest recesses of the human mind. What makes this thriller a cut above the rest? <br/><br/>A good thriller scares you. As a grown man (and horror fan), I rarely see a film that accomplishes this task. This one had me flipping on every light in my house...and sleeping that way as well. I'm actually embarrassed to admit that I kept thinking the killer was going to jump at me any second. <br/><br/>A good thriller delivers an ending that you don't expect. For ""Saw"", this would be a gross understatement. This is an entire film of one unexpected event after another, so much so that I actually gave up trying to guess what would happen next. <br/><br/>A good thriller stays with you afterward. There are several times during this film where the tension was so unimaginably unbearable, I found myself wondering whether or not I really wanted to continue watching. Not because it wasn't good but because it was almost too good for its own intent. The horrific scenes of torture the killer puts upon his victims were made impossibly more shocking by the schizophrenic style in which they were filmed. This is not to be confused with the ""MTV-Style Flash-Cut To Infinity"" style seen in so many thrillers today (which thankfully was absent here). This was a series of frantic zooms and close-ups along with swooping high-speed 360 shots of the victim. Throw in some music that effectively makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up and you have the work of a brilliant (if insanely twisted) director. <br/><br/>Films like this don't come along often so don't miss it. Even if you think it is too gory, too sadistic, or too intense, you would have to admit it is an excellent piece of independent art that makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" look like a fairy tale, swims circles around ""Open Water"", and pretty much cuts any Hollywood studio picture completely in half."
"Altrabyte","3","1","2","5 March 2005"," From Good to Bad
","When I first started to watch this movie I said to myself ""wow, this is good."" The idea behind the movie Saw is pretty original, having the killer find was for victims to kill themselves. But as I continued watching it I began to get bored. It just felt way too much like the movie Se7en, which is one of my favorite movies. But when you get to the end it's like the crap hits the fan. It's like they tried to throw you a bunch of plot twists to make you confused at the end, then they ran out of people to blame. Is it the cop, NO! Is it the co-worker from the hospital, NO! It's the dead body that's been laying next to you for 8 HOURS! Then he gets up, and walks away, The End. What the hell, that ending just ticked me off. And then throughout the movie is the stupid thought of, hey, if I've got a gun to this guy's head, there is no way for him to escape! Oh No! I've been distracted and he stabbed me. I guess I'm just sick of these piece of crap movies that are thrown together in the end."

Jigsaw chooses victims who ""don't count their blessings"" such as self-injurers and drug addicts. He puts them in situations where they are forced to find a way out or they die. Adam and Gordon must find a way out before they become victims themselves.<br/><br/>This movie is disturbing beyond belief. Actually, this movie could potentially be very good because the concept is pretty original. There's also some great transitions, such as the ending (not giving anything away). A man is heard screaming and it fades into Fear Factory's song ""Bite the hand that Bleeds"". However, this film is filled with dumb characters and plot holes. The movie tries to leave you feeling scared, but instead, it only fills you with questions.<br/><br/>Overall, scary but far too many plot holes. 3/10<br/><br/>recommend if: *you want something scary/disturbing *you like slasher films<br/><br/>avoid if: *you're offended by blood, gore, and graphic violence *you're offended by foul language *you hate plot holes and characters that don't think"

There were some young women in the cinema who were giggling through the whole movie. I felt sorry for them that they had chosen to see such a bleak movie. It's astonishing that this movie, of all ""horror"" films, should get such a high rating on IMDb. It should really be exposed for what it is: A sadistic MTV-rock video with no purpose other than to waste people's time.

"Alexan_Simon","5","1","2","2 March 2005"," clever, but not believable
","First, I would like to say that this movie could've been one of the great movies of the thriller genre in the past decade. There are many strong points to this movie, most of which set it apart from the typical, crappy horror/thriller. It's a shame, though, that its problems distract from the movie too much to allow the movie to reach its full potential.<br/><br/>The cleverness of the screenplay is what strikes me as the most important strong point to this movie. The psychopath in question in Saw has a very unique method of dealing with his victims. His cleverness allows for nice little plot twists throughout the movie and always keeps the viewer guessing. You will find yourself fully engaged throughout the length of the movie, which is always good for a thriller. It's actually very disappointing to see the director ruin such a unique and fine screenplay.<br/><br/>The first problem that hit me with this movie is the acting. I wasn't convinced that the actors' feelings and emotions were genuine enough to make some of the actions and conjectures that they made throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The next and most important problem i found with this movie was that the psychopath and his motive did not seem believable to me. I always compare these types of movies with ""Se7en"", which i believe is the standard for modern thrillers. What makes ""Se7en"" so successful and gives it such replay value is the fact that Se7en had such an outrageous, yet believable antagonist. It is this type of antagonist that ""Saw"" lacks, and is what will kill its replay value for the future. For any good thriller, there should be a believable and genuine reason for the killer's actions. I was not convinced of ""Saw""'s reasons for his killings, and this is the main reason for the low score.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie worth seeing. It is a clever, smart movie that will be entertaining until the end. This isn't a movie, though, that I would buy on DVD, nor would it be a movie that I would be interested in seeing more than once.<br/><br/>5/10"

","For those who have not seen this movie in theaters, I feel so sorry for you! The intensity of it with the killer sound really plucks your nerves in the worst way. If you have surround sound or know someone who does, I suggest watching it with surround sound if you want to feel the true experience of this movie. ""Jigsaw"" teaches cruel but in a sicker sense valuable life lessons to horrible people. One girl in the movie is actually grateful for having encountered Jigsaw so she can now start over fresh and appreciate what she truly has. All of the characters in this movie add to the intensity in their own way. Danny Glover adds an eventual insanity and urge to catch Jigsaw at the expense of his life due to his partner's death. As for Jigsaw, I feel he does a very good job of portraying an ""evil character."" I love how he uses the tiny manican (spelling?) to represent himself. God that thing is creepy! I won't ruin the ending of this movie, because if I do, it will definitely ruin everything that builds up to it. This ending makes the movie spectacular. Probably one of the best endings in this type of movie since Se7en came along."

","A demonic serial killer (Okay, so he's not REALLY a serial killer, but) imprisons two average men (Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell) in a rather unpleasant bathroom in an ancient, long-deserted sewage plant. Things go from bad to worse for them when they realize that the intent of the said killer is for them to turn on one another and ultimately, kill one another. <br/><br/>Wow. How can I describe a film like ""saw""? Brutal, disturbing, grisly, unpleasant I think you get the picture. Elwes and Whannell (Who also scripted the film) both give excellent performances, but more importantly, we care about the characters, they're engaging and realistic, usually in this type of film I find myself not caring at all for the characters, that isn't so here, though. The characters are well-rounded and likable. I WANTED them to survive.<br/><br/>This is James Wan's first big feature film, and he delivers everything here with extreme intensity, style, and atmosphere. The cinematography was superb and I loved the ways some of the flashbacks were filmed. The guy's got a great eye for detail and I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him soon. <br/><br/>This is no Disney film, folks, in case you haven't guessed. Not only is it extremely gory at times, but the situations are so unsettling and mean-spirited that if the film hadn't been gory, it still would have earned every bit of it's R rating (come to think about it, this is probably the most physiologically disturbing film I've ever seen!). <br/><br/>In my opinion, the ending was absolutely terrifying. I won't give it away, but it's easily the most twisted, ironic and anticlimactic ending I've ever seen. Yes, I'll admit, I did loose some sleep over it.<br/><br/>""Saw"" is a flick that wasn't designed with the faint-of-heart in mind.

The horror and hopelessness for the two main characters, Adam and Larry, is completely believable -- how real something seems measures the level of fear you can smell in an audience. It's common sense. For example, ""Jaws"" -- ever go to the beach and swim? ... ""Friday the 13th"" -- ever go to camp some place in the woods? (minus when they did the movies outside of Crystal Lake and the camp, gimme a break: Jason in space, oh I can relate to that one!) ... ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- ever go to sleep? And I know that these are only three of many well-known horror flicks, but it's the fear of horrific possibility that is impossible to defeat: isn't it possible to wake up in a foreign place with a foreign person in a foreign situation?? Now, if you've been to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and truly experienced it, well, you know where I'm going... but I'm not going in that direction. This movie actually has nothing to do with sex -- it's not that predictable. I bet in the horror-making-rule-book it states: ""You must have an outrageously attractive woman become immediately bare-chested then perform intercourse with an equally attractive man just before the both of them are brutally killed. Rinse and repeat as needed."" Matter of fact, NOTHING in this movie was predictable, and you have to appreciate that, too. Oh, and if you're looking for bare-chested women? Yeah, this isn't the movie for that. Don't let the 'R' rating sucker you in for a sweet set of ta-ta's! I know, disappointing... but the movie is loaded with back-story and plot lines and insists that you watch every frame. Doesn't that count??? Hahaha, yeah, not for me, too.<br/><br/>Second, ... and this is the part I really don't want to type out: the acting. You know... I'm a big fan of Cary Elwes, but maybe shooting the film in 18 days (according to the Behind-the-Scenes) was a bad choice. Could the director have gone maybe 19 days JUST TO GET IT RIGHT?? Again, the horror of it all, the suspense, the actors outside of the dirty bathroom were fitting and worked really, really well -- AND CAN I GET AN ""AMEN"" FOR SEEING DANNY GLOVER IN ANOTHER POLICE ROLL?! LOVE ME SOME CAPTAIN MURTAUGH!! -- but our two main characters made me want to puke more than the graphic scenes did. For the record, I did not puke during or after this movie, but there were two scenes that made me bite my fist pretty hard. For example, the dialogue from the get-go: okay, cool-under-pressure surgeons are one thing... waking up, barefoot, in a strange place with the lights out and feeling a heavy chain attached to your ankle is another. That kind of made me second-guess my rental choice because now I'm thinking: ""Oh, Jesus... one guy is losing his damn mind while the other guy is hanging out like it's no big thing?"" SURE, IT'S COOL... I WALK AROUND BAREFOOT AND HANG OUT IN DIRTY BATHROOMS FULL OF BLOOD AND DEAD PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME! ROCK ON!! Whatever. The Adam-character changed ... one second, he is really concerned about his hopeless presence in such an unpromising situation and, the next, I find him saying his lines like a nympho-voyeuristic homosexual staring at a same-sex porn video! His character totally changed and threw me off of the story when all I could think about was: ""Wait, what did he just say? Because it didn't really sound like the last thing he just said."" Very distracting.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt that, yes, the movie ""Saw"" touched on a lot of issues that ""Se7en"" did: sin justified by sin. BUT! I was hooked from the get-go (minus the crappy dialogue) with the storyline/plot and how it literally unfolded before my eyes. I was very pleased with the movie from beginning to end. The ending? Didn't see it coming one bit. And, in a way, I'm glad it didn't even end 'Happily Ever After' because isn't that lame?<br/><br/>MY CONCLUSIVE RATING: 8/10 -- Dark, dirty and grimy, moderately gory, super-suspenseful meets shady and distracting acting in the most pivotal parts. Not just in horror but this is the best movie I've seen in a long time!"
"T_Dogg80","5","1","2","20 February 2005"," Would have been good, but...
","Wow. I thought it was a great story. I think the movie would have been great, and I probably would buy this movie, had it not been for the acting, or lack thereof. First of all, the lead actor, Cary Elwes, is absolutely horrible! He should stick with his ""preppy/snob"" type roles, because that's about all this guy can do. At critical moments in the plot line, when you have to believe that these people are scared to death, he shouts and sounds like he's on stage in a Broadway musical. Not a good suspenseful actor. I love Monica Potter, and think she should have been given a bigger part, as she IS a good actor.<br/><br/>Danny Glover is another good actor, and I have seen his do well in detective roles, but without Mel Gibson by his side, his role in this movie is about as stale as a a 10 year old bag of chips.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie was good, and had a good story, but geez, take the time to hire the right cast next time!"

","After hearing mixed feedback from reviews and comments made by others who had seen the film, i wasn't expecting too much from SAW. I WAS WRONG! Entirely Dark and Creepy, Saw successfully engages your attention, provides many shocks and scares that are perfectly blended with a strong story.<br/><br/>SAW achieves what too many Horror/Serial Killer movies only strive for, Undying Tension and an original plot, where the viewer is fed each revelation and twist at the right time so that the truth unfolds subtly, and the shock effect is maximised.<br/><br/>With a budget of around $1 Million and a debut outing for writer/director James Wan, the result is stunning, and i feel this young talent has a great future ahead of him. Even with some fairly weak acting and an occasional low budget feel, Wan has still created one the finest horror/serial killer movies ever. This would equal Seven or Silence of the Lambs if the Cast was of the same calibre.<br/><br/>A brilliant Debut, an original Film, and a fantastic achievement. Great work, and i look forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>9/10"

","OK, I gave this movie a 3. So, you can probably guess what I'm gonna say about it. The movie wasn't even scary. When this movie came out, I came close to going to see it myself because I thought that the premise was amazing. Two guys in one room, with very, very, hard choices to make of how they were going to get out of the situation. Yeah, that's part of the story... but, the story, the performances, and even the images on screen leaves me to wonder.. how these guys actually got a studio to release this thing.<br/><br/>The movie has almost no point of making you watch it (not even a good amount of gross out images), all of the characters are totally 2 dimensional, the acting was HORRIBLE, and the sets looked like they cost $5 to build. I can appreciate the premise and how interesting it was... but, this movie could have been so much more than it was."

","i thought this movie was so good. Throughout the whole movie, i was wondering what is going to happen next. Although the acting was sub-par, the plot was pretty good and the action in it was pretty good. I would tell everyone to watch it. I especially liked the creative ways ""jigsaw"" trapped his prisoners. I did not think that this movie would be that good, but from the first minute, i knew that it would be a very good movie. There are not many other movies like this one, with all of the detailed sets and intense camera angles. The only movie which could hold a candle to SAW was probably Seven or Cube. Overall, everyone should go watch this movie."

","Right behind The Exorcist and Alien is this, a true masterpiece. The twist ending, which i wont ruin, topples anything from M. Night, even though he is still one of the top directors/writers of this genre. The story is smart, deep, gripping, intense, and provides so much in 100 minutes. The acting is great, it might seem over the top, but so does the situation they're in, so it goes with the flow, and really is some of the best acting in any movie this year, especially any horror movie, ever made. Its scary, its shocking, its dramatic, its deep, and like the comment on the cover says, it really does make your blood run cold. 9 out of a 10, i cant wait for the sequel, and more from the director and writers, they know what they're doing."

Like other posts have said, it has so many twists and turns and a wonderful plot. The ending blew me away. Saw is definitely in my top 10. It is very rare now to see a movie as good as Saw. It has all the good suspense and blood but doesn't concentrate on just making the film as bloody as possible. The actors are outstanding and you can totally put yourselves in their place and feel their emotions. Saw is thrilling, sick and twisted and extremely creative. It makes your spine tingle."
"humdinger_80","8","1","2","13 February 2005"," Zep Hindle
","Not to say i didn't like the movie but I just found that the Zep thing was a little unbelievable I mean the guy has a fairly long time and as far as we know he has the freedom to move about which is how he got to the Doc's apartment. But why then didn't he go to the hospital? I mean he is dying from a slow acting poison...true Jigsaw (the psycho responsible for these games) says only he has the antidote. But surely there is something Doctors could have done to help him. And why did Sep go find the Doc to kill him? if the rules were his wife and daughter would be killed and the doc would be left to rot in the abandoned washroom...plus as far as we know Zep had to kill the wife and daughter or die himself (according to his ""play me"" tape) and if it was too late for the Doc then it surely was too late for Zep because he failed to kill the Doc's wife and daughter who escaped These are just some of the questions that came to me while watching. meh i dunno these things could have been explained<br/><br/>anyhow if anyone has anything that might help explain these, perhaps i missed something."

","OK, as a young person everyone around me wants to go see a horror movie, myself on the other hand hate them simple because I believe they are there just to strike fear into people and have no meaning what so ever. But I am more of a thriller kind of guy, I loved Se7en and many other movies (Twisted, Kiss the Girls, etc.) and the second I saw a trailer i was interested, the second FX showed the United States a preview i was watching with my mouth open, and the day the movie came out I was, as usual, in the movie theaters because it was a Friday watching Saw. Simply the greatest movie ever!!!!! twists and turns every where the camera shows, yes i agree the acting was bad (especially Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell), who my drama teacher says will never get a job again), but the average person should look beyond that, and look at the amazing twist at the end (a must see i might add). But my drama teacher made me a monster so i cant really discard that, anyway the movie is a must see, i don't think the should make a sequel and i don't really know how its going to work but yes i will see it, and i wont be surprised if i get disappointed.

","These days, a truly ""unique"" twist to a movie seems harder and harder to come by. SAW delivers where so many others leave you questioning why you didn't take your eight bucks and splurge on a fun night out at the local dollar draft night. Elwes and Glover both deliver a performance that might just get them back into the mainstream (Glover apparently not too old for this s**t-sorry, I had to say it!) The real driving force behind this film however, is a plot which, though a bit slow at times, rewards viewers with an ending that fits neatly into a demented little non-sequel package. Oh, how I've missed movies that just END! In closing, this is arguably the best thriller since SE7EN...see it!"

","Saw is one wild movie ride! This is a must for anyone who enjoys horror movies or police detective movies. I have to say I have never seen a movie quite like this. It really keeps your interest and has a lot of surprises you don't see coming. The masterminds behind this movie should give their selves a pat on the back for creating such an awesome ""not your everyday"" scary movie. The things that can really happen to you are the ones that get me really scared. No ghosts, no long boring plots to follow. This movie should start a revolution for other movies to follow. People really want and need to see this kind of stuff. It really makes you think, ""What if I was in their situation?"" I highly recommend watching this one. It may be one you only watch once, but it is definitely worth the ride. Time really zooms by and before you know it, the movie is over and you are wanting more. Sequel, anyone?"
"ComboTron","7","1","2","2 February 2005"," Good but not completely satisfying
","James Wans ""Saw"" is best described as a psycho thriller with some elements of horror movies. The name suggests a hack-and-slash ""ten-teenies-and-a-killer-in-a-house-movie"" but it absolutely isn't. Althougth it isn't a great movie, it still has it good and bad sides. Let's take a closer look.<br/><br/>The movie begins good when Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) find themselves in a room, chained by one foot. In the middle of them is a dead body, with a gun and a little tape recorder next to it. Both find a tape in their trousers pocket. When they play it, a creepy voice sets Dr. Gordon for a choice. If he doesn't kill Adam within eight hours, his woman and little daughter will be killed.<br/><br/>Then Dr. Gordon recognises the situation. The moment when they discover they are victims of a serial killer who likes to do sadistic psycho logic experiments told by flashbacks of the victims is thrilling and reminds me strongly of Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"". The main theme of this experiments is, how far would you go to save your own life? The way the victims react in the different situation is very realistic because it represents pure fear and so humanity. Moreover did the custom designer a awesome job by making the bad guys mask. It can be described as defying, sadistic and evil, which perfectly suits the content of his experiments.<br/><br/>But then, there are a view scenes which don't add anything to the whole story and contains crappy acting. The middle of the film feels like they rushed through it and never shot a single scene twice. This is a sin, because the starting of the movie promised much and I was expecting the same fear-factor in the next three quarters.<br/><br/>The ending compensates this a bit. There are a few scenes which are very realistic. The faces of terror and the disturbing footage gives us a good impression of mens will to survive or their will to protect their loved ones. However, the last scene isn't satisfying and logic at all. It gives you the feeling that the script writer hadn't enough time to finish it properly.<br/><br/>This movie isn't bad, but it deserved more then 18 days of filming and such a low budget. When they had chosen to use an ending with a little bit more logic and if they had discovered the benefit of crossing out some scenes in the middle of the movie during the cutting process, this movie could be one of the best in it's genre."
"mrblonde1110","10","1","2","1 February 2005"," Guilty Pleasure
","I just got this account and the first movie I chose to review was Saw(2004). There are two reasons for this: one is that it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore and two is because I saw it for the first time last night. This is probably one of maybe seven ten movies I've ever seen. as time goes on with this account (if you, the reader, see more of my reviews) it will become painstakingly clear that I hate most films, especially horror. As I read a lot of your comments I see that a lot of people hated this film-why? The acting, although weak and faltering in some parts, made up for it in the important scenes in the movie. For those of you who said that it was a horrid ending I say to hell with you. The reason he could stay still so long and the reason he was doing it all was that he had a purpose-vengeance on those who take their life for granted when he has to suffer every minute he's alive. If you were listening you may have heard that he had an inoperable brain tumor-one that made him go the path of insanity which is not unheard of in those extreme cases (actually it's common). The real reason I gave the film a ten was because of that end scene-complete darkness with tortured screams calling out one after the other. the fact that characters we have grown to like get it right up the ass, figuratively of course."

In one hand there's a small tape recorder and in the other hand there's a gun. They find on them self an envelope with their name on it and inside is a tape that says play me.<br/><br/>The movie starts out as a big mystery, but they figure out on the way more an more about what is going on. I will definitely label this movie as ""A MUST SEE"" for thriller/horror/mystery fans. The beginning is very creative, but the real breathtaker is the ending, never has there been such an amazingly creative ending as the one in saw. I can reveal that they start filming ""Saw 2"" in feb-2005, i can't wait for the sequel, i can only hope, it will be as creative and breathtaking as Saw was."

"silentcheesedude","9","1","2","23 January 2005"," Gritty, claustrophobic fun
","It's tough to find a good, low budget horror movie now-a-days. Back in the 80's, slasher flicks were fine for the population looking for a thrill. As long as you had a lunatic with a knife, it didn't matter if you didn't have a good plot or known actors. That doesn't work anymore, and SAW proves it by making a solid, well done, low budget film that brought in profits.<br/><br/>The setup is simple: Two men are placed in a large, nasty looking room, complete with a toilet that hasn't seen a brush in a few decades. They are both tied to their ankles with chains. It seems that the only way they are going to get out of this is to hack through their legs with a saw only strong enough to break skin and bone, but not steel chains. As they piece together the puzzle as to why they are there, we are given details about the serial killer behind all of this called Jigsaw. Both of them will be pitted against themselves and each other, all the way through the very surprising end. It's worthy of a Hitchcock type of twist. Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>Leigh Whannell plays Adam, who is one of the men chained up. He wrote and produced the story together with James Wan, who also directed. As a first time effort for Wan, this is outstanding, so much so that the studios have approached the producers for a sequel.<br/><br/>About the only drawback is the Cary Elwes, who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon. I do like him in most roles (mostly his sarcastic hero roles, like Robin Hood MIT, Princess Bride, and even Hot Shots!) but his performance here seems a bit out of place for him.<br/><br/>This is a low budget film, done for a little over a million. A shoestring by today's standard, and yet the production looks 10 times that amount. These types of independent films, and even some high budget films are bound to have some type of production flaw. Sure you can count some minor plot holes here and there, characters that are flawed beyond belief, and an unbelievable premise. But, when you consider life is several hundred times more brutal then anything you see in any horror film, just consider this a good escape from real life, even if it's an hour and 40 min. Stop thinking so much about reality, and enjoy.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

"demon_john","6","1","2","18 January 2005"," Chilling tale let down by OTT performances
","Two men wake up in a room chained to pipes with a body on the floor in a pool of blood, and no recollection of how they got there. They soon find a tape instructing one of the men, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) to kill the other (Leigh Whannell) within 6 hours, or his wife and daughter will be murdered. Dr. Gordon quickly realizes that they have become the latest victims of a serial killer known as ""The Jigsaw"", whose trademark is to put his victims in situations where they kill themselves, or each other. Neither of the men can reach the gun in the middle of the room, all they have been equipped with are saws too flimsy to cut through their chains, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone...<br/><br/>With an intriguing central premise, 'Saw' proves what can be achieved with a small budget and a big idea. Much like a cross between 'Se7en' and 'Cube', flashback is used to show us the fate of earlier victims, while most of the action is confined to the dark underground room where the men are being held (ala 'Cube') providing a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>The earlier part of the film is where 'Saw' works best, with the initial introduction to the serial killer and his victims both chilling and gripping, while the predicaments faced by both men heightens the sense of desperation as they work against the clock. Paranoia and suspicion are inevitably drawn in to the equation and through these plot convolution's we begin to 'piece' together the mystery of ""The Jigsaw"".<br/><br/>While hitherto displaying what can be achieved with a minimal budget, one area 'Saw' trips up is in it's casting. Instead of plumping primarily for unknown actors, the cast is comprised of z-list actors Cary Elwes, Monica Potter and Danny Glover. And z-list they will remain. Porbably the films greatest splurge is it's greatest flaw. Potter is just fine as the suffering wife, but this role could've been pulled off by anyone with breasts and a good pair of lungs. Glover hams it up as the cliché ridden obsessive cop while Elwes, at times cringe-inducing, overacts to the point of melodrama, though not helped by a script hampered with dire exchanges and misplaced dialogue. The central plot work well enough, and if the film had been perhaps somewhat improvised with an unknown cast (as in 'The Blair Witch Project) it could've brought a heightened sense of realism from which the film certainly would've benefited. The set pieces (with creepy masks and terrifying weapons aplenty) and premise are terrifying enough on their own, it's a shame we're drawn out of this by hammy acting and plot holes that don't stand up to repeat viewings. <br/><br/>6/10"
"Danielist","10","1","2","14 January 2005"," The title ""SAW"" is not as good as this amazing movie...
","This movie is totally far from the typical kind of scary movies which contain lots of chasing in the woods, disgusting masks or some boring curse craps. When I was in the theater, I kinda felt some pressure on me. It made me feel excitingly scared. Unlike the traditional movies, SAW did not try to scare people by killers' suddenly showing up but all its suspicious plot.<br/><br/>The Madarin title of the movie is ""Duo Hun Ju"" which means ""Spirit Taking Saw."" By the way I found it sucks. I think most Taiwanese would take this movie as some typical scary movies. Some people even thought that ""Saw"" is just a story about a psycho who runs after lots of innocent victims like the leather face guy in Taxes Chainsaw Massacre but he uses a simple saw this time. The stupid title has a serious effect. Few Chinese people like killing movies. I think the title of the movie should be like ""Game In The Cube"" or ""The Rules."" It's more logical and reasonable.<br/><br/>Sorry I forgot to recommend it. I just say it's really a creative movie. Besides I think it's an surprisingly healthy movie teaching us to be more optimistic and be satisfied with what you have now. Those who are depressed because of something little or want to commit suicide should really see the movie. I mean it.<br/><br/>Do not tell anyone who hasn't seen the movie the ending after you seeing it. I really feel bad myself because I read a guys comment which had mentioned the ending part.

This was a recurring thought because the flick was set up by the script to deliver extreme violence yet instead it came up short at every new scene demanding such an end.<br/><br/>Then there was the actual visual look of the movie which became more and more annoying with its choppiness that seemed like a desperate attempt to achieve something original without any spark of an idea behind it.<br/><br/>The makers of this production suffered from an acute case of gutlessness. They never made a really bold decision, instead going for these cheap tricks with the camera and lighting and manipulative setups that just never achieve any power. <br/><br/>The villain of this attempt at scary film which also lacked any dark humor- is ultimately unbelievable in the extreme as a victim of a brain tumor, and the film itself looks like a movie directed by Hitchcock just a few weeks away from death by the same illness. <br/><br/>While the film makers may have wanted Hitchcock and Dr. Lecter on screen what they made is something that looks like a student film funded by a millionaire daddy."

","I had read that this movie was a poor man's Se7en, so it was a genuine surprise to find that Saw is actually a very good, well-made thriller which keeps the pace moving frighteningly brisk throughout.<br/><br/>The movie begins in darkness and creates a tense mood right from the start. It is a relief when the lights come on and you can gain a sense of the scenario - two men on opposite sides of a room chained by a leg, with a dead body lying in a pool of blood in the centre of the room. Through a series of flashbacks, a little at a time is revealed of the situation they are in and how it came about.<br/><br/>There are some similarities to Se7en in that the movie concerns a serial killer who selects his victims with a macabre purpose. In this context, Saw compares favourably with Se7en and sheds more blood more graphically. This in itself does not make it a better movie, but it sustains its dark mood throughout as it continues to build up tension with a series of twists. Perhaps the final twist is beyond the pale but then in any movie of this type you need to suspend reality for best effect. And the ending does tie up a loose end that was barely even considered throughout the rest of the movie, that is, whose is the dead body lying in the pool of blood?<br/><br/>If you like your movies fast-paced with plenty of thrills, chills and gore, then this is for you - if you are prepared to suspend logic and go with the flow (of blood). 8/10"

","Saw is a puzzling physiological thriller that kept me guessing till the very end! The plot of the movie was very good. I have not been stumped like this during a movie in a long time. Some scenes were graphic, but never really showed anything that would make you not want to look at the screen. The director allowed just enough to let you imagine how bad and bloody the scene is. I loved this movie, but I was disappointed in the acting. Leigh Whennell (Adam, one of the men locked in the room) did a horrible job, and Cary Elwes (the other man locked in the room; best known from The Princess Bride)could have done a lot better. I put that aside, and got a great movie. Outstanding job!"

","Saw is a movie with a lot of potential, and one I had very high hopes for, but it turned out to be one of the most disappointing movies of the year.<br/><br/>The movie opens with two men, a doctor and another stranger, changed to pipes in a filthy bathroom. The movie spends most of its time in this bathroom, with a few scenes dedicated to explaining the mystery of the ""Jigsaw"" killer and to following the shallow and uninvolving subplot of a detective obsessed with nabbing the murderer. As the movie plods on it becomes clear that it either got its inspiration from Seven or is trying to rip off of it. In any case, Saw is a poorly executed copycat of a great and original film.<br/><br/>Saw has a weak plot that jumps quickly from scene to scene and never drew me in, and even weaker acting, which just falls short of the performances in my middle school Shakespeare play. Now being a fan of gory horror movies I was hoping that the movie would make up for its other setbacks by at least showing some gruesome effects, but there's only so much you can do with a million bucks. This movie turned out to be less intense than many, many others I've seen, and a lot less intense than I thought it would be. There's hardly any reason to worry about being traumatized after seeing this film.<br/><br/>There is one genuinely scary scene, however, and it involves a dark apartment and a unique take on flash photography; the rest of the movie is boring and about as scary as a Disney film.<br/><br/>Saw also wins two distinguished awards: 1) Worst Car Chase Scene Ever Filmed. Everyone who has ever tried to make a decent home movie and been depressed by the results should be encouraged by what they see here. 2) Most annoying name ever. I can't talk about having seen this movie or tell others not to see it without inadvertently using a dumb pun like ""I saw Saw"" or, most importantly, ""Don't see Saw!"""

","After seeing Saw, which played at the Sundance Film Festival and actually has received some glowing reviews, the absolute best thing I can say about it was that it wasn't boring.<br/><br/>It also wasn't even in the least bit suspenseful, looks so much like a bad heavy metal video during the thriller sequences that you would swear it was directed by a member of Spinal Tap, and features a script that not only completely squanders a fairly nifty premise but also becomes embarrassingly stupid after a while, filled with lapses in logic and gaping plot holes that are pretty unforgivable when you consider that the movie barely even has a plot to begin with.<br/><br/>The simplest way to sum up the movie is this: Saw is to Seven what Urban Legend was to Scream. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie actually was the trailer at the beginning for the French slasher pic High Tension, which is supposedly coming out for Valentines's Day. High Tension is the genuinely visceral, squirm inducing movie that the makers of Saw wanted their flick to be, so in that respect, at least, a theatrical viewing of Saw gives horror fans some reason for hope."
"shark-43","4","1","2","6 November 2004"," SAW is (S)AWFUL
","SAW is a mess of a movie - and I'm not talking about the bloody, filthy conditions the two lead actors find themselves in when the movie starts. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of clever things in this movie. It really TRIES to pull it all together but overall, the movie is just full of plot-holes and some real laughable moments of pure stupidity. Poor Cary Elwes has had a real strange career - he is absolutely charming and funny in Princess Bride and since then he really seems to have lost his way - showing up in second and third leads - playing the stiff boyfriend or the shifty cop. Here is a hardworking doctor who finds himself chained to a pipe in a killer's lair. (Again, this whole notion of someone being able to just turn an old factory into a torture chamber with millions of dollars of equipment and accessories is just ridiculous). Elwes really tries to make the moments work but I swear to you, near the end, his work goes so over-the-top, so hammy and corny - you want to call the Screen Actors Guild and have them stage an intervention. Also, the so-called police work that is done in this movie is so unintentionally moronic that the audience I saw this with was howling at some of the dumb mistakes Danny Glover makes in this movie. This is one of those serial killer movies where at various times either a cop or a tortured wife or victim get a chance to have an actual gun pointed at the killer and instead of shooting him many times or wounding him or disabling him or shooting him in both ankles, etc. they just point the gun at him and scream obscenties until they can be overpowered. The film really isn't scary or gory - just rather unpleasant in a Seven kind of way. Horrible things happening to humans and even children. I like this genre and there are some powerful moments in Saw, but overall, this movie should be chained to a pipe and left for dead."

I think the guy that wrote the script is a genius and I can't wait to see more of his work. Sure the movie has similarities to ""Seven"", but I found it to be quite original and a refreshing break from some of these sorry ""thrillers"" they've been coming out with (e.g. Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The village). And that ending? Wow! I didn't see it coming and believe me, I usually have these kinds of movies figured out by the 3rd quarter. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that some of the acting is ridiculous and had the entire crowd in the theater laughing at times.

","""Saw"" is relentlessly grisly. The serial-killer genre has been run into the ground recently, but ""Saw"" grinds it into mush and churns it out kicking and screaming once again. Here, the killer never really kills anyone, he simply sets up overly elaborate and grotesque scenarios that leave his hapless victims with painful choices, die a horrible death, kill yourself first, or kill someone else to escape. What we get here as viewers, is some of the best hardcore horror gore splattering this side of the latest zombie-fest.<br/><br/>""Saw"" has everything a hardcore cult classic of this ilk needs to stand the test of time. The director, James Wan, is a hapless slap-dash hack (the editing is especially horrible) with a lovingly perverse penchant for the grotesque and macabre. Hardcore horror fans will rejoice. The film's set-ups are clever, and its executions are over the top. The film is anchored by a screamingly bad lead performance from Cary Elwes. All the performances here (save for the creepy tape-recorded voice of the Jigsaw killer) are terrible, but Elwes (who always seems to be acting as if he is still in ""The Princess Bride"") has some of the most howlingly awful sobbing/screaming scenes I have ever seen. Once you get done puking, you will laugh, as most of the audience did. I don't think the laughs are intentional, but by george, they are surely needed, because the last piece of the cult-classic-status puzzle is the stomach-churning ending. The last ten minutes of the film give us such a perverse twist, that it will leave the viewer shell-shocked. Don't expect a nice tidy ending. The film is as sloppy as its director, but the climax is as insanely ingenious as the killer it depicts. I was shocked, and so were the hardcore fans I went with, and that is saying a lot. So, if you are like us, see ""Saw"", otherwise, I can't recommend this gnarly hack-work to anyone else."

Let me say just I as a life long fan of all things horror I enjoyed SAW, bottom line was the that had the acting not blown ass the reviews would have been very different. I gave SAW 6 out of 10 had the acting been pitch perfect I think people would have been carried out of the theater.<br/><br/>Saw seems to now be racking up negative reactions which I think could have been avoided if we factor in a few things.<br/><br/>1).Hype. This film had a lot of hype. People were convinced that they were going to see that most frightening film in years so expectations were super high. I think if this had quietly been released limited or straight to video<br/><br/>and the word spread by word of mouth the effect would have been better for the people watching, That is scary for studio and no one would gamble like that, however it would've had less expectations.<br/><br/>2).This was a low budget horror film not 'The hours' when everyone complains about the acting I have to wonder what there favorite horror movies are? The two men behind this film are clearly planted on the coat tails of Dario Argento and his brutal films. Argento has made some of the best horror films ever and not single one of them contained a good acting performance! While I admit It hurt a film that was so dependent of psychology, Acting doesn't ruin all horror films.<br/><br/>3).People need to realize how hard making a movie is and remember that saw is a film by a first time director on a low budget. He may have wanted to take more time to film multiple takes of (which could have given Cary Ewles a chance to not suck) scenes. He was probably under pressure to get things done fast and in budget.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* 4).Try thisexplain to someone who is not in to horror movies the reverse trap scene. Explain that to save her life she would have cut open a person who was drugged on the floor to find the key to the contraption that was seconds from splitting her head apart. Twisted, look at the faces of the people you tell it to! <br/><br/>*End spoiler*<br/><br/>I thought the writing was amazing, which only makes the weakness of the directing and acting so much more painful.

Soon, we discover that Adam & Dr. Gordon are somehow connected and no one is as they seem.<br/><br/>Whannell co-wrote the story along with director James Wan. The plot of ""Saw"" is superb with interesting plot twists, nice shock moments, and is nicely structured. Likewise, Wan does a good job of painting the picture very dark and disturbing. Also, Wan does a fine job of portraying the ""room"" as being utterly bleak and seemingly inescapable.<br/><br/>However, the acting in ""Saw"" is the ultimate downfall of the film. Whannell does a decent job of adding humor to the movie but is not very good in the scenes in which he is intended to show deeper emotions. Elwes is absolutely terrible towards the end of the movie. He completely fails to pull off the movie's most demanding scenes which comes towards the end of the film. Glover and Leung are OK (and they have decent chemistry), but they are both under-used in the story.

A couple of the issues I'd like to discuss and hear every theory on pick any random issue to respond to or take them all on! <br/><br/>1. The Jigsaw Piece(s). Was Colon Cancer man using the jigsaw flesh to make his pig-beast mask? What was the significance of the fat man having the piece missing? Was such a fleshy token acquired from naked-candle-poison victim? Why did he need the piece(s)? Were they simply and elaborate quirkly fetish? Come on, people let's get to the bottom of this.<br/><br/>2. Mr. Puppet. Shxt, where to begin. Is there more than one puppet? Like a small dummy and a life size model? Did Colon Cancer man control the puppet through some means of the occult, or was the suit actually a life size costume as the tricycle scene suggested? What did the puppet represent, or was it simply creepiness for the sake of creepiness? Was there any supernatural elements involved with the bond between Colon Cancer man, Mr. Puppet and the various victims? <br/><br/>3. The ending. OK so (*HUGE SPOILER*) the dead dude on the floor=Colon Cancer man=the Jigsaw killer. So I'm taking it that he wants people to appreciate life because he knows dying sucks. Alright that's clear enough, I assume he goes and gives hobbled-doughy-Robin Hood Men In Tights-man a curb sandwich because he didn't complete his task. Alllriiight I guess.

","If only this movie didn't have so much potential: a cast of historically competent actors, an interesting premise, and a reasonably compelling story, it might not be so painful to sit through the drivel that is ""Saw."" Yet, just as you might slow down for a glimpse of a gruesome car accident on the side of the road, you will probably be curious and stare riveted at the screen until the bitter end, wondering just what twist will be yanked from the amateurish screenwriter's posterior next.<br/><br/>Easily, the worst part of this movie was the acting, or, possibly, bad editing made the timing and tone seem worse than it was. At its best moments, it's as melodramatic as a 19th century British parlor room drama. At its worst, one could wonder whether it has stooped to self-parody. In fact, in the crowded movie theater where I saw this film on opening night, loud laughter nearly covered the ridiculous supposed climax of the movie. This was not the sort of nervous giggling that sometimes accompanies horror and gore; this was the kind of full-out belly laughter one might hear in an uproarious comedy. One wonders if any test-screenings of this film were consulted and how this final version was allowed to make it to distribution.<br/><br/>Again, the story was fairly inventive, if somewhat gimmicky. However, the surprise-twist ending was certainly a surprise; it was basically physically impossible if you'd been watching the rest of the movie. The greatest surprise endings, while difficult to guess, make the rest of the movie make more, not less, sense, explain unanswered questions from the rest of the movie, and allow a second viewing to give you an enjoyable new perspective. This ending does none of these three things. <br/><br/>I'm quite baffled at the high rating this movie is currently enjoying on this site, and the box office success it reportedly has had this weekend. My advice: skip it and rent ""Se7en"" again."

","I found this to be a mix of 2 movies, one I liked very much, ""Seven"" and one I didn't like much at all, ""Phone Booth"". This one ranked right there in the middle but probably should be closer to the latter. The idea was nothing real new here but some of the concepts were. However this film had one major problem and that is it wasn't scary which I'm pretty sure was what it strides for. Whereas ""Seven"" was beautifully rendered and flowed like poetry this just became downright stupid in some parts. It could have just pertained to my audience but a lot of them were laughing at parts especially during the second half. This was good in one instance that was supposed to be funny however I'm quite sure that the others were actually very serious but unfortunately didn't get perceived as such. The acting wasn't anything to write home about either. Another goal that didn't get reached was the audience was supposed to stop and think both during and after the viewing about their life, kind of like ""Seven"" did, in the whole 'what would you do if you were in this spot' mode. Sadly this didn't happen as I left the theater disappointed in a few ways. The gruesome factor wasn't that bad either and most people will be able to handle it without any qualms. A good attempt, but needed big improvements all over the place.<br/><br/>Final Slander:<br/><br/>Movies: Not really worth it.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: See previous line.<br/><br/>Rental: Waiting for this option is probably your best bet!"

","This movie has a story and an ending but the acting is the worst I've seen in a long time. Did they screen this thing? If so, who said ""Great movie, release it to the general public."" Barely worth an NR rating for a DVD release. Danny Glover is the biggest joke in Hollywood history and the dude playing Dr. Gordon was a one hit wonder in The Princess Bride. Who are these people praising this film? The 12-year-old in front of me said this thing sucked. The script and dialogue where jokes. Really, people in the theatre were laughing like this was a comedy. I thought the bad acting had to be part of the twist but no, they passed this off as a scary movie. Refund please?

","I go to a horror movie to be scared (although no horror movie actually scares me) so lets just say I go to be entertained, but this movie did neither. I think Mr. Wan used a book about making horror movies to make this one, as nothing surprised me and there were many old worn out horror movie plot devices contained within. I will say that the end of the movie was confusing, which can be a good thing, but not in this case. I read that the gore was toned down for the theatre, but being a fan of some good old fashioned blood and guts, there was very little to speak of. Of course I'm not saying that gore makes a movie good or improves it, but it is an added bonus in some movies. I think the writers of ""SE7EN"" should be insulted that this movie was compared to their film, as they are not even in the same league. If you are a fan of good suspenseful crime stories, then in my opinion you should save your money and rent ""SE7EN"" or ""SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"" again as they are both light years better than this film. I give ""SAW"" 4.5 out of 10 stars."

Right! - I guessed OK? Actually, it wasn't even a guess - I mean, James Wan might as well as placed a flashing arrow over the killer's head or maybe even got the rest of the cast to point and wink.<br/><br/>Cary Elwes' acting was abysmal I have not seen him in a film since Kiss The Girls and even then I had to look him up. Am-Dram at best. Leigh Whannell performs better but not much. I always find Danny Glover a disappointment; he hit his 'peak' with the Lethal weapon series (Don't even mention Predator 2) I say 'peak - more of a small hillock really.<br/><br/>Yes, the twist was both unexpected and shocking.

","When you get sooooo excited about a movie, it's hard to tell people how good it is. Words just can't describe how thrilling it was to find a movie like SAW and have it be such an amazing surprise. There have been so many ""horror"" movies lately that critics call the the scariest movie of the year, that end up being huge disappointments (""The Village""? ""Open Water""? I rest my case) So I was setting myself up for the same disappointment when I saw SAW at the Toronto International Film Festival last night. And I have to say the film blew me away. It's what true horror should be: Gory, clever, surprising, and terrifying on a very primitive level. This is a film that rarely has pointless ""jump"" scares (you know, a loud music hit then a cat runs by) but achieves a fear that stays with you in a way that you could see someone walk down the street, and it's scary. My heart was thumping the whole time. The images are truly disturbing, and that's a good thing. It creates more fear. Director James Wan is probably the best thing to happen to horror in a long time. Some of the visuals he creates in this film will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. And writer/actor Leigh Wannell has created such a cool premise for a horror story that it's so refreshing to watch, because you've never seen it before. Whichever one of the two thought about using a camera flash to light up a room when the power goes out (you'll understand when you see the film), my hat goes off. That scene is one of the scariest I've seen because of the pure suspense and fear that they've created. If I had to point out something bad about the film (and there's not much bad about it) it would have to be the acting. Now, I'm not saying it's community theatre acting, because there are some amazing talents here, and throughout most of the movie they all shine, but as an actor myself, I pick up on some of the weaker moments. And there where some lines that were said that weren't totally believable. But that being said, horror isn't really an ""acting"" genre, so it's easy to look beyond. Anyway, in closing, this is one of the most original movies, not just horror movies, to come along in a while, and truly one of the scariest. You have to go see it whether you like horror or not because it is such a thrilling movie going experience. It deserves to be up there with ""The Exorcist"" as one of the scariest movies of all time. I cannot wait to see what Wan and Wannell do next. They definitely have a successful future ahead of them!! SEE SAW!!!!!!!"

","2 guys wake up in a room after being kidnapped. Through clues they find out that one has to kill the other to survive. Apparently they are being held captive by a psychopath who enjoys torturing people by playing deadly games with them. The film has an interesting premise as far as horror films go, but the execution turns the whole thing into an unfunny comedy. Annoyingly stupid turns of plot, utterly unbelievable screenplay (no one would act this way given the circumstances), amateur acting performances and the clueless way it was filmed left me scratching my head as to why the film has gathered such a large fan base. Anyone with a basic grasp of directing and or screen writing could have done a far better job with it. Just ridiculous."

It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This was an enormous achievement for both James Wan, and Leigh Wannell. The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary cliches. The film is incredible and it start from Saw 2,3,4,5,6, Final Chapter, Jigsaw, and now in 2020 Spiral.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","3","28 May 2019"," Saw cuts through a meticulously intricate crime mystery with nothing but bloody wits.
","The cultural phenomenon that has spawned an entire, albeit probably unnecessary, franchise including sequels, prequels, video games and a theme park ride (Thorpe Park anyone?). The film that put the modern legend that is James Wan on the blood-soaked Hollywood map, whilst also establishing the Wan/Whannell dream team. So, this being my first time watching it, was Saw really that sharp of a thriller? Or just blunted by its overbearing sequels? Well, suffice to say, it holds up with excellence. Two men wake up in a dilapidated bathroom with only one order: one must kill the other in order to save his family.<br/><br/>An ultimatum that would test the psychological stimuli and moral compasses of both the characters and the audience. Raising that inevitable question: ""what would you do?"". Wan immediately inserts his hyper-kinetic energy, with the assistance of the hyperactive editing team, and introduces several of his trademark directing techniques. Panoramic camera rotations, seamless switches between handheld and static and elongated takes through dark corridors. Sometimes the bursts of 30-40 cuts within a 3 second timeframe is somewhat disorientating, and the aura of TV-movie presides over the frenetic editing, however Wan just about maintains a level of cinematic quality. And with that, his unique storytelling along with Whannell'a script makes for a tantalising thriller.<br/><br/>The suspense immediately kicks in when we find ourselves stuck in this room with these two unknown characters. Why are they here? Who are they? How do they escape? It resembled one of those ""escape room"" activities that seem to be rapidly popular for recreational enjoyment these days. But then the narrative shifts. Of course Wan could not keep up the tension for an hour and forty minutes in a room, there wasn't enough substance. So he ingeniously integrated a flashback structure that slowly revealed who these characters were and why they were there tied up in chains. It had a sniff of 'Se7en' meets 'CSI: Miami'. Yet it illustrated the almost labyrinthine story that Whannell devised, with Wan carefully placing breadcrumbs. It held my attention solidly throughout. The serial killer ""jigsaw"", along with his puppet, was practically immortalised after this film. Horror fans would consistently quote ""I wanna play a game"", which is a testament to the staying power of Wan's creation.<br/><br/>There are however a few issues. The acting on occasion was, how can I put it, iffy. Whannell starred in the film alongside Elwes and were probably the strongest performances. Glover, Smith and Vega on the other hand were not nearly as effective. The devices and traps that ""Jigsaw"" created unfortunately didn't hold much memorability. Mostly because they were tainted by frantic editing, particularly the barbed wire trap, but mostly because the focus was solely on the current mystery. Which is acceptable, although the sudden focus on the ""jaw breaker"" device held no tension and lost the suspense raised so far, merely included just to highlight the crazed morality of the antagonist.<br/><br/>Oh, how could I end this review without spoiling the infamous plot twist? I jest. Unfortunately I knew about it beforehand, but its execution was effortless and I would imagine it blew everyone's mind upon release. That accompanied with the famous theme tune? Yeah. That's gold. Well there you go. Saw is still as sharp as ever and despite a few poor technical and narrative decisions, it comes as no surprise why a franchise was born. Low-budget thrills done right. As always, ""in Wan we trust""."

","Despite being such a high profile ""horror"" title, the fact that Saw is lacking an underlying sense of dread and tension is remarkably surprising. There are pockets of tension dotted throughout the film (in particular the trap sequences), just not to the extent you may imagine. <br/><br/>The cinematography is well executed, and is most notable in moments of aggressive editing ( the trap sequences) where it is used to great effect to create tension.<br/><br/>Saw deserves praise for its non linear plot structure, featuring an abundance of flash backs and multiple story lines.<br/><br/>The leads deliver modest performances, however the supporting cast are a little more mediocre. <br/><br/>One minor complaint is that protagonist Adam sometimes behaves like he's in a completely different environment to the hostile death trap he's been plunged into, including spouting cringe worthy pieces of dialogue."

","For my 500th review I have decided to begin my 'Saw' series of reviews leading up to the October release of the eighth installment 'Jigsaw'. Back around 2004 the ""situational horror/thriller' genre was quite a big thing, however it seemed no one could quite nail it. They even tried making a main stream one in 'Collateral' which admittedly was a pretty good film. Other than that though it seemed no one could seem to quite get it right. Then along came James Wan and Leigh Whannell with a little project they called 'Saw' and the rest is history.<br/><br/>So what made 'Saw' so great? Firstly, was how clever it was. Other similar films always felt like they were trying to be clever, but could never quite pull it off. 'Saw' had a genuine motive and a genuinely intriguing premise. It was incredibly simple and incredibly intricate all at the same time. Secondly, was the originality. Never before had we really seen anything like this. The situations these characters were being put in were not only thought-provoking and captivating to watch, they also were unlike anything we had seen.<br/><br/>It was a low-budget production obviously so it's far from a perfectly put together package. The acting for one thing is quite shocking in a few moments. It wasn't until the sequels where the budget obviously increased that they became very fine and well oiled machines. Nonetheless though 'Saw' is one of the best horror films ever made and is proof that storytelling will always be where the true strength of any film lies."

","The infamous torture porn movie that is Saw. This horror movie serves as more than just a sketch show of creative and elaborate traps rigged to kill those in its way, it is essentially a psychological mystery thriller about two men piecing together how they came to be the latest victims in a puppets game whilst also solving the puzzle that is... the identity of Jigsaw killer.<br/><br/>The film is of course unsettling and disturbing, It's a torture porn horror film after all. The film successfully creates this uncomfortable feeling with the use of creative camera-work, good direction, nauseous plot points and (fortunately) minimal jump scares.<br/><br/>Would you like to play a game? Let's play count the flashbacks. The film is overly reliant on the use of flashbacks that the film even contains flashbacks within flashbacks. The infamous Head trap is one of these inception like flashbacks.<br/><br/>One other issue I had with the film was the poor/ lack of explanation for major plot points. The key in the bathtub at the very start of the film as well as the reasons for why Adam and Dr Gordon are in this situation as they haven't really done anything wrong. These plot points could have been explained far better then they were so that audience members can actually understand key moments and back story of the film.<br/><br/>Overall Saw is a disturbing, creative and scary film that like many good horror films would subject itself to a string of sequels each one worse than the other. But it would not have happened if not for this successful horror thriller that will leave you both disturbed and intrigued to see the next instalment"

They play audio tapes and the voice tells Gordon that he must kill Stanheight before 6 O'clock or else his wife Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter Diana (Makenzie Vega) will die. Adam finds two saws in the toilet tank. Gordon suspects the perpetrator is the Jigsaw Killer. He recounts police detectives David Tapp (Danny Glover), Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) and Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigating. Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) is an orderly and John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is his patient. Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) is the only known survivor of the killer's elaborate games with a harness wired to her jaw.<br/><br/>I love the compelling premise of two guys chained in a room. Once Amanda Young's harness shows up, the movie becomes too convoluted to be scary. On the other hand, it becomes fun splatter. There is no denying that the elaborate plans are ridiculous but the movie completely owns it. Jigsaw is a Picasso clown and that's part of the fun. There is an interesting mystery of trying to escape from the room. It would be better if Jigsaw isn't so invasive leaving the clues. For example, there is no need for a clue to tell them to turn off the lights. It would be more compelling for the guys to guess on their own. It feels like a carefully laid out path and there is no tension in that. I'm not revealing the final twist but there are good points and bad points about that. It's impossibly elaborate but utterly surprising."

","So unfortunately I watched this 11 years after it came out-hands down one of the best horror/thrillers ever. I had low expectations for some reason, but it was the rarest of occasions that I was dead wrong. <br/><br/>The script is airtight-close to perfect, as far as logic goes. The way it built to the end with everything falling into place was brilliant. When the killer stood up in the room at the end my jaw literally dropped and I was yelling ""oh my God"" to myself in my room (and my dogs I guess). <br/><br/>I can see why people said this is more thriller than horror. A genius concept though- a killer who helps you be grateful for your life. It was extremely well executed too, and all of the killer's schemes were really well thought out. The pacing and editing was really well done. They'd show just enough of what's going on outside the room, then when you're wondering what how the 2 guys in the room are doing they'd switch to that. <br/><br/>This movie easily could've sucked with lesser writers, although I guess that's true of anything but especially here. He could've relied on gore. He could've been lazy in the 2nd act by showing some dumb scenes of excess marital backstory between husband & wife, showing the cop getting fired or something (Danny glover's character was awesome btw but his arc was perfect), or spending too much time in the room with the 2 dudes arguing. In fact, the writer probably had that in earlier drafts but discarded it bc he's a better writer. <br/><br/>Instead, he pushed it to the limit by switching it up and revealing little details along the way. He kept me guessing to the very end who the killer was. This is how good of a twist the ending is: (major spoiler alert): I remembered someone telling me the killer is in the room the whole time about a decade ago when it came out, but I got so wrapped up and engaged in the movie that I dismissed my memory as mistaken and was still shocked by the ending! Honestly that was incredibly well done. <br/><br/>I totally thought the orderly was the killer. Also I liked that both guys in the room live in the end too. The writer did a great job making me root for both of them and care about what happens. <br/><br/>Thank you for a great experience!"

","Horror films like this may be old hat today, but I think we should dedicate a moment of silence to honor what may have been the first of its kind. OK, enough silence, let's get back to blood curdling screams.<br/><br/>""Saw"" distinguished itself from the usual 90s-00s horror tosh by taking a pseudo intellectual approach as in classics like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""The Cell"" where the killer is not just a mindless hockey goalie on a bad day with power tools. The killer has a distinct, logical, stylish modus operandi that will appeal to people who know the meaning of the word ""modus operandi"". If you don't, or if you don't care, there's still plenty of suspense, action and blood & guts (literally) to keep you entertained from start to finish.<br/><br/>""Saw"" is the story of a serial killer who is highly intelligent, highly resourceful (some of the diabolical devices he builds could be featured on Mythbusters), and most interestingly the killer is driven by a twisted sense of morality. This brings to mind the mother of all serial-killer-morality tales ""Seven"" which Saw undoubtedly drew inspiration from. While I don't think ""Saw"" is in league with ""Seven"", it does a great job of keeping up, and I think it's worth a watch.<br/><br/>Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"") playing the obsessed cop on a manhunt and Cary Elwes (I'll always remember him from ""The Princess Bride"") playing the intelligent victim, raise the bar with their excellent, characteristic performances. And while the story may have 1 or 2 loopholes, you can handily overlook them in light of these two iconic actors and a story that unravels suspensefully at every turn.<br/><br/>I did want to mention one thing for the squeamish (as well as those of you who crave the squeam), ""Saw"" isn't as over-the-top disgusting as I had been told. Yes, there's a ton of blood and a few hurl worthy scenes of bad things happening to body parts, but for the most part it's somewhat tame by today's standards. I actually like that, because it's a film I can recommend to my mom. The lack of nudity/sex and the interesting morality angle furthermore might make it a family-safe film.

The whole time during this scene we get to know the two main characters, Adam and Gordon, and how they interact with each other. Adam is at first the most nervous and afraid of them and have a hard time trusting Gordon for whatever reason, while Gordon seems almost unnaturally calm to begin with but his temper become more and more apparent as more details about their situation is known.<br/><br/>Their characters are both brought to life by incredibly well done performances, nearly all of their lines being delivered with an almost perfect level of realism, and the two actors play off each other brilliantly, really showing their relationship of forced trust play out and evolve in a way to keep you invested in their thoughts for the whole film.<br/><br/>After the introduction to the main characters, the pace starts gradually increasing as we start receiving pieces of the puzzle of what have happened here via the help of flashbacks, creating a cinematic jigsaw puzzle where more and more pieces are filled in as time goes by. <br/><br/>We find out a serial killer dubbed the Jigsaw killer might be behind their kidnapping, a person of unknown identity who abduct their victims and have them go through lethal games to test their will to live based on their sins in life. The killer's character is intentionally left vague for this film, but is explored more in depth in the second movie.<br/><br/>We are also introduced to a large and diverse cast of characters tied into the case in various ways, them also brought to life by excellent performances. The only acting I had any problem with was the somewhat cheesy acting of one particular character that I can't mention in fear of spoiling anything, but they are thankfully given rather few lines and other than that this movie really achieves to blend the line between someone just pretending and somebody really being there.<br/><br/>This is part of why the horror elements of this movie works so incredibly well. When eventually terrible things start happening to people we are emotionally invested in and care about due to their realistic and sympathetic portrayals, the horror of seeing them in danger is escalated to levels well beyond what is usually seen in mainstream horror films. Their reactions to their suffering as thus also manages to creep under your skin and make you feel genuinely afraid for them, which is where I think the accusations of this being ""torture porn"" comes from.<br/><br/>Because the movie is not really very gory. There is a couple of shots of some gore, some police case photos of earlier victims, but the real visual punch from the movie is how they mostly hide the visuals involving such body horror and instead focus on visualizing their fear. Camera techniques such as speeding up footage, sporadic editing, experimental use of camera framing and other techniques are applied to moments of horror to give the visual idea of fear, panic and suffering without trying to just gross out the audience with it, and instead disturb you at a deep emotional level.<br/><br/>The score also helps a lot, being held up by great industrial pieces that range from ambient electronic during down moments of character interaction to full out noise rock to accompany scenes of panicking, helping create an atmosphere of dirty grim locales far away from any helping hands while not giving the impression of there being no hope at all. And of course the now iconic theme song that plays once all the pieces of the puzzle is put together and we are revealed the big secret behind this will send chills down your spine.<br/><br/>The film is also filled to the brim with small details all around, being a movie that rewards re-watching it by suddenly catching a small detail you didn't notice before, or something you were confused by suddenly making sense when you see it from a different angle when coming back to it. This I think is a testament to how much love and care is put into this film by its creators, and all of this is incredibly done on a very tight budget and shooting period without ever feeling rushed or half done.<br/><br/>All in all it's hard to describe this film in a way that gives it justice without actually giving away too much, so I will end with saying that you should give this film a try. Clear your brain of the hype, don't go in expecting gore and excess, and instead try to look past the marketing and look for the core of the film itself. If you are anything like me, chances are you might be pleasantly surprised by the genuinely effective thriller you can find there that never gets old to watch."
"arussell23","9","1","3","11 June 2015"," 'Saw' is an innovative horror film that all fans of the genre should witness
","In 2003, up and coming filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell created a 9-minute short film (now dubbed Saw 0.5) to try and market their idea for the film that would start a cultural phenomenon. They optioned the script and short around until they finally gained the attention of producer Gregg Hoffman, who later showed it to some partners and created the film label entitled Twisted Pictures. Given 18 days and a $1 mil production budget, the two filmmakers set to work on creating one of the best horror films in the last 15 years. Let's see how good of a job they did.<br/><br/>Saw follows two men chained to pipes in a bathroom, with no recollection of how they got there or who brought them there. As the two slowly figure out the game they're apart of, a detective obsessed with finding out who the person responsible is attempts to close in on his suspected killer.<br/><br/>Until yesterday, I had never seen the original Saw film in it's entirety. Sure, I had seen some of the traps and I had actually seen a lot of the movie through clips and such. But, this was the first time I had sat down and watched the film. How does it hold up, especially nearly eleven years after it's release? Well, let's see.<br/><br/>The acting is really great. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell both do great jobs at portraying people from completely different backgrounds but who are both left, stuck in a situation they can relate to. Tobin Bell, even in his very limited role in this film, is still bone-chilling as the diabolical Jigsaw (or, his real name, John Kramer), and delivers a performance that many should remember for years to come. Danny Glover is fantastic as Detective Tapp, a figure with a dark past, who is obsesssed with finding out Jigsaw's identity. Monica Potter also does a great job as Elwes's wife. I won't explain her role in the story because I suppose it's a spoiler, but she does great in the role.<br/><br/>The music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it that you would expect in a film like this. The unofficial theme song to the film, entitled ""Hello Zepp,"" is probably one of the best themes to a horror movie, ever, especially when you think about the climatic ending that accompanies the song. In my opinion, the music to the film really elevated it above a standard horror movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the script and the story. It really deserved it's R rating, with all the ""fucks,"" ""shits,"" and such in the film. The story was pretty tight, even if there were a few small plot holes that I noticed, but it's probably because I'm such a good person at noticing things like that. The script was great, giving us dialogue you would reasonably expect in a time like this.<br/><br/>The cinematography and direction was spot on. James Wan, or perhaps the editor, liked to use a lot of shots that lingered or would like pan over to a spot and fade into another scene or location. That gimmick worked very well in some scenes (one I can remember the best is when the camera pans down and into the bathroom from the ceiling).<br/><br/>The only thing I really didn't like about the film was a bit of the gore. I'm okay with gore and blood in films, but the film took it to extremes a bit. Perhaps that's why people didn't like the film, because there's so much of it in there. Now that I think about it, it doesn't really bother me, but still.<br/><br/>Overall, Saw is a fantastic horror film. The acting, music, script, story and cinematography are all completely on point. While I do have a few issues with some elements of the story and a bit of the shots with gore, Saw is a film that any horror buff needs to check out.<br/><br/>9/10. Grade: A-"
"alishahmohd","9","1","3","26 July 2014"," Game Over!
","The year 2004 was a great year for Hollywood. As this year brought many brilliant, memorable and big budget movies to Hollywood which were both critically and commercially successful. Saw was one of those films which was actually the wild card. It was an independent film with a low budget and a new entry into the survival horror and suspense/thriller genre of movies, with so many movies of the genre already out during that during time period, Saw was the dark house and it was not known whether it would be successful or not. <br/><br/>Saw turned out to be a such a big success that it spawned 6 sequels. I always wanted to watch this movie as I am a fan of genre, but what put me off was that there was a lot of gore in this movie. I can handle violence but after watching many films with so much pointless gore and bloodshed just for the sake of it, I did not get around to watching this movie until recently. <br/><br/>The film puts you right into the action two men who don't know each other are trapped in a room together with a corpse, with no idea how they got there, they find out that some serial killer coin named the Jigsaw has trapped them there and wants them to play his Game to survive, than several events unfold with the two guys attempting to find out a way out, and also trying to get to know each other knowing that these maybe their final hours. The film also switches back and forth with flashback sequences of both guys that led them to that place which adds to the suspense of the film, we also get a flashback on some of the earlier Games played by the Jigsaw. There is also an interesting side story about a cop named Dupp who is obsessed with Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The films starts out great and will have you hooked to your seats and it adds to the mystery that the film was not told in a chronological order but kept on switching back and forth between the present and past sequences this leaves rooms for more shocking twists and more mysteries to be revealed.<br/><br/>Of course there was a twist at the end and I was not able to figure it out, I was actually shocked and the idea about it did not even cross my mind. But this twist leaves some ambiguity, interpretation and some suspension of disbelief. But the twist delivered in terms of shock value and many did not see it coming as I can tell from forums online. <br/><br/>The film is well shot and well directed, and the violence and gore is there but not to the extreme levels I expected so I did not find it that bad. Acting is fine, Adam and Lawrance do act somewhat naturally for the situation they were put in, Lawrence's character development by the end was also handled well. The Jigsaw did not get screen time a whole a lot but his voice was just menacing and villainous, and the mystery about him just adds to his character makes the character more thrilling and scary. The actor who plays the former detective Tapp also did a fine job. Shawnee Smith as Amanda was great in her cameo she played her traumatized character very well. The acting is not Oscar worthy or anything like that but I thought it was fine and done well.<br/><br/>Saw is an enjoyable horror/thriller film, It had me hooked from my seat from the beginning to the end and was extremely fun to watch. Although I am a fan of the genre there are films of this genre which I find tiresome and hard to sit through and mostly find myself skipping through the scenes , Saw was the complete opposite of such films it had me glued to my seat and I was anticipated to see what happens next. The end left me in shock and after the ending I am still thinking about this movie and it's story and trying to interpret it's events. This is a great survival horror, suspense, mystery which is recommended to any fan of the genre.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10."

"mitzibishi","4","1","3","13 September 2011"," great premise but a cheap trick horror that disappointed me again.
","Last night I rewatched Saw for a re-assessment, I remember going to the cinema to see this one and from what I remember I was luke warm about it back then. I remember being mildly put off by the guy from Robin Hood Men in Tights being the lead, I couldn't take him seriously after that film and he isn't the best serious actor. Comedies maybe. Acting, no.<br/><br/>so i thought id give it another chance, get over the fact robin hood was in it and watch a supposedly horror classic but again was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>don't get me wrong the premise is great and a new idea for once, the mystery theme was OK and twists at the end good also.<br/><br/>Was surprised to see the budget for the movie, pretty OK job for that budget but at times it did feel a little amateurish, not in look but the use of a lot of cheap tricks, the execution, plot holes and acting of some scenes was poor enough to take the horror right out of the scene and I've seen some cheap ass badly acted horrors in my time.<br/><br/>the gore was none existent, and the horror consisted of mostly loud scare noises and the bad guy/people shown moving around in fast forward quick editing then eventually shaking their head close up in front of the camera in fast forward accompanied by a loud scare noise.<br/><br/>That was the main scare because it looks weird/scary but the technique was used over and over and over again, and its a technique thats been used in many films and even TV shows to project insanity/chaos that its become clichÃ© to me now like Matrix bullet time and its a pretty cheap trick at that, although I'm not sure if James Wan invented this technique or Saw was one of the first films to use the trick so i gave the first 10 uses of it a bye on that reason but after that it became a one trick pony, probably the last straw was the obscene car chase fast forward, i suppose it was used to save money and not filming an actual car chase outside or they thought we'd better throw it in 1 last time because its our thing.<br/><br/>People may rest the horror on psychological and its an ""in the mind"", what you don't see kind of thing but the execution and cheap tricks ruined that aspect for me. the punchlines were always a loud scare noises or/and a scary face close up to the camera.<br/><br/>again the acting from the robin hood guy was pretty bad which is what the movie rested on, because basically most of the movie was 2 guys in a room, the whole plot centred around them and you feeling emotion for them. the 2 guys in a room story ain't a bad thing if done right, the atmosphere and plot of them in the room was done to good effect, the photographer guy sold it but robin hood(Carl Ewles) really fudged it amateur dramatic style and if a better actor was used who brought more to the table i would've liked it much more and would've blind sided its shortcomings in other areas, man i just cant take him seriously and he even upped the ante of bad acting in the final crucial scene.<br/><br/>Michael Emerson although a great actor and was surprised to see him just came off goofy mostly, i don't think it was his fault. Even Danny Glover was pretty mediocre, maybe it was the way they were directed and what they had to work with, it seemed like Danny phoned it in.<br/><br/>there were a lot of things that just irritated me, why didn't Michael Emerson go straight to hospital and alert cops of the whole thing instead of going ahead with everything like a goof, don't tell me Jigsaw has his crap so tight that there's only 1 cure in Country and hes got it, i wasn't falling for this Jigsaw has everything 110% planned, he just wasn't scary to me, he was just a dude with a ku klux clan robe on who coughed a lot.<br/><br/>When the cops found jigsaw and he sets off the drill mechanism and they let him do his speeches and get away, why didn't they just shoot the drills right away instead of goofing around and playing silly Q&A games with an unscary Jigsaw and listening to his vitriol. any cop would've shot jigsaw to bring him down as soon as he set it off the drills the shot the flimsy little power drills.<br/><br/>also in the hospital at the very start when Michael Emerson said to the doc that the sick guy/jigsaw had a name was he poisoned then? why come off like his brainwashed cohort right back then which is what he was painted to be all movie when he wasn't poisoned at that time. He listens to sick peoples drug induced jabberings and takes it way too seriously.<br/><br/>And Jigsaw being in the room at the end was a good twist but when i thought about it felt a little cheap. And the whole Michael Emerson twist was good till thought about, its not worth another watch to see how he reacts in earlier scenes because there is no reaction, he mainly acts like a brainwashed foot-soldier throughout. its not an inception, shutter island or fight club watch it a 2nd time feeling.<br/><br/>And there were a lot of other minor irritants like the girl with the bear trap mouth making male sounding demonic noises when she was escaping it, presumably to add to the scariness of it and the rest i cant be bothered to list.<br/><br/>my opinion is the reason it was successful was based on premise, and the 2 twists.<br/><br/>anyway thats my thoughts on Saw, great premise but a cheap trick horror that disappointed me again."
"davydteather","Null","1","3","8 September 2011"," I want to play a game.
","Saw is the best serial killer movie I have ever seen. This movie is on par with se7en as being one of the most disturbing movies ever made. The look of it is just outstanding.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie different from other serial killer movies is that the killer puts his victims in situations where they have to fight for their lives and try to survive their traps or ""games"" as the killer calls them or die trying. The killer wants the people to succeed and appreciate their lives.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell were just excellent together. And hands off to Danny Glover. He brings life to every scene he is in. He is just amazing.<br/><br/>Every shot in this movie was made with a lot of planning. Unlike battlefield earth which was a complete mess. This movie is an amazing piece of filmmaking."
"scott10101","10","1","3","19 August 2011"," How could it be better!?
","Saw: I must say that was the film of 2004! It was perfect as a film, and very well made even though it had a very small budget, all the grungy walls and rooms really make the film seem more real! And let's face it, the film is Very Realistic! It could happen, which makes it all the more Chilling!<br/><br/>When I first watched this I honestly could not go anywhere I literally feared Pausing it! The actors as well! They done their job so so well, they really added to the drama of the film.<br/><br/>But what got me the most, was of course the ending, maybe one of the best endings to a film I have ever watched, Just when you think it's all over, that happens that must of made history! I was blown away by this film and how real it was, the acting was good, Jigsaw was brilliant for even the small amount of screen time he had, the traps were creative and brutal and the director was legendary! 11/10 for saw! :)"
"Sandcooler","9","1","3","4 August 2011"," Stuff nightmares are made of
","I've never really taken the time to fully get into the whole ""Saw""-franchise, mainly because the word ""franchise"" is always sort of off-putting to me. I mean seriously, seven movies in six years? Perhaps the makers can just work really, really fast, but randomly shelling out entries at that kind of ridiculous pace just screams ""cash cow"" to me. I might start checking them out anyway though, because the original ""Saw"" is nothing short of magnificent. It's gripping and terrifying from the first minute to the last, and it keeps putting you on the wrong track just because it can. There's some stuff in this movie that doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's forgivable because all of it's done in the name of mind-shattering suspense. The acting is also great, particularly by Cary Elwes. ""Saw"" is not a movie that leaves you with a good feeling, but who really wants it to? Excellent dark thriller."
"ian-76-72211","9","1","3","4 July 2011"," A masterpiece
","This is one of the best horror movies from this decade, Whats different about this movie that distinguish it from the others in the series, Is the violence. In the sequel is all that torture and gore, Saw I doesn't have that, OkÃ© Zep holds Diana and Alison Gordon under shot and Lawrence amputates his own foot but that happens of-camera. And this is very tame when compared to the sequels. But the main attraction Is the main characters, Adam Stanheight and Dr. Lawrence Gordon. You sympathize with these characters and feel how they become more paranoid by every minute that ticks on the clock. The character that i didn't like was David Tapp, He just slowed things down. What a also didn't like was the villain of the movie, YES i dislike Jigsaw/John Kramer. At least in the first movie he is just useless, In the sequels he is given way more detail and back story from that point i liked him more, But in the first movie he is just useless.<br/><br/>But overall this is a great movie and i highly recommend it.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10!"
"paulpersic","9","1","3","26 May 2011"," An excellent horror
","This movie was one of the best horrors i have seen. It has a great storyline, a huge load of surprises, and pretty good acting.

They realize that they have been chosen to be in a game from a serial killer called ""jigsaw."" This becomes a great success and moves past pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I did not find any complaints really but you know, I'm reviewing this so I did find one. This movie did not really freak me out it was really just gore. Overall saw is a cleaver horror with a great twist 9/10."
"jackstarr777","10","1","3","23 March 2011"," excellent film.
","Many critics will tell you this film is terrible, but trust me, they are wrong. The millions of fans, however, are quite right. From the moment it begins, it is completely gripping and mysterious and carries on the whole way through with some amazing twists and intense moments which make it probably the best horror film of the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>This is not as gory or as scary as you may imagine. There are moments which may make you jump and some realistic detail of wounds, but there is nothing any worse than what you would probably think. This film is not a gore-fest, it is a well-thought out thriller film, perhaps one of the best since ""Se7en"" or even ""Silence of the Lambs"".<br/><br/>Most of all, the film isn't like any other horror film. This one leaves you wondering, yet satisfied. In fact, I'd hardly call it horror, it's more of a thriller. The storyline is completely unpredictable, and it has probably the greatest twist ending since ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack really brings out the brutality and the creepy atmosphere of the film. Charlie Clouser does an amazing job on the music, especially during the exciting, gripping climax in which I nearly wet myself, literally.<br/><br/>The only real let down was Cary Elwes (Dr Gordon)'s acting. He wasn't so brilliant with his performance in this film, but he does seem right for the role. Leigh Whannel (Adam) does an amazing job, and it's a shame he didn't make it into any other big films after this. (He did have a minor role in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" which I noticed, and he did fantastically in that too.) Danny Glover (Tapp) and Monica Potter (Alison) also do great jobs, and Michael Emerson (Zepp) was so right for the role; he was very creepy in his role, I loved it.<br/><br/>10/10, I would more than definitely give it a go. It's not really a surprise it's grown to be one of the greatest selling horror movies of all time."

","Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. <br/><br/>Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!<br/><br/>When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!"

","OK were do I begin? Well, let me put it this way. I have seen many great horror movies from this decade, like Nightmare on elm street remake, and King Kong 2005, but none of them can seem to top Saw. Let me tell you about the plot. (Note: I am going to leave out a lot of info because I don't want to spoil it) Anyways, 2 Guys are chained to a bathroom somewhere, and they have to figure out why they are there, and who put them there. Luckily, one of them has information about who it might be. Throughout the whole entire movie, they are looking for clues that will help them find out what is going on. Eventually they find out that Zepp (I will explain him in a sec) has the doctors wife and kid held hostage! If you want to hear what happens next, well then you have to see the movie for yourself. This movie starts out disturbing, making you wonder what's going on, and then it hits you with a twist ending! Zepp, is another victim of Jigsaw. There is a lot more too it then that, But as I said before, I don't want to spoil too much of it. Let me tell you about Amanda, she was supposedly the first victim, and one of the most memorable traps in the entire saw trilogy! The reverse bear trap. Let me explain that specific trap, she has it on her head, and it rips her jaw open, pulling it apart. Just like a reverse bear trap! If you have ever seen the movie King Kong, there is a scene were Kong is fighting a Dinosaur, and he rips the Jaws open. It is very similar to that. Anyway, the key to unlock it is in her dead ""Cell mate"" and she has to cut the stomach open to retrieve it. Which she does of course. It is a great, very memorable scene in the saw series. Im gonna have to wrap this up. in the end, this movie is good with the story line, characters, etc. I do recommend the sequels, but non of them are going to top the 1st one."

I'm not going to spoil it, but when I first saw this movie my mouth was on the floor. This movie has two story lines, the major one which takes up almost all the film, Dr. Gordon and Adam in the bathroom, and Detective Tapp trying to save Dr. Gordon's family and 'Jigsaw'. The major storyline is better, and out of the 100 minutes this movie is, the other story line only takes up around 30 minutes of it. The rest of it is the bathroom. This movie is the least amount of gore in the series, so if your kids ever ask for it soon then I would recommend watching it on TV where they cut all the gore and swear words out of the movie.

"moviemaniac008","10","1","3","21 November 2009"," As far as recent horror movies go, Saw can definitely be the best!
","After all those half-assed horror movies like Boogeyman, it was time a movie like Saw came and scared us, not physically, but mentally. The sequels that came afterwards aren't entirely as good as this movie, but then again not much can be compared to this movie, which will probably go down in history as a cult horror film, the next never-ending horror franchise in the style of ''Friday the 13th'' or ''Halloween'', without all the slashing action. Saw doesn't scare us with all the gruesome murders (at least not the first one), but it's the psychological aspect of the plot that kept me into the film. In fact all, movie long I was wondering what the hell was going to happen to the two main characters, Adam and Lawrence.<br/><br/>In fact the story focuses on two characters: Adam and Lawrence Gordon, two men who wake up chained in a bathroom. They are told to kill one another before 6 O'clock PM or their families will die. Meanwhile, Detective Tapp and his accomplice Sing try to get as much info on the Jigsaw killer by talking to Amanda, a survivor from one of his sadistic ''tests''. Visually speaking, the movie isn't all that great, the visual effects aren't super but for it's 1.2 million budget, it's got some pretty decent effects. The acting is okay, some are very good and some are very bad, the acting is never equivalent. So why am I giving it a 10??? Simply because the script is so well-crafted. The story is so awesome, it's twisted. You think something will happen when it's actually something else. You can never guess, and thus, even after you've seen it many many times. Also, the story affects your psychology directly. The two men socialize in a way that you want to know what will happen in the end. If you want a beautifully crafted, twisted thriller who isn't for the squeamish, then Saw is the closest to perfection you will ever get."
"blaisetelfer","8","1","3","9 November 2009"," Different from the sequels, and in a good way
","Definitely one of my favorite horror films, the first one. Sure, it spurred a lot of entertaining sequels, but none of those measured up to this. Not only was it so dark and original; more believable than the sequels. Instead of setting up elaborate traps for groups of 8 people (would've taken years to construct), Jigsaw watches Adam and Gordon the whole time, in their presence. He controls everything as he sees it happening. Scay factor #1) ""He was in the room this whole time!"" - incredible ending, by the way - Scary factor #2) the filth and decay of the killer's first traps. Also, this ""SAW"" focuses more on Jigsaw's morbid / twisted view of rehabilitation, whereas the other films focus more on typical revenge / punishment."

","It's sad to know what ""Saw"" has become. The series is now synonymous with the words ""Torture Porn,"" and each entry only serves to show more killings for the fun of it. The sequels simply can't grasp what made the first Saw a genuinely good film - True horror. The gore here isn't ""For the hell of it,"" this film is genuinely meant to unnerve and scare: And it does just that. The movie is downright bone chilling in my opinion. The ending, which was a genuinely cool twist as well, still gives me the freaks and whenever I hear the now infamous ""Hello Zepp"" music, I can't help but remember my reaction when I first saw this film.<br/><br/>The story is about The Jigsaw Killer, a mysterious killer who kidnaps people and places them in twisted ""traps."" He never actually kills them himself, but plays ""games"" with them, and gives them one chance to solve the riddle and escape. There has only been one survivor, and Jigsaw has set up one of his most maniacal traps ever - which is where the film begins. The film asks one question: ""How much blood would you shed to stay alive?"" It's a great concept for a horror movie because in reality, what WOULD you do to stay alive? Would you kill? Would you let others die just to save yourself? Our most basic instinct is to survive, and the crushing tension in Saw makes use of our survival instinct against us.<br/><br/>Saw is unique, not only to its sequels and similar styled horror films, but to the horror genre in general. Although it may have caused controversy and garnered not-so-great reviews from Critics due to its relatively shocking content, in truth it is something important to the horror genre. It came up with a fresh idea (Although some elements can be traced back to ""The abominable Dr. Phibes"") and managed to turn heads - whether they approved of the film or not. While its sequels may tarnish its name, it can truly stand alone as a unique and creepy film. Even though there is gore, it can be said that like many ""slasher"" horror franchises, the gore isn't as intense but its still portrayed in a realistic light which makes it more disturbing and unnerving. To some, ""Saw"" may feel like a modern snuff film, but if you can stomach its contents and want a good and unique horror flick, Saw is for you. The crushing tension and suspense will put you on edge and the films scares are well made too."

","The one that started it all! I'll never forget how impressed I was with the novel concept of this horror film when I first discovered it via a risky DVD rental: a man dying of cancer decides to play elaborate games of potential death on people who foolishly do not appreciate the value of life and take their health for granted. In this opener of what was destined to become a hugely popular franchise, two young men awake inside an unknown dilapidated building, each one helplessly chained, and find themselves the targets in a crazy game of survival by the unique serial killer nicknamed ""Jigsaw"". Danny Glover (LETHAL WEAPON) co-stars as the detective following the case. Despite the gruesome nature, and thumbing my nose at those viewers too sensitive to watch such a film and realize it's only a movie, this is one of the freshest horror movies to come along in the 21st century, exceptionally written and executed by the young team of Leigh Whannell (who plays one of the doomed prisoners) and James Wan (who directed). ***1/2 out of ****"

This movies is all psyhocology based in the way that they have a choice and have a certain amount of time to make the choice and it's really how far can they go to want to be able to live however they are scarred for life even if they do make it anyways. The ending completely threw me, had no clue about about it, it really made the whole movie. Also, there is barely any gore, i thought it was going to be completely gory but it's not since it's just telling the story of who Jigsaw is and how each of the players came to be locked in the room.

Well anyway I found myself watching the movie on a holiday I have just returned from and let me say I was pleasantly surprised (and pleasant it a word I would imagine you will not find associated with this movie very often). Where this movie works is in its simple premise. Cheaply made with a small set but this actually aides the suspense built up as the main characters slowly interact with one another revealing more about themselves. This is interspersed with reveals to Jigsaw the orchestrator of the two protagonist's fates. The movie moves along at a good pace introducing us to Jigsaws previous crimes as well as the police officers on his trail with a increasing sense pf dread and the payoff is worth it (as much as these things can be) with a very satisfactory ending.

I think about Jigsaw, the movie's villain as a crazy preacher that is angry with anyone that isn't taking the best about happiness.

"jzappa","9","1","3","6 November 2008"," Mortifyingly Claustrophobic Splatter Film
","When I first saw this ideal sleeper hit, I was absolutely terrified. It wasn't that it was violent or Gothic. Rather, it was that it is claustrophobic even when the story reaches beyond its main setting, an unsavory dungeon warehouse bathroom. Saw never comes up for a breath of pleasant fresh air, even by the mortifying end, an end that will make even the most adventurous or free-flowing of viewers become at least scared of the dark. This was the most scared I had ever been by a movie from the horror genre. I loved it for its nonstop bearhug of creepiness.<br/><br/>The film opens as Adam wakes up in a bathtub full of water, getting out of the bathtub and screaming for help, then Dr. Lawrence Gordon tells him that screaming for help is no good because he tried it already, meaning he was awake some time before Adam. How could Adam have been submerged water for so long without drowning? No matter. Bearhug of creepiness. Now, in the neglected industrial bathroom, Adam and Gordon are chained by their ankles to pipes at opposite corners. In the room between them is a dead body with a revolver and a micro cassette recorder loosely in grip. Lawrence and Adam each find tapes in their pockets labeled ""Play Me."" According to the disguised voice on the tape, Adam has to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence must kill Adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be deserted to die captive in this room. This is the irresistible set up for Saw, one so intelligently designed to inject us with great tension in the first single minute that I dread the idea of ever seeing it in the quintessential modern-day American horror film theatrical experience, surrounded by a nearly sold-out rowdy, shouting, giggling, starting and restless audience. It demands our intention.<br/><br/>Its concept, which is unraveled which the crisp enough pace to ensure that we are enduring the suspense, is one which does not just play on our irrational human fears that usually result in horror films like Jaws, Night of the Living Dead or Rosemary's Baby. It connects with true misery, helplessness and paranoia to its terrors. For better or for worse, this is a real breakthrough in the realm of debuts among young fanboy filmmakers. And you can tell that James Wan has some growing up to do: His movie inserts, flashes back, speeds up and machine gun-edits too much. Wan could have intensified the horrific atmosphere by letting an image speak for itself without screaming at us that it's an intense moment.<br/><br/>But the talent, ambition and spirit behind his work, not to mention the wit and flair of Australian screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who stars as the panicked Adam, is highly infectious. With the surfacing of the ""torture porn"" genre in the past decade, the Saw film series, together with similarly relentless shockers like Eli Roth's Hostel and Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects, is often discerned as an instance of the frequency of manipulatively attractive and stylized graphic violence and gore in contemporary horror films. Nonetheless, Saw is perhaps the very least exploitative of them all, especially Hostel and The Devil's Rejects.<br/><br/>Splatter pictures, owing to the wear and tear of special effects and extreme amounts of blood and guts, have a propensity for exhibiting an explicit attraction to the weakness of the body and the sensationalism of its maiming. Saw is, yes, an inordinately violent movie. The word might actually be sadistic. However, Saw's gore and brutality come inherently from its concept, which is designed to horrify us.<br/><br/>Saw may be a great horror film, but it is not quite a great film. By and large, its cast gives B- movie performances. There are suspense sequences in which a character makes a glaringly unrealistic choice. Wan needs to mature into a more confident filmmaker with a better understanding of the language of editing. In spite of these things, it's the kind of horror movie of which we need to see more: A horror movie that is as smart as you."

","After watching this film, for the first time, over 2 years ago, I was astonished by how great it was. I, personally, am not the biggest horror fan but this movie is so much more than your typical monster movie or slasher flick. It contain great writing, a mesmerizing plot and above all, a horrific storyline that is completely unpredictable. Once the movie had ended, I was in complete shock at how brilliant it was (trust me, the ending is great!). It literally had me guessing and chewing my nails for the entire 90 minutes. ""Saw"" is the best crime/horror film of the new millennium or perhaps since the movie Se7en.

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","1","3","24 October 2008"," A surprisingly effective, visceral experience
","With only around two scenes of extreme gore, ""Saw"" deserves a bit more recognition than dismissal as 'torture porn'. Although it's not hard to see why this was originally going to be released to DVD before test screenings, right down to James Wan's directorial style (which would be pushed to its limits with Darren Lyn Bousman's ""Saw IV"", which somehow manages to look cheaper than all the rest of the movies in the series in spite of having a much bigger budget), which is to put it mildly not to my taste. Still, I credit Wan for creating a really claustrophobic atmosphere here, and the one or two action scenes are quite well-done. The cast is fairly good thanks to the several better-known actors here, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, and Michael Emerson (the latter two ended up on ""Lost"" eventually), but the two leads trapped in the room are quite poor unfortunately. Jigsaw is a wicked villain, the film ultimately creates a visceral experience without resorting to unnecessary gore, and the end product is an entertaining and effective thriller.<br/><br/>7/10"

When watching Saw, please choose a comfortable sitting position because once you start watching Saw you will not move. The suspense and thrills are mainly sourced from the wonderfully written and very original plot and the mystery surrounding the main characters. However, some people blame movies in the Saw series for being too violent. But please let me mention that i love Saw. Im a big Saw fan. But i can understand that the Saw movies can be a bit too violent. For whatever reason, Saw 2 , 3 and 4 were a bit in your face violent. Saw 1, however, was made with not a lot of money, and for that reason the violence is simplistic, which is not a bad thing, because it just adds to the suspense.

"KillerLord","10","1","3","21 September 2008"," A Truly Remarkable Movie!
","Movies based on serial killers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But common to most of these movies is one central theme. The central character loves killing. He is a sadist and he is on the prowl. He defines his life by the amount of suffering he can impose on his victims. Many movies have been made on such ideas. What has perhaps differed from one movie to another is the method of killing. But in the end, the movies had a typical end - some way somebody manages to put a stop to all this. Some movie makers tried showing more blood and gore to attract the audience and some tried to show death in compromising situations which would attract the attention of the perverted. And after a significant amount of these movies came out a wonderful movie in form of Saw. <br/><br/>The Saw movie is not like other movies at all. It is no doubt about a serial killer but this time the difference to the movie is not just the method of killing but also the motivation for doing so. The movie does not dwell too much on the past and development of the killer. That would be so typical, right? On one end, you show the current activity and parallel to this, show his past. No! This movie is not like that as well. It just shows his activities of the past but not his past. And then we come to know that this guy is completely different. He is not killing for pleasure and sadism like others, he is doing it as some kind of a perhaps misguided noble work. All his victims in the past have been drug addicts or people whom he thinks have no value for their own life.<br/><br/>The movie takes you straight to the action. It has one of strangest beginnings I have ever seen and an end that is simply beyond imagination. And this makes the movie unique and special. The blood and gore wherever present is just right enough to produce the ideal effect on the minds of the viewer. The plot is good and the screenplay is very tight. The music is intense. The movie does not give you breathing time. It progresses rapidly and involves you completely. <br/><br/>And should I say more about this movie, I would completely spoil the fun for you. Please avoid reading or knowing the story in advance else you will destroy all the fun for yourself. Cheers."
"Jacques98","10","1","3","9 September 2008"," The best thriller ever made.
","I'm a huge fan of the horror and action genres, and I've seen most all of what both have to offer. Though sometimes I'd find a movie that was great, I've never once seen anything like Saw. It created its own sub-genre and it turned every cliché I've ever known on its end. Saw is one of the only perfect movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The reason Saw is original is because it takes everything you've known about standard storytelling rules and completely ignores every one. The villain is the only ""good guy"" you're going to see and the ""good guys"" are the only ""bad guys"" you're going to see. From that basic stance alone, I cannot name another movie like Saw. I know works of literature like A Clockwork Orange try to make bad seem good, but it's done is such a traditional way it is ridiculously predictable and nothing really that hasn't been done before. But Saw is so simple in how it twists the rules of storytelling that it is blatantly obvious and punk. The literary geeks hate this movie because it does something they said could never be done: it breaks the rules they said every story had to abide by. The critics hate this movie because it isn't a safe cliché that they have known all their lives like No Country for Old Men. The standard horror enthusiast hates this movie because it breaks every rule of a traditional horror plot ever conceived. And unlike the supposed ""deep moral"" movies like Battle Royale, Saw actually has moral point that you can use and a moral that isn't a redundant cliché.<br/><br/>As far as gore goes, it's enough to hold me over but isn't really excessive or as insane as the other movie in the series. But I think what make this an effective movie is there is no cheese like in the old slashers. This is something that could happen, and it's portrayed that way. Also, unlike every other movie like it, Saw is not only twisted but gory as well. It's almost an unspoken rule in cinema that if your movie is twisted/disturbing then you cannot show gore. I'm referring to movies like Sev7n and The Silence of the Lambstwisted, but no gore on screen. Once again, Saw breaks another rule.<br/><br/>But what really sells Saw is the stylish punk style. With the flash-cuts, the lighting-paced editing, the blood on screen at almost all points in the moviethis was made for the ADD generation. I'll never understand why traditionalistseven those who don't want to admit they're traditionaliststhink there has to be at least 20 minutes of pure boredom every other scene for a movie to be good. Saw is a true thrillerit doesn't give you a second to sit there and be bored into a comfort zone.<br/><br/>The ending plot twist is the single best plot twist of all time. I've seen a lot of plot twists, and while most of them go down the bland physiological path, or the cliché you-thought-I-was-a-good-guy-but-I'm-the-killer! stance, Saw once again uses its own plot to do a plot twist like none I've ever seen. The entire movie is deceptive, and you literally know nothing until the last 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I simply cannot think of a single thing wrong with Saw. I tried, but I can't. It's the most perfect thriller ever made, and one of the most original movies of the modern generation.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Every once in a while, you may encounter a film that has the power to captivate and mesmerize you from its first seconds, all the way through the finale. 2004's ""Saw"", the original film that has sparked one of the most well-known franchises in modern history, is one such film.<br/><br/>Looking at it now, it is hard not to compare it with its (so far) three sequels, and the slew of other hyper-violent copycat films that have emerged since its initial release.<br/><br/>The film was written by James Wan (whom also directed) and Leigh Whannell, two young filmmakers from Autstrailia, whom obviously have talent beyond their age. And while the other films they have worked on (""Dead Silence"" and ""Death Sentence"" so far) have not quite attained the success they deserve, you can tell they have bright futures, and I predict they will soon become the go-to guys for classical and modern suspense.<br/><br/>But, back to the film.<br/><br/>""Saw"" is a movie that grabbed me from frame one. Mind you, I was very unimpressed by the add-campaign Lionsgate had put together, which made the film seem like nothing more than an out of control gore-fest, but once I finally sat down to view the film, I realized it was just the opposite.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, two young men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (played a bit over-the-top by the excellent Cary Elwas) and Adam (co-writer Leigh Whannell) awaken, to find themselves chained to opposite walls in a secluded and unsanitary (to say the least) industrial bathroom.<br/><br/>In between them is a dead body, killed by a suicidal gunshot, with a tape-recorder in one hand and the murder weapon in the other. They fish the tape recorder away, and play two tapes they find hidden on their persons.<br/><br/>The situation is not merely a simple scenario... it is an elaborate and terrifying ""game"" set up by a figure known only as ""Jigsaw."" Jigsaw is a wanted man, being pursued by a troubled cop (played by the always fun-to-watch Danny Glover), whom is infamous for putting his ""test subjects"" (aka, victims) into horrifying situations, where they must make unimaginable choices to survive, or die trying to escape. He is not a true killer, but rather, a misguided figment that thinks he is helping those who have become wayward in their lives.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Lawrence must kill Adam within the next few hours, or his wife and daughter will die.<br/><br/>That is the set up for the film. And I can promise you, it is a chilling exercise in brutality and moral choices...<br/><br/>What makes the film so visceral and terrifying is the human aspect that is given to the characters. As opposed to the ""disposable"" fodder most horror/suspense films provide, you actually get to know Adam and Lawrence as real human beings.<br/><br/>Whannell and Wan also expertly set the stakes very high, making the film more tense and tight as it goes on, almost like a wire ready to snap at any instant. One of the most well-known, and disturbing scenes revolves around the one person who escaped one of Jigsaw's games, the drug-addicted Amanda (played chillingly by Shawnee Smith of ""The Blob"" fame), in which she recalls her ""game"", in a scene that is almost indescribably eerie.<br/><br/>This film should be considered a lesson to Hollywood. It has a relatively simple plot, and yet manages to deliver more thrills and chills than any big-budget ""horror"" film I have seen in the past 10 years.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is really a miracle for the suspense/horror genre.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Bravo! This is what it's all about. It's not for the faint of heart or should I say stomach in some scenes but it's a really good Horror flick. Jigsaw (John) personifies evil and true mental sickness. He's bitter at the world for the cancer eating at him. He gets back at the people who he feels have done wrong by putting them in situations that either result in a painful (usually drawn-out) death or a very difficult escape. It really keeps you going the whole time.<br/><br/>I think that people who require constant stimulation in movies will probably not like this one because it's kind of a time-release film. The character development is right on too. You really get attached to Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell's Characters. <br/><br/>Despite what some may say, I think the final plot twist at the end was a particularly good one. I also think that people who are gonna say ""I saw that coming"" or ""It was predictable"" are full of it! This was new territory for a Horror film. There's been some similar stuff but you've gotta admit that it really does go into some uncharted territory.<br/><br/>Awesome Film, A must rent for us hard-core Horror fans.

It makes you ask yourself what you would do if put in those extreme circumstances, and it forces you to deal with the darker side of humanity.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed on a fairly low budget with a cast consisting mainly of unknown actors.

The light goes down the drain, and he wakes up. He finds out that he is in a bathroom, but it's too dark with the lights off. As soon as he gets out of the bathtub, he finds out that his leg is chained to a pipe. He yells and screams and a low voice responds. When the lights turn on, there is another man, his leg is also chained to a pipe. His name is Gordon, and he is a doctor. There is a dead body in a pool of blood in the middle of the floor, with a tape recorder and gun in his hands. They grab the tape recorder, and they each find out about the fact that they each have a tape.<br/><br/>They play the tapes, and based on one of them, Gordon's test is to kill Adam to save his family. His family has been trapped. There is a limit as to when he has to kill Adam, which is 6:00. Along the way, we learn about someone named Amanda, who's a junkie. We learn that she was tested too. The test? She wakes up with a strange device around her head. A video comes on, with a creepy puppet. The puppet is based on a serial killer named Jigsaw, and he created the puppet. The puppet tells Amanda that she must find the key in the body of her ""Dead"" cell mate. If she dosen't, her jaw is permanently ripped open. She cuts open the stomach of the cell mate, and sifts through the organs and locates the key in his heart. She successfully takes the trap off and the puppet comes out, congratulating her.<br/><br/>""Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore."" Meanwhile, we discover about other people, including detectives who enter Jiggy's lair, and many other traps.<br/><br/>Saw is a truly great masterpiece. Great blood s/fx, and great plot line with a twist that you don't see coming.<br/><br/>So If you like horror films, this is a must see."
"jamesmcfadyen","10","1","3","14 April 2007"," Top-drawer Horror
","I have been reading the comments and it seems to be a love it or hate it kind of film.<br/><br/>It's not trying to convey any life-changing message, it's just doing what a horror is supposed to do. The twists are great, although some seem to dislike twists in horrors. A horror without twists is predicable, so if you can't predict it, you don't know what's coming next and thus heightening ones visual and emotional experience. The main element of horror, you agree? <br/><br/>Anyhow, great film, I've seen Saw 2 and waiting to see Saw 3. Can't wait!"
"peter-wilson","10","1","3","5 April 2007"," This film has no peers
","Saw is an exceptional suspenseful horror flick without the traditional heart jumping editing and audio tricks. The film has a refreshingly original script, with many twists and turns, with performances to match.<br/><br/>If you're an admirer of horror then this rates 11 out of 10. For others this film may rate 9 out of 10 for suspense with a high level of violence.<br/><br/>After viewing this film I'm sure you'll be looking forward to the sequels with further twists on the original theme whilst offering additional insights to the original film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended ... although it's strongly recommended viewing this film before viewing the sequels."

This is my favorite movie really, i think that during times like these where every new ""horror"" movie is a zombie flick or a slasher film, Saw really sticks out. Although i do not like the second one as much as this one.This is a must-see on the horror list for every gore-whore, it really is. This movie glues you to the seat just in the first couple of scenes, waiting for what comes next.i loved every flashback that they included, except that whole fast forward thing at the beginning of every one got pretty annoying, but other than that it was great and the idea of Jigsaws puppet was genius."

Both men are tied up in chains and are given two saws but are meant for them to cut their feet off not the chains. The doctor soon realizes that it's the jigsaw killer that put both of them in the room to solve a puzzle. Then there is a flashback to other victims like one who has to crawl through a lot of barb wire to get out of a room, another with a man who has to figure out the combination to safe and the combination is on the wall but he has a candle but the stuff on the wall is flammable and he is walking on glass. A women also have a trap that will crush her head if she doesn't get the key out of a mans body. The doctor is accused of doing the crime by two cops.

"dwmurphy85","9","1","3","21 December 2006"," Great, brilliant, excellent
","This is definitely one of the most original movies I've ever seen in my whole life!! There is absolutely no film I could make reference to because this movie is unique in all it's means. One could think it's not a big deal, but there is to consider that it begins without you knowing anything and throughout the film, with a very original technique, you're brought to know step by step what really is going on and with who the characters are dealing with 'till finally it finishes with a very surprise ending. Do not expect though to see a horror, this is a thriller, it scares you at times but it's more a splat movie and it it's much more concentrated on the plot than on the groce scenes. Regarding the acting I think the actors were great and absolutely up to the role they've been assigned, considering also that Leigh Whannell was at his first worldwide picture. Also a very good directing by James Wan which was also at his first real big movie. For a medium budget movie I must say that the audio, picture and video are excellent and the movie is very realistic; and they certainly didn't save on writing the story which took Wan and Whannel 9 months!! Of course a situation and series of events like those occurred in this movie is very unlikely to happen in real life... but what the heck, if you don't see things like these in movies, where else would you???"

","Saw. What an amazing film. Not only is it grisly, but it's also very psychological and very disturbing. You should think twice before you do something bad to yourself...Jigsaw might be waiting.<br/><br/>Saw stars Leigh Whannell (writer for Saw II and Saw III), Cary Elwes (Twister, Liar Liar, Ella Enchanted), Danny Glover (Angels in the Outfield, Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2, Lethal Weapon 3, Predator 2), Ken Leung (X-Men: The Last Stand, Vanilla Sky, Red Dragon), Shawnee Smith (Saw II, Saw III, Carnival of Souls), and Tobin Bell (Saw II, Saw III, Black Mask 2: City of Masks).<br/><br/>Oh, my God! This movie is so scary! It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be before I watched it, but it was still so frightening! I almost peed in my pants when this film was finished! Like 'Se7en', there is a bloodcurdling twist at the end which forces you to let your mouth hang open for the rest of the week. You can't move. You can't think. You can't even breathe. But, since my friend ruined it for me and told me the ending, I wasn't as shocked as I would have been....<br/><br/>Cary Elwes was good and bad at the acting. Like when he cried to get his wife and child back from Jigsaw, he was so horrible at acting! That was a huge disappointment, because Cary is an excellent actor. But, otherwise, he was very good, along with everyone else.<br/><br/>I can't tell you the plot without giving too much away, but I can tell you that it is very well thought out and very tense. Like, you know something is about to happen...but you just don't know when.<br/><br/>This movie is very grisly and graphic and is exceptionally disturbing. Saw is definitely not for children under 15. Fifteen years of age and up can absolutely see this movie without an adult. But fourteen and under absolutely need to be accompanied by an adult if they want to see this movie.<br/><br/>*****MINOR SPOILERS***** <br/><br/>Saw also has very nasty sound effects and frightening images. For example, we see a brief glimpse of bloody intestines. We see a man trigger a tripwire, which activates four guns hanging on the ceiling to shoot a man in head, making several splatters on the wall and a bloody torso. We don't however see the man's head when he gets shot. We only see his head after he gets shot in photographs.<br/><br/>*****MINOR SPOILERS END*****<br/><br/>Overall, this film is the best horror movie ever made (so far). Followed by Saw II and Saw III, and Saw IV hopefully coming out in 2007. See Saw! You WILL NOT be disappointed!<br/><br/>Violence/Gore: 10/10, Sex/Nudity: 3/10, Profanity: 8/10 (constant F-words), Drugs/Alcohol: 1/10 <br/><br/>Original MPAA rating: R: Strong Grisly Violence and Language <br/><br/>My MPAA rating: R: Strong Grisly and Disturbing Violence, and Language.<br/><br/>My Canadian rating: 18A: Extreme Violence, Frightening Scenes, Coarse Language"

","I just finished watching Saw, and I must say I was very impressed by how original, creepy, and mysterious it was, because now a days, you don't usually find such movies. Some movies are just gore,lots of swearing, hint hint ( Friday the 13th, A nightmare of elm street, Halloween, Pinhead) but not this one. This was a twisted, psycho movie that you never know when another twist will come by.<br/><br/>I am a huge horror fan, and I heard some sick and Mordid and Macobe things about this twisted movie. So I finally watch it and I must say ""Holy hell, this is what I call original,"" Excuse my profanity.<br/><br/>Attention Parents: If you are a wise parent then I personally recommended no child under at least 15 unless you know they have strong and bearable stomachs.<br/><br/>The characters were really great and described through great detail. This is really going to be a movie I watch again. If you haven't seen Saw, Saw II, or Saw III then you should really consider it if you think you have the stomach for it. Overall: 8/10"

","OMG! This was a genius of a horror movie: bloody, shocking, and jaw-dropping...everything a horror movie is suppose to be about! Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel, who is also the co-writer of the film) are two men who have never met before and both wake up chained on opposite ends of an abandoned bathroom with a corpse in the middle of the floor holding a gun and a tape recorder. Each find an envelope with a tape, but Dr. Gordon's envelope also comes with a bullet. They play their tapes and find themselves at the hands of a serial killer called the ""Jigsaw killer"" who sets them up to play a game in which Lawrence is to kill Adam by six o'clock or his family will die. As the two men struggle to understand the situation they are in the serial killer is somewhere watching. What is so frightening about this film is that the serial killer doesn't technically kill his victims, but instead finds ways for his victims to kill themselves or each other. The situations are grisly and gruesome and emotionally raw. The Jigsaw killer targets victims who are not grateful for living or self-destructive in some way. Be prepared to watch this film and be even more prepared for the ending that is only seen in the most terrifying of all horror films."

","When SAW hit the screens in 2004, it leaped to instant success. Albeit made on a low budget, the movie fails to disappoint, with clever twists and plots that will keep you guessing and speculating right until the very end. Although the acting talent of Cary Elwes (who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon) has come under heavy criticism on the IMDb boards, actor/co-producer/writer Leigh Whannell gives a strong performance as the young photographer Adam, unfortunately caught up in one of Jigsaw's games. Without giving away too much, the movie opens out to reveal more than meets the eye with several characters. Overall, a highly enjoyable experience. 9/10"

","This film was amazing. the idea were fresh and the ending was a massive shock to me i disagree with everyone who said the actors were bad in this film yeah they could have been better but they had time no rehearsals together and they could not afford big actors. I loved the fact there was no big stars in this film. i also own the saw uncut DVD and listen to the commentary by director James wan and actors Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes. this was hilarious and i now have great respect for James and Leigh because they have not become big-headed at all they still seem really laid back and they are both good looking!!! Also Tobin Bell as jigsaw not many actors would agree to do a film where all they do is lie on the floor until the final scene of the film where they get up and walk out. He was very good in saw 2 and to me he is the only person who could play jigsaw.<br/><br/>anyone agree?"
"Vic_max","Null","1","3","11 August 2006"," Good Horror Movie
","'Saw' was better than I expected. From the name and the genre, I was expecting something akin to 'House of 1000 corpses' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. I found 'Saw' to be a step above these movies. It had an interesting intellectual component that left one guessing about a central mystery. (This mystery involved how the characters got into, and will get out of, their predicament.) I found the performances, dialog and character decisions to be believable - which is unusual for this genre. I was also surprised to see that there were some fairly well-known actors in the movie such as Danny Glover and Dina Meyer. I was impressed with the quality of movie that was created given a limited budget. Although a definite step above most horror movies, I wouldn't recommend the movie to the average viewer unless one likes the Horror genre. In that case - definitely catch this one."
"karen_a_k","7","1","3","31 July 2006"," sick and weird, yes, but also fascinating
","I have watched this movie with a mixture of fascination and disgust. The plot is quite intelligent and although I guessed who it was from the beginning, it still surprised me in the end. Nasty twist there.<br/><br/>But what bothers me - apart from all the gore and the unnecessarily bloody details - is this: How sick must a mind be to think up a plot like this ? Go see a shrink Mr. Wan, please.<br/><br/>Of the 10 possible points I immediately deduct 8 for unnecessarily violent and gory pictures. And another one for the ghastly music. The intelligence of the plot and the astonishing fact that I didn't turn it off after the first few minutes and actually watched it to the end merit 5 stars. And I have to add another one for the even more astonishing fact that I do not totally discount the possibility of ever watching it again.<br/><br/>So, all in all, this is the most points I have ever given a horror movie (excepting The Fog of course). And I still wonder why."
"oldbondsie","9","1","3","28 July 2006"," Great moral in a great movie
","This was really my first modern horror movie that i ""saw."" To be honest it was a great choice for a movie but a bad choice for a horror noob.<br/><br/>The opening scene does not grab your attention as quickly as some horror movies because the scene immediately develops the story and the characters rather than showing a gruesome death to grab your attention. But don't worry there are plenty of gruesome deaths later on. After meeting Doctor Gordon and Adam we witness their futile attempts to understand the game and to break free.<br/><br/>After doctor Gordon and Adam hear the voice of the Jigsaw Killer they realize what the game is. Doctor Gordon has to kill Adam by 6 a.m. or his family will be murdered and he will never be freed from where he is now chained and neither will Adam. After finding two hacksaws the pair of them seem rejoiced as they hack away at their chains. Unfortunately the hacksaws are too dull to cut through the chains, Dr. Gordon realizes that to escape in this manner they would have to cut their feet off (the part of their body which is chained).<br/><br/>Doctor Gordon then begins to explain how he knows about the Jigsaw Killer. We witness flashbacks of Dr. Gordon being questioned as a suspect for being the Jigsaw Killer and we witness flashbacks of past victims playing passed games of the Jigsaw Killer. These are some of the more gruesome scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>During this stretch we are also introduced to the primary detectives working on the case. Danny Glover and a main i believe was named Seung. After discovering Jigsaw's lair and saving one of his many victims they attempt to arrest him. However Jigsaw makes a run for it and Seung is killed by a trap while pursuing him. Afterwards Danny Glover goes mad attempting to find the Jigsaw Killer.<br/><br/>We are taken back to the present time and place with Adam and Dr. Gordon eventually and we witness both of their capture scenes, Adam's capture was a very frightening scene, it was smart that they used it in the trailer. Eventually Adam and Dr. Gordon work together to the discovery that Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter are being held by a man named Zap or Mr. Hindel who works at the same hospital as Dr. Gordon (Lawrence). After many more futile attempts to escape 6 o'clock comes and goes. MEanwhile, Danny Glover has discovered who he believes to be the Jigsaw Killer: Zap. After breaking into the Gordon's apartment he chases Zap back to where the two men are trapped however he is shot and killed by Zap after a fight.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon has gone half mad trying to break his chain to help his family. As his blood lust takes over he saws his own foot off, (wondering where the title came from and the cover?). He crawls to the gun in the room loads it and shoots Adam to end the game. Unfortunately for him time was already up.<br/><br/>Zap appears in the room and aims his gun at Dr. Gordon. However, Adam who was not shot fatally takes him down from behind and beats him to death. The killer is finally down. really? Dr. Gordon crawls out of the room to get help and send help back for Adam who is still chained in the room. Adam struggles to find the key to his chain on Zap's dead body and eventually finds a mini-tape recorder. It is then that the greatest twist in any movie i've seen happens. Zap was not the infamous killer, simply another pawn in the real killer's game. For 5 seconds we have time to ask ourselves ""then who is the real killer"" and after those 5 seconds the supposed dead body that had been in the room the entire time begins to rise.<br/><br/>This is the true Jigsaw Killer, he tells Adam the location of the key to his chain, unfortunately in his panic Adam had allowed it to slip away and be lost forever. After a futile attempt to kill Jigsaw Adam is shocked into submission. The killer then walks out and slams the door shut as the credits flash across the screen.<br/><br/>Myself? I was a teenage boy hampered by the complications of adolescence, i still am. I was worried about a girl that didn't like me the way i liked her, my lack of success in athletics, my declining grades and all the petty things that shouldn't matter in the grand scheme. After watching this movie i made a vow to appreciate things more and i have kept that vow since i made it.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was obviously not the greatest but how could it have been, with a budget of around 1 million or so i've heard, they couldn't afford to get Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro. As for Carry Elwes' accent, why does it matter so much? Quite honestly i just want to know why it is such a big deal to some people.<br/><br/>The character development i think was relatively good for a horror movie and the settings and scenes were all dark dank and mysterious. Even in one of the few scenes outside it is a cloudy day when it was filmed.<br/><br/>I think the script in this movie was great.<br/><br/>But of all things the moral in this movie was the best part. Too many horror movie villains kill just because the movie wants to have people get killed. At least in this movie there is somewhat of a motive although many including myself would consider it a bullsh*t motive.<br/><br/>Anyways this was a great movie not just a grotesque horror movie. Don't watch it alone or if you have a weak stomach. See my review for Saw 2 as well if you're interested."
"funkywood","8","1","3","19 July 2006"," Manhunt Inspired?
","I want to add that very few people have commented on this film's similarity to the Rock Star game Manhunt. This goes beyond the gruesome theme of victims being trapped in macabre puzzles while a hidden Director offers clues to their survival (or not) while watching them on his screens. It goes right down to the individual characters.<br/><br/>Anyone who has played Manhunt will instantly recognise the pig men and narrator upon watching Saw. Me and my friend were thinking this was just a coincidence until the appearance of the sinister clown puppet on a tricycle. When we saw that we just turned to each other and said ""This is so Manhunt!"". We even sat through the end credits to check for any reference to the game to confirm our suspicions but could find none.<br/><br/>This doesn't take away from the film though as it has its own story line that leads to a very different ending to the game. Now matter how much you played the game the film will still shock you to the end."

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","1","3","13 December 2005"," One of the greatest horror/thrillers of all time
","Most people who haven't seen this masterpiece of a movie, 'Saw', think of it as a horror film. How sorely mistaken they are. It does have scary moments, but the true allure of 'Saw' is the fact that it is a heart pounding psychological thriller that is near unpredictable. The thing that makes the film so good and horrifying is the fact that it is so close to reality. It'll make you wonder if the things that happen in the film actually do occur. Known for notoriously mediocre acting, the amazing lighting and sound, writing, and direction make up for this 100 percent. If you have to see one horror/thriller, make 'Saw' your choice.<br/><br/>The plot goes as follows: Adam (writer Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a room that he has no recollection of ever being in or how he got there, soon discovering that he is not alone, for a doctor (Cary Elwes) soon awakes to a similar fate. All the while, a paranoid detective (Danny Glover) attempts to track a mysterious serial killer who likes to play 'games' with his victims.<br/><br/>The thing that adds to the shock and awe of 'Saw' is the incredible lighting and sounds. The lights are so effective, and you really notice them. They add to the horror and surprise so much. The sound does as well, but this is not one of those 'when the sound gets crazy, something's about to happen' films. The music is just great. Like every good film in the horror category, 'Saw' has its fair share of blood and guts that will satisfy the horror fan in everyone, but it's the thriller aspect of it that makes it so damn good. The suspense is absolutely incredible, and when the ending rolls around, you will gasp in shock. The writer of the film is coincidentally Leigh Whannell, and as it's his story, no one can do it better. His writing is simply phenomenal, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. James Wan, Whannell's friend, is the director of the film, and he is just as good at his job as Leigh is at his. He manages to make the film extremely dark and edgy, yet keep the flow going so you're never bored. The acting is simply mediocre, but it doesn't really matter. The best performance is probably from Danny Glover, which is no surprise.<br/><br/>Full of twists, blood, suspense, and daring entertainment, 'Saw' is a real winner that any fan of thrillers will love and want to see over and over. It remains one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

"lathesius","7","1","3","28 March 2005"," Great idea...but flawed.
","SAW is without a doubt one of the most original horror movies I have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>It starts off simple. Two guys who, at first, seem to have no connection to each other wake up in a squalid industrial bathroom. They are chained to either side of the room, and a dead body lies between them clutching a Dictaphone and a revolver. Using clues that their kidnapper has left for them to find they soon figure out what is happening. They are the victims of a known ""serial killer"" called Jigsaw. One man is a surgeon with a family, and his mission is to kill the other guy in order to save his and his own families life. But chained to a wall how is he going to get to him? With the help of a rusty hacksaw that seems only to be able to cut through flesh and not metal.<br/><br/>From here we are greeted with a series of flashbacks that explain just how Jigsaw works. Here's the original part: Jigsaw isn't actually a serial killer. He has not killed anyone directly. Instead he puts his victims into a situation where they have a chance of living. They are given a task. If they complete it, then they go free. If they don't, then they die. I won't go into too much detail but some of the ways his victims suffer are very gory indeed.<br/><br/>This movie keeps you guessing right up until the end, and even then it knocks you for six with an ending I don't think anyone saw coming.<br/><br/>Now come the flaws. Ten out of ten for the idea and the set up of the idea, but the film is let down by, at times, appalling acting, sketchy dialogue and THE worst car chase I have ever seen committed to screen. Sadly you can tell when watching this movie when the budget started to stretch, and from there on it goes downhill, but the surprise ending makes up for some of it.<br/><br/>If you like mystery films and gory horror then this is a must see, but don't expect too much of the acting. Ten out of ten for the idea, but only seven out of ten for the final product. Entertaining, but not outstanding."

","This is a very tricky, mind boggling, suspenseful movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat and throw you around until it leaves you in shock for the climax. I randomly coughed up 8 bucks to the movie theaters with some friends and had no idea what the movie was about. I was expecting a typical Halloween horror with a crummy plot and basically not worth the money. I couldn't have been more wrong. Entering the movie theater and underestimating the movie was the best thing i could have done. It made the movie a total thrill which i will never forget. <br/><br/>2 men are trapped in a random ""shit-hole"" and are forced to pull their knowledge together to escape with their lives. only, its not that easy to do when you don't know who has kidnapped you or even the man your starring at. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy or even can handle horror/thrillers with a twist. ""...How much blood would you shed to save your life..."""
"klygts47","7","1","3","27 February 2005"," A more Brutal Phonebooth
","Saw is essentially about a man who captures his victims based on their lack of appreciation of life. In Phonebooth the killer bases his victims on their lack of appreciation towards their spouses. Both killers play a ""game"" or test their victims and if they pass they are set free. The difference between the two is the amount of gore presented in each movie (SAW being the ""gorier"" of the two).<br/><br/>The movie goes back and fourth in time slowly revealing what the real story between the two main characters is and obviously, near the end, the identity of the killer. This is done with great style and perfect pacing that doesn't leave the audience shifting in discomfort. The killers way of ""testing' his victims is very creative thus keeping the audience interested as long as you are not queasy. It's disturbingly pleasurable. However, at some points in the movie the acting - especially that of the doctor - is somewhat questionable. It was rare, but I sometimes found myself not quite convinced of the character's emotions. But beyond that, 95 % of the time, you really do fear and feel for the two men. There was also one scene where you hear the doll laugh and that didn't quite have the effect I think the director wanted. This is probably what separates Phonebooth and Saw. Throughout Phonebooth you are in constant fear for Colin Farell's character and the acting is superb. There are just a few glitches in Saw that aren't present in Phonebooth. <br/><br/>In all I recommend Saw for anyone who is a Horror buff or is interested in psychopaths like yours truly. It's a new idea that, for once, isn't destroyed by the director trying too hard."
"jackhammer132","7","1","3","26 February 2005"," pacing is a problem, visuals are not!
","I wont add a review of the films storyline as i would presume most people visiting this page have seen it, however i will concentrate on other aspects of the film. One thing that annoyed me was the pacing of the film, and a common problem of a lot of films-slow middle third. The film opens at breakneck pace, bombarding us with images and the merest of back story. When the film reaches it's middle third, it is mainly told in flashback, which is maybe not even needed for this type of film, this would enhance our fears and our attachment to the characters predicament instead of giving us choices in deciding if we feel sympathy for them. i am not all out for gore and torture, but if the film begins in this quick edited, quick visual style then when it slows down it becomes very apparent(whereas a film like Se7en, keeps pretty much the same tempo throughout) and hinders the films style. As has been said Cary Elwes is very poor in this movie, and his performance really spoils the dark oppressive nature of the film. Visually, although MTV style in parts, is very impressive. The torture scenes are more suggestive than you think, and looking back you realise how little actual gore you have seen, but thanks to some great production design and editing you are jolted into feeling real sympathy for the victims. Despite a few flaws this is still an excellent entry to the the thriller/horror genre and refreshing to see that it doesn't resort to any sly winking at the audience. I could see elements of Fulci and Argento in there, so it can't be all that bad!"

This is one of the best movie I have seen in the past years (it qualifies along with usual suspects, memento or ravenous in in the category of jewels in the rough, kind of movies). We are millions light years away from typical Hollywood formatted blockbusters (although I like them, a lot).<br/><br/>My only slight complaint, is that the second half, is not as strong as the first.

"pcav0","2","1","3","14 February 2005"," Overrated mimic of Seven, You can be far better
","To begin with, I must make a comment that I fear filmmakers are emulating this Gothic thriller style a little too faithfully. This film resembles ""seven"" in so many ways it is almost a farce that this movie has become so critically acclaimed.<br/><br/>The basic premise of this movie is quite good. A serial killer who coerces victims into murdering themselves, all in the name of helping people count their blessings. Two men are part of a game being played by this killer, and one has to kill the other before 6:00pm or his family is murdered.<br/><br/>The highlights of this film are all in the back stories of ""jigsaw"" including a chilling scene with a reverse bear trap on a woman's head and a large man forced to crawl through a room of razor wire. The tragic thing though is that these are the only real shocks this film has to offer, besides the overacting of Carey Elwis which actually becomes sickening by the end of the film. The man who plays Adam is essentially such an annoyance that you cannot help but wish the good doctor would actually slaughter him.<br/><br/>The sad fact is , is that Saw is nothing special. With a plethora of far superior and more stylish films to steal from, Saw has taken what worked and tried to up the ante. Rancid environments, shocking visuals, and unnecessary gore have made this film a clone, albeit a clone with luck, having gained stupid amounts of critical acclaim for very little reason.<br/><br/>My advice. Watch Seven, or resurrection (yep, even a film with Christopher Lambert is Better). It is disappointing that my fellow Australians can't be more original than this."
"klesker","9","1","3","12 February 2005"," The most disturbing film for years
","As an avid horror fan i can safely say that the majority of horror movies released today are average at best. they are either crap yet fun or just plain crap. Even films such as Cabin Fever, although trying to go back to the original 1970's style of horror, fail to hit the mark. Which is why i was stunned by this little beauty. If you thought serial killer flicks could only ever b as good as the next Ashley Judd thriller then you were gravely mistaken.<br/><br/>It tells the story of two men (one a photographer, Adam, and the other a doctor) who wake up to find themselves chained up in an old abandoned warehouse, With no knowledge of how they got there or why. Then a mysterious killer by the name of Jigsaw informs them the the doctor must kill Adam by 6 o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed. Although the premise is very basic, after the opening the majority of film is played out in flashback informing the audience of how the characters got there and looking back at past killings Jigsaw has committed (the barbed wire murder will make you sick to your stomach).<br/><br/>Shot on a budget of only $1,000,000 this film looks as professional as Silence of the Lambs and as grim as Se7en. Although at many points the director seems to delve into MTV syndrome (look at anything by Michael Bay and you'll know what i mean), the overall tone of the film is probably the bleakest in film history. There is nothing pleasant in this film. No comic relief, no assurance that everything will be OK, just twist after twist the keeps you guessing till the very end and even then things look pretty bad. If your movie preference is that of soppy rom-coms or chick-flicks this is definitely not for you. I have a fairly high tolerance for this kind of stuff but even this tested me.<br/><br/>This is a truly great and utterly disturbing film that deserves to be up there with the great horror films of our time. This is pure nightmare inducing material. If they were as well made as this gem then i would openly welcome many more movies like it. Apparently there is now a sequel in the works set for the end of this year. Lets hope it works as well as this.<br/><br/>4/5"

","The basic premise of Saw is the it's cool to have epileptic editing and short music video based shots. The movie continuously jumps from one scene to another without a discernible transition. This is a horrible cross between the Blair Witch for it's camera techniques and Scooby Doo for shear stupidity. If I were so afflicted I am sure that this movie would have induced a seizure. The saddest part of this project is that it features genuinely good actors. I love Cary Elwes and Danny Glover but they were either miscast or poorly directed because no amount of talent on screen can save a thundering failure like this.

","I was really looking forward to seeing this film, after some fantastic hype and decent looking trailers coupled with my love of dark films I rushed to the cinema as soon as I could. I wish I hadn't have bothered, what started out as a promising psycho thriller with a nice bit of gore thrown in soon descended into a predictable, laughable and poorly acted turkey. I have to agree with davidcurtis_5's comments on the film, it is a blatant rip off Seven, at least with regards to the killers motives (although when the killer is finally revealed then these motives become quite laughable compared with the ones of Kevin Spacey's John Doe) Unlike Seven though the acting is just abysmal, Cary Elwes is possibly the worst actor I have ever seen outside of amateur dramatic productions at my local town hall and Danny Glover may as well not have been in the film at all given the amount he contributes to both the plot and the tension. As for the rest of the actors mediocre is probably the best word to describe them with the possible exception of Leigh Whannell as Adam. To be honest the only enjoyable things about this film for me were the direction (but even that got a bit clichÃ©d in places) and the pure inventiveness of the death scenes. Overall I would say that this film is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever had at the cinema, the 'shocks' ranged from mildly disturbing to plain laughable, the twist can be seen a mile of by anyone with even a mild knowledge of the genre and a smattering of intelligence and the acting will have you falling about in the aisles laughing. To sum up, if you want to see a great serial killer film watch Seven, if you want a great comedy watch Saw"

While it was scary at times, e.g. when the daughter of the main character had an unwanted encounter with her future kidnapper or in the scene, where Adam noticed there was someone in his home and he searched for his uninvited guest, it really wasn't so much of a horror movie for the most part.

"quinimdb","7","1","4","8 October 2016"," Saw
","""Saw"" is a smart, tense, psychological horror/thriller that nowadays, thanks to its awful sequels and the many imitators it spawned, is passed off as a cheap torture porn.<br/><br/>The first scene is an intriguing setup: A man wakes up in a grimy, dark bathroom, in the bath. He gets out and hears a deep voice speaking to him. The lights come on, it turns out someone else is in the room and he also has no idea what is happening. Also, there's a dead body in the center of the room. The mysteries unravel one by one mostly through a series of flashbacks. While this constant switching between time and place may seem like a jarring structure, the transitions between these scenes are handled very well by James Wan, the director. The cutting back and forth actually aids the film, since it leaves constant mystery and suspense throughout the entire film. Literally, the entire film.<br/><br/>The suspense and mystery of the film is mostly character based. Everyone in the film has a reason for where they are. These are not the usual clichÃ© horror film archetypes. First, the two men who are trapped together. Adam is a private eye who basically exposes people for money, and he's impatient and easily angered. Lawrence Gordon is a doctor, who cheats on his wife, but he isn't an entirely terrible person. He does love his daughter and it seems he wants to change. Then there's David Tapp, who becomes incredibly obsessed with this case, to the point of rushing into Jigsaw's hideout without a warrant and with his partner, Detective Sing, who is killed by Jigsaw, the murderer, during their ambush. Tapp then only falls more into obsession, driven by his guilt from the death of his partner. Then, of course, there is Jigsaw, who has severe cancer and is fed up seeing others who don't appreciate their lives, so he creates these elaborate torture scenarios which will make the victim appreciate their lives more if they escape. Of course, all of this is revealed slowly throughout the film, but that doesn't mean it was slow paced. There is constantly a new mystery to focus on in this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography has a gritty, grimy feel to it constantly that fits the depravity of the characters well. The quick editing increases the tension of many situations, such as when the detectives go into the abandoned mannequin factory to find Jigsaw, which is also a notable scene for incorporating the extent of Tapp's obsession into the moment when he decides to ""see what Jigsaw does"" rather than attempt to save the man who is about to be killed. Even in this intense moment, the film is able to develop the character. There are many other genuinely frightening sequences, such as when Adam goes looking for the man in his dark house with nothing but a camera flash, as well as the moment where Lawrence is kidnapped and the moments leading up to it. James Wan knows that in order for a moment to be truly scary, you must hint that there's something there, but not specify what. The fear of the unknown is infinitely scary than all the blood and guts you can imagine. Speaking of which, the film is actually much less gory than people make it out to be, and when there is gore, and don't get me wrong, there is some gruesome imagery, but it is not overdone to the point where it becomes ineffective. It will shock you every time because it is never shown in detail for more than a few seconds.<br/><br/>A very good horror/thriller that, judging by the end of this one, received many unjustified sequels."

","Saw (2004) is actually a pretty well made film, though it does have its flaws. The actors do exceedingly well with their roles. Danny Glover is a great presence to have in the movie, he brings his detective character to life, and he's such a joy to watch on screen. Leigh Wannell is amazing here, and I loved him in this film, he is intense, dramatic, and very focused. His character, Adam, is really a great character, and I loved seeing him attempt to figure what hell was going on. This movie is written well, and has the correct amount of intensity and energy about it. One of the flaws, is that a few of the most disturbing and grotesque images could've easily not been there, there was absolutely no need for me to see the insides of a mans stomach, that one shot could've been cut and it wouldn't have harmed the film at all. I wish they would have cut those few most gross images, because in my opinion, it brought the movie down instead of lifting it up in quality. Tobin Bell played his role menacingly and was completely evil, as he should have, even though he didn't get tons of screen time. The plot is clever, and it's well executed. The ending is clever, even though I couldn't help but feel sad for Adam, and no that doesn't make me some wuss or whatever, but come on he was a decent innocent guy and then that happened to him, even though yes it was a bone chilling, clever ending. So all in all, a clever well made film, with some flaws which I've already mentioned. And it's a hell of a lot better than Saw 3D, which I've already reviewed. 8/10."

The mask characterization is all but scary. It just doesn't put up tension - at times I truly was laughing out loud. And it's NOT IN DEPTH - that's the real problem of it. Everything is just left there - I felt like the movie was constantly missing the point.<br/><br/>And also I felt like it was just ripping off things from videogames...SILENT HILL was a certain inspiration for the guys in charge.<br/><br/>It0s just a fast movie for this new generation of hyped teens and I'm not surprised to hear that a sequel is in the works - gotta make the biggest amount of money out of a stupid plot for sure.<br/><br/>I definitely suggest the readers to check out more deserving movies. Mullholland Drive and Lost Higways by David Lynch could be those working for a serious macabre aficionado. Hell, SE7EN will work too, even if I'm not the biggest Fincher fan!"
"sarah-282","1","1","4","6 April 2005"," Why do people like this movie!??
","I thought this film was awful! I cannot understand why people were raving about how good it was?! Someone above says it was a wasted opportunity and I agree it had the potential to be much better. Whoever cast the Doctor made a serious error; he ruined the whole film for me. He was an unbelievably bad actor as well as unbelievable in the role. I hated this film and I am a horror and thriller aficionado. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. It just left me feeling ""is that it?!"". I thought that the twist at the end was ridiculous and unbelievable. I suppose with the name SAW it had a lot to live up to and I was expecting much more than I got. It was also intensely annoying in parts, I don't want to put spoilers in here, but there were a couple of scenes where I was literally screaming at the TV, ""AS IF""! I am more than able to take films in this genre with a pinch of salt when required but this just left me cold."
"sunbiz_3000","8","1","4","11 March 2005"," One of the Best movie of recent times
","The movie ""Saw"" is one of the best movies that I have seen recently. The movie has very good script and screenplay. Although the acting, with new actors is not the best, but the story really keeps you excited. The story not only is different but has awesome logic and understanding unlike few other horror/thriller I have recently seen. The climax is awesome and unexpected! One other thing that needs to be greatly appreciated is the director's narration of the story. He has done a splendid job in telling you the story at the perfect pace, not too fast and not too slow! Also the gore scenes are so logically and artistically crafted, that they don't seem irrational at any point. The killer's mental state is shown beautifully without actually ever showing the person behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is bound to be favorite of anyone who's seen it! One of the best thriller ever!"

I mean, honestly, we need another movie like Se7en where we don't know who the killer is and when we find out it isn't a big surprise, because, well it wasn't the important part of the story. Honestly, there are better horror movies out there. Go see Rosemary's Baby. Watch Se7en a second time. Donnie Darko is impressive. Even cheesy 80's horror movies are better than this.

"benben209","2","1","4","13 February 2005"," No, no, NO
","So I had a great time watching this movie. The ticket price for this movie was some of the best money I've ever spent. I was almost rolling on the floor of the movie theater laughing hysterically at how incompetent the movie was at displaying any semblance of cinematic quality. And I wasn't the only one. In fact, everyone in the theater was laughing.<br/><br/>For the most part, the acting was not terrible, and anyone who says otherwise isn't looking closely enough. The DIRECTION was the terrible part. In fact, it was appallingly bad. In a movie that bases itself around tension, I have never seen a director specifically cut away from the tension because he wanted to develop another storyline that didn't have any relevance whatsoever and probably shouldn't have been cut.<br/><br/>So what do I mean by that? I mean Danny Glover. I said the acting was not terrible for the most part, and the other part is Danny Glover. He was awful. He was pathetically awful. I have no idea why he gets work anymore, because whatever acting talent he had once upon a time is just plain gone. This performance is so bad, it's almost offered as an apology for being watchable in Lethal Weapon. And his storyline was completely unimportant. Really, there's no reason to have a cop (or even a vigilante cop) in this movie because it has no relevance to an isolated world of a serial killer. Also, for heaven's sake do NOT let him pretend to be crazy because he just can't do it.<br/><br/>Also, why are people being killed? Is the killer bored? Is he mad that he's dying and taking it out on the world? If he's a sociopath, we don't care. He's not Hannibal Lecter. In fact, we have no character development of the killer whatsoever. They might as well have turned him into an object. Edgar Allen Poe had a better killer in the Pit and the Pendulum. And by that, I mean the Pendulum was a better villain.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the directing. When a director breaks the tension of a scene such as this director does ALL THE TIME, he leaves his actors out to dry, which is inexcusable for actors who work as hard as Cary Elwes does in this movie. And then the scene when Cary Elwes is sawing off his leg is so funny you can't breathe from laughing so hard. That's not the only mistake the director made (such as the intensely pretentious philosophy that he and his best friend, the writer, dreamed up), but it's certainly the most heinous.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I did like about this movie was the idea. NOT the execution, but the idea was solid. Also, the production design and cinematography were pretty neat. I like the seedy, gritty look of junkyards and abandoned warehouses, and I especially like seeing what people can do with them. And Monica Potter, as usual, did a pretty darn good job.<br/><br/>If I were a studio executive, I'd give James Wan all the money in the world to make another movie, as he can obviously make the money back. However, I would have trouble looking myself in the mirror, knowing I'm directly responsible for propagating more bad movies. WE DON'T NEED MORE BAD MOVIES, Hollywood! PLEASE STOP!"
"fastpixel","1","1","4","4 February 2005"," low budget is no excuse for making this kind of poop
","This film probably tries to be original, but it stumbles badly. Idea of a killer giving victims couple of options to live or die and punishing them for what they have been in their lives is not really original. It was seen for example in Seven, which was quality film and cannot even be compared to Saw.<br/><br/>The Plot and characters are filled with more holes than swiss cheese. Timings within the film and sets are not realistic. The turn-points in the plot were overly worked and unnaturally stiff.<br/><br/>Can't help thinking that director/writer James Wan has been overly abusive and voted the flick to average of 7.5 (04.feb.05). There is no reason why 8000 voters average would be as high as legendary film masterpieces other than someone is abusing the voting system. Box office goes along much with the rating and now we have a fault here."

"blumdeluxe","8","1","5","10 January 2017"," Better than most Thrillers
","When you hear about Saw, what comes up straight into your mind are images of a splatter movie, celebrating violence without worshiping the plot too much. In my opinion that is a completely false judgment.<br/><br/>To me, the movie is a classical psycho-thriller rather than a Horror movie actually, even though the borders are naturally fluent. What I really liked is how much thought is put into when to release which information. I can honestly say that I didn't predict many of the details that came to light, including the excellent end.<br/><br/>Of course the movie gains some of its success from the language of violence it carries, but honestly, there's nothing so bad in it, that you couldn't have seen it a dozen times before. And in part the degree of violence helps to create an atmosphere in which the audience can really feel the desperation of the protagonists grow.<br/><br/>In my eyes, this is a better approach towards an excellent thriller than many others I've seen lately. I respect the mixed critics but recommend a watch if you're okay with seeing explicit images."
"xenazues","8","1","5","10 January 2017"," This movie average rating is accurate with Movie
","The average viewer rating for this movie was 7.7 before I did my rating. And I didn't read other reviews for this movie. What I usually do is watch a movie and then give a review. If its been over a month since I seen it I probably wont even give the review. I take reviews seriously and if someone decides to watch this I really want to give my opinion of it as well as be accurate. So to be honest I usually review it after days. <br/><br/>But with that said this movie was great for a few reasons. Its horror movie is one. I can't state enough all the terrible acting in these horror movies and yes the budget reflects that. The banks just don't support horror movies like they do Hollywood movies. And why should they. They are corny, terrible acting and not well put together plots. Doesn't sound like a turn on your investment with me.<br/><br/>But enough of that. What made this movie great is the plot. Seriously I just gave a review for another movie and it seems like people are having a hard time with basic things like detectives and leading an investigation. Investigations don't go as planned, they leave you in suspense, who did it. You might have one set of suspects get there and you have to start from scratch. Not sure how some of these movies just get a suspect follow him then arrest him. I guess too many perry masons and murder she wrote for some of these people. But real detectives cases, its up and down. And this movie had twist and turns. <br/><br/>Danny Glover didn't have a great performance but he was interesting and very interesting. And realistic, some detectives never give up period. Cases hunt them. The real honest tell in the movie is the money they made. The budget was a little over a million dollars and they made 55 million dollars and started a franchise. Which I'm sure no one expected.<br/><br/>And just like freddie, and pin head (before they changed him to that model looking guy who had no business acting in a horror flick) this actor who plays jigsaw really gives you the creeps. So its a great movie must see and for horror flicks it up there in the top of its class. I've wrote some reviews but not many movies are up in the top of their class. This is a must see movie. <br/><br/>To get a 9 they would have had to have a better actors in the first seen. The younger guy in the tub simply was terrible. Thank god I like my horror movies with terrible acting otherwise he would have cost this movie huge rating points for me."

The film focuses on building tension with every scene, without ever allowing its audience to breathe, leading up to a final twist that'll go down as one of the best game-changing endings in recent memory.<br/><br/>The only minor gripes I have involve moments of bad acting and some questionable editing choices, particularly during a car chase sequence near the end, but those can be attributed to the limited budget and can be easily overlooked.

Those who don't enjoy horror movies also enjoy 'Saw' for it's uniqueness, elaborate storyline and lack of jump scares. The completely unexpected ending crowned the movie.

In many other movies of the same genre the ending and plot are very predictable, like someone moving to a new house. The victims is given the opportunity to live, but at a high price and it makes you wonder what you would choose to do, although you don't really want to think about it. It's a really twisted and creepy movie. What I loved about it was the plot twist and mind games that kept me engaged the entire time. The only problems I had with the film was the constant swings from one part of the story to another which can leave you confused and some things are not very realistic, but over all you can either see that as a good thing or a bad one and for me it worked."

"chijoker","1","1","6","1 November 2004"," New pitch: a serial killer stalking serial killers
","I realize that the movie was not intended as camp, but clearly that is the result. You can complain about the writing or the acting or the directing, but they are all equal parts horrible. Beyond that though, the whole serial killer genre is fading out like the Westerns did in the 70's. We've been watching this for, what, three decades now? It has become an exercise in ratcheting up the gore to get someone into the theaters. It is dead, a victim whose corpse has been hacked and mutilated by dozens of directors, and the good ones (Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Jonathan Demme, David Fincher) only serve to give the bad ones a new template to follow. You can add or subtract from that list of directors, but the litmus test is simple: were they followed by a flock of imitators? TCM, Halloween, SOTL, Seven all showed this lasting influence. Can we consider Saw to be anything more than a typical B movie, popcorn required? Did it break any conventions other than adding a new serial killer MO? A 10? If this is a perfect movie (and I am assuming that these disturbingly positive reviews are genuine, not just cast and crew and their relatives) then what does Silence of the Lambs, or TCM or whatever rate? Are those all 10s too, making them all of equal quality? C'mon, the movie is big steamy pile. Don't worry, Princess Bride fanboys - I'm sure people are going to see your secret love Cary Elwes, either in this movie or in the unemployment line. The way I see it, (1) Danny Glover should have stayed down after first blood and let his character die early on, (2) Elwes should have used the cellular to call Aaron Eckhart and thank him for passing on the script, (3) the whiny writer/co-star - he nearly captures the most annoying performance of the movie until Elwes realizes he's being one-upped - should switch to copyrighting for Proctor & Gamble or something equally harmless to society, (4) Monica Potter needs to swear off any further garbage before the same thing happens to her career as those around her, (5) the dummy needs to be sent back to the Brothers Quay museum, (6) Shawnee Smith should be congratulated for finding some flotsam to cling on to in her never-was acting career, and (7) director Wan should be condemned to watching this film for eternity."
"Coventry","7","1","7","13 March 2005"," A new hope for the horror genre...
","Despite a few obvious flaws and a couple of understandable logic-errors, James Wan's debut ""Saw"" definitely is one of the best horror projects of the last fifteen years. It finally is a film that dares to shock again! Most recent horror films politely request whether it's okay or not to scare you now, while ""Saw""  much like cult hits from the 60's and 70's  just grab you by the throat and doesn't let go before the end credits start to role. That's what this genre is all about! It's not about how 100% waterproof the script is or how Oscar-worthy the acting is....we need shocks, bitterness and madness! Wan doesn't waste any time, as the story begins with two men waking up in a filthy old restroom, chained to the wall and separated by and corpse holding a gun. Still unaware of where they are and what they did to deserve this, Adam (a photographer) and Lawrence (an adulterous surgeon) are given the order to survive this situation by killing the other, using the attributes hidden somewhere in the room. It soon becomes clear that they were captured by the notorious ""Jigsaw"" killer...an extremely violent but intelligent serial murderer whose identity is still a mystery to the police and whose only motive and grudge seems to go out to people who're ungrateful to be alive. Wan and co-writer Whannel did their best to stuff the plot with so many twists and turns that you eventually stop to guess along in the killer's identity but the climax is overall satisfying and ingenious enough to be praiseworthy. The very best aspects, however, are the very imaginative ""games"" that the killer has thought up for his/her victims! These sequences (mostly shown through flashbacks) are utterly demented, grim and most certainly not meant for the eyes of the squeamish! I wanted more of them, actually...Truly disturbing also is the use of eerie scenery (masks, dark set pieces, torture machines) and sound effects. The gore is not overwhelming  thank God  but several sequences are quite repulsive and there even are a couple of authentic ""jump"" sequences. It's true that the acting, of nearly the entire cast, is abominable and at times even downright irritating. Maybe it's because all the washed up actors and actresses (there are quite a few ""departed glory"" stars here: Cary Elwes, Dany Glover, Monica Potter, Dina Meyer...) are just disappointed in their careers or maybe the young director Wan still lacks the talent to guide his cast into the right performances. I sure didn't allow the acting to ruin the rest of the film for me. When you watch horror a lot, you'll quickly learn that atrocious acting can't be too much of an obstacle. This is probably a film that will raise even more questions and unravel more mistakes when you watch it the second time around, but at least the first viewing is impressive and ensuring horror buffs that they're beloved genre is not yet dead and buried."

","Great film. Very different from the rest of the Saw films. Actually had a good plot. Its very simple, but that's what makes it work so well.

","What I revere about is that the two creators thought of the cheapest script by just chaining two men to their opposite sides of a prehistoric bathroom with a dead body in the middle of the floor and he is the reason they are locked in the room.<br/><br/>Interesting turns were when it is revealed that Zepp was another victim following rules to obtain antidote for a slow-acting poison he was given.
And as Zep's tape ends, corpse rises and is revealed to be Joe Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer.<br/><br/>Jigsaw chooses his victim under these principles:
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.
Sick of people who don't appreciate their blessings.
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.<br/><br/>I read about the fact of how Leigh Whannell came up with the idea for the character Jigsaw, juggled between his tumour and MRI scan. Sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, ""What if you were given the news that you had a tumour and you are going to die soon? How would you react to that? And thus he imagined Jigsaw giving his victims in the literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.<br/><br/>

"bowmanblue","8","0","2","20 November 2019"," More intelligent than you probably think
","You probably wouldn't say that the 'Friday 13th' franchise is particularly 'high brow' or a 'thinking man's' horror film. The franchise went on seemingly forever and, if you know anything about the 'Saw' movies, you'll know that they're up to about 'Part 802' (well, not quite, but you know what I'm getting at). Therefore, you may think that a horror series that churns out one film after the next isn't worth bothering with. I can't comment on the latter installments, but the original is actually a damn sight more deep than you'd ever imagine.<br/><br/>Yes, you can probably sum the plot up (like many have) simply by saying that two strangers wake up in a serial killer's lair and they have to figure out a way out of their soon-to-be-fatal predicament. There's nothing wrong with that plot summary - it does the job, but, if you sit down to watch 'Saw' then you'll find that there's so much more to the story than such simplicity.<br/><br/>Also, 'Saw' was one of those films in the early 2000s that helped to revitalise the 'torture p0rn' genre. In case you don't know, it's a sub-genre of horror films which specialises in watching people do grisly and disgusting things to their own, or others', bodies. And - again - this is applicable to 'Saw' which just makes it sound like yet another reason to write it off as just a sick video nasty with no substance.<br/><br/>Besides my earlier plot summary I'm not going to go on about the story, namely because - as I've already mentioned - there's a lot more going on besides. If I give too much away then - if you haven't already seen it - it will spoil much of the surprise that you'll get from an initial viewing.<br/><br/>All I can say is that if you're into horror (and have a strong enough stomach) then you should definitely check the original 'Saw' out. It has pretty much everything you could want, from strong acting performances, character you'll care about, plenty of gore and various elements that you probably won't see coming. Ignore the sequels (actually, I quite liked the second one too, but everything after that I could pretty much leave) and stick with this one."
"andrearhodes-13133","Null","0","2","12 November 2019"," Horror, visceral gut-wrenching horror
","Saw is gory more than scary and the subsequent films in the series amp both up.  To appreciate Saw in its full gory, you have to have a penchant for productions that bask in the traditions of the Grand Guignol. While most of the film relies more on psychological tension and terror, there's plenty of gut-churning, visceral violence, especially during the final 15 minutes. That's the time period when James Wan's otherwise compelling feature goes a little too far over the top, veering out of its David Fincher-inspired darkness into the realm of self-parody. There's lots of blood, plenty of hysteria, and perhaps one twist too many. On the strength of a grippingly original concept and 90 strong minutes of building action, Saw gets a recommendation, but only if you like this kind of thing. Saw bucks the horror trend towards formula storytelling and proves that enough qualities in the ""plus column"" can overcome a weak ending."

","Saw is the film that started it all, and boy, it was a really good way to ""let the games begin.""<br/><br/>The plot of Saw is about two guys, Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell), that are trapped in some bizarre looking bathroom with a dead man in the center of the room. They find out they are in a game. The game is where Gordon has to kill Adam before a certain time and if he fails to do so, his wife and daughter will die. Gordon and Adam try to find clues around the room to escape this game and save Gordon's family before it's too late.<br/><br/>The first Saw film had such a clear and basic plot, and had some good extra subplots to it. Danny Glover's character, Tapp, that wants to analyze more about Gordon and see if he is innocent after his partner Sing gets killed. Michael Emerson's character, Zep, was hired to kill Gordon's family because he had a poison in his body and if he succeeds, he gets an antidote. I liked how it all tied in by the end and it all came full circle. The pacing was also very good and everything went where it had to go.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone was really good. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell had good chemistry as the two main victims, and although he didn't get much screentime, Tobin Bell did a great job as the main antagonist and person that was behind everything, Jigsaw/John Kramer.<br/><br/>Out of all the Saw films, this one was the least graphic one. They were just starting things up to see how it went, and in the sequels, things would get more out of control with the gorror. This film also didn't have much traps like the other ones, mostly because it was just about two guys in one trap, but shows other traps in the film that have happened prior to their situation.<br/><br/>All in all, Saw is a pretty complete film and holds up 15 years later."

","Intro:
""Saw"" is a masterfully made movie, and a film that understands building tension and keeping the audience in constant suspense.<br/><br/>Pros:
This is a movie easily deserving of a spot up there with some of the best horror movies ever made. ""Saw"" has a shockingly original premise of two people chained in a bathroom. Being forced to either cut through their feet, or both die. The movie lives to it, by building tension to the point that you can't wait for the ending. And the twist ending satisfies. The movie is mostly set in one location, and I love one location movies, because it allows the writers to be creative. And while it doesn't stay in that location the entire time, it doesn't take away from the suspense. As the movie goes on, both of our main characters learn more about each other. And that there's more to it, then them just being there by chance.<br/><br/>Cons:
The only issue I have with the film is the acting. The performances on the part of our two leads are pretty bad, they both have really bad reads. But I can forgive the film for it's big flaw.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
I love ""Saw"". It's one of my favorite horror films. Many critics might call it a gore fest, but the film doesn't focus on the gore, it focuses on the story. It's interesting, it's suspenseful, and it's a great watch."

","This classic right here is one of the best of all time. If you are fan of Torture, Slasher, and Mystery then this is a movie you really have to watch. The movie Saw starts off with the mystery of who is Jigsaw. It starts off with 2 men named Lawrence Gordon who is a doctor and Adam Faulkner-Stanheight who is a photographer trapped inside a filthy bathroom not knowing they are only then to notice that they're stuck to a chain. This is where it gets interesting, This time they are given an opportunity to survive the trap and this movie is creative to let the Jigsaw killer send out tapes of the rules of the game and leaving out clues and mysteries to the detectives to see who's behind all this. This movie does a great job with the suspense and brings a lot of thrill to the Jigsaw mystery with a lot of smart traps such as the Reverse Bear Trap and the quadruple shotgun. This movie also gives you alot of goosebumps especially when the wife and daughter of Dr. Lawrence Gordon are part of the game and the only way they can survive is Dr. Gordon needing to kill Adam which brought alot of attention into the movie and the detectives still puzzled on who is behind all of this traps, clues, and games. Another good part about the movie was Adam faking his death the whole time after getting shot by Dr. Gordon. That left me shocked. Adam then proceeds to kill Zep Hindle on who he thought was the Jigsaw killer. One of my favorite and best plot twist scenes of all time when it was never Zep who was the Jigsaw killer as Zep was actually part of the game too and was following Jigsaw's instructions. The person really behind the Jigsaw killings was a man named John Kramer. Which lead to the best movie plot twist of all time that brought a lot of shock. It then thens with John Kramer telling Adam before closing the door on him, ""Game Over!"" One of the best movie lines of all time. This movie was very smart. Smart traps, It followed the plot correctly, brought a lot of suspense and mystery, torture, and an amazing plot twist. So I recommend you watch Saw. It's the best horror film of all time."

"TheLittleSongbird","7","0","1","24 November 2017"," A puzzling game worth playing
","Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.<br/><br/>The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The first 'Saw' is very problematic but is one of the better films of the 'Saw' series. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted. Some of the story is ridiculous with large lapses in logic, Danny Glover's character's actions will have one screaming in frustration at the television screen. Some of the script is tight, other parts are half-baked and silly and Elwes' character's back-story had some taut tension but that it had some melodramatic parts with frustrating character behaviour.<br/><br/>Some of the acting is not good. Cary Elwes seems to be thinking like he's acting in a very over-heated melodrama that would have been out of date even in the period when they were in fashion. Danny Glover's performance is also a mess, with a mix of over-compensating and not looking interested. Even for the film's mood, some of the editing is chaotic.<br/><br/>However, for a film that didn't have a high budget 'Saw' visually doesn't look too bad on the whole, effective even. There is a real sense of unsettling claustrophobia induced in the lighting, setting and photography. Music has its eeriness.<br/><br/>Not everybody fares badly in the acting. Michael Emerson has an unnerving presence and Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell also do a decent job. Then there is Tobin Bell, not easy to forget him after this film. James Wan does more than competently in the director's chair, even with the inexperience.<br/><br/>Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. There is genuine dread, some truly imaginative traps and kills and much of it throughout is disturbing and creepy. 'Saw' is notable in particular not just for the traps/kills but also for its bold twists, the character of Jigsaw (the modus operandi, impulse and justification setting him apart from most characters of his type) and an unforgettably shocking ending.<br/><br/>Overall, very problematic but effective. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"thelastblogontheleft","7","0","2","12 November 2017"," Surprisingly Awesome
","Amazingly enough, I hadn't actually seen Saw until this viewing. I think a lot of the ""torture porn"" stereotype kept me away, which is a shame because it doesn't really fit into that category.<br/><br/>It was director James Wan's feature film debut, which is especially impressive considering how much of a franchise it is now (Jigsaw, the eighth installment in the series, was just released last month) and how much the character of Jigsaw has become such a well-known face in the world of horror (his puppet representation, at least). <br/><br/>The film centers around Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell), two men who wake up chained by their ankles in a filthy, dilapidated bathroom, separated by a dead man laying in a pool of his own blood and gripping a microcassette recorder. They have to piece together clues in the room as well as their own slowly returning memories to figure out just who has them locked up and why<br/><br/>** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>I honestly did NOT expect to enjoy this movie. It was a pretty effective lesson in not judging a book (or a movie) by its cover (or its hype, for that matter). I was surprised, overall, by how smart it was. Again, I had expected a sort of schlock film, rife with blood and guts and sadism but no real substance, but I was happily surprised by the developing complexities of the plot.<br/><br/>It is dirty and gritty and poorly acted, for sure, but there's a solid enough plot line behind it all that I was able to pardon it for the most part. Reading about Wan and Whannell's limited budget — which didn't allow them nearly as many takes with the actors as they had hoped for — helped. Wan had wanted to go for a more Hitchcockian vibe but he was aware of how much his limitations would prevent that, which is a shame — it's interesting to think about how much more intense this movie could have been with the proper time and money put into it.<br/><br/>I love Cary Elwes, I really do — I mean, come on — but the dude is not the greatest at American accents. He starts off barely hiding his British accent and by the end his accent is plain unrecognizable. It's funny in a way, really, but it does make me wonder why actors are even told to hide their accents to begin with.<br/><br/>I probably knew the most about Jigsaw before I watched this movie — just the general idea of him pitting people against each other — but I didn't quite realize the extent of his ""murders"". The man who slit his wrists being put in a room full of razor wire with a narrow tunnel to crawl through to show how much he really wanted to live (with the irony being that he would have to cut himself again to really prove it), or the man who was ""sick"" all the time having ingested a slow-acting poison and needing to navigate walls covered in numbers to find the combination to the safe that contained his antidote (all the while being covered in a flammable substance while his only source of light was a candle), or the drug addicted woman needing to cut open the stomach of an alive but drugged up man to get the key to unlock her ""reverse bear trap"" (oooof). The scenarios were all meticulously tailored to each person's sins, in a way — specifically catered to how that person took their life for granted in the eyes of Jigsaw.<br/><br/>I thought Jigsaw's motivation, while disturbed as hell, was an interesting aspect to the movie, especially when paired with the fact that he doesn't actually kill anyone himself. I can only imagine how maddening it would be to have a terminal disease and see people around you that you believe are taking for granted the very life being ripped from you. I also thought the reverse bear trap scene was such a crucial one because it showed that he is indeed fair in his games — she successfully fished the key out of the man's stomach and Jigsaw let her go, hoping she was more grateful for her life now.<br/><br/>I knew as soon as I saw the orderly, Zep (Michael Emerson), being patronized by Dr. Gordon that he would play a more major role later on, though it wasn't what I thought at all (I initially thought he would end up being the killer but had doubts when I saw how sloppy he was later on).<br/><br/>The gore was surprisingly sparse but when it happened, it was intense, specifically Dr. Gordon sawing his own damn foot off in a moment of desperation to reach his wife and daughter. One of those rare moments where I sat, mouth agape, and then started yelling ""no no no NO NO!"" at the TV.<br/><br/>But the ENDING is really where it's at. I had NO clue where it was going, and somewhat assumed it would end with some kind of bloody battle or hokey cliffhanger but DAMN, it surprised me. It was perfect, really — enough so that I won't spoil it for the 5 or 6 of you out there who haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I am really looking forward to watching at least some of the sequels. If they are similar to this one I think they will be super fun (and I really don't mind the gore so bring it on)."

James Wan's gory mystery begins with two men waking up in a room with no idea how they got there. Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) finds a tape in his pocket along with a dead body in the center of the room. He reasonably freaks out as his leg is chained to pipes. The other man in the room Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) is also chained to pipes and has a tape in his pocket. The dead man in the middle of the room has a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other. Adam drags the tape recorder and listens to his tape that tells him he is going to die. Dr. Gordon's tape threatens his wife and children if he does not kill Adam by a certain time.<br/><br/>Dr. Gordon knows of this modus operandi as he was the suspect in a similar murder case. Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) and Detective Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigate a string of brutal murders where the victims were forced to perform ridiculous tasks that usually resulted in them dying or being so traumatized that survival was difficult. Lawrence Gordon's penlight was discovered at a scene so he was brought in for questioning. The doctor had to admit he was having an affair to establish an alibi.

"justinpkelly","8","0","2","27 October 2017"," A classic of the genre that is still underrated
","James Wan has proved himself to be one of the best horror directors out there with The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2. But his first feature film, Saw, is almost always overlooked. I think the reason for this is that people hear the title and automatically assume that it is a grotesquely violent movie like its sequels. But this one avoids using too much violence and leaves quite a bit up to the imagination. It's a really well-thought-out, exciting, and intelligent movie. In fact, I'd even go as far as to say that this is one of the greatest low-budget horror films of all time. Look, there's no denying that the Saw sequels are bad movies. I'd actually be shocked if the new sequel Jigsaw, which is the eighth movie in the franchise, was legitimately good. The sequels may be incredibly entertaining as fun, gross-out Halloween guilty pleasure films, but the writing and acting are generally both terrible in each sequel. But this one is so far beyond a mindless guilty pleasure movie.<br/><br/>Saw's story is absolutely awesome. The movie unravels the Jigsaw killer's motivations without beating the audience over the head with them or making them too obvious. The idea of a serial killer doing horrible things based on what they believe is right has been a terrifying story element in many previous movies. Saw, despite clearly homaging classic thriller movies like Seven, still feels like an extremely unique and clever vision that stands on its own. The fact that Jigsaw makes victims hurt themselves or others may be an even more terrifying prospect than him just doing it himself. The traps that Jigsaw sets for his victims are truly terrifying, but it's not because of an excessive amount of gore. There is some violence, of course, but it is often shown off-screen or isn't shown up close. That is something that the Saw sequels did that made them feel like they were just trying to gross out the audience rather than having them be engaged in the story. The scene involving Amanda is truly one of the best scenes in the history of horror because of how psychologically disturbing it is. Would you be willing to kill an innocent person to save your own life? Saw makes you ask questions like this that will make your stomach churn. I also have to mention Billy the Puppet, who is, in my opinion, the greatest horror movie puppet ever put to screen. The way he seemingly operates by himself makes him feel alive despite the fact that the viewer knows that it's just a puppet. The design of Billy has become incredibly iconic and, whenever he is in a scene in this movie, he adds a lot to the atmosphere. Seeing the main characters, Adam and Dr. Gordon, trying to figure out how to escape their trap is incredibly thrilling as well. But it's not just because it's well directed and involves creepy and disturbing tasks; the characters have a ton of personality and are actually quite deep. Upon rewatch, I realized how little I appreciated the character writing in this film during previous viewings. Also, the twist at the end of this movie is still one of the great movie twists of all time. If you've never seen the movie before, you will be caught completely off-guard.<br/><br/>The movie's not perfect, though. Some of the line delivery is bad on occasion and I feel like overall the acting left a bit to be desired. Don't get me wrong; there's a lot of good acting in this movie. But I feel like having truly excellent performances could have elevated this movie to yet another level. Also, I would have liked the storyline involving Detective Tapp, played by Donald Glover, to have been stronger. It was entertaining, but it felt like the most cliché element of this movie and they could have gone a little deeper with that. Overall, Saw is a must-watch around Halloween time. It is one of the best horror films ever made and I highly suggest that you check it out if you've never seen it before. It's an extremely riveting ride from start to finish. 8/10 Grade: A-"
"lorcan-61881","8","0","2","25 October 2017"," Halloween Review #25: Brilliant horror film that continued a horror series til now
","When Saw came out,I remember everybody was talking about it,from school friends to even adults on the street and when I went to see it,literally the god damn cinema workers were just there,not talking about bills or events,they were talking about the god damn Saw movie and saying it was so creepy and gory,now..that dose'int happen too much. Saw follows the story of two strangers(or are they?)who wake up in a abandoned bathroom with no explanation of where they are,but when they begin to find clues to getting out,they realize that everything is linked to a sadistic serial killer who sets traps for his victims who have done wrong. Saw is a brilliant film,James Wan knows how to create horror,hes brilliant at it,its not zombies or witches or little Asian ghost girls,he can make a awfully low budget horror film and it will be the most scariest horror film ever(Insidious,The Conjuring as well as the sequels,ehhh,heloooooooo?). There are scenes in this film are stupidly so good because I love how smart Wan is,he can just make a brilliant horror film that will have people talking for years with literally just a click,every other horror director puts so much effort in to horror films and it just ends up being so awful and cheesy,even if Wan dose not create a awesome horror film(which,i hope not,is yet to come),he dose'int give two sh*ts,hes just like ""all right,lets move on"". Saw is an amazing horror film I advice you to see. I will be reviewing the next 6 Saw's,hopefully before Sunday after I see JIgsaw,the new film and yes,these are parts of my Halloween reviews!!"
"kylemcdavid-27399","8","0","2","24 October 2017"," One of the best Horror Movies of the 21th century!
","Man, this movie. Now I see a-lot of Horror Movies in my time but never that brutally sick and twisted like this one. <br/><br/>Basically a new serial killer is in town, but is unique than any others as he set traps for his victims, in which ain't like any other as they usually uses a weapon like a knife or a gun. The killer was dubbed as ""Jigsaw"" as according to the video tapes he left behind with a dummy he voiced in order to hide his identity, may have a connection to these people he kills because he seemly knows a-lot about them as they goes from Drug Addicts to Pathological Liars to Those who attempted Suicide, and his games that he have them plays are kinda like puzzles, and if they figured it out, not only their allowed to make it out alive (Which unfortunately is a rare chance), but also learns about their mistakes in life and shelled changed their ways of living. Meanwhile, a Ruthless Doctor is suspected to this ""Jigsaw"" individual because his applys was found at one of the crime scenes. But it turned out he Innocent like he proved to be, as he was soon kidnapped by the killer himself to become another of his victims and plays another of his deadly games, and if he fails, his family shall be killed, alongside with him is another individual who is also kidnapped and his purpose is somehow connected to the doctor's case, and the Doctor have to killed him to shows his realization of his Cruelty especially what he learns about him.<br/><br/>The movie got ton of great acting in it, I absolutely loves the interaction between both the doctor and the other person in the room which is primarily of the film takes placed in, it started kinda funny at the beginning, and gets really twisted to watch as it drags. The doctor was good as the actor did good playing such a jerk of a doctor who deserves to play the game by Jigsaw especially what Jigsaw turned-out to be in the end, with his Identity is revealed at the end. As it makes total sense for his abduction to exist not because he was accused of his killings but because he's quite cruel at his job. The other individual was at times amusing to watch, such loves his sarcastic talk at the beginning of the film as he answering the Doctor's question of his identity, just wow. Danny Glover plays in this film as a detective who is working on the Jigsaw's case, he was alright here not much to say about him, except for two scenes in which are good-old Cop actions my favorite is close by the end of the movie in which he was fighting against who thought is the actual killer. <br/><br/>The trap scenes are brutal to watch especially the infamous Amanda Young's scene in which quite shocking to see with her digging though that one dude's body, just glory as it's gorgeous. One last thing to say about this movie is the ending which is like awesome, now I figured there would be a Twist after-all but still it nice to viewed, and the theme song is something I'll not forget, it awesome to hear, and I'm glad I have it on my Cellphone.<br/><br/>Over-all, I still don't think I could give this movie a score like 10, because I think this is not the best horror movie yet, but I give this movie a good score still like 8. Check this out if you want to see a movie that have good Brutalities and such interesting characters, or not if you're too sensitive to this type of movie, make your choice."
"ajourneywithjake","7","0","1","21 October 2017"," A decent start for a famous horror franchise
","This film has a very interesting premise. Rather than simply being a serial killer, the villain instead forces people to play in his game, where they can choose whether or not they'll actually survive. This potential to survive depends on the victim's problem solving skills and the willingness to sacrifice in the face of usually great pain. These scenes where the sacrifice occurs often times can be morbid and cringe worthy, but the unfolding plot more than makes up for this. The main characters, Adam and Lawrence, are acted very well and Jigsaw's presence is felt very ominously and powerfully when he has speaking lines. Seeing the characters' backgrounds develop as the movie progresses highlights the film's overall message starkly, namely how too many people don't appreciate what they have and also take life for granted. Also, while they are the prettiest things to look at, the sets are very well dressed and definitely give off the feel of both abandoned buildings and the darker places of society. The producers also did a very good job with creating this film and the gore in particular looks quite realistic. Overall, I found the plot entertaining despite the gory parts, which I chose not to pay too much attention to.<br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on my blog at: https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com/"

","I expected horror, but I was not disappointed not to see one. I saw something much better. Intelligent and original psycho-thriller. Story is strong, twists are excellent, and torture and gore scenes are carefully measured, purposefully placed and they do not cross the line of tastelessness at any point. Surprise factor has big role in this movie and knowing how movie ends spoiled it to me pretty much. If you didn't see it yet, I strongly recommend you to avoid trailers, reviews and any other potential spoilers.

","SAW is a movie that isn't big on the overall budget for locations but that actually works for the movie as the eerie bathroom sets a perfect view into a horror series that will send a shiver down your spine. the cast was a lot of unknown actors but they prove that an experience of being kidnapped is terrifying and A list actor like Lethal Weapon star Danny Glover as a detective completely obsessed with the jigsaw case he brought a new dynamic element to the story. I personally found that the original SAW was a unique story with some great new gory elements which would set up the future of the entire franchise."

"michaehastings","6","0","1","22 July 2017"," This movie is good
","SAW is the first of the SAW septology, and definitely the best. The creators had a vision for an original horror movie that was unlike any American slasher movie around at the time. I like how they were able to use their budget effectively, and use aspects of the production that could have been problems to their advantage. This can be seen in how they used their inability to have too many exterior shots or different locations to create a sense of claustrophobia and isolation. The only real issues I have are that some of the actors aren't pulling their weight in terms of bringing the story to life, and some of the stuff that happens is stupid. Overall, this is a fun, creative movie that's worth watching if you like horror and bad editing."
"bizopoulosalexandros","7","0","2","15 July 2017"," Connection between Saw and the TV show Survivor
","I watched this movie for the third time. It actually has some similarities with the TV show ""Survivor""(which apparently made a hit in Greece this season) although, it does sound a bit weird.<br/><br/>First of all, the people, that take participate in the games, don't have any previous experience on these , so they need to get accustomed quickly to make it through.They usually also act on their own, to achieve their goal which is their survival from this experience with the gain of some food, or the immunity from the voting. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the players that go to the TV show, are of course willing to do it.They also have a general view of the action that should be done on the games, and they stay there for as long as they try, or as long as the majority of TV viewers like them. Of course the people that get in Jigsaw's games try to win the game in order to live and apparently leave . Last but not least, the players in the TV show fight each other in order to take the limited amount of sources that is the trophy but in the movie the players fight against the death.<br/><br/>To sum up with, I think that this movie has symbols that could make the viewer feel that he/she needs to make something considerably difficult in order to make his/her living.These symbols are shown in a softer version in the TV show."
"a_chinn","7","0","1","18 June 2017"," First Saw is a smart horror/thriller. Sequels just torture porn.
","The quality of this series seriously declined as time went on, but this first film really does stand apart as being smarter and not simply a torture porn gore-fest. Similar to ""The Cube,"" this film has a can't resist premise of two men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) waking up in a dank disgusting basement, chained to the wall, with a dead body between them, and no idea how they got there or how to get out. This film, unlike the others, unfolds much more like a mystery, as the two men flashback to the events leading up to their imprisonment, while at the same time a team of police detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are hot on the trail of the madman who put them there. Even without the elaborate head-smashing traps and terrible choices, this would have been an exciting thriller. In some ways, the sensationalistic traps and terrible choices detract from the film, although I think it was those elements that really hooked audiences (that was the focus the the film's marketing at the time), but this entire film could have worked fine without that. However, the sequels seemed to almost exclusively focus on those extreme elements and the mystery and thriller elements took a backseat, which is why the subsequent films are nowhere as good as the first. This first film also stands out because it has a stronger cast than any of the sequels, which also includes Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Although this film is clearly going to be repellent for most audiences, it's undeniably compelling if you are a horror fan and can stomach the many stomach churning moments in the film. Overall, this film isn't a classic, but it is something of a cultural touchstone for when torture porn had it's short lived and ignominious run (""Hostel"" is still the best American film of this disreputable genre)."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","2","10 December 2016"," Something to make even the most jaded horror fan squirm
","Youthful director James Wan must have watched David Fincher's SEVEN about ten or twelve times to get the inspiration for this grotty, unpleasant and deeply unsettling horror film, which is definitely aimed at a teenage crowd. The plot itself is outlandish – if not outrageous – as a serial killer goes around murdering people in variously unpleasant ways. Another inspiration for the film are the films of Dario Argento, with a scene from SUSPIRIA – in which a woman is trapped in a room full of razor wire – repeated with the only change being in the gender of the victim.<br/><br/>Basically this is a film which focuses on sadism, with the plot just getting in the way. Every cliché in the book is on show here, with lots of scenes where you just want to tell the dumb detectives to shoot the killer and get on with it. The ending has two or three twists and is quite clever, in a contrived kind of way. The movie looks pale and washed out and watching it is definitely a depressing experience.<br/><br/>The good part of the film is a two-hander set in a run-down bathroom. If they had excluded the rest of the contrived police investigation and unpleasant murders (including THE BLOB's Shawnee Smith as a victim who nearly loses her jaw!) it would have made for a much tighter, more exciting film. Cary Elwes is fine, but kudos to Leigh Whannell who delivers the most intense performance in the film. Danny Glover also pops up as a tired detective and you have to ask whether he's getting ""too old for this""! Still, as gruesome serial killer thrillers go, SAW delivers the goods, with something here to make even the most jaded horror fan squirm."
"mistoppi","8","0","2","26 April 2016"," More like a thriller than gore horror
","The idea I've had of the Saw movies has been that they are mostly senseless stodge, gore done for no other purpose but score, and especially I've been very doubtful because of the several sequels. Even gore movies should be done with some other purpose than money. I can't yet say if I'm wrong or right: I've only seen the first, and considering the director (and writers) seem to be different in the others, the first one might still be way better than the others.<br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised by the plot - no matter how weird the choice of words may seem. The plot was extremely intriguing in a way, but it could've been much simpler - and that way more effective. What if we'd lose most of the flashbacks in the film, so for the most part it would be just the two men in the room, talking to each other, until the crucial point something else is revealed? That's what I thought during the film, but now that I've seen it I can see how important the flashbacks were, but before the end they just felt unnecessary way to make the film longer. But everything did wrap up nicely. <br/><br/>Still the plot is quite simple. I mean is there anything unnecessary in it? There's not too much violence, and the film is about 1,5 hours. The plot is so much closer to thriller mystery than gore horror. That's something I won't expect from the sequels, if I ever end up watching them. I think they might be overplaying the gore parts and downplaying the mysteries - but what we already found out in definitely why the mystery in the sequels would be ruined. But still, I can't say yet. This is just my speculation.<br/><br/>The cinematography bothered me the most. It seemed tacky and bad, and the sped up effects seemed just ridiculously stupid. Sure, the way this film was shot gave it a certain atmosphere, but it was quite annoying to look at.<br/><br/>Saw was a great movie, which I'd prefer to call thriller than horror. I'm still surprised how it isn't as violent as everyone always said it was. It's simple yet it surprises you. Saw is an amazing film, and I didn't think I'd like it, but here I am."

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","6","0","2","22 July 2015"," Somewhat disappointing but still enjoyable enough
","Finding themselves trapped in a room together, two men are at the mercy of a sadistic killer intent on infusing lessons into his traps and must solve the deadly game while attempting to stay alive for a detective to save them.<br/><br/>While initially this appears quite enjoyable, there's a few rather alarming flaws here with this one. The biggest issue with the film is the fact that there's really nothing here that can make the killer all that imposing for the simple extrapolation of this one's most ingenious part, that he never physically lays a hand on the victims. There's never a time here where he manages to actually cause harm to people, only by setting up the scenarios the victims are put into so that they make a choice to carry through the entirety of the sequence in order to escape. It's impossible to do anything but get worked over by the goriness of those traps, and the fact that there's not a whole lot of them means that the killer is so rarely seen in here there's little that can be don generated from this other than ingenuity and creativeness which has little to nothing to do with him. Likewise, the issue of finding the rationale for imprisoning them under his own misguided morality and sense of justice never makes any sense, for his guise of taking others and forcing them into life-or-death traps makes for incredibly twisted logic that doesn't have anything remotely close to teaching people lessons and more with him simply being a raving lunatic with people placed inside grisly traps that eventually results in their deaths. Beyond these issues, though, this one is somewhat enjoyable for what it manages to do with a very simple storyline. Taking two people trapped in a room, with no way to connect to the outside world, and have an hour and a half to resolve a series of clues and scenarios to escape is quite impressive by being able to wrap an entertaining story around that premise. That stays pretty consistent here with the way this unfurls, with them coming together quite nicely to keep this one really enjoyable as it builds throughout here that give off a really grisly set-up. That this is set-up with the flashbacks throughout here to the other traps makes for quite a fun time as the traps that were set by Jigsaw are extremely clever, from a maze of barbed wire to running through a candle-lit room covered in flammable material is very creative. The side-plot of the detectives hunting him down is also rather enjoyable getting in some solid mystery angles and set-ups leading into the final half, which throws one of the greatest twists around that fits the story incredibly well, is nearly impossible to predict and comes off marvelously. These here make this one worthwhile.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and children in jeopardy."
"rjsf96","8","0","3","6 April 2015"," ""I Want To Play A Game""
","In 'SAW' a twisted killer makes up his own games for people whom he believes do not appreciate their lives. The mysterious Adam and strange Doctor Gordon must work together, if they are to escape a test of their own, before their time expires.<br/><br/>'SAW' is a franchise that has had its day. The sequels failed to understand what the original did effectively. This was the lack or somewhat lack of gore, as opposed to the sequels that rely on gore for shock value. It instead goes for a mysterious thriller vibe, with an effective villain, you can even understand his reasons for doing what he does. Not that that entitles him to do the acts of violence he commits, just he makes some sense, even if his methods are questionable at best.<br/><br/>The first 'SAW' is by far the most original of the bunch and offers scares and creepiness as well as being the only one that is really worth watching. Think of it as 'Se7en' turned up to 11. This is both good and bad. It allows for more gory detail, but has less character nuances. It still provides however, some great thrills without the use of jump scares. Ignore the sequels and stick to the unrelenting original, as they are with a few exceptions, poorly made. In the first instalment there is gore, but not an overwhelming amount. What impresses most is the acting for this genre which is good, when one considers the meagre budget of a million dollars spent on the film. The music is not cheap and is the one thing you cannot fault the film for, whether you love it or hate it. I consider myself in the former camp. Although the film is not flawless, as some of the events are a little far-fetched, at least you can never guess the many twists and turns along the way! The ending will leave you mesmerized.<br/><br/>It is a testament to the original and how much I value it as a horror film, that I will re watch it on a regular basis, regardless of whether it is Halloween or not; whilst this is no 'The Thing' or 'The Shining', 'SAW' achieves what it sets out to do, in the best possible way, without an over reliance on bland characters, cheap scares or boring villains. It was never going to be a masterpiece, but 'SAW' can claim to be one of the most effective and original Horrors of the 2000s. The fact that it can still bring in new audiences to this day, speaks volumes about how frightening the first one really is.<br/><br/>So settle in for a great little horror, which unfortunately gave birth to a franchise. Maybe it should stay dead, like Jigsaw's many victims. Just pretend the first instalment is the only one in existence, which is how I manage to sleep at night."
"noxeniv","7","0","2","31 March 2015"," It's unique in its own right
","Let me just say that this is the best one in the series. The movies past the third installment are more so about the blood and gore. However, the first one was always about the purpose of Jigsaw and why he does what he does. It also sort of emphasizes human emotion when placed in a situation such as the characters in the film. It's a sort of unique film, and because of this I recommend giving it a watch. Also it may not scare you as it most likely will give you a chill or just make you cringe at the thought of you being forced to play a game with Jigsaw. If you like that kind of thrill then I'd say watch this, including the rest of them. If you're looking for a great story then this isn't really the movie to watch. The message it portrays is interesting and gets to you, but the story itself could be much better."
"bh_tafe3","7","0","2","19 March 2015"," Let's travel back in time
","It's 2004. We've just seen off three great horror franchises in the space of a few years with Scream wrapping up (until it didn't) and Freddy vs Jason bringing an end to both the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street film series'. Stepping into that vacuum come two Australians: Director James Whan and writer/ actor Leigh Wannell armed with an idea.<br/><br/>Two men, Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes), and Adam (Leigh Whannell) awake on opposite sides of a room, chained by the leg to pipes, with a dead body in the middle. Gordon plays a tape saying someone has his family and telling him he has one day to kill Adam and he can leave and his family will be safe.<br/><br/>Gordon quickly works out that they are playing a game set by a serial killer given the name Jigsaw by the press, who tries to teach people life lessons by putting them in situation they will more than likely die in. We are asked to buy into the idea that Jigsaw ""never killed anybody."" Well sorry to rain on your parade, but if you recklessly endanger someone's life or show depraved indifference, yep you're a murderer. And the rules are hardly consistent. For instance one woman survives a trap by stabbing a man to death and cutting out one of his organs to retrieve a key. Wonder what his game was supposed to be? ""If you're hearing this it's because a girl's head just exploded when she decided not to stab you to death and mutilate your lifeless body. Now we're going to play a game...."" When some traps have multiple people all with an opportunity to survive and others are ""Kill or die"" you can make no claims to fairness. Jigsaw being a killer who doesn't kill is an interesting idea, but doesn't quite work, both because the writers are not consistent with what Jigsaw is about and because he is clearly a murderer.<br/><br/>Anyway, Danny Glover plays a grizzled cop who believes Goodman is Jigsaw. He lost a partner to this killer and will stop at nothing to find and stop Jigsaw. The script effectively takes us back and forth between the two guys in a room and the crazy cop. This would become the structure of each of the seven Saw films, focusing on one elaborate trap involving multiple people and a police investigation. At least in this one these two plots are connected, which is not the case in some of the later films. In the meantime, Goodman and Adam sit in the cell trying to work out how they both got into this mess and how they are going to get out.<br/><br/>We see one of the worst and unconvincing car chase scenes ever put to film, we see holes in the plot the size of Texas, and we see Gordon saw his leg off (maybe that's why it's called Saw?). At the very end we get the ""twist"" that Jigsaw is what we thought was a dead body in the middle of the room. The key to the chains holding Adam was in the bathtub he woke up in at the start, and has been lost down the drain. Meaning that his lesson was to not freak out and get up when he wakes up in a bath with a chain on his leg. Game Over, Jigsaw says as he slams the door shut, leaving Adam in there to starve to death. This succeeds in being surprising, but fails in being another ""game"" with no point and no way of winning and also in being absolutely ridiculous. <br/><br/>Saw is an entertaining little film, that requires the viewer to not ask questions, perpetually suspend their disbelief and just go with it. The veterans give disappointing performances, particularly Elwes, and Whannell is clearly a better writer than actor. The effects are cheap, but only the car chase is laughable. Saw was a unique and original film that grew first into a passable trilogy and then into a seven film orgy of torture porn and stupidity. In many ways, this one deserves to be separated from the rest of the series. Saw, at least, can stand as a decent film on its own based on a unique, if flawed, idea and you don't need the later chapters to appreciate it."

The blood and guts are not nearly as bad as one would think, so don't be put off by the media hype surrounding the movie. There are just enough twists and turns to keep one interested, but not so many that it's hard to follow. JUST when you think you know who the killer is, it twists again.

So I decided today to give it another look to see if it still had its bite. For the most part, it did. Though made for just $1.2 million, you could swear it was made for a lot more money - its look is utterly convincing. More importantly, it has the right feel and tone - it's bleak, horrific, graphic, and other adjectives that the best horror movies have.<br/><br/>Though the movie is definitely good, it could have been made to be even better. There are several sequences (mostly in the first half of the movie) where the movie exits the washroom and shows flashbacks to what happened to the characters earlier. In these parts of the movie, the horrific spell is temporarily broken and the movie goes through the motions until returning to the washroom. I wonder what the movie would be like if it had been set entirely in the washroom. Maybe better. Another problem with the movie is that there are two or three points where the direction gets extremely flashy and flamboyant, again breaking the movie's disturbing tone. Fortunately, these parts don't last very long. While all these problems are why I don't think the movie is a modern horror classic, I will say that despite these problems, the movie gets close to that desired status."

","SAW is one of my favorite films of 2005 and has an absolutely great story which goes well with some decent acting (although the acting can be pretty bad at times). As i was saying earlier probably the main reason i likr this film so much is because of it's amazing story. The other thing you have to watch in this film is the ending which is one of the best a horror film has ever has, i wont tell you what happens besause it will spoil it but it really will stick with you! This film isn't really violent but very sadistic at times. The killer in this film doesn't really kill people, he tests them and finds ways of making them kill them-selves because he doesn't like the way people live their lives, he thinks the gift of life isn't something you should waste! (or in short he is completely and totally mad!) This is a great film that any horror fan with a PSP should get!"

"brianberta","7","0","1","18 February 2015"," One of the best horror movies of the 2000's
","The sequels weren't that good but in my opinion, this is one of the better horror movies of the 2000's. As the film continues on, it gets more tense and the different traps make more tension. As soon as it starts, Adam and Dr. Lawrence start recalling incidents so they can figure out what happened to them and who put them there. It's a great look into human survival and it covers the depths of insanity as they start to turn on each other. I know it's excessively gory at some parts so this is not for everyone but most horror fans would probably like it. Also, at the final 5 minutes, its twist ending will knock you cold. Accompanied, by the epic score, your heart will be racing beyond belief. I'm not going to spoil the ending because it must be witnessed start to finish to be fully appreciated. But, thinking about the true nature of it, makes it more terrifying. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one but if you want an epic, gore-filled, tense story about survival then you'll likely enjoy this one as long as you can get past the gore."
"rehor-masarova","8","0","1","16 February 2015"," One of the best movies ever made.
","The first Saw movie is in my opinion the best one mainly because there is one main trap and then like two or three other ones and because you don't know what to expect in the other ones it's much more brutal and there is one main character that just never dies,sometimes only at the end but this was very different then the other movies from saw. At the beginning you don't now anything and it actually explains it in the movie and it's not like the character just says that while camera is dramatically zoomed on his face no nothing like that,it shows how it was happening how he was reacting to things. This is not a horror movie well only at some parts but it's not scary,there aren't any ghosts or something but it was actually scary in some parts like really and it was so well done the camera was beautiful even though at some parts it looked like it was very cheesy,which is obvious because the movie had only 1 million budget but after all it is totally fantastic movie.One of my favorites."

","Saw. The cult gory thriller from James Wan is a pioneer among movies which rely on gory visuals while creating suspense or tension. It is damn good fun while it lasts.<br/><br/>The strength of Saw lies in its twists and turns that keep you hooked throughout and imaginative uniqueness of execution from James Wan. Pacing is fast, color tone mostly black and white, characters are twisted, acting overall good enough and length perfectly short of less than 2 hours. If you are seeing it first time, it has enough to startle you but given the disturbing images you might not like it to revisit. <br/><br/>I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for Saw. It is something special in horror genre but only for those who do not mind their cinema dark, twisted and disturbing."
"grantss","6","0","2","12 July 2014"," Better than expected
","Better than I expected. Expected it to be mostly gratuitous, sadistic, pointless violence. Has that, but also has a fair amount of intrigue and suspense.<br/><br/>The movie builds well, from the initial confusing, no-explanations- given, scene. Information is fed in in fragments. Even once the full picture is revealed, there are still a few good twists and blindsides.<br/><br/>Last few scenes are incredibly suspenseful, with no clear conclusion.<br/><br/>The amount of violence and gore does detract from this however. It is often gratuitous.<br/><br/>Overall, a watchable movie, with a decent plot. It is the subsequent sequels that turned it into 100% gratuitous sadistic violence. Trust Hollywood to ruin a decent movie by making heaps of mindless sequels."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","23 June 2014"," ""I Wanna Play A Game""
","Incorrectly labeled by many as the film that commenced the 'torture porn' phenomenon, Saw is director James Wan's debut feature which beautifully exhibits his instant grip & comfort with the elements of the genre this picture belongs to. And even though its strong cult following spawned a series that bathed in gruesome torture, this 1st chapter of the Saw franchise is undoubtedly the most compact, story-driven movie that works as an exciting, effective & shocking horror mystery full of twists & turns.<br/><br/>Filmed on a modest budget & shot mostly in a single location, the story of Saw revolves around 2 men who wake up chained in a dilapidated bathroom with a dead body in between them & are given instructions via a micro-cassette recorder explaining how to escape. With limited time in their hands, both men try to figure out why they were chosen for this scenario while in the meantime, police detectives try to uncover the identity of the mastermind behind these ""games"" by looking for clues in several other similar incidents.<br/><br/>The direction by James Wan is excellent considering the eerie vibe he was able to generate along with its unpredictability & cleverly executed twists. The script may lack a chunk of flesh when it comes to characterization but it still keeps the story far more believable than its successors. The rest of its technical aspects are finely carried out, the performances by its cast is quite amateur but Charlie Clouser's score is a definite plus here as it keeps elevating the tension throughout its runtime & is at its best during the final moments.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that it leaves many events unresolved in the end, which are dealt in its sequels, Saw somehow still manages to work as a standalone feature to a great extent & is skilfully crafted by director James Wan & screenwriter Leigh Wannell. On an overall scale, this independent horror certainly isn't the torture porn you might be expecting for it's a solidly structured, nicely assembled & violently narrated cinema that'll have you guessing from its opening moments & deserves to be seen by every horror fan out there.<br/><br/>P.S. If the violence in this film turns out to be too much for you, then in all seriousness... stay away from its sequels. Those installments are strictly reserved for hardcore fans of extreme cinema or for any deranged soul looking for new methods to torture his/her boss, spouse, ex or foes."
"videorama-759-859391","8","0","1","13 June 2014"," See Saw
","Of course you can't beat the original, so why can't they leave it alone, instead of adding a chain of sequels. Films like this, whether being Hostel, Wolf Creek, or even The Hitcher, that 86 road movie masterpiece, how more memorable, desired, or talked about, would those originals be. Here is just another brilliant premise that works beautifully on the screen. I haven't heard screams coming from an audience (this coming fro m a pack of girls) like this in years. Elwes and Whannel pull of great performances, where I consider Elwes one of those great character actors. Here these two strangers awaken in what Whannel, perfectly terms ""a actual shithole"", that being a dungy washroom, where their arms have been chained. They're separated at both ends of this capacious room. As fate would have it, they're here for a reason, to atone or suffer for their sins so to speak. Some brilliant and clever psycho, the introduction of another evil great, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) The story flashes back a lot to establish how our two out of lucksters got here. Elwes, a doctor apparently neglects his family, and is doing a younger Asian inturn as well, where poor pathetic soul Whannel, has been paid to sneak pictures of em', where this history comes into play much later on. So meantime, we have our minds working up a lot of curiosity to why they're here. Inevitably one of the two has to make the big cut, using the saw they've been left with, and yes we have an unavoidable cringing scene, where some blood is shed. In flashback, we see some of Jigsaw's other victims, including a surviving one, (Shawnee Smith) who became a favorite in the next couple of pics, the sequel to this, having her settling a score with a cop, where she's actually thankful to Jigsaw. When viewing his reasons for becoming the monster he is, one can minorly sympathize. Saw is bloody two, and will have you wincing at some scenes, while you have the squeamish, just screaming. Too, as in flashbacks, concerning the victims, it's filmed in a lot of dungy green that works splendidly. Wan and writer Whannel have pulled off some special here, a real horror show, where Bell, though not really seen in this one, has been magnificent as the psycho Jigsaw, while bringing a human depth to him too. My Dad, a hard critic liked Saw, which I couldn't believe. He liked Seven too. If you really want to be scared and truly unnerved, like in nail biting territory, this is the horror pic for you."

","Pretty low-budget and filmed in just a few days, James Wan's controversial debut ""Saw"" quickly grew out to be one of the more successful horror franchises of the 21st century, even though all its sequels, with no exceptions, are dread-awful, uninspired gorefests, whereas the original actually has a lot of suspense going on for it next to all the creative torture. The twist at the end (the reveal of Jigsaw's identity)'s quality is debatable, but I found myself very intrigued and satisfied by it. Doesn't make it the big leagues (Hitchcock!

"HandHStudios","8","0","1","12 September 2013"," Saw Left A Bad Taste In My Mouth... But That's the Point of It!
","Saw is the perfect movie for hardcore horror fans who want to see a good gory film, because Saw has more gore than a pig slaughterhouse. Seriously, I mean there's always someone bleeding profusely at some point of this film! Yet another reason fans of the genre will be enamored with Saw.<br/><br/>Besides surpassing the average genre fare, Saw is intelligent. Unlike the usual slasher or gory pic, Saw's story is, for the most part, logically sound, although I put ""logically"" very lightly. Obviously, it's not every day you wake up in a dirty abandoned bathroom chained to a pipe! For what the film was, it made relative sense. At least, it made more sense than most of the other horror flicks I've seen. The story was engaging, and very compelling. There were a few gaps in logic and minor plot holes, but that's pretty standard for any horror movie. The real logical person in that situation would either find a way out in the first 5 minutes or give up and find a way to kill themselves. But a 5 minute movie where the main character dies in the first 5 minutes wouldn't sell at the box office, would it? So the filmmakers have to suspend logic in some places to move the story along, something most critics don't understand. That doesn't make the movie bad, because believe me, if the mentioned critic saw the ""5-minute Saw"" I talked about before, he/she wouldn't complain about the real film at all.<br/><br/>Moreover, Saw actually had pretty decent acting. The characters were well-rounded, and this movie was a good kick-starter for the career of Leigh Whannell. Cary Elwes, who I've seen in Twister, Princess Bride, and Robin Hood: Men In Tights, turned his usual goofy character into a serious, dramatic role as Doctor Lawrence Gordon. Desperateness loomed in his eyes the whole film, as he had no idea what was to happen to his wife and child being held captive by an unknown man he thinks is ""The Jigsaw Killer"". Danny Glover, who almost always dies in a movie, (It seems he's almost surpassed Leonardo DiCaprio in movie deaths!) takes on a detective role as Detective Tapp, obsessed with finding the Jigsaw Killer after Jigsaw kills Tapp's partner, played by Ken Leung. <br/><br/>This film was a good watch, especially if you like horror films, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. But that was the point!<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 7.7/10"

","Saw is now nine years old and six sequels have already been made. I still felt like this was a movie worth reviewing in spite of the fact that most horror fans will have watched it a long time ago, since the Saw series are arguably the most successful films within the horror genre.<br/><br/>Having barely finished film school, James Wan and Leigh Whannell created Saw, a gory budget horror movie that would turn into a massive success.<br/><br/>One of the things Saw truly succeeds in is telling its story, its starts as a big puzzle which is pieced together brick by brick as the movie progresses. The story is generally very unpredictable and though the acting is not exactly amazing, the characters are very believable.<br/><br/>Saw also made a new standard for how gore can be used in horrors. While in the first saw movies, the characters are not exposed to THAT much gore and bloodiness you will still be turning your head away or burying it deep into your covers. This is because you actually see most of what is happening. In your usual horror movies, you will see the actors split-seconds before they are about to get hurt, then get cut away to them lying in a pool of blood. In Saw you are showing everything. This includes watching a man cut off his own leg.<br/><br/>With an amazing story, very decent acting, great directing and a no-less than beautiful soundtrack Saw deserves all the credit it has gotten, and is much more than a piece of torture-porn as some critics has deemed it."
"Normanholic","9","0","1","2 August 2013"," Horror movie with a moral
","Going into Saw, most people expect it to be a gory slasher flick, but coming out of Saw, people realize that it's a story with a meaning, a moral if you will. Saw is the story of two men trapped in an old rundown bathroom together, handcuffed (well, technically It's their feet) to pipes in the bathroom. As the story moves along we learn more and more about these two men and who put them there and why. This film is definitely one of my favorite horror movies. What makes this movie work so well is that it's not about the blood and the gore, (though it does have it's fair share of that), It's truly about the story, and a movie without a good story is no movie at all. Thankfully, this movie delivers with a powerful script. The script is amazing, Leigh Whannell took 9 months to write it and those 9 months paid off BIG TIME. The acting is also great. Leigh Whannell doing double duty by writing the script and being one of the leads. The editing is very quick due to lack of footage, but it works in my opinion. It doesn't look sloppy. The score is also wonderful. The main theme is brilliant. The entire song has an eerie feel and in a way you feel stressed out, which is a good thing! The climax of it is amazing and it fits so well with the ending of the movie. The pace of this film is great. You never get bored nor think that it is going too fast. It's going just right. The whole movie has a dark feel and an intensity that I love. It works so well with the story. Ohhh the story, I love the story, I love understanding the meanings and motives of the villain, and what he is trying to say through his actions. Most people take their life for granted, or wish they could die, but forced into these situations they are forced to make a choice, and all of them in the end want to live. And if you are of the lucky few who survive, you are given a new perspective on life. And not that I agree with what the villain is doing, because I don't condone that obviously, I just understand what he is doing and why. So all in all if you are expecting a slasher movie with no story look somewhere else, because you won't find it here. All that is here is a clever and extremely well done horror movie that you will think about for days. Oh, and the twist at the end will leave you speechless.<br/><br/>""Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not any more...""<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

It is frightening and nothing for sensitive people, jam packed with gore, violence and suspenseful scenes from beginning to end. <br/><br/>It does not have a whole lot of character development for David Tapp, which would be my biggest complaint. I get that he was a detective that we are not meant to learn much about, however, I think it would have added so much to the movie if they gave Danny Glover more big moments to shine. <br/><br/>Jigsaw is a brilliant character and will leave your with goosebumps all the way through. The movie's build up is fantastic, I will not spoil what happens for anyone who has not seen it, but once you finally get to it, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>A thrill from beginning to end.

Many film genres were in critical phases in 2004, including horror movies. Saw was THE film that turned the horror genre around. But I feel that Hostel, one year later, is more representative of the horror movies of of the decade. I am not denying the impact this film had, but now it is an odd film because it feels old and not in line with this type of movies anymore. I felt the acting was fake, as well as the make-up. I love horror movies, in fact I watch too much of them, but this film is a classic now and not something that should be watch for shock value like it was 10 years ago."
"Zazwaz","8","0","1","1 June 2013"," Great psycho-horror movie
","Overall the plot is quite solid and there are several very satisfying twists along the way. The dialogue is fairly well written and the characterization is good. The villain's motivation is a little shallow, but remains plausible. Also some of the secondary characters could have used a bit more depth, especially as some of them are more important to the plot than they appear at first glance.<br/><br/>Not much can be said about the acting. The then not so well known actors play the parts convincingly and the drama is believable.<br/><br/>Saw has gained a reputation for being a blood soaked gorefest not for the faint of heart. This reputation may be true for the sequels, but surprisingly the first one is quite harmless. This is really a film in the psycho horror genre, most of the violence is suggested or occurs off screen. The horror is brought on through the power of suggestion and the fact that it is disturbingly realistic.<br/><br/>The direction is well paced and the film carries some serious tension with a few genuine jump moments. This is only enhanced by the cinematography and the editing, both executed in an original way to ensure a very unnerving and twisted viewing experience.<br/><br/>Saw did not have the highest of budgets, but it is one of those films where the lack of production value is compensated by a good script and solid directing. Aside from the odd cheesy or gruesome moments I can definitely recommend this film."

Any detail would spoil the experience which Is 'Saw' for anyone who hasn't seen these movies(where have you been?)suffice It to say that If you like intelligent Psychological horror\suspense then Saw Is a must-see. Note - Leigh Whannel,the actor chained-up with the Doctor and who wrote the original script also stars In the original 9- minute short,also called Saw, which Is an interesting addition as a sort of prequel. Absolutely fantastic and unique - greedy and selfish people,let Saw be a warning to you to change your ways!!!!!!!"

","'Saw' has to be without doubt, one of my favourite films of all time. As an enthusiastic horror fan I'm always on the look out for new and creative ideas to inspire a 'new generation' of horror films; rather than frequent remakes which fall short of- and literally disrespect- 20th century classics. 'Saw' delivered an emphatic ride from start to finish which won't fail to disengage you for a moment. The director's (Leigh Whannel) clever use of green light adds an element of fear in most of the climax scenes which gives the film an excellent sense of authenticity. Although there are 6 more sequels to this film, this is by far the most engaging and most well thought out film, which excels in every way in my opinion, even with it's low budget and very short time-scale when filming. Overall this is a very enjoyable film which will keep you guessing from start to finish, I'm proud to have this in my collection!"

","The first and the best, Saw is bloody great fun. Two guys (Whannel) and the ever great character actor (Elwes) wake up in a decrepit washroom, chained up. Their reasons for being there become evident later as they try to figure an escape. On a mini tape recorder, is a dark, simulated voice we'll come to know as Jigsaw, much like Seven's John Doe, who makes his victims realizes of their actions, where a minute number of survivors appreciate life much more and the rightings of their wrongs. The story goes and forth to how to how they ended up in this mess, where we see some more examples of Jigsaw's work, the different ways their victims die, where they do have choices. Very violent this film is, that really questions censorship in this country, Saw has some uncomfortable moments of violence, but the movie has a lot of suspense and intrigue, plotted brilliantly as a first class horror thriller that rivals the superlative Seven. Elwes, such a great unappreciated character actor here, again doesn't disappoint, as an unfaithful doctor who's wife and daughter, neglected, become hostages in this game of Jigsaw's. We too have that creepy little guy from Person Of Interest as one of Jigsaw's accomplices, bringing a real creepy piece of work here, minding Elwes's family who will die if Elwes doesn't deliver. The most insane of choices has Elwes either shooting Whannel, to get the key to unlock the chain around his ankle or cut his own leg off, and you can pretty much guess from the title, Elwes preferance. Saw too has a great shock ending, and like all the Saw films, not a nice one. Whannel the writer of this, another good performer here, and James Wan have created a horror masterpiece, that will live on in cinema history for at least the next hundred years. One of Jigsaw's surviving victims in this, becomes another of his assistants too. Danny Glover is solid here too as the obsessed detective,while Monica Potter, no not Julia Roberts, is solid as Elwes's wife. For horror ala Seven fans."

","Very clever plot combined with insane characters creates this brilliantly made thriller by James Wan. Beginning one of the longest running horror genres ever, this film truly brought out the horror genre of the 21st century. It brings us a new era of scare that I've never seen before.<br/><br/>Two men, (Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell) wake up in a bathroom, chained by the ankle to pipes on opposite sides, and have no idea how they got there. After finding some clues left by their kidnapper, they discover they've been kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer, a psychopath who doesn't kill, but puts people in booby traps, forcing them to kill themselves. Flashbacks indicate the entire investigation, in which one of them was a suspect, leading all the way to the present.<br/><br/>Filmed in a very creative and clever way, dealing with the crazy and insane mind of film making, using fast forward crazy camera zooms and techniques to make every scene intense as ever. Every scene puts you on edge.<br/><br/>Scary not in a visual way or jumpy way, but a psychological way, dealing with scary ideas that will keep on your mind for a long time. Deals with a different scare that other movies could never carry on, (besides the others).<br/><br/>Can get a little cheesy at times, like some of the acting performances by Leigh Whannell, who may not have been taking this seriously. Some actors act a little goofy, but only when things are calm. As soon as things heat up, no more playing around.<br/><br/>All together, a beautifully filmed thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Hard to not enjoy if you're into being scared the crap out of. Definitely one of the scariest of the decade. Followed by Saw II, and a bunch of other pointless sequels."

","It is understandable that when people think about the Saw franchise now, images appearing as snuff and torture cloud their minds. Speaking from someone who has seen the first, second, and final film of the franchise, I can definitely see where the series began and how differently it ended. To me, it was a film that could've stood perfectly on its own. It never needed a sequel, let alone six, leaching off of its coattails.<br/><br/>After the astonishing success of the first film, grossing over one hundred million at the box office, it almost became a yearly tradition to release a Saw sequel around Halloween. Hollywood had successfully turned Saw, a suspenseful and intriguing psychological thriller, into a shameless, inept cash-in for the season of fright.<br/><br/>At least we have the first film to remind us that this series was once destined for greatness. The film begins with Adam (Whannell), a voyeuristic photographer and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes), an oncologist, awaking in a dilapidated basement to find that they are chained at the ankle to opposite ends of the room, with a bloody corpse in the middle of them. They find that they each have tape-recordings that, when played, reveal the ominous voice of our antagonist. Call him the ""Jigsaw Killer."" He informs them that they have, in some way, taken life for granted and that Dr. Gordon must kill Adam in six hours to be set free.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the film is intercut with scenes of detectives trying to piece together the explicit tracks left by this notorious killer. He is constantly kidnapping people who take life for granted and have it all, but choose to dispose of it in a careless, unorthodox manner. A drug addict woman and a man who enjoys inflicting self-harm on himself are among his victims. Detectives David Tapp (Glover) and Steven Sing (Leung) continue to breathlessly map out his killings and try to figure out where his notorious tapes are being shot. The Jigsaw Killer, himself, is obviously a real person, but is voiced through a creepy puppet with stringy black hair, swirly red cheeks, and always riding on a tricycle.<br/><br/>The film knows how to create atmosphere effectively. Many scenes are unsettling, but I found the most fun to come out of the scenes between Adam and Dr. Gordon. Saw compliments my rule of claustrophobic filmmaking perfectly which is, when you limit characters geographically you must make up for it with dialog and subtleties to properly convey tone and development. Both Elwes and Whannell do great justice to their roles and play them convincingly, and the flashback scenes never seem to derail the film or make it stumble without direction.<br/><br/>I feel some have written off the film as being ""too gory,"" when in reality, Saw doesn't have as much as gore as I remember. It's more of a clever, tricky, psychological thriller perfectly complimented style and dialog. The last five minutes of the film are fabulous, and don't become winded and lazy. It actually becomes quite mysterious, brutal, and above all, intriguing, with the intro to the credits being actually somewhat depressing. This is a well-written horror film, reminding us that PG-13 can't do justice to the genre physically or mentally.<br/><br/>Starring: Leigh Whannell, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, and Tobin Bell. Directed by: James Wan."

","I thank that saw is a great movie at the time when saw came out there was not any good, scary movies, at that time, but I think Saw was one of the goodies, movies, at that time. In the end, the director start making more saw movies, so the and when you see one you want to watch them all. I have seen all of the saw movies I have a collection of the movies. The one I like the most, is the first one because of the beginning of the movie, there are three people in a bandanna warehouse their do not have a clue what is going on. They are trying to figure out why there is a man bleeding to death in the middle of the floor. The then a tape play began to play and soon they will find out why they are they are. The Filmmaker James Wan, this psychological thriller beginning the first screenplay by actor Leigh Whannell, who also stars. Whannell plays Adam, one of two men chain up in a mysterious chamber. Jointly, Adam and Dr. Gordon try to piece in concert what has happened to them and who the aggressive madman in the back their imprisonment is. As well starring Danny Glover and Monica Potter, Saw premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi. So jigsaw gave the doctor an automated. He has instilled six o'clock two kill the man in the room was him and if he does not kill you jigsaw will kill his wife and child. Man in the room with him. I think was a very good act or the time he had in the movie. Donny Glover was a police officer He was looking for the man who is killing the people. So you did not stop looking for jigsaw but jigsaw was not easy to get to so the hunt was on to kill jigsaw budget saw gave the police a run for their money. Eventually jig saw you two of the main police officers and Danny Glover was one of them. Meanwhile, the man in the room had to cut off his to escape from the chains that is exactly what he did he did not die because he was a doctor so he knew what to do to survive. So if I had to say anything about saw it is very graphic for little to you to watch, but overall I think the saw collection are very good movies."

I do have trouble sometimes with keeping up with the plot, trying to understand what characters say. what's going on, and then i have to watch the movie again to figure out what is going on. I do think that this is all about the torture traps, I don't see how these traps can truly help a person with their problems, but i care so much about the victim, I just want to see what happens to him/her.

"david-gouldthorpe","10","0","1","24 March 2012"," Disturbing and brilliant. Far superior to its sequels.
","""Saw"" has set a new standard for the horror and thriller genres. The shining centerpieces of this movie are its story and its antagonist. The plot line of this film extends far beyond the horror movies of this time, like ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring"". The beginning mirrors the character's problem. He wakes up in a room and has absolutely no idea what is going on. We, the audience, see him almost drown in a bathtub and start wondering, ""Whoa, what is happening?"" From this, the plot delves into a downright sinuous and insidious story. This movie does well in its story because it does not rely on a lot of cheap jump scares. Instead, the scare scenes in this movie actually are horrifically macabre. Of course, any good story relies on it's antagonist for drive. And Jigsaw provides a truly terrifying antagonist, because he's the kind of villain who is just insane enough to believe in his actions' virtue, and yet composed and intelligent enough to actually pull them off. And then, in the last third of the movie or so, the story takes a series of unprecedented turns, each building on and outdoing the last until, at last, it all culminates in one huge twist that surely left Shyamalan burning with envy! Add in one well-composed soundtrack that feeds off of and emphasizes the gradually increasing terror, and you have a must-see for any thriller movie fan! Don't let the poorly made sequels set you off. See the original by any means!"

","People asked me why didn't you review Saw when it came out. Simply, back then, seven years ago, you had to wait almost a year for the DVD release. When it came out part 2 was already at the cinemas. So I had to wait until they finished the franchise which was last year. But then again, it wasn't that simple to know what DVD or Blu Ray to pick up, because some were bloody versions or uncut or directors cut. All versions I have are the longest versions, I do have the German collector editions on Kinowelt, they are all uncut. <br/><br/>It was my wife who came home one evening, she had won a screening, from the cinema and told me, I just have seen Saw, this is for you babe. And indeed, it became one of my 'things'. <br/><br/>What did it for me is the storyline. There are so many twists that you just couldn't see coming. It was based on James Wan's short of 9 minutes called, sigh, Saw. He directed it, Leigh Whannell wrote it in 2003. With that short they went out to hunt a production team who wanted to make it a full feature. Nobody really believed in it but they were so wrong, the merchandise and the franchise it created was beyond limits. Leigh Whannell also played as David in the short and appeared as Adam in the full feature. <br/><br/>What attracted me was that it was in fact just a simple police story with the focus on two victims of a serial killer. But what you couldn't see coming was that it contained a bit of real squeamish parts. The red stuff do flows and it is just on the border of gore. Due the fact that there were some really messy parts it created a new genre called Torture Porn, one year later Hostel was released and was gory as hell, with a bit of the same story, torturing for fun. The end of Saw is the strongest ending I have seen so far because what happens isn't predictable at all, and due that people start talking about Saw as they did about the reversed bear trap. The focus here wasn't really on Jigsaw, the serial killer. He was involved but wasn't the main concern of the coppers. But viewers were tricked by the writer of saw. <br/><br/>The acting itself was really sublime especially by the victims Cary Elwes. It's also weird that most of the original actors didn't came back in the other parts, only in flashbacks. But naturally it's Jigsaw that steels the show, what Tobin Bell did was really creating a new hero for the horror geeks. This is his best role ever for me. <br/><br/>Is it me or my imagination but I clearly saw some winks to the genre. When the so-called boogeyman appears in the closet just look how they filmed him, you just saw his eye in the closet, Black Christmas 1974 indeed. And at the end the closing of the metal door, Texas Chainsaw Massacre indeed. This is a must see for horror fans or people who liked a good police story like Seven or In Dreams. <br/><br/>Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5"

","Forget about the never-ending stream of sequels - I suppose that if you like the horror genre which involves people being mutilated and killed by increasingly involved methods of extravagant complexity, then the sequels may very well be just what you're looking for - because the first is a true original.<br/><br/>It is also a wonderful example of the fact that you don't need to throw oodles of cash at a movie to make it a good one - the cast list which you see is entirely illusory, because this film is pretty much a two hander in a single claustrophobic set. Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell are chained to pipes in a disused basement bathroom, with a single hacksaw. There is a time limit which precludes sawing through the chain/s. The only way one of them will survive is by sawing a foot off.<br/><br/>This is such a simple scenario that you wouldn't think it was capable of subtlety and complexity. Yet the brilliant script by Whannell and director James Wan twists and turns all over the place.<br/><br/>I say, not for the first time (and, no doubt, not for the last), that a good film requires a good script, and this is one of the very best."

","I'm a little late in hopping on the Saw franchise train considering there's somewhere around fifty other Saw movies out now but hey, better late than never. And now that I've finally seen this twisted little flick I can say that I'm glad, because it's not a particularly terrible movie. It isn't great but it is slightly better than your middle of the road horror flick. Saw opens up to two men who wake up in a disgusting old bathroom, each of them chained to pipes with a dead body in between them. They quickly find out that they are part of a twisted game of life and death being orchestrated by the serial killer named Jigsaw. The two men must find a way to escape this evil trap before going insane and killing each other, or even themselves. Saw is a sadistic, cruel, and evil film, but it surprisingly has a little more to offer than the average serial killer flick.<br/><br/>The idea behind the way Jigsaw kills people and the way he chooses his victims is the entire point of the Saw franchise. The idea behind it is that Jigsaw picks his victims by determining who needs to suffer. He chooses people who have done terrible things in their lives and who he feels no longer deserves to live. Through his torturous and somewhat symbolic punishments he causes his victims to suffer to the point of death or they will survive and, as Jigsaw puts it, appreciate life much more. These are ideas we've seen stressed in film and literature before, but never quite to this level of violent sadism. This seems to be that defining aspect which sets Saw apart from other films which fall into the subgenre of ""torture porn."" Unfortunately, these ideas and motifs could have been articulated a little better than what Saw accomplishes. The problems with this film stem from the writing and acting. It has a great story; one that keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times, never knowing for sure where the film is going. However, the dialogue leaves something to be desired. It is terribly cheesy at times and a lot of the banter between characters is absurd and sickeningly unrealistic. The melancholy melodramatic delivery of this dialogue from the actors doesn't help either. It is also a fairly shallow movie when it comes to characters. It thinks it is much more profound than it is. It wants to be a horror film that psychologically transcends the genre, but it most certainly is not. It is nothing more than an entertaining story with a fun and interesting idea. If Saw had toned back some of the silliness and absurdity it would have been a much better film.<br/><br/>I commend Saw for its themes, its story, and its fantastically unexpected twist ending that wrapped up the film in an extremely satisfying way. But I have to call it out on its many flaws that keep it from being a great film. If you can stomach the gore it is certainly a horror film worth seeing, but don't expect something that will revolutionize the horror genre."

","Oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and photographer Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a derelict bathroom with no idea of how they got there; they are the latest victims of the serial killer known as Jigsaw, who carries out elaborate and sadistic 'games' in order to teach people to appreciate life.<br/><br/>With six unnecessary sequels over the last seven years, I had forgotten just how original and innovative the first Saw film was; what a pleasant surprise then to find that, instead of struggling manfully through my first repeat viewing since 2004, the time whistled by, with the movie feeling as fresh, suspenseful and as twisted as it had the first time.<br/><br/>When analysed, the plot is admittedly extremely far-fetched—Jigsaw's games, which rely on his victims doing precisely as predicted, could not possibly go off without a hitch—but James Wan doesn't let that faze him and directs Leigh Whannell's convoluted script with enough style, energy and confidence to make it easy to turn a blind eye to the sheer preposterousness of proceedings. Although the film relies heavily on suggestion rather than outright gore, Wan still manages to make this a very unsettling experience, ensuring it as one to miss for the faint of heart but a gruesome treat for those who love their horror gritty and raw.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

"cuppa_tetleys","7","0","1","17 April 2011"," A strange film, one that switches from being brilliant to being unbearable
","I had low expectations going in to this film - a franchise that spans over 3 films is something I'm always wary of, especially when each film is essentially going through the same motions. It started out great; two people in a room who have no idea who each other are or how they got there making for an extremely engaging first act. They have been placed there by a murderer who places people in situations where they have to escape from precarious circumstances or die. Flashbacks give us more information on each character and it assumes that kind of format of switching from outside the room and inside. <br/><br/>If I'm going to praise anything, it's the plot - specifically when involving the murders and how they challenge their victims, those are genius. Otherwise the plot is kind of average; there are brilliant twists and turns you don't expect, but the rest of them of a bit stupid. You can tell it was written by two people because the quality of writing soars and then dives in alternating scenes; some sequences are fascinating and well thought out, but others that focus on the characters are horrifically unrealistic and far-fetched and it detracts from the experience. Generally though, the writing is OK; when talking about the murderer it's excellent, but the writers clearly know little about character building - as they spurt clichés and illogically change emotions. This may account for the films biggest problem, the acting.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I've seen a popular title with such terrible acting - and it only declines as the narrative progresses. Some scenes are unbearable to watch because of the terrible delivery, especially characters become emotional and frantic, as they just start mimicking what they've seen in cartoons. In one scene, a character is shown pretending to die and I honestly thought it was a joke at first. Normally I would've laughed, but I was enjoying the film so much up to that point, that I was just disappointed. So don't watch this after something like 'The Social Network'.<br/><br/>About 5/6 of the way in, the film completely messes things up before finishing brilliantly - it's clear that there were set pieces that were really well thought out, but filling in the gaps turned out to be an exercise in crap. I nearly stopped watching it, it turned into so much of a pantomime, but I was thoroughly rewarded for my perseverance. <br/><br/>Overall, very good directing, turbulent (in terms of quality) story, suspenseful, terrible acting, awful characters and a good ending. However I was all ready to give this film a 9 or a 10 at some points, but then it dropped to about a four.

"jigsaw1993-892-199869","8","0","1","29 March 2011"," A welcome back to Horror films
","Saw (2004) by writer Leigh Whannell, and director James Wan was a fresh, and dark breath of air to a big horror fan like myself. The film starts off with no explanations, but picks up as you go along. Sort of like a forced ride. Cary Elwes makes his semi-come back as the professional Dr. Gordon, who you can't help but suspect through the film. Leigh plays his cell mate Adam, who obviously is hiding something. For reasons unknown, they are held captive to kill one another to escape the game they're forced into. Very cool and eerie premise from the start. The scenes with Danny Glover, and Ken Leung I sort of start to think of Se7en, along with the warehouse Jigsaw chase scene. Jigsaw is played very well, and sounds fantastic on the recorder, and Billy puppet. The music, editing, and the cinematography fits the Gothic feeling of the film quite well. Especially at the very end, you will see what I mean once you see it. The last 10 minutes is pulse pounding, and jaw dropping."

","This film was so creepy and very unusual to me. I mean I know that there are people that are kidnapped to undergo a certain 'game' but there is a chance that a person can die from their 'game'. This film was sick and twisted but I would have never known or seen anything that could become this monster that creates these killing machines or as he calls them 'games'. <br/><br/>The story of this film at first I thought they would drive each other bonkers or something like that. But when the ending came to a close its like you feel that you could hear that man still screaming because not only was the man who made that 'game' but he was causing you to go crazy to save the ones that you knew and loved dearly. <br/><br/>My favorite trap was the reverse bear trap(Amanda's game), the wire room trap, and overall the bathroom 'game'(throughout the film).

"Fmobley2746","8","0","1","7 November 2010"," Saw is filled with non-realistic actions and bad acting on the part of a few actors, but overall it is an excellent joy ride
","So I watched ""Saw"" after seeing the second, third, and fourth one. Anyway, I really enjoyed Saw but like some people have pointed out there are a few unrealistic parts. Thankfully though, the movie is so intense and emotional that most people will not catch on to the unrealistic parts.<br/><br/>UNREALISTIC STUFF: 1) How the crap did Jigsaw pretend he was dead for HOURS!? He pretended to be a dead corpse lying in the middle of the room that the main protagonists were trapped in. Did Jigsaw not breathe at all? Did he not move ONE muscle? Yeah, I would say that that is pretty unrealistic.<br/><br/>2) Jigsaw was in the hospital pretending to be in critical condition. How can he PRETEND to be in critical condition in a hospital and the doctors not even notice? Again, unrealistic.<br/><br/>3) There are also some other things that I must question but I would have to re-watch the movie to be precise about what I say. And by the way, how was that doctor so calm when he first discovered that he was trapped in that room? And why did he not pass out from the pain when sawing off his foot? BAD ACTING: 1) The two men that were trapped in the room were not very good actors. They got the job done but their acting was crappy, especially the actor who played the doctor.<br/><br/>PLOT HOLES?: 1) I saw the following in another person's review and I did not realize it when I watched the film. What it was that the person pointed out was the fact that if Jigsaw injected a man with poison then that should be considered murder. If the man would have not found the antidote (which he did not) he would surely die.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Like I have already said, the film is so emotional and dramatic that it kept me from seeing most of the crap until I thought about it afterwards and had read other people's reviews. I think the basic idea of the film was great and I honestly enjoyed the movie. I rated this film a seven right after watching it, and even though now it may deserve lower I must leave it at what it is."
"hennis-8","8","0","1","29 October 2010"," A New Level of Horror is Reached
","Saw is to the horror industry now the way Halloween was to the horror genre in 1978. Saw revitalized and refreshed a disintegrating film genre. This is one of the most innovative film franchises of modern day. In the first installment of this series we are introduced to Jigsaw, a murderous mastermind set on 'teaching' people the way they are currently living their lives is in fact a waste of life. Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon are caught in the midst of one of Jigsaw's games while detectives Tapp and Sing are trying to track down Jigsaw to bring an end to his maniacal, twisted games. In order to survive Adam and Dr. Gordon must do exactly what Jigsaw has instructed them to do. Their fate is in their own hands.<br/><br/>Although no a technical element per say, the rejuvenation of the horror film is initiated by the writing of this film. The twists and turns that the plot takes as well as the releasing of each character's past really makes the film roll. This is a crime/mystery film at its best; it is just set in a world of horrific wonders waiting around every nook and every corner. Despite the actors faulting every now and then with their performance of certain lines, the film is wonderfully bright in its writing.<br/><br/>The idea of open or closed space is interesting when applying it to this film. Adam and Dr. Gordon are literally in a closed space that is poorly lit and grimy, giving the audience the impression of being trapped. Even when we are allowed out of this makeshift cell, we are still in a closed world as we are not allowed to explore the areas thoroughly. Instead, we are shown only what we are meant to see just as Adam and Dr. Gordon see only what Jigsaw allows them to see and find. This film is great with only a few minor flaws. If you can handle gore then this is the movie for you."

","Saw is a great film for you and some friends to gather round and watch together. I found there was nothing wrong with this film and all the actors was great, the traps were totally brilliant and I think it is also awesome how they spent so much on the equipment. Lionsgate have proved them self to be the best horror makers, I would say most of these films are going to be a classic horror in years to come. What made saw great is how all the characters showed emotions, in some films like this, e.g. Hills have eyes, they faked screams and get killed but in this I think they actually really tried. I do love this film and I would love everyone to view it. The ending is really cool..... Find that out yourself"

","Based on a short film of the same name, Saw is now known as one of the most successful horror movies known to date. The story was very gripping and cleverly written and you couldn't wait to see what Jigsaw had up his sleeve, the characters were brilliant as the movie focused mainly on Lawrence and Adam who were played by the very talented Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell. The acting was brilliant and the cast made you believe their characters and the one scene that stood out to me was Amanda's Reverse Bear Trap with a brilliant performance from Shawnee Smith. The direction was fantastic and the cinematography was brilliant as it kept that eerie feeling that you weren't really safe. The script was cleverly written and the ending was such a surprise and it wasn't obvious which I love in a movie. The special effects were great and it doesn't let up on the blood or gore so if you're squeamish, you might not want to see this.<br/><br/>Saw is one of the best horror movies I have seen for quite a while now and I think that it's brilliant. Everything from the music to the story is a scary thought and it manages to keep the realism that so many horror movies lack. I liked seeing the characters interact and working as a team to try and figure out and escape from the situation they were in. I believe that Saw is a very cleverly written and very gory horror movie with many twists and turns to keep you interested in the movie. Any movie fan who likes either a good story with twists or bloody and gory scare scenes would love this film. Armed with a clever story and script, a few good scares and a great ending, Saw really raises the bar for horror movies out there.

"juancasno","10","0","1","1 October 2010"," It may be my favorite movie, but it still isn't perfect.
","SAW is an example of how most psychological thrillers should be. It plays with you, makes you think you understand the movie, and shocks you at the end. I'm not going to whine about the acting, since it was a low-budget movie. In fact, I never care about the acting: I go for the story itself. This is why I think books are better than movies. Anyways, in SAW, the best character isn't jigsaw himself, but Billy, the puppet. Billy gives the killer an abstract way of being, so you don't know what you're up against. The plot twist at the end was marvellous, but could have been done better. Something like... we didn't see his face. It would have been better if, at the end of the movie, all we thought about Jigsaw was Billy. Also, there were some unnecessary flashbacks that made part of the movie boring: You could either make the movie shorter or add something else, but, by taking off those scenes the movie would certainly be something else.<br/><br/>Summarizing, the movie would have been perfect if Jigsaw's image was abstract by the end of the movie, portrayed by Billy, and the directors wouldn't have put some unnecessary flashbacks. I think the movie could have gone good in any way if you changed the plot completely but kept Jigsaw/Billy, for example, take a group of friends, put them in a house, and make them pass a couple of tests throughout some days (make them even sleep in that house). So the movie's main strength is, obviously, our psychotic killer Jigsaw and his amazing puppet Billy."

","This movie kicks ass. I love the concept of how jigsaw sets up these traps for just ordinary people. And the twist at the end when the dead guy in the middle of the room was alive and he was behind all of it. This is scary stuff. And the cliffhanger of whether Dr. Gordon made it out alive (my opinion, I don't think so). This will mess your head up. And when he cut off his own foot in a fit of obsession and insanity; that sent chills down my back. And I can't wait to watch the other movies; I hear there are like five or six other saw movies.

Could be the most horrifying, enjoyable or most passable excuse you have to keep constantly changing your underwear for the many scares in store. But one thing is certain: watching it alone, at night time, lights off, completely alone isn't wise.<br/><br/>I don't mind blood, heck I even ate spaghetti during Reservoir Dog's infamous torture scene. But when I absolutely, positively have the living daylights scared out me, you know the movie is very, very good.<br/><br/>Two guys in an abandoned bathroom, alone with handcuffs (No it isn't an introduction to gay pornography, this is how the film starts). They have nothing but spooky video tapes and a look to suggest having a hangover isn't fun. They don't even know how they got there, who each other are and well, much about anything else.<br/><br/>Then as the film progresses the story naturally starts to piece together like a jigsaw (See what I did there Saw fans?). And just when you think it's all been neatly put in place another shocker hits you square in the face - not literally I should add, maybe that's what 3D technology should do next? <br/><br/>The first hour-ish of the film is short on explanation which makes it all feel very unnerving and gives it a flavouring similar to David Fincher's Se7en; absolutely no complaints about that.<br/><br/>But Saw is as good scaring as it is, the next plot shocker, making it a must see for any horror fan or the ones who miss checking under their bed for any night terror."

","I wasn't expecting anything from this movie. I rented it almost reluctantly when there was nothing else in the store. One friend even told me that this was just OK, so I was a bit hesitant. In the end, it turned out as a great movie. I liked it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The story is about two guys who wake in an old and very disgusting bathroom. During the movie we see why they end up in there.<br/><br/>This is not a horror movie by any means. It is a suspense thriller. I wasn't scared once during the whole movie, I was amused instead. Some people complained about the lack of scary scenes, but this movie didn't use the same old and cheap tricks to keep the audience in suspense. The plot was brilliant and it was developed in a good way so the viewer might be interested. The script was good as well. Those elements were very well polished, even more than other high budget films.<br/><br/>The acting contributed a lot even if it wasn't perfect. There weren't any super famous actor, and that is exactly what helped this film the most. We were able to relate to the characters because of that. Another good thing I found was its length. I don't particularly love very long movies. This one had the perfect runtime for me.<br/><br/>The negative aspect is that there are many sequels. this should have been the only movie in the whole series, but the greed of its producers, etc. made them ruined this saga (Which should have never been a saga in the first place). I liked this one, so I just ignore the rest (I was excited about the second installment at first though).<br/><br/>To finish my review, I recommend this title. Almost any person might like it. There are some who felt it wasn't plausible though. They complained about certain aspects that weren't totally realistic. This is a movie people, so it shouldn't be too realistic."
"callanvass","10","0","2","29 May 2010"," The original and without a doubt the best. Saw is a magnificent thriller that will get your pulse rate up, but quick!
","Saw may be undervalued to some due to the endless sequels coming out now a days, but the fact remains this one is the best thriller since Se7ven. It wasn't just about gore and torture here, it had a lot of plot to it, a lot of detail and the suspense was liable to push your pulse rate, right past the danger zone. They didn't just throw characters in their, forcing you to hate them because of there unlikable ways, this gave you two characters who have done dirty deeds, but remained likable. It's so surreal that a disturbing concept of having having people trapped in an ugly room became such a huge hit among Horror fans and now there is one out every Halloween, but I really feel the abandoned bathroom one they used here is the best. The finale itself is one of the best I have ever seen in a thriller. I've seen this now officially three times, and each time the suspense is at times unbearable, and it's rare that I feel that way with the genre now a days.<br/><br/>Performances. Cary Elwes is sort of despicable in a way, but somehow he injects likability into his part. His intentions are not admirable, but he obviously cares about his family and I admired that. Leigh Whannell is a bit of a whining weasel as Adam, but he somehow remains likable and sympathetic with his character, which is quite an impressive feat. Tobin Bell's part is nowhere near as big as it would become in the sequels, but it's still felt. Danny Glover gives one of the best performance of his career here. Due to the success of his role as Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon films, a lot of people didn't think he was capable of a gritty cop role, boy did he prove them wrong. Shawnee Smith does fine with what she has to do, but her part isn't as well-known as it would become.<br/><br/>Bottom line. It's the original, it's the best, and it's one of my favorite Thrillers. If you ignore all the hype come Halloween, rent this around Halloween time, it's bound to give you the thrills.<br/><br/>10/10"

Two strangers wake up in a mysterious room (an old toilet block) with chains attached to their feet and hacksaws. The two must work together in order to figure out how to escape this forbidden room. Meanwhile the serial killer known as Jigsaw is being hunted down for putting people into Traps which often lead to fatal consequences.

Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of ""Lost"", and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.<br/><br/>There has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze ""Saw"", injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the ""militarization"" of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a ""military"" setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw's workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators' intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from ""Silence of the Lambs"" to ""Seven"" to ""Saw"" with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock's ""Rope"" offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.<br/><br/>You can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film's writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key's location is revealed. I can't discuss this in a review, but let's just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""Saw"" yet, see it. And see the second film.

","After having rather low expectations for this film, I was pleasantly surprised. I expected a gore-filled, plot less, no-brainer, but I was met with a film with not much blood and quite a deep plot. <br/><br/>The film is about two men, a doctor called Lawrence and a photographer called Adam, being locked in a bathroom with a corpse between them. In order to get out, they have to play a serial killer's, named Jigsaw, game. For Lawrence it is not just his life that is at stake, but also his wife's and daughter's. The film skips from the bathroom, to Lawrence's wife and daughter that have been kidnapped by the same man that placed the in the bathroom, or to the past, showing Adam's and Lawrence's lives before they found themselves captive, and two detectives who are on Jigsaw's case. I didn't expect as many flashbacks, and the main characters' stories to be told. The amounts of gore in this film are rather small, also something that surprised me. When there was gore/violence it was quite clever, and well-made, especially seeing that the film's budget was rather low. This film is not a no-brainer. It involves the audience-it gets you to think about what is happening. Why Adam and Lawrence? Is Lawrence going to do it? Who is the Jigsaw killer?<br/><br/>There isn't much more to say about this film. I don't have much more to add. I highly recommend this. It is quite a complex thriller, and if you have low expectations for it, you are likely to be surprised, just like me. But, on the other hand, if you do want a slasher/gore/violent flick, or an actual horror, I doubt you will like it. Decide for yourself though.

There is a great twist at the end that surprised me, but I thought it could have been a bit better. In terms of ""special effects"" and sets the movie was quite simple,yet so entertaining. The movie is like a puzzle, a mystery, and the scenes of horror and torture are very imaginative, very. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone who enjoys a twist at the end, a puzzle to solve. My opinion on SAW 2,3,4,5,6,7 without even watching them are that they are going to be bad, a movie that continues to number 7, seems like its gone to far and is going to get worse, this is only what I assume, however the first was amazing."

","I was first intrigued by the trailer of this film is why I chose to watch it despite the positive reception it was getting when it first came out. The scenario of a serial killer who plays a game of life and death without getting his hands dirty was amusing and actually quite original. The serial killer got the reputation of being called Jigsaw cause he makes the victims go through a game where blood shed is needed to survive, he is obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, in a deranged and sadistic way after abducting them. So basically he tries to test the fabric of human nature. The main victims of this game is Adam Faulkner-Stanheight(Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes), they have to face different choices in order to survive and depending on the choice, it will decide if one or both of them will survive. This was a good and entertaining horror thriller, that is well worth the audiences time, mainly cause of the creativity and a cool twist that happens near the end. The acting in this movie is not very good, especially Cary Elwes. I think he is better off doing comedies like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" cause his acting is actually quite funny during serious scenes. And while the victims are trying to solve Jigsaw's puzzle, it goes back and forth with a cop played by Danny Glover who is obsessed with tracking Jigsaw down. Despite the films low budget, it will keep the audience intrigued and will keep them guessing, it is a suspenseful film that has thrills and chills.

","Let the games begin. And so they did in the original 'Saw.' Crafty, original, simple and suspenseful this mystery/horror 'Saw' was. The unfortunate biggest flaw was not really the movie itself, but the torn-porn trend Hollywood jumped on and since, produced dozens upon dozens of imitations and far less quality pictures (including 'Saw's own sequels.) Aside from that, I was quite pleased, though disturbed (with the violence and gore) with the concept of a serial killer that doesn't kill. In 'Saw,' two men wake up in the dirtiest of scummy bathrooms, chained and armed with a mission (rules, if you will) to not only put all the pieces together on how to survive, but how to decipher on the reasons behind their imprisonment. Multiple flashbacks and exterior shots, whether presently or in the past, make the viewer actually think for once and try and solve their dilemma as well. I'm simplifying this, it was a great concept, and despite the low budget, excellently made. For those not used to horror, or in the trend previously mentioned: ""torture porn,"" this is not for the squeamish. It's enormously gruesome and hard to watch at times. However, I liked the message, though it was a rough ride to get to it. And the message? Simple: Appreciate life. If one can get past the gore and really listen to what the brains behind the operations – Jigsaw, then you'll get it too. In fact, take this as a lesson and go out to enjoy life now, before something like this happens to you. I'm kidding – I certainly hope this never happens. Years after Freddy, Jason, the 'Scream' ghost, Hannibal, et al, Jigsaw stands amongst them and played beautifully by the actor playing him. (No spoiler on who it is; that's part of the game.)"

","There is a serial killer out there. His name is Jigsaw, and he is possibly the most deadly and cunning primate descendant since Hannibal Lector. <br/><br/>This is how he kills.

This trap could be a cage full of stretched barbed wire, or it could be an explosive helmet strapped to one's head. After setting the trap, he starts the countdown, then sits back and watches his victims try to escape before time runs out and he leaves them to die. In trying to escape, the victims subsequently kill themselves in gruesome ways. Jigsaw there fore does not get a drop of blood on his hands. It is all a game, and horror fans will love it. Well, they already do. <br/><br/>The film is engaging from the beginning, because there is no introduction to the story. The curtain rises on an event which has already begun. In a rusty old bathroom, two men Dr. Lawrence Gordon and Adam Faulker wake up to find them ankle chained to the piping. They have no idea where they are and why, but they soon figure out that they have been kidnapped. The body of a dead man has been dumped in the room, and in his hand is a cassette player on which to play the instructional cassette which their kidnapper has left them. The instructions are for Dr. Gordon. He has until 6:00 to kill Adam, or his wife and child will get it. Gordon must think fast to outsmart the killer who is watching them ready to spill Innocent blood. <br/><br/>Someone recently asked me why these films appeal to so many. Even as a horror fan, I don't find slasher films appealing unless they offer something a step above the lobotomy level. Saw offers this and more. Is it disturbing? yes, but it has good energy and creativity. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, you should. But brace yourself"

","Though I saw it pretty late, the best thing was; i had 'Saw 1' through Saw 5 all the titles with me and was able to see it as a daily soap for ten odd days. One thing very interesting about Saw is the Plot. Lot of conversation in the closed room and only a couple of characters; Still I guarantee that you would not feel bored. Viewer would for sure see something new in the movie, never seen in other commercial thriller movies. Movie contains gory scenes with a lot of graphic detail making it not so obvious choice for underage and persons who barely can take blood.<br/><br/>The story primarily revolves around a couple of characters in a packed room trying to find their way out. Thrill is they have limited time and clues are really hard to find by. You as a viewer would be biting your nails most of the time during the movie. Though the plot used is highly unrealistic, you would not have time to think about that part. Movie is fast paced and gives very less time for emotions and drama. Everything in the movie is related to plot and its less wastage of screen time. <br/><br/>It certainly is kind of movie which you would want to discuss with your friends. and i would rate it as a very good thriller. And yes, you may want to try watching it at night; best time to enjoy this movie."

","Saw is an excellent film that didn't get too much credit from critics. Mostly because of the amount of violence it contained. that was quite a bit too. Saw is a highly original film that doesn't take place at many places. It mostly takes place in a bathroom, but it shows other places. The Saw films are extremely violent and I give credit to almost every one of the films. There are good performances by many people, though there aren't many people in it. Cary Elwes is excellent and I wanted to see him return in the other films. Saw is not a horror film or a scary film, well it is a horror film. It's a thriller with a lot of blood and plot. I think Saw is an excellent film, so I give it a big thumbs up. Warning, it is very violent, not that violent but pretty gross.<br/><br/>Saw:***1/2 out of ****"
"stephen_cage","9","0","1","2 September 2009"," Saw: A Must Watch!
","I'm not usually a fan of horror films, but i was really impressed with this film. To put it simply Saw seems to have all the ingredients of a traditional horror film; whilst delivering them in a less stereotypical way. Though the film never releases its tension on the viewer, it really takes its time in letting the story unfold. E.G: We are told details right towards the end of the film, that could easily be given from the start. I suppose that's what makes the film so entertaining: Chilling, bloody scenes that are able to make the watcher squirm, locked in by an inventive story line.<br/><br/>Without giving to much away Saw isn't really a torture film, nor a film about a serial killer. I see it more of a 'scenorio film' (if there is such a thing) with a 'killer' placing his 'victims' in a sickening circumstance where they will have to complete a hideous task in order to survive an even more hideous fate. Though i have not seen many horror films, i would imagine this film would be suitable for 15 up (though rated for 18 viewers). Saw manages to keep an uneasy tension throughout the film, but does not build up the level too high. That being said, there are only one or two frightening scenes in Saw; (but this depends how easily scared you are)as a result is not nearly as unpleasant as people seem to make it out to be.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best thing about this film is the sheer incredible twist at the end. I can honestly say i never saw it coming, and i'm sure most others didn't either. I do not know how its sequels compare, but the ratings don't seem to good. However this is still a great film. Not too frightening to become unbearable, but delivers enough to make the viewer feel insecure, and on the edge of their seats. Throughout most of the picture.<br/><br/>This film is a Must Watch!"
"robwolter24","7","0","1","21 July 2009"," So much more than your average horror movie
","I watched this movie expecting nothing but gore and stupidity. Then I saw Cary Elwes, of whom I am a huge fan. Then the film got progressively better for me. I loved the idea of just having the movie of two men in a bathroom, with a dead man in between them. I noticed that they were doing things that actual people WOULD do, unlike many other horror movies. I'm not a fan of gore, but I appreciate a movie that can keep me from falling asleep. And I realized that as the movie went on, I was getting more into it. Something would develop like Gordon's family being hostage, and I would be concerned. I found Cary and Leigh much better than I had expected. They portrayed human behavior rather accurately. I then saw that Zepp was played by Michael Emerson, another actor of whom I am a fan. By the time Adam was killing Zepp, I was very into the plot. Then Dr. Gordon crawled away, and I was left wondering, how do they make the sequels? Then the answer was shoved into my oblivious face. This movie, that by this point I considered to be an OK movie, completely shocked me. The man who you assumed was dead, that had been lying in between Adam and Gordon stood up! And I realized that every aspect that I had seen in the movie made sense, and was important. This twist was unlike anything I had seen before, especially in a horror movie. My major is psychology, and I think this film is a good study of human behavior. Unfortunately only Saw 1 and 2 are worth your time. You expect so much by the third, and they let you down horribly, then the fourth tries to over compensate, and the fifth is just your typical horror movie. Hopefully the sixth is better. But one thing is for sure. The first and second Saw have made me a large fan of the series, and I will continue watching them until the end. If you like horror movies, this is a must see. If you like good movies, this is a must see. If you are faint of heart, Don't see this movie, or any of the sequels"
"aviakob","9","0","1","15 July 2009"," Very, Very good and qualitative (HARD SPOILERS ON THE WAY!)
","I hate horror. Mostly because these movies always end badly, they have lots of blood in them, and, well, they're scary. But I wanted to watch this movie only because it got really great reviews. So I started to watch and I waited for some scary moment or some blood, but I have to say that I didn't get scared at all! And the only blood I saw was when the Dr cut off his leg! So it's not that violent after all.<br/><br/>People always said that the ending is surprising, so I decided to try and figure out what could be the ending while I'm watching the movie. I couldn't. I could have never guess that (HARD SPOILER NOW!!) the body in the room is actually the murderer. My first thought was:""How could he not move all that time???"".<br/><br/>I really REALLY liked the music in the ending when the truth was exposed. I just loved Cary Elwes's acting. It was really special. I felt like he's really in that situation, and like he really cut off his leg. Great make-up by the way.<br/><br/>So, NO, I couldn't find out the ending while I was watching the movie, but there are all kinds of clues during the movie! You just can't realize them. I didn't give too much thought to that dead body in the room.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:A good movie, A great ending, A brilliant acting of the two leads (Especially Cary Elwes's), A good make-up, A great sound track, A not-so-very frightening moments...

"happyendingrocks","9","0","1","23 June 2009"," Truly sick, demented, and awesome
","I have to preface this review by admitting that I have not seen any of the 5 sequels (to date) that have turned this truly thrilling and original horror ditty into a ballyhooed franchise. Though I'm sure I will get through them all someday, I'm fairly convinced going in that none of them will do anything for me but detract from the power and mystery that surrounds the macabre events that unfold within this film's 100 minutes.<br/><br/>Watching how expertly each piece of Jigsaw's puzzle falls into place, it's truly amazing to imagine that a first time film-maker is responsible for this modern classic. Both the premise and its execution are startlingly original, and the brilliant performances by all the actors involved here are especially great when you consider that this cast of largely seasoned pros were taking their cues from a rookie.<br/><br/>The first time I watched Saw was a couple of years after its release, and I had managed to avoid learning anything about the plot or its intricacies. Going in cold made this film all the more horrifying, thus I'm not going to ruin that same rush here for those reading this who have remained insulated from clues to the movie's happenings by including anything resembling a spoiler in this write-up. All I knew going in was that Saw was a new type of horror film that sparked legions of would-be film-makers to crib its elements for a series of diminished clones, and that the ending was a real doozy. That assessment turned out to be absolutely right; this can arguably be called the first film of the modern horror era, much the way Scream kick-started the genre in the 90's.<br/><br/>Without giving anything about the film away, it's hard to identify exactly why Saw deserves every bit of praise thrown its way. In a general sense, much of the genius here derives not only from the shocking and brutal horror contained herein, but in the way that horror is not the sole impulse driving the film. Horror films are not pornography, and too many film-makers (especially in the modern era that Saw helped spawn) seem convinced that a series of money shots are enough to build a movie around. Yes, you can make a good horror film by simply delivering the horror. But making a great horror film requires a bit more. A captivating and solid story surrounding the grotesque elements, which Saw definitely has, certainly helps. In fact, that seems to be the main ingredient that separates Saw from its inferior homages. We are immersed in the mystery here just as our characters are, and since we then identify with them, it lends even more weight to the gruesome fate that may or may not be in store for them.<br/><br/>Certainly, other films since have outdone Saw in the gross-out department (probably even the other Saw installments... I'll let you know when I see them), but gore for gore's sake is sometimes not as potent as the shocks generated by the glimpses of carnage we see here. In fact, compared to what has come since, Saw is almost restrained in what it reveals. But, smart film-makers know that a viewer's imagination can conjure much worse than a film can show. That discipline is well-applied here.<br/><br/>Many of Saw's copycats have utilized a strong sexual element to augment their violence, thus birthing the ""torture porn"" phenomenon. Though Saw is often pointed to as the flagship of that movement, such a comparison is both unfair and completely erroneous. There is absolutely no sexual component to Jigsaw's psychotic mind-benders, and that actually makes them more horrifying. After all, if there were sexual undertones in the equation here, that might give some motive to the wickedness. Not clearly knowing why a deranged killer does what they do makes them that much more unpredictable and frightening. We're given a vague idea of Jigsaw's motivation in the film, but ultimately the conclusion we come to is that the killer does what he does because the dude is just completely twacked in the head.<br/><br/>Twist endings only work when they, well, work. In Saw, the final ""gotcha"" is so masterfully played that most viewers are going to want to start the disc over again to see how the film snuck up on them. The sense of dread and unease that this film left me with is one of the main reasons I haven't been clamoring to see any of the follow-ups. The story is so precisely crafted on its own, that the idea of adding anything else to it seems like it would detract rather than add anything substantial to the minor mythos explored here.<br/><br/>I'll reserve my final judgement on those until I see them, but Saw stands on its own as one of the best horror film thus far this century, and the previous one too, for that matter."

","I do not know why when ever someone is talking about a sick, torture movie they always mention Saw and Hostel. I haven't seen Hostel, but I have seen Saw. Saw is NOT a gory, sick, torture movie. I always saw it as a thriller, because it is a movie that has detectives and makes you think. (but not too much thinking) I can only remember one part in the movie that was actually torture. ( there was a few other moments but nothing big ) As for the gore, it isn't that gory. It has a unique plot and lots of suspense and good character development, and an amazing ending. That is why it is so popular. Not because it is the sickest, or most gory movie ever made. So go buy it or rent it and see why it is so popular.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Warge","7","0","1","2 June 2009"," Part of something bigger
","Saw is as a standalone film a quite good piece of gruesome and disturbing violence of the worst type. However, I think one has to see Saw with at least Saw 2 and 3 to actually get the entire picture of Jigsaw's mind and why the things happen and why he he orchestrates the kind of torture he do.<br/><br/>Technically the films are not great, but keep a fairly standard style in camera works. The acting is OK but in a few cases, it feels like either over the top or a bit stiff. What confuses me however is how Jigsaw manages to keep track of all things so dependent on timers so to speak, and I find this to be one of the few flaws - everything goes too smooth for Jigsaw, simply put. <br/><br/>In the wave of torture films (Saw, Hostel and others) I think I have to say the Saw 1-3 trilogy to be the best, not watched on a full stomach."

But one day, I braved it and sat down, and I can't imagine not having seen this movie. It gave me an appreciation for horror movies. What an absolutely fantastic movie - the story is gripping and thrilling with, in my honest opinion, the best ending to a movie in movie history. It has some amazingly tense scenes and isn't just a gore fest which is what I love about it. James Wan and Leigh Whannell weren't looking to create mindless blood shed, but created a plot with twists and turns that had you guessing right up until the end. This movie is quirky and brilliantly directed, edited, written and acted. I 100% loved it and because of this movie it has inspired me to watch more horror movies and, having researched behind the scenes stuff, has taught me a lot about film making. This is horror/slasher at its best and it was definitely worth the hype. Horror fan or not, I think people need to see this movie, it's a real gem in the industry of film."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","8 April 2009"," One of the most twisted and horrifying films ever made!
","Saw really is a modern horror classic. It is so original, and it really has something to say about the human condition. Im going to start off with the amazing direction by James Wan. He cleverly directed this film, and he really made the film be what it is. The suspense and the atmosphere the film has is so scary and disturbing, but at the same time you cannot look away. I thought the writing was really great. Sure, it did have some flaws in the script, but overall, it balanced great mystery and very well developed characters. The acting ranges from great to bad. For the most part, it is great, especially from Leigh Whannell, who is really strong. But Cary Elwes will be the actor people talk about. Why? Simply because he really gives a memorable performance. Do not get me wrong, I said memorable, not great. He does have some great scenes, but some of his scenes range from bad to horrible. But at the same time, I could not help but appreciate what he did. At least he gives different acting ranges, and this is a performance that really split me. I cannot say it was perfect, it was great at times, but I cannot say it was horrible, although it certainly bordered on bad. Michael Emerson is great for his small screen time. Tobin Bell's creepy voice really adds something to the film. The movie's lighting and editing were also very well done, very original also. The film at times even reminded me of other crime classics like The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. Truly, Saw is a very remarkable film. Like I said, not flawless, but it really achieves so many aspects that a lot of horror films never do. It manages to be gory, but also manages to get into your head. I really disagree with some of the negative criticism the film gets for being 'torture porn', because that is not what the film is. It does have a lesson to teach, as well as one of the most iconic characters ever put on screen, Jigsaw. Bravo to Saw, sure to become a classic in horror and mystery."

When I first heard of saw I thinking about how it must be, but when I saw it, it actually much better what I had thought. The storyline of the movie was original and so awesome that I couldn't think of a better way this movie would have turned out, and Jigsaw which to me seems like one of the best icons of horror that could have ever been created, the twists in this movie will keep you guessing and guessing until finally the end will have go ""No way, he was there the whole time!"" and have you turn your TV of with satisfaction.

","It's all about the story, innit.<br/><br/>SAW dives into its second act in its first minute: Two men in a subterranean TRAINSPOTTING bathroom, chained by their ankles to steel pipes at opposite ends of the room. A dead man lies in a pool of blood on the floor; in his hands, a gun and microcassette player. The men find cassettes in their pockets instructing them on how to escape their plight. One of them has to kill the other...<br/><br/>Old-school indie film-making at its best, from director-writer James Wan and co-writer, Leigh Whannell. Though ever-gorier sequels (SAW II, III, IV, V) have turned the SAW franchise into generic gore-fests, the original SAW displays a depth to its cutting edges that raises it miles above the average bear-trap nipple-twister.<br/><br/>Through flashbacks, tape recordings, police investigations, we piece together the story that a psychopath named Jigsaw is forcing victims into impossible escape situations where, even if they survive, they will forever be scarred physically or psychologically. The last seconds of the movie reveal why Jigsaw's motivation is to give people a new appreciation of life.<br/><br/>The two trapped men are Cary Elwes as Dr. Lawrence Gordon, and Leigh Whannell (the co-writer) as Adam. Lawrence figures out that the hacksaws supplied by Jigsaw were not to cut through their chains...<br/><br/>Amazing first-time direction and writing from Wan and Whannell, twists aplenty, solid characters and primal screaming that rattles our ribcages. We are immersed in every frustrating, impotent moment with the trapped characters, both Elwes and Whannell pulling off some complicated emotions.<br/><br/>Ken Leung does a great job with his detective role, but Danny Glover sleepwalks through his role as Leung's partner. As they trail the killer, they uncover other fiendishly ingenious death traps: a man who must step across broken glass to work out the combination of a safe that contains the antidote to a poison he has ingested; a man who must crawl through razor wire to escape a cage, before the timer on the door locks him in forever; and of course, Shawnee Smith in the infamous reverse-bear-trap jaw-breaker.<br/><br/>The beauty in the simplicity of the story and the complexity of the tortures.<br/><br/>Has anyone told Monica Potter yet that she can't act? She plays the doctor's wife - unconvincingly. Luckily, the Story comes to the rescue, making up for the less-than-exemplary performances from Potter and Glover.<br/><br/>Pay very close attention for there are twists aplenty, the filmmakers intending a double-meaning with their title, as in: Doubt what you ""saw,"" not just the bladed tool to make people toss their plastic popcorn. But that is the image that burns itself into your fear factors: in the shocking, brutal climax, Lawrence descends into madness and does the unthinkable - saws off his ankle to escape and save his wife who can't act."

","I have just finished watching this for what must be the tenth time on DVD within the four years that it has come out, and i have to say this is a great film<br/><br/>The premise of it is this, a serial killer alias 'jigsaw' is creating 'games' for men and women whom he has decided are wasting their lives, they have two options, play the game and try to live, or don't and die its that simple<br/><br/>The film starts out with the character of Adam(Leigh Whamnell) waking up in a bathtub in the middle of disgusting bathroom, he soon climbs out to realize that he is chained to a pipe within this room and he has company one dead man who shot himself, we don't know how long ago, and Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes), as the both come to the realization that they are trapped within one of the infamous Jigsaw killer's games, in which Dr Gordon is told to kill Adam by Six PM or his Daughter(Makenze Vega) and Wife(Morgan Potter) would be killed.<br/><br/>This movie when I first saw it, I was impressed, first off the movie has a moral lesson behind it. Live your life, don't take it for granted because if you do you could end up regretting it in the end. It is mostly meant to say, don't think that your life is meaningless just because you deem it so, and it did so without a lot of gore, or sex it was a simple low budget horror flick with a twisted way of showing a moral, and I loved it.<br/><br/>But not just because of the simple fact that it had a moral, because it was more mental than it was slasher, it actually makes you think this could be going on now, and sadly it probably is somewhere someone is either copycatting, or was the inspiration for this film. But thats a social commentary...<br/><br/>All and all, I think that Saw is one of the BEST horror movies out there and if you have a mind to think, I suggest you pick it up and watch for yourself<br/><br/>and hope, and pray one day you don't wake up in a small dark room with an electronic voice saying ""want to play a game?"""

The first time you watch this movie it's like an intense roller coaster ride that never seems to end, and when you think all the twists and loops have passed, think again. The suspense continues to build throughout the whole movie, and then about 3/4 of the way through, the bottom falls out and all hell breaks loose! It's all capped off with a stunning ending.

","This is an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Jigsaw, although quite deranged, is a genius. He sees people who don't appreciate life, and wants to do something about it. Instead of just capturing and torturing them like any other killer would, he sets up elaborate ""games"" in which he tests his victims' will to live. His plans are very well thought out, and are very scary - not because of the gore, but because of the thought actually being in this situation. Also, Jigsaw is the only killer smart enough to make his legacy continue on for several sequels after he dies.<br/><br/>The plot really makes you think. Unlike most horror/thrillers, it isn't about some maniac going around killing strangers, or a ghost haunting someone. It's a gripping, twisted story of people who are placed in life-or-death situations by a clever yet psycho man. The plot is completely unpredictable, although in some places, very confusing. I had no idea at all what was going on in the ending, and it took me a long time to figure out how all these characters are connected.<br/><br/>Like most horror movies, Saw has a lot of humor. Some was obvious, including most of Adam's lines, but some parts were hilarious yet unintended, such as the man freaking out in the wire maze and dying (totally his own fault), Jigsaw's costume making him look like Rocky Balboa and Michael Jackson in some shots, whoever it was hiding in the girl's closet just standing there with a blanket over his head, and who can forget the classic line: ""I thought I was alone, but I'm SURE someone else was there!"" The movie itself is very well made, especially for the low budget it had. All the various traps must've been very hard to make. The actors had a lot of courage to put themselves inside those death machines. The lighting gave it a spooky feel, and had a lot of variation: the light in the bathroom was bright and washed out, some flashback scenes were greenish, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, Saw is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I can watch it over and over again without getting bored.

The acting isn't particularly great, borderline poor at times, but not so bad you start to roll your eyes, though that said, I have never been a fan of Danny Clover in any way.<br/><br/>The story line cannot be praised enough, it keeps you guessing throughout and, just when you think you've got it sussed out, the film springs the ending on you. The ending made my hairs stand on end. Not only that, if the film had flopped abit, it had an end, but if it was successful and a 2nd was on the cards (as it turned out there was) a sequel was perfectly set up, no other way to say it. <br/><br/>The only problem with it is, once you've seen it, it can't have the same effect, but thats no real criticism <br/><br/>Verdict: Saw came from nowhere to completely blind side everyone. Dare I suggest a future classic?"
"Danielramos16","9","0","1","27 July 2008"," A revolution in horror
","Every once in a while there is a movie that will change how other films are made, and this is one. Saw is a film that is a revolution of the horror genre. Since this film came out i've seen a lot of other films taking cues from this. There is just something about Saw that sets it apart from other horror films of the past that other films will try and copy.<br/><br/>First off this is just such an intense film In terms of the camera work, it looks so nightmarish like a bad dream but at the same time it feels so real. Also the music is magnificent, it adds to the chaos & fear of what's happening on film. The film makers cleverly use music to intensify the horror of the movie. The settings & scenery are also magnificent done, it's far more gritty then the most recent horror films. A lot of movies in the horror genre during the late 90's & early 00's concentrate more on being hip & stylish, not this movie Saw is dark & gritty it's all about the horror. What also sets Saw apart is that it doesn't focus on the blood & gore like most horror films, it more about the suspense, mystery, and drama of what's happening. Saw is a mystery film that just adds a lot of blood & horror.<br/><br/>The Puzzles & test's Jigsaw puts his ""subjects"" through are horrific and very graphic, but every test has a deeper meaning. What's so great about this film is that it really does put you in the shoes of the ""subjects"" would you endure so much pain & suffering in order to survive.? that is what Saw does so well. The main villain Jigsaw is taking people who have committed some morale or legal crime and tests their will to live. From the very 1st scene the suspense and tension builds up to the most horrific and shocking ending ever.<br/><br/>Thoughtful, meaningful, intense, and scary as hell. Saw is a horror classic that will and has revolutionized the horror film genre."

","this movie was great i watch it and it was perfect i think this movie is better than titanic. the end was the best end ever when jigsaw has been woke up i liked that part of the film and you must watch it and you will love it. saw is the best ever. This film was a lot like ""Last House..."" with the exception of the moral at the end. this film was a plain, scare the pants off ya, turn the lights on in the middle of the night, scream out loud till ya barf twice go crazy, deadbolt your doors, pray you die early type of scare film. Two men are locked in a sewage room and must try to kill one another in order to be free. Other characters and lot twist are added along the way. But the film is executed unnervingly! <br/><br/>Elwes and the other dude were really great in their roles. Danny Glover, as a dried out, discharged obsessed cop was great with what little time he had on screen. The rest of the cast did their own little private parts to make it pleasant. Intense character build up creates a surrealistic atmosphere that makes the audience concentrate on exactly what is going on.. creepy stuff."
"hnt_dnl","10","0","1","3 July 2008"," The 21st century's first great horror film!
","SAW is a film that can be considered a fusion of many elements of the horror genre. It has the deranged 'killer' who methodically downs his victims (like PSYCHO and all the subsequent slasher films that tried to emulate it). In that sense, he is just a mindless killer like Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, or Michael Myers. In reality, he is an intelligent serial killing sociopath with deep-rooted hatred of people who take life for granted: those are his victims, so that he is much more like the killer in SEVEN and other films about serial killers who are always one step ahead of the cops and FBI (in this case, he's about 5 steps ahead at all times!). Also, it is a very stylish film with a real grade-A Hollywood look and feel, but still captures the atmosphere of a horror film.<br/><br/>SAW is told in a random fashion with a lot of flashback scenes that drive the film. Although the PULP FICTION scenes technically weren't flashbacks, the style of SAW reminded me a great deal of that film, like each scene was its own separate vignette. You actually learned a lot about the different characters in these scenes. Case in point: the brilliant early sequence where the cops find one of the killer's victims in a dark cellar and as they discuss and re-create the crime, we see in flashback how the killer (unseen to the viewer) terrorizes the victim and shows us how he met his fate. Just one of the many great scenes of the film.<br/><br/>Cut to the first scene of our 'heroes': Dr. Lawrence Gordon (played with cool precision by Cary Elwes) and Adam (impressive performance by newcomer Leigh Wannell, who also developed the story and wrote the screenplay), who find themselves trapped in some grungy, dirty old warehouse bathroom chained to the fixtures. They find they cannot free themselves by any means. There is a man in the middle of the floor, a previous victim of our killer, who apparently shot himself when he realized that a slow-acting poison was coursing through his veins.<br/><br/>Gordon knows who is behind this: a killer who calls himself Jigsaw. In flashback, Gordon tells Adam how Jigsaw kidnaps, imprisons, and traps his victims and then forces them to make life-or-death decisions to release themselves from their traps. Sometimes they have to actually torture themselves or others to release themselves from the traps.<br/><br/>In flashback, we find out that the cops suspected Gordon at first because they found something that belonged to Gordon at one of the crime scenes. The lead cop is Det. David Tapp (played solidly by veteran actor Danny Glover), who is essentially the other main character of the film. Tapp and his partner Det. Sing take Gordon to the station and question him and find out he is not the killer because of a solid alibi, then they have him look in on an interrogation of one of Jigsaw's victims who survived. The girl's name is Amanda (played brilliantly by Shawnee Smith, who has too little screen time) and her sequence is the best in the film and truly shows the depths of torture that Jigsaw puts his victims through. Michael Emerson is also exceptional as Zep, a rather odd orderly at Dr. Gordon's hospital.<br/><br/>We also find out in flashback how Adam got there and of the connection between these 2 trapped men. We also get to learn about Gordon's family and personal life and why Jigsaw is punishing these 2 men. But most importantly, we learn about all of Jigsaw's earlier victims and the elaborate traps that he has put them in and what they must do in order to survive.<br/><br/>The film speaks a lot as to what depths a human will go to in order to save his life when he is pushed to the breaking point. Jigsaw has obviously planned his traps very carefully. The film has a major surprise ending, one of the biggest surprises that I have seen in a film ever. I was totally shocked by it.<br/><br/>SAW is a highly original, high-concept film. It could have failed miserably, but succeeds in spades! It has a wealth of interesting characters, a highly stylized look, a labyrinthine enjoyable plot, a pulse-pounding score, and an original serial killer for the new generation. A must see!"

"RunningJokes","8","0","1","27 May 2008"," In an age of ""slasher"" films with weak story lines, Saw stands above the rest
","In an age where the common goal of horror-movie creators is to achieve the most gruesome and disturbing scenes, Saw is a wonderful breath of fresh air. Although there may be a few scenes that may make the viewer turn their head away, the movie stands out due to the exceptional story and structure.<br/><br/>The movie delivers right from the beginning when a man (Adam) wakes up in a bath tub and chained to a wall in a small, grimy bathroom that help set the tone. From that point, the audience is immediately swept up in the fear and suspense of the movie. After getting out of the tub, Adam discovers he has a cell mate (Lawrence). They realize they are part of a game of a serial killer who gets his victims to kill themselves. The rest of the story combines interaction between the two, following the cops trying to find the killer, and flashbacks to try and discover who is doing this and how to escape.<br/><br/>After many years full of ""slasher"" movies with no intriguing plot line, Saw stands out with one of the most original ideas. The Jigsaw Killer creates traps where the victims have the choice to live or die, and the trap usually reflects the reason why they are put in the trap. The catch is that they must sacrifice something in order to save themselves.<br/><br/>Despite being James Wan's directorial debut, he delivers with flying colors. A lack of establishing shots gives the audience a very claustrophobic feel to help convey the feelings of the characters. Wan's most amazing accomplishment is that he created this film in 18 days on a budget of about $1.2 million. The actors also did a phenomenal job, especially considering the fact that they had no rehearsal takes.<br/><br/>The movie actually can be regarded more as a suspense film than a horror movie, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Make sure to focus all your attention to the movie for the 103 minutes because it will keep you guessing right to the very end. The finale provides a shocking twist that I believe ranks right up there with Citizen Kane and Sixth Sense."

","A new take on the traditional horror formulae, Saw combines elements from the psychological thriller and slasher canon to create an effective chiller that goes out of its way to create numerous inventive death scenes that will appeal to gore-hounds. I don't think many films set in predominantly one location have been as creative. You start from square one, as an audience member knowing as little as the two leads, then as they find out the reasoning behind their plight the plot unravels into an edge-of-your seat if routine finale, that is set apart by a fairly convincing twist that is well mapped out, even if the acting and the dialogue is a bit shoddy at times.<br/><br/>7/10"

This film keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through (apart from the beginning) and then the ending is unbelievable which has a amazing twist to it and it leaves you thinking that there will be another Saw.

If you like gory films watch this film but if your just watching it for the gore watch ""SAW 3."" Now if you want to watch this film. DO!

","""Saw"" is a movie that was originally scheduled for a straight-to-DVD release. After positive reviews at a test screening, the green light was given for a theatrical release. The rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Two strangers awake from a drugged stupor to find themselves chained in a decrepit, unused warehouse bathroom. With them are instructions by a psycho killer, which they must follow if they want out this room alive.<br/><br/>The twist at the end is so amazing I think it makes the whole movie memorable.<br/><br/>The only flaws I can see with this film is poor dialogue (sporadic -- not all the way through), bad acting (most notably from Leigh Whannell) and poor editing. But, we should cut the film makers some slack because they had a tight budget, and their result is something they should, and will be, proud of -- regardless of these flaws.<br/><br/>Not so much of a horror movie, as some people tend to call it. More like a psychological thriller, in the same way as Seven."
"BigBirdtheBum","8","0","1","26 February 2008"," I am glad i SAW it. (very minor spoilers)
","The fairly well known horror movie""Saw"" has been unfortunately crucified by the majority of critics. This is one of the few occasions in which i say- they are wrong. The film ""Saw"" in my opinion is easily one of the best horror films this century. Unfortunately it has spawned a number of sequels that honestly are no where near as good as this one.<br/><br/>Saw has many unique and appealing qualities which i believe make it an exceptional modern horror film.First of all the films focuses is of a serial killer (nicknamed Jigsaw) who forces people through horrific tasks(which often result in death or blood) who he believes are not worthy to be alive. Thats right a serial killer who does not actually murder! Aside from having a very unique plot the film also has many multiple plot lines that keep the viewers exhilarated and mind-boggled. The special effects are done rather well considering the very low budget. And the ending i must say is absolutely brilliant and will please almost everybody. As well as these many positive qualities the film has many many questions and puzzles that will keep you guessing to the bitter end. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the film is not perfect. Due to the low budget a lot of the sets and props look at times fake and out of place, and at times the film can be awkward as a majority of scenes take placed in enclosed areas such as; houses and warehouses will little images of the outside world. Also seeing how the film really is an ""amateur"" film the acting at times is not too crash hot, but better then most low budget films. Same as the acting, the writing does have some flaws but when compared to other film makers first work is surprisingly good. Character development on the other hand is also surprisingly good, the characters are developed gradually and the changes they express happen realistically in response to the many situations they are plunged into. <br/><br/>The film itself would appeal to a variety of audiences from gore hungers to lovers of psychological thrillers. However i would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 13 as it does have some graphic violence and can be extremely tense and disturbing. Overall i would give the film a 7.6 out of ten. Well done James Wan a perfect example of how could a movie can be, regardless of it's budget. It is also a shame that this film was to some degree ruined by mediocre to terrible sequels."

","I haven't seen the original short movie yet (titles SAW as well), but with this feature length effort, a change has been made in Horror movie history.

Saw on the other hand, is a brand name now. A 5th saw movie will come out later this year (and more are yet to come).<br/><br/>But let's talk about this original, that lays some seeds for the other movies to follow. We get the rules to which the character have to play (the general idea) or let's say the concept. It will keep you guessing from beginning to the end, what is going to happen.

","Since all of these new horror films or torture films have started coming out, there haven't been many great ones. Saw however delivers perfectly and always keeps you thinking about the story, and not about who is going to have their arm or leg chopped off next. Not saying that gore is not a sometimes good thing in horror films, but it cannot be the entire movie. Saw's plot is distinctive and detailed and really gives you an inside look at what is happening inside the mind of the killer, Jigsaw. Jigsaw, however, is not your ordinary Jason Vorheese masked killer who doesn't talk sort of guy. He is completely obsessed with teaching his victims the value of the life they hold in their bodies. Jigsaw has a severe case of cancer that cannot be cured, so it is easily understood why he is so obsessed. In the film, Jigsaw decides to incorporate 2 victims, or players in his game. Normally his games only have one player and they fight for their life in a vicious trap that usually has something to do with why Jigsaw has put them there. The 2 new players are Dr. Gordon, a surgeon who is cheating on his wife, and Adam, a man who spies on people for money. Both have been chosen by Jigasw to play in his most intense game of all. Locked in a disgusting industrial bathroom, the two must fight for their lives in an extreme game that will test their fears to the next level.<br/><br/>In this extreme thrill ride, Saw, delivers like a roller coaster on the loose, with twists and turns you will never expect. And an ending thats sure to be kept in your head forever."

","I've said this before and I'm saying it right now, there are not very many horror movies which I consider good. ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" ""Darkness Falls"" are examples of how pathetic the horror genre has become. This movie is different. There's no cheesy immortal killer, no huge name actors who you KNOW are gonna make it out as the 'Big Hero'. This movie has no bias toward any character, each one can be killed at any time, can only do so much to survive this, and only knows so much. Writer Leigh Whannel was good as the paranoid, crazy, pessimistic Adam. Cary Elwes wasn't half bad as the observant, intelligent Dr. Lawrence Gordon. And of course my favorite actor in this film was Danny Glover. He was very well cast as the determined Detective Tapp. Over all, I recommend this movie to anyone with a taste for good horror, by that I Don't mean The Ring, The Grudge, 2003 version of TCM, etc. This movie is not for the weak minded/stomached."

","This film was a major surprise to me. I looked at the DVD case, saw the severed foot and thought; 'right, looks like a pretty average gore film, lot's of blood and guts, just for the sake of it'. But, and I'll be the first to admit it, I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes it's over the top gore, but no, it is not by any means just blood and guts all over the place in a random fashion. This film has a plot, meaning and brilliant scripting.<br/><br/>'Saw' explores the genre in a completely different way, almost redefining the whole gore genre, and converting it from a once plot-less carnage, to a now meaningful blood-bath of excitement. The whole film relentlessly surprises with multiple plot changes, ultimately ending in a way which is completely not what you expected. (The murderer gets up and walks right out of the room - yeah, as if you really did expect that 'dead' guy to be jigsaw after all - because I'll tell you now, I didn't). The whole film is a feast for your brain, nothing about this film makes you feel guilty for watching it after, it doesn't suck the sense out of your brain and the brutality doesn't seem in your face; it seems normal and fits perfectly with the sub-texts of the film. 'Saw' doesn't just randomly spill it's guts out to you, it depicts desperation and makes you think twice about how you view your own life. It therefore presents morals that we hold to our own lives and presents an ideology represented by the murderer, 'jigsaw', that if we don't appreciate our lives enough to be fight for it, no matter what sick trap has been placed, than we should die. Flashbacks give us a slight insight into this murderer's thoughts, but it leaves it all very open, giving it a lot of potential to produce a very satisfactory series of films.<br/><br/>There are no immediately bad things about this film, although, it doesn't quite satisfy your taste buds, instead it seems more like a filler, getting you ready for the next set of 'Saw' films.<br/><br/>A highly recommended rent or purchase if you enjoy gory / horror / thriller films, but, if you don't, don't expect to suddenly be bowled over by 'Saw'. It may be good, but it's nothing inspiring, it just is a little more interesting than your run of the mill gore film. And, if you do buy into the 'Saw' franchise, expect to be renting the next 4 or 5 'Saw' films that have came out, along with it too."

But, sadly, the story lacked any true depth, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Some of the camera work was a lot of fun, nice effects there, and the caped man reminded me of the Allan Moore graphic novel hero from V for Vendetta interestingly enough... but, I wold have rather seen this microcosmic game effect a larger microcosmic level, and this movie sadly stays within the box.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed Saw I and Saw 3 somewhat, I hated Saw 2, so was pleased when Saw 4 redeemed the series somewhat."

This film also gives the viewer many many scenes that they want or need in order to stay interested, which is what is good because it's easy to get confused, so this way we are kept with blood pumping in the old grey matter. It will keep you guessing until the very end. It also wraps it up in about 90 minutes so you don't lose interest. But most of all, this film has one of the best endings ever! It will jump off the screen at you and it will wow you. I don't think you need a really strong stomach, but it does take a little bit of a strong stomach to watch.

","OK. Usually I don't like horror movies all that much. But for some reason, this movie seemed like something I HAD to watch, so I checked it out. Well, I thought it was pretty good. It had a good scare to it, it had good intensity at times, the plot was pretty decent, the acting was great. It had some really nice unexpected plot twists, here and there. It was pretty nice. :D But there is ONE problem, I have with this movie. One ****ing problem: THE ENDING!!!! The ending SUCKED! I mean, even a HORROR movie has to end, HAPPILY! I mean, why couldn't it have gone like this: the family escapes; the two guys escape; THE END. Instead, it went like: the family escapes; the surgeon dude saws his own foot off; guy in the middle of the floor gets up and closes door and leaves Adam in the room to die and goes after the surgeon dude! What an utter crap ending??!!!! I mean, ""Child's Play"" had a happy ending! Why couldn't THIS movie?! Anyway, in closing, I LIKE this film, but it could've been better. :|"

","This one is passable (and I""ll go into that), but going on my experiences with sequels, I'm sticking with the odds and saying skip them, including ""Saw II, III, IV"", etc. ""Saw"" was recommended by a friend. I love films, and this was his first recommendation. The IDEA is an interesting one: layers of psychological challenges that are slowly revealed to the very last moment. We are ""set up"" more than once, and I fell right into it. I admit it - they got me - but I was disappointed in the answer, which struck me as nothing more than a vehicle for driving sequels down Money Highway. The acting was uneven, and sometimes bad. The sets were good. The makeup and special effects ran the gamet from lousy to good. It's like no one (James Wan) really stood over this film with a strong hand and guided quality control."

As the events unfold you are completely driven into the world of Jigsaw. Wan could have thought of casting better actors, as acting could have been a weak point in the movie. The camera work is top-notch, every scene looks so real. The real high point of the film is its end. This really proves that the maker of this film is truly a genius.

","Let me get straight to the point. Saw is perhaps one of the most exciting, gripping and downright excellent thrillers I have ever seen with a plot to scare, terrify, and most importantly, entertain. The film gives a good taste of its flavour from the opening scenes- two men, one body and no clues. After some intriguing riddles and puzzles, they find a tape and cassette player which will give them all the answers- why are they here? What are they doing here? How will they get out?<br/><br/>Well directed, acted and produced, Saw is a roller-coaster of a film right from its very beginning. As the film goes on, the audience is kept on tenterhooks, waiting to feed on the smallest plot advancement. With perhaps the best twist ever seen since Darth Vader's paternity confession, Saw will excite, delight and intrigue all watchers of the film. Just do yourself a favour- ignore the inferior sequels and watch this with no knowledge of the film's plot twists, and prepare to be absorbed in an astonishing, visceral game of torture and mystery. You must see this movie."

"maddymoo","8","0","1","4 November 2007"," not what I expected
","I'm unlike most people, I think, in that I prefer not to read movie reviews until after I've seen the movie. There are exceptions, of course, but they are very rare. If I've enjoyed a movie my habit these days is to come online and look it up here, add it to MyMovies and almost always rate it (but not often comment). I will sometimes do this for movies I didn't like much, too, if there was any reason at all why I bothered to watch it after the point at which I decided it was junk (eg a favourite actor, or one really good character in a sea of dross).<br/><br/>And so it is that I have got this far without being acquainted with the premise/plot/characters of ""Saw"". I do like horror, preferably ""intelligent"" horror, although pulp slasher/vampire/zombie flicks are fine too (as long as they have *something* to recommend them; see above). I feel obliged to class ""Saw"" as horror even though I think it's a psychological thriller first and a horror vehicle second. There *were* moments where I was backed up into the corner of the sofa with my hand over my mouth, but it was a reaction to the degrees of realism rather than being grossed out by gore FX. I was actually expecting more gore. I like zombie movies so I feel pretty acclimatised to gore (realistic or not), but I had unexpected empathetic reactions to the emotions rather than a ""repulse"" reaction to gore.<br/><br/>Only a few movies in the fright genre have ever really bothered me, but the only one I've actually had to switch off unfinished was ""Wolf Creek"" - because it was *so damn good*, also because I was heavily freaked out by John Jarratt as a sociopath, having previously only seen him in neutral or positive contexts (particularly ""Playschool"" and ""Better Homes and Gardens""). I was slightly worried that I would find ""Saw"" unwatchable in the same way, therefore I was greatly relieved to be favourably reminded of ""Cube"" (which I like very much).<br/><br/>I was a little irked by the various continuity errors, and I felt some aspects of the plot didn't get enough explanation (or enough visual clues), but I was very pleased with Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle, knowing I recognised the face but taking a while to come up with ""Lost"" (which I had to stop watching after the 2nd season because I was becoming unhealthily obsessed with it). I pegged Zep as the most likely suspect right from his first scene; it was gratifying to be wrong, and to have been so masterfully tricked. Emerson has a lingering resemblance to Brad Dourif (a great favourite), and this is a good thing, imo, if he doesn't mind doing a lot of these kinds of roles - the fringe loony, basically, or the corrupt official.<br/><br/>Normally I am annoyed when a movie ends in such a way that there is obvious scope for a sequel, but this time it seemed the *only* way to end it - given that Zep is not, after all, the monster behind the tortures. I am looking forward to seeing 2 and 3 in the next week before heading off to the cinema (which I rarely bother to do) for the fourth installment."

"vitachiel","7","0","1","27 July 2007"," Freaky enough
","Following the hype, I must say that I expected more from this movie. Still, the entertainment value was very high, I did not get bored a single time. The basic concept is good and freaky enough. The dark, cold and stinky atmosphere was justly portrayed. However, there were some things missing that could've made this movie a true classic. Maybe there are too many flashbacks, police investigation scenes, etc. to get truly absorbed into the main story of the two men chained in a sleazy bathroom. What's more, I was not really impressed by the choice of actors. I never got to the point of empathizing with the characters, and therefore I was not so concerned with their fates (which lessens the tension). More character building would've helped a lot.<br/><br/>Also, more focus on the dreadfulness of lying hours in a row as a caged dog in a desolate place would've been welcome: I understand, including a minute or two of silent trepidation would be risky in the commercial eye, but I am convinced it would add to the overall texture of the movie. I also expected more gore and bloodiness; if somebody has to pull a key out of another person's stomach, show more of the actual action. If the doctor is sawing his leg, well, include at least a second more of the sawing or of the sawed-off foot/leg (then again, my own stomach says thank you for not showing that) The last factor which did damage to the absorption level was the logic of action taken. If Big Brother can hear all that's happening in the bathroom, why can't he hear what's being said between the two victims when the light is turned off? And is it not oh so obvious for BB that they made a deal with regard to the poisoned cigarette? When (near the end of the movie) the doctor reaches for the cell phone, he gets frustrated for not reaching it. Hey, you managed to pick up things that were harder to pick up by either man just throwing another object towards it, so why cutting off your foot to do it now? To add some praise: the end scene was totally unexpected, though very conceivable and thus of true perfection."

","I'm no fan of splatter-movies. Rather i don't like them at all with a few notable exceptions. I'm not sure why that is really, i'm not squeamish about blood and i'm not sensitive otherwise either. I guess i just don't see the qualities in a movie where the blood itself is the point.<br/><br/>I have seen some people summarily disregard SAW as another splatter-movie. Blood and gore just for the sake of it. Luckily most people don't agree. And indeed there is another quality here. Sick, deranged and quite possibly insane, but also devious and intelligent. There is a method and thought to the killing in this movie. It's not random neither in purpose nor in execution. And that does in fact help when the disgusting scenes become a little too much to watch comfortably.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw-killer, as the orchestrator of the games in SAW are called, is one of the more colorful villains in recent years. His insane designs of self-punishment, or rather forced life-defining decisions, are both amazing in appearance as well as devious in function. His single purpose is to make people appreciate life more after having fought a bit for it. While i find that idea disgusting in itself, it is a very alluring concept for a movie.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, the sets are amazing, the props equally so and the story original. There is blood here, but i think it's still less than what you would be made to believe. Also the sequels live up to the gory expectations more as you would imagine. Here though we have a quite perfect mix between blood and suspense. That being said, i don't think this is for everyone considering that some people would probably just spend the entire running-time behind a pillow.<br/><br/>SAW is suspenseful, disgusting and smart - all in the same package.

"zardoz-13","9","0","1","9 July 2007"," See ""Saw"" and ride a teeter-totter of terror!
","Hardcore horror film fanatics measure their fright flicks by how far filmmakers push the envelope in their efforts to scare audiences. Meaning, what do the filmmakers do that that none have ever dared do in a horror picture? Do they pile on more blood and guts? Do they take horrific conventions (i.e. monsters or ways to die) to greater extremes of sadism? Do they offer more stomach-churning plot twists? Freshman director James Wan doesn't push the envelope with his movie ""Saw,"" he shoves the envelope straight up our collective sinuses. Imagine the murderous 1997 movie ""Cube"" crossed with elements of the grisly, white- knuckled, Brad Pitt serial killer saga ""Se7en"" and nasty bits and pieces from Italian gore- master Dario Argento's nail-biters ""Deep Red"" (1975) and ""Suspiria"" (1977), and you have a glimmer of an idea what you'll get from ""Saw."" Basically, Wan and writer/actor Leigh Whannel put the teeth back into terror with their ingenious, ironic, R-rated, masochistic thriller killer movie. This stark, visceral, mean-spirited, George Romeo-style gorefest isn't for folks who cannot handle Grand Guignol horror movies. Whether it's the eerie puppet head that intimidates the killer's victims or a psychotic character who decides he would rather cut off his own leg with a hacksaw to free himself from being shackled to a pipe, ""Saw"" succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout its 100 nerve-wrenching minutes.<br/><br/>""Saw"" opens as its two shanghaied protagonists, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes of ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"") and a low-life photographer Adam (newcomer Leigh Whannel), awaken to find themselves chained at the ankles to huge pipes in the most foul-smelling and disgusting men's restroom this side of Iraq. Topping off everything, sprawled in the middle of the grimy floor between them, face down on the tiles in a huge puddle of dried blood, lies a dead man gripping a micro cassette recorder in one fist and a revolver in the other hand who appears to have shot himself in the head. Essentially, manacled as they are at the ankles across the room from each other, Gordon and Adam constitute a hybrid version of the 1958 Tony Curtis/Sidney Poitier civil rights yarn ""The Defiant Ones."" Since they aren't going anywhere, they try to deduce how they wound up in the worst place in the world. They discover that each has a micro cassette in their possession. After they manage to get the micro cassette player out of the corpse's hand and play their tapes, they learn that Dr. Gordon has until 6 PM to kill Adam (several hours from then) or they both die without a hope of anybody finding them. <br/><br/>Wan and Whannel keep things short, shocking, and savage. ""Saw"" is the kind of movie where the characters don't get second chances to live. Further, you'll have to be psychic to figure out who the killer is. Watch out for those red herrings! Nobody is really who they seem to be in ""Saw."" Ironically, the maniacal villain--referred to as 'the Jigsaw killer'--puts his victims in situations where they end up killing themselves or others in the process of trying to save themselves. Fans of the Ted Danson TV-sit com ""Becker"" will appreciate Shawnee Smith's acting range. In a brief role, she played a ""Double Jeopardy"" like heroine who escapes death, but bring eternal turmoil on herself. The Jigsaw killer placed her male roommate and her in a room. She has a huge steel bear-trap slung around her head like a helmet with a key lock. The killer reveals that when the timer spots, the bear-trap will implode and crush her skull, unless she can get the key inside the entrails of her dead roomie. Although she survives the ordeal, she learns afterward that her roommate was drugged, not dead, and she killed him when she eviscerated him in her search for the key. A subplot about a revenge-seeking, ex-cop (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") who wants to kill the Jigsaw killer for killing his Asian partner alternates with the flashbacks about how our protagonists got to where they are, and the suspense mounts as to whether the ex-cop will rescue the victims before they have to kill each other. ""Saw"" is the kind of horror movie that appeals to your baser instincts by showing you things you won't easily forget when you go to sleep. See ""Saw"" and ride a teeter-totter of terror!"

The Saw franchise is a series of psychological-thrillers. I saw this movie last year and it taught me a lesson. A valuable one too. I'll explain: Jigsaw(protagonist) teaches people how to value their lives in the most gruesome way. And how do these people mess up their lives?

","After countless raves from nearly every one of my horror film loving friends, I decided one day it was time for me to watch ""Saw,"" an indie slasher film premiering at the Sundance Film Festival as one of the ""Midnight Movies"" that is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of its generation. In no way does this film disappoint, no matter what you are looking for in a film.<br/><br/>Let's start with the story. Two young men--a doctor named Dr. Gordon, and a photographer named Adam--wake up chained to the wall in a dirty, old washroom. Neither of them know how they got there--and they don't know each other either. There is a slaughtered corpse between them eerily clutching a tape recorder and two tapes addressed to each of the men. The message is clear: one must find a way to kill the other by 6:00 that evening or they will both--along with Dr. Gordon's family--be killed.<br/><br/>Before long, they realize they are now victims of the Jigsaw killer--a known serial killer who captures people who do not appreciate life and force them to hurt themselves or others in order to save themselves from a bloody, gruesome, brutal, torturous death. In a series of flashbacks, we discover more about Jigsaw, and experience previous encounters his victims' have had. We learn of Gordon and Adam's past, an obsessed detective dedicated to finding Jigsaw, and a young drug addict named Amanda who survived Jigsaw's sick ""games"" and is now mentally scarred. As the story unfolds, it suddenly explodes into a brilliantly twisted psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll after the shock ending and even for some time after that. Lots of hardcore gore and an INCREDIBLY SCARY atmosphere accompany this much-above-average slasher flick.<br/><br/>The acting is both great and dreadful at different times, but is always thoroughly realistic. Jigsaw is perfectly cast in his role. Adam was sort of an annoying character, but still managed to deliver, and Dr. Gordon seemed like some WAY over-dramatic guy out of Star Trek, and was the only character in the small cast I was actually hoping to get killed.<br/><br/>The directing and editing is absolutely nothing to rave about and is solely why I didn't give Saw 5 stars. The flashbacks are adequately done, sometimes poorly, but unfortunately, for a super psychological horror film like Saw, that is a huge failure and deserves negative feedback. Very fortunately, the strong storyline and sheer terrifying simple atmosphere holds the film together.<br/><br/>Overall--a very enjoyable movie watching experience, and it will scare the living daylights out of you if you watch it alone on a big screen with surround sound. Not one for the little kids however, as it is very violent in some select scenes (particularly the ending) but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it. Very good and much, much more and above and ultimately smarter and more brilliant the average super-violent slasher horror films that are out there today."

","This is the greatest movie ever made. Saw has murder, mystery, action, and even ventriloquism. This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder for days how the writers got these ideas. I had to watch it twice to even figure out the plot. That right there is a recipe for an awesome movie. Saw is followed by Saw 2 and 3 and they are equally awesome movies. There is also a Saw 4 coming out, but if you are a Saw fan, you should know that by now. If you love Saw more than anything, you would definitely love Dead Silence. That is another wickedly awesome movie made by James Wan and Leigh Whannell. If you haven't seen Saw yet, then get it and watch it until your eyes pop out."

","This film, to my surprise, was actually very good and cleverly written. Although, the acting may have been somewhat cheesy it still manages to catch audiences in its tale of suspense that circles around a pair of complete strangers, trapped in a room,that find out they have more in common then they had originally thought. At the same time a very intelligent serial killer going by the name JigSaw is on a rampage, kidnapping people... I won't reveal the ending, considering the ending is what made this film so popular, but this film is amazingly suspenseful.

","Can you imagine being a part of somebody's sick and demented game that could result in your death? Adam (Leigh Whannel) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) were just that. They both woke up in a room in some unknown building, chained to pipes with a dead man on the floor. In that room were all the clues and tools they needed to escape, or risk perishing there; all they had to do was find them.<br/><br/>""Saw"" was one twisted movie but it was well done. The movie held you in suspense throughout while also interweaving the necessary background information that lead the two pawns to their current situation. Saw was made effective by having an appealing multi-layered plot. There was the cop trying to catch Jigsaw (the bad guy), there were the two guys in the room trying to get out, and of the two guys, one guy in the room also needed to save his family, and on top of all that you are trying to figure out just who the bad guy was.<br/><br/>I was completely engrossed in this movie. I wanted to see the two guys survive and I desperately wanted the mastermind behind the whole sick scheme to be caught, and preferably tortured. This was one of those thrillers where you had a true rooting interest in seeing the antagonist either caught or destroyed. Every suspense or thriller has an antagonist, but not many have one that you can really loathe and pray for his demise. ""Saw"" effectively combined the suspense of whether or not the two main characters would survive along with the suspense of whether or not the bad guy would be caught. This was a well done movie, and even though the ending infuriated me to no end, it was a great twist."

And it's not just the gore and the blood, it was the sadism. The fact that Jigsaw had set all of this up and knew so many intimate details about his victims was truly terrifying. He remains my second favorite Horror Icon to date (after Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lechter). I did not give the movie a perfect score because I have real problems with the two main characters, but everyone else made up almost completely for their lack of acting talents. I, personally, was surprised at the appearance of a fairly high profile actor such as Danny Glover was in this movie. The rest of the cast was relatively unremarkable.<br/><br/>Saw II was excellent as well, given Jigsaw's expanded role and Saw III was a good movie that could have been done better, but this film, in my humble opinion, was in a class all it's own."

One of the best horror films to ever grace the cinema in all of its existence, Saw creeps up unexpectedly and really gets to you when you're least expecting it. I wasn't expecting much from this first movie in a series. I had heard buzz about it at school, lots of things from my favorite websites online months before it came outit sounded like it would be a decent movie. Little did I know, Saw would completely blow my mind and become one of my favorite films of all time well, at least until I saw the sequel, which was superior in ever way, shape, and form. I viewed Saw a week after it came out in theaters, and I was so far from being disappointed. I went in with very few expectations, and I came out shaking, moved, scared. Saw is an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Saw is written by Leigh Whannel, who also starred in the film as Adam, and over the course of three movies has managed to become one of my favorite actors. This guy can really write, too! He knows what scares people, and he really uses it to his full advantage. The dialogue is top-notch and really hits hard, especially in the final act. The ending is, by far, the best ending I've ever had the good fortune of witnessing, and it is probably the best twist ending in a movie ever. James Wan is behind the director's chair in this picture in collaboration with Leigh, and they do a sensational job."

The true horror lies not in the way he murderer's victims die but in the onset of their demise.<br/><br/>On various locations people wake up with either a contraption wrapped around their head. Or they're locked to drainage pipes. You know who you are but you don't know what the heck you're doing at where you woke up.

And will the borderline obsessive Det. Tapp (Danny Glover) help matters any or will he just wreak everything? 'Saw' is a movie worth every penny of the hype it gets; I especially liked how it doesn't assume its viewers are stupid, and the motives of Jigsaw, who acts out his 'games' according to his twisted morality.<br/><br/>It's not a particularly gory movie, though; gorehounds will probably be bored by this.<br/><br/>Of course, the great and tightly paced script written by Whannell and James Wan (the director) and the intense directing, editing, photography and music (I particularly dig the song that is played when Adam realizes WHO and, more importantly, WHERE Jigsaw has been for the whole time) wouldn't work if there weren't actors good enough to pull it off.<br/><br/>But there are; all of them, especially Elwes and Whannell do a damn fine job (I was surprised when I heard Whannell had never acted before!

","Two men wake up in the bathroom from hell with a dead man lying in the middle with a bullet through his brain. The two men have no idea of why they have been brought here. Then one finds a tape labeled with there name. ""Hello Adam, I wanna play a game."" Does a movie need a more intriguing start? Not for me.<br/><br/>Now, at the word ""Saw"", most people cringe because of the things they have read in the tabloids about it, but this film, while having extreme amounts of blood and gore, has one of the greatest story lines and cruel twist endings since Craig was left helpless in that young girl's subconscious in ""Being John Malkovich"" and is one of the smartest psychological thrillers since..... ever! This movie is often overlooked as ""a senseless amount of unnecessary hour - and - a - half blow of violence."" But oh, is it so much more. Not only, as every minute goes by do you want to know more and have your eyes literally stuck to the screen, but the movie shows such a psychological side to it that makes you think a team of expert scientist spawned this creation.<br/><br/>This movie not only explores the thought of human reactions in a panicked state, but shows us how humans really do seem to have the ""Survival Gene"" missing. It also puts forward many clever theories, such as that we become ""Immortal"" when we face death and survive. We finally start being grateful for things and our eyes are widened. Things seem to taste better, and smell better, but it shows that that is usually only active once our own lives are put in danger, but even then, our will power and survival instinct just seem to be missing. And lastly, it really seems that important things seem so much more important once threatened with death.<br/><br/>Although put in the ""Thriller"" category, the movie uses clever horror techniques that still make me laugh with satisfaction. The horror in this movie goes by the theory that ""The most irregular things in life are usually the scariest."" - A clown is usually funny in the day at a carnival, but when it appears down the street at night, standing in the mist of a street light, that is the most scariest thing you will ever see. Examples of this is primarily with the doll, a doll that may have been colorful and a child's play toy once, is now seen as evil and scary and therefore, becomes frightening because ironically, dolls are meant to be a thing of joy. Other elements are exampled in the scene where Adam wakes up in his ""Shit - hole Apartment"" and goes on a chase for the thing in his house. His only source of light is his flash on his camera, which leads the viewer on a series of blank shots in the dark until Jigsaw with his boar mask leaps out, which makes almost every watcher in the room wet themselves, feeding on our tension.<br/><br/>The film goes through a series of traps used on ""victims"", which seem to be very ironic to their crimes or misleading lives. This is shown especially with the suicidal man trapped in a barb maze. He had been cutting himself and Jigsaw decided to see if he truly wanted to die, or was just wanting attention. If he truly wanted to leave this life, he would just stay in the maze to rot, but if he was only seeking attention and wanted to live, he would have to cut himself, again and again and again. As a very realistic sped - up scene of the man panicking and screaming ensues, he finally begins to make his way from the bloody maze. He gets quite far, but in the end, it isn't enough, the timer runs out, the door closes and the maze becomes his own crypt. As the barbs had cut him so deep, enough to spill body acids out, so he seems to die a quick death, quicker than his alternative, that is.<br/><br/>As the movie continues, more and more realistic outcomes of the two men display, and Lawrence's slow descent into madness is one of the best things I have seen in a movie. And every time i show the movie to a friend, they always cringe at the moment when Lawrence ties his shirt around his leg and bites down on his sleeve. They only know too well what is about to happen. And the ending is something that sends a chill through my bones every time as Adam's cruel screaming drowns out all other sounds over the ending credits.<br/><br/>While I love this movie immensely, it still does have some things unexplained, like how could Adam get out of his situation, did he just have to persuade Lawrence not to kill him until the timer runs out? All that aside, this movie is a classic and sheer brilliance. I have seen it at least 10 times now and every time i solve something else in the giant jigsaw - piece puzzle of a movie. This is some experience no amount of alcohol or drugs could ever give. In fact, this movie is a drug in itself."

Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape the perfect fit for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes.

They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open.

","i thought this movie would be like most horror movies: one with lots of violence for shock appeal to lure in teenagers and anyone looking for a scare. for this reason i never planned on seeing it, but boy, was i ever wrong. i caught this flick on the movie channel and was very impressed. the story unfolds more and more as the characters and their motives are developed and the viewer gets a bigger picture of the whole scenario as the movie goes on. i found that the movie caught my interest in full (unexpectedly) and didn't let me down as far as the story and character development goes. not only is it a piece that will have you on the edge of your seat, but you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the end of the movie when you realize how smart the movie actually is. it might even leave you thinking for some time after watching it, like it did with me. i wouldn't even call this a horror flick, its more of a suspenseful thriller. when i found out that this movie was an independent film made on practically no budget at all and was shot in only 18 days, i was all the more impressed.<br/><br/>if you are looking for a hack-em up horror movie with nonstop violence, you will probably appreciate the originality of the film, but will be somewhat disappointed with the lack of violent content in comparison to other horror films. if you like a well thought out plot that fills in gaps as the movie goes on or if you like an intriguing suspense that keeps you guessing, you will probably either like or love this one (assuming that you can stomach the elements of a horror film). all in all, i'd venture to say this movie was just plain great. 9/10"

","This was a good & original horror movie that wasn't my favorite, but I can appreciate. It had cool twists and an original way to kill off people. I thought the ending was trying a little too hard at being original, but it was still cool. Danny Glover couldn't be any more forgettable if he didn't try. I'd give it an 8 out of 10 for originally, twists & wit. But, to me, part 2 is way better and more believable. But this was the start of the franchise and had to start off somewhere, so of course there's gonna be mistakes. But it was real good overall. If you wince or flinch at movies that show messed up ways at getting tortured, then prepare to flinch/wince your behind off. I Did. :)"

","I'd heard both good and bad stuff about this movie, but the thing that made me have to see it was when I heard the word ""sick"" used to describe it. I thought 'that word hasn't been used to refer to a movie since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and look what we got there!' It was official: I had to see this film.<br/><br/>So, when my brother-in-law - also a horror fan - rented it and asked if I'd like to watch it with him, I jumped at the chance.<br/><br/>I found it to be a very creative, original and clever thriller. The idea is brilliant, the reason for the ""bad guy"" to do what he does is well thought out, albeit slightly barmy, but then again, he would have to be a few sandwiches short of a picnic.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that the audience finds itself playing detective along with the on-screen ones, and is as frustrated as they are through the course of the film.<br/><br/>This is a good film, that actually gives you something to think about. The performances are good and, at stages, it is really quite chilling and is far more than a sicko gorefest.<br/><br/>I think one of the things that people who dislike this movie object to is the ending. I think it's a brilliant ending. Anything that gets you shouting ""NO!"" at the screen gets the thumbs up from me Intelligent, thought provoking, gory with a brilliantly nasty twist"
"biggestfanofurs","10","0","2","6 November 2006"," Pure genius! (gives away the twist ending)
","I wasn't in a hurry to see this movie, but my friend rented it for me, so I thought I would give it a chance. And I am SO glad that I did.<br/><br/>From the very beginning you can't take your eyes off. The camera shots, the raw energy, everything from start to finish is just pure genius.<br/><br/>It starts off with so much energy its hard to go wrong. First scene there is a guy in a bathtub, apparently drugged and afraid of drowning... So he unplugs the bathtub. You notice something go down the drain but it is so dark you cant really see what it is. He gets out of the tub to realize he is chained to a pipe by his ankle. He starts screaming, and gets the attention of another male also chained up by his ankle. They cant reach each other, and can only hear each other for the darkness of the room. The one guy (who we learn is a doctor) finds a light on his side of the room and switches it on. They realize they are in an old rundown, unused bathroom. Quite large. Right in between them is a guy face-down, dead with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other hand. Eventually they figure out that they each have a tape that fits the recorder in their back pocket. They are the latest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. The Jigsaw Killer puts the victims up to 'games' that they must complete to keep their lives, and sometimes the lives of their loved ones. The doctor must kill his cell mate by 6:00 somehow, or his wife and daughter will end up dead. They are both chained, and cant reach one another so the task seems impossible... Let alone the fact he doesn't want to kill him. So eventually Jigsaw left enough clues for them to figure out there are 2 handsaws in the toilet tank, apparently to cut through their chains. They each try sawing through the chains with no luck.<br/><br/>Meanwhile throughout flashbacks... You learn all about the Jigsaw Killer. Then thanks to a woman named Amanda. She was also a victim... One who was lucky enough to survive. She told her tell of how she had a mask on her head and her game was to find the key to the mask or it will rip her jaw open. ""Think of it as a reverse bear trap."" So the key, we find out is hidden within the intestine of her ""dead"" cell mate. So the only thing in the room with her (besides the TV she received the 'rules' of the game to) is a knife and a cell mate... Who clearly was not dead as was stated, but actually drugged enough he couldn't feel what was going on. He eventually died, and Amanda went free.<br/><br/>So back in the bathroom the two guys figure out they aren't exactly complete strangers. The doctor was being followed the entire time by the other kid in the room, who gets paid to spy on people. He had pictures and notes on his entire personal life. The doctor had been having troubles at home with his wife, and his daughter felt as if he didn't make enough time for her. While he was out at the ""hospital"" he was cheating on his wife. So all of a sudden he has to figure out if he wants to kill this random stranger, who now he doesn't like so much to save his wife and daughter. Clearly he wants to, but he doesn't know how. Then he finds a box with 2 cigarettes, a bullet, a note and a few other items. It basically says something that makes you think the dead guy in the middle of room was poisoned and couldn't take it so he blew his brains out.<br/><br/>So eventually, near the end of the movie the doctor thinks he knows who Jigsaw is... An orderly at his hospital. His time is running out and he must do something to save his wife and daughter (who we know are both alive due to the fact there is a one way cell phone and the wife and daughter are instructed to call it every so often). So he ends up sawing off his leg, taking the bullet out of the box getting the gun out of the dead guys hand, loading it and shooting the other guy. So then the orderly does end up in the bathroom (after the wife and daughter actually escape from him) to shoot the doctor because he killed the guy too late and ""its the rules"" So right before he shoots him, the other guy you realize only gets shot in the arm, he wakes up and smashes the heck out of the orderly with the toilet tank lid. The doctor says he is going to get help (now that the orderly opened the door and left it open) and assures the guy he will be just fine because he is going to get help. So then the guy that was laying in the middle of the floor DEAD all along... Gets up. Well, big surprise its Jigsaw!!! He says to the guy chained to the pipe ""the key is in the bathtub."" Then you realize that is what floated down the drain in the first scene. So Jigsaw just gets up, turns off the lights and shuts the door. IT IS STUNNING. Fantastic. Your jaw literally drops to the floor. Beautiful. Leaves you speechless and thinking about it for DAYS."

","OK its safe to say that I have seen lots of and love lots of horror movies, and I must say that SAW is the most unique, best acted and best story I have ever seen! I love it! With plot twists from the first minute right to the end. Its about a man called Dr. Gordon and a man called Adam that find them selves locked to pipes in old ruined bathroom with out much knowledge how they got there. With the most unique villain I have seen horror movie (much better that stupid Freddy and Jason)It is my favorite movie and I highly recommend it to any body would loves a story with lots of twists and turns with a bit of gore and a large puzzle like plot."

","Even though some may not find it likable because of the crude dialog, sub-par acting and downright nasty elements, it has to be said that it may be the best horror movie of our times. It is one of the first horror movies where we are not afraid of a monster, or killer... We are afraid of death itself. The feeling of claustrophobia is immense even the second time you watch it. What really makes this movie stand out is it's ending. Such a twist could not have been expected by ANOYNE and caught the audience off guard. When a movie like this makes you leave, get in your car and drive home still thinking ""what the hell happened?"" you know it's good."

","If you are into the whole horror scene, then you should definitely watch this movie! I was hooked from beginning to end. The way the film starts is unexpected and a great way to open. Two guys Adam and Dr.Lawrence Gordon are chained to pipes at opposite ends of the room. Both guys have some kind of relation to each other, but I won't spoil it for you. There is also a dead body in the middle of the room, with a gun and a tape recorder in each hand. They have been put there as part of Jigsaw's (a somewhat vigilante who plays 'games' to test people's dedication to life) games. The ending is unexpected and made me gasp. It turns out the dead body on the floor is Jigsaw all along and not some other guy called Zep that appears to be Jigsaw. The dead body (now known as Jigsaw) locks Adam in the room ending with the memorable words, ""Game Over""."
"mr_popcorn","8","0","1","2 November 2006"," Game over...
","Directed by first timer James Wan and assisted by Leigh Whannell, this film is about two men who lies chained into the ankles in a filthy bathroom and a dead man between them. Adam (Leigh Whannell) receives a message from a tape recorder he found in his pocket. It says that he may die in the room he is in unless he does something about it. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) also receives a message from a videotape and tells him that he must kill Adam within six hours or his family will die. He then receives a bullet and an unknown key. We are then indulged into numerous flashbacks that reveals why they got there and who is their captor. Their captor, is then revealed to be a serial killer named 'Jigsaw' portrayed by Tobin Bell who uses sick games to murder his victims yet he claims that he hasn't killed anyone. Its up to his victims whether they die or not.<br/><br/>The movie is outstanding in many ways. The concept was just darn good. Its not your average slasher, run-here-scream-there film, it has more sense and they put more meaning to it. The cast, though its the first time that I've seen them, were great too. Adam's agonizing scream at the end has had me sleepless nights and bad dreams. And its also the first time that I felt sympathy to the villain. He don't kill people for nothing. He has a reason. Its not just some big guy who slashes people just because they trespassed his territory or something. Jigsaw kills people who don't appreciate life, the ones who don't deserve it. A 9/10 for a smart horror flick."
"edred33","7","0","1","1 November 2006"," Interesting idea
","I do admire this film for its original ideas and concepts. It manages to not just frighten the audience with its shocking intense gore and violence but also manages to slowly freak out the audience when it puts the characters in sick disturbing situations, like the guy in a cage full of razor blades or the woman that has to dig for keys in a guys stomach (he wakes up). This is one of the first horror films to cause such a scare but with the killer not actually coming in contact with his victims. He doesn't just do that but he also creates a situation when his victims have to kill each other, thats the most disturbing part in my opinion. I also admire the fact that there are more or less two stories going on at the same time throughout the whole film. The main plot with two trapped victims and then the two cops trying to catch the killer. I think horrors manage to create more terror and intensity if they follow the same characters through the film but in a fatal and horrible situation, and thats exactly what this film does. It also manages to give a very detailed background story of all the main characters. One last good point about this film is the acting, i think the acting is very realistically portrayed and intense. One bad thing about this films that it has its corny scenes and also seems to have slightly typical (horror) Hollywood film characters. All in all i think this film is a masterpiece in its own right and a classic original film for the horror collection. If you like horror films you should 100% see this film, and if you don't like horrors see it anyway."

","I will admit that I was hesitant to watch this film, seeing the previews and hearing the gossip of it. I eventually sat down with some friends, and watched it, and waited for the most horrific moments to appear before me, but they never did.<br/><br/>The film does have much gore and blood, but what good horror movie doesn't? ""Saw"", I can now say, is one of my more favorite horror movies to watch. A great Halloween movie to watch with the adults, not the children so much, they WILL be terrified. The effects in the movie are awesomely done, and the layout of the film itself is spectacular.<br/><br/>And Jigsaw, a sadistic, psychopath killer. God bless the writers and the director for creating another horror icon. This guy is just brilliant when it comes to killing people. All the different ""games"" he likes to play with his victims. And his motive, wanting people to care more about their lives, is ironic, because the entire time, the victims are trying to escape his traps.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Saw"" is a great horror movie that is best enjoyed with company and late at night.

"Degrassi293","10","0","1","31 October 2006"," One of the best films in a long time.
","Many horror films today are becoming less and less creative and less truly scary. Saw is one of the only exceptions. It is a great film. It masterfully combines the elements of surprise, gore, emotion, suspense, mystery, tragedy, cliff-hanging, dread, questioning, everything that every horror movie should have. Although it's previews were lacking and didn't do a great job of showing how amazing the movie is, the movie itself is incredible and addicting. You'll want to watch it again and again. It'll make you long for the sequels and hope that they are as great as the original. It'll make you thirst for more and more. You'll want to know everything you can about it. Saw is truly a great piece of work."
"blanbrn","8","0","1","31 October 2006"," Clever. Heart pounding fright and terror. The birth of a new horror franchise.
","Saw when first released in 2004, the low budget horror flick, wasn't expected to do much, but guess what surprise over 100 million! It looks as if though James Wan has founded a new horror gem. When I finally viewed it I was amazed at the clever plot and bloody gore. Saw is well done, well shot as it tries to teach us morals. Only these life lessons are taught by a new sadistic serial killer Jigsaw, who abducts his morally wayward and he puts each in a horrific game of cat and mouse survival. The abducted must fight for life or die in the process. And some of Jigsaw's methods are clever and cruel such as chaining victims feet together, strapping people to seats with leather even ranging from fire torture and barb wire cutting methods how cruel and sick! Saw begins with Carry Elwes who plays an abducted doctor who is chained up with an abducted photographer, the cat and mouse game is clever and sickening, as Jigsaw watches both thru camera and makes cell phone calls to them! The Elwes character is unaware that Jigsaw has held hostage his wife and daughter, and the only way they survive is that the photo man must die. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega give fine performances as the wife and daughter of the Elwes's character. It is just so sad and sickening though when the sadistic killer has both the Monica and Makenzie characters bound, tied up and gagged. As while both are pleading for mercy the crazy uses a stethoscope to check the fright and fast heartbeat of Makenzie while he points a gun to Monica's head, how terrifying as they both scream and cry thru their gagged mouths. Really a tough scene, overall this film is frightening in a way that disturbs the mind as a dangerous game that's tough to win, it seems only the lucky survive. Saw is a must see it was good to finally see a new twist and take on the horror genre with Jigsaw. I must finally say a thumbs up for James Wan's clever new fright franchise."
"strangla35","7","0","1","28 October 2006"," Pretty original... definitely worth seeing.
","No doubt, today's horror genre is filled to the brim with tired, worn-out clichés, predictable plots and settings, and ""scare"" attempts that frankly, would put me to sleep faster than a tranquilizer dart to the jugular vein. I'll be honest, I'm not a big horror fan. Usually, the only horror films I REALLY like are the classic masterpieces---The Shining, The Exorcist, Misery, etc. I was much more of a horror fan when I first saw this movie (almost exactly two years ago, when it was in theaters), so the fact that it still retains a certain degree of respect from me and a special place in my heart really says something about it. I'm giving this movie seven stars, although I would give it a 7.5.<br/><br/>I have now viewed the entire ""Saw"" trilogy---I just watched the latest installment last night. And now, I feel compelled to write reviews for all three films.<br/><br/>""How much blood will you shed to stay alive?"" was the tag-line for this movie. And indeed, it was applicable in many places throughout the film. Would you hack into the stomach of a living (albeit heavily drugged) person to save your own life? Would you shoot someone you barely knew in order to save yourself and your family? Would you sever one of your own limbs if it was your only means of escape? These are situations that are explored in gruesome detail throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The story is that there's a unique serial killer out there who puts unsuspecting hapless souls into desperate situations whereupon, by their own action or inaction, they become victims of some truly gruesome endings. There's a lot of flash-backs and secondary stories, but the main course of the movie involves two men who wake up in what appears to be the scummy remnants of some abandoned restroom, chained by leg shackles on opposite sides of the room. There is a body resting face-down in a pool of blood between them, clutching a revolver and a tape recorder. Both men discover audio tapes in their possession that feature a dark, raspy voice telling them the rules of the ""game"", and also warning them of the consequences they face should they fail to fulfill their objectives.<br/><br/>Strangely, unlike many horror films involving psychopaths, the mystery of the identity of the killer is not the only thing that keeps us glued to the screen. Of course, we wonder about it (as do the characters on-screen), but many times, it is treated as something of almost secondary importance. This is not to say that the movie doesn't tease us about it, but it relies on much more than a stupid guessing game to keep us interested. As we come to know the characters more and more, we come to sympathize with them, at least to a degree, because the situations they are forced to endure are things that most of us wouldn't wish on our worst enemies.<br/><br/>The film doesn't focus so much on the killer and his inner self as it does on the story and lives of the victims. Don't get me wrong---the killer has his places in the movie, but he's more or less a masked phantom figure that chooses only to observe the situations he rigs into place, rather than directly interact with them.<br/><br/>In real life, the situations that are masterminded by the killer in this movie (and in the succeeding two films) probably wouldn't play out as smoothly to his liking or prediction as they do. However, that almost goes without saying; in the movie world, the unlikely becomes very plausible.<br/><br/>Also, unfortunately, the acting is quite sub-par in certain parts. Cary Elwes, in particular, is kind of... well, lame. There's scenes where the acting makes you go ""Uughh, come ON."" That's the main weakness of the film. If you can withstand those certain scenes of rickety performances though, it's quite easy to enjoy the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This movie definitely relies on some of its impact through gratuitous bloodshed---even though it doesn't come anywhere near the level of grotesque gore of the succeeding two installments, that is definitely where some of its ammunition is stocked. Part of it is also the sheer sadistic creativity of the traps that are placed for the characters on-screen. One thing I really like about this film is that it relies on very little of that annoying ""having things pop up on the screen so we can get the highly strung audience members to jump up in their seats"" technique. Oh yeah, and part of the impact comes at the end, which features a huge, unexpected twist. Frankly, I thought that said twist was ingenious.<br/><br/>In any case, this is definitely a horror film that deserves recognition, because it is certainly far better than many of its competitors, and in a genre that is so filled over-the-top with lame excuses of celluloid crap, that is always a relief."

","THE NEXT LEVEL???<br/><br/>Is it just me or do you find that all the horror movies we have coming out these days, are pretty much the same as each other. You've got the typical bad guy costume with the long black cloak and the freaky looking mask. Most of them tend to prey on dim-witted teenagers which you could convince to do anything, who are usually on summer vacation or some other American holiday. Then would you believe it, they either all end up dead, miraculously find themselves able to escape the evil villain, or at some point during the film they manage to produce some sought of intelligence and come up with a plan to defeat the wicked killing machine. So you find yourself not bothering with the new movies and sticking to the old classics, for instance, The Shining. Those two simple words ""here's Johnny"", some how find a way of gluing themselves permanently into the head of every Jack Nicholson fan out there. My theory is .. No one will ever be able to create a movie that could even be compared, to The Shining. <br/><br/>But guess what.have we finally reached the next level? My theory has just been cut into tiny pieces, with an extremely well crafted  SAW!<br/><br/>Two men (Leigh Whannell + Cary Elwes) wake up and find themselves in a dirty, disused bathroom, Chained to pipes at opposite sides of the room. Between them lies a slaughtered man with a tape player in one hand, and a gun in the other. It's not to long before each of them finds a tape in their pocket, and they soon come to realise that they are the latest victims of 'The Jigsaw Killer'. With only a certain amount of time and clues, the two men are hurled into a game of lies, deceit and murder. 'Let The Game Begin!'<br/><br/>My first attempt of watching this film was some time ago, as soon as it was released on DVD I knew I had to watch it. Luckily, my sister had brought it a week after its release date (getting a film to scare her is like getting a man to get in touch with his feminine side). As I recall, I think I watched about 10 to 15 minutes of the movie before it had freaked me out so badly I ended up running away with my tail in between my legs, so to speak. By the second night I had told myself that was going to watch the movie from beginning to end. Well, let's just say it got my adrenalin going extraordinarily well. <br/><br/>James Wan, director and writer of the horror, I believe to be one of the best film creators out there. As James has only directed 5 movies in his lifetime so far, I think we would all be right in saying that he's definitely got a natural talent in the movie business. James has also made other masterpieces such as, 'Stygian' and 'Dead Silence'. Look out for his latest movie 'Death Silence', which I believe is due to be released in 2007. Although I am a fan of James's work, I've always felt the need to state my opinion, even when the matter in hand has absolutely none of my business. But, I do recommend that James seek some serious sociological help, because he did create an intensely disturbing and extremely graphical movie. But, maybe we can overlook that?<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed watching the horror movie (once I plucked up the courage to watch it). The story line kept me gripped from beginning to end, and the film definitely has the element of surprise. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to be mentally disturbed for the rest their life. <br/><br/>Although the film is certified as 18 for a reason, I strongly advise that people take notice of this. This film also contains a lot of gore, so it might be a good idea to let your dinner go down before slipping it into the DVD player.<br/><br/>'Game Over!' <br/><br/>Review by Wendy Tomsett"

","Two men wake up in an isolated room only to find themselves chained by their feet to walls from a distance from each other. Neither of them have any idea where they are, how they got there or who might have kidnapped them. Soon they discover clues as to what they need to do to survive this sick test, designed by a maniac who is referred to as the ""Jigsaw"".<br/><br/>Saw grasps you from its very first moment until the end. The idea that a killer designing traps in where he places people so they will end up either killing themselves or escape with serious bodily injuries is quite horrifying. And yet, it still has a message: Jigsaw is trying to teach his victims the value of life. The story is structured very well. As two men (Adam and Dr. Gordon) start talking to each other they discover certain connections between each other and their relation to the Jigsaw. The story is two-fold, past and present: we go back in time to see the victims' past connections and we also see them co-operating to get of the situation they are presently in. But all those connections are revealed gradually serving very well to the building suspense.<br/><br/>As you might expect, there are some gruesome scenes in the movie but they are not gratuitous. Even though we are used to seeing some many twists at the end (it seems ever since ""The Sixth Sense"", every thriller/suspense movie must have a surprise ending), SAW still manages to surprise us at the end with a shocking ending. I highly recommend it to all horror fans."

","Though the movie wasn't anything worth watching once a week, I must say that anyone with a name that alludes to Casablanca should NOT be watching a movie with obvious gore and/or gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>The movie had a consistent story-line that didn't go too far ahead of the audience. At the same time, rhetorical situations like ""You can do this, or die,"" allow the audience for further participation VIA deciding if they would rather gut someone or die.<br/><br/>The gore, albeit over-done, was tasteful. Though the masses are fairly uneducated in the fields of medicine, they know well enough that a romp through barbed wire can surely tear ones insides out.<br/><br/>The situations were just odd enough for the average person to understand. One person may not know what it feels like to be cut with a scalpel, while another surely knows how it feels to walk through glass. <br/><br/>A movie for someone who doesn't mind gore, and can see past it well enough to take in the story."
"jluis1984","7","0","1","14 September 2006"," Very good horror film!
","Before ""Saw"" premiered at Sundance festival in January 2004, few could have imagined that this new horror film would be part of a new wave of horror films that brought back gore and violence to the screens and moved away from the now formulaic style of self-referential teen slashers started with Wes Craven's ""Scream"" back in 1996. To call ""Saw"" revolutionary would be an exaggeration, but it's fair to point out that it was among the very the first of this resurgence that received wide public acclaim and became popular in mainstream crowds, proving that an R-rated horror film still can achieve financial success.<br/><br/>""Saw"" begins with two men waking up in an old, and apparently abandoned industrial washroom. They don't know each other, and apparently the only thing they have in common is that they are both chained to the pipes with only a small saw as a tool, not enough to cut the chain, but good enough to cut their feet. Trapped in this nightmarish scenario, the men try to figure out an escape to their situation, and get to know each other; one is a young photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) and the other is a surgeon named Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). Lawrence realizes they have been kidnapped by the notorious serial killer named ""Jigsaw"", a man who puts their victims in deadly situations that most of the times lead to their deaths.<br/><br/>Written by Leigh Whannell and director James Wan, ""Saw"" gives a new edge to the serial killer stories turning what otherwise would be another thriller into a full-fledged horror movie. The premise of the film is quite original, and via flashbacks we discover the past of both Gordon and Adam, as well as the story of this killer named Jigsaw, whose identity is a mystery and seems to be destined to be the bogeyman of this decade. Full of plot twists and with a cleverly hidden secret, the film keeps the mystery until the end, making an enjoyable and for the most part rewarding thriller.<br/><br/>But as written above, ""Saw"" goes beyond the common conception of ""thriller"" and adds a horror edge closer to 70s grind-house than to otherwise similar films like ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"". Director James Wan focuses on the graphic violence of Jigsaw deathtraps and makes ""Saw"" a visually different kind of film, delivering a very good mix of detective story and gory horror film. However, Wan can't escape the influence of music videos and the now-clichéd use of shaky camera and rapid cuts. At times the overuse of this device breaks the suspenseful pace of the film in sadly awful ways.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part effective, without nothing really spectacular, although good considering the budget. Leigh Whannell delivers a good performance and while Elwes' accent at time slips out, he is a nice counterpart for Whannell's character. Danny Glover and Ken Leung appear in supporting roles, as the cops following Jigsaw's case. the two have great chemistry together, but it's safe to say Leung steals most of the scenes they share.<br/><br/>""Saw"" suffers a lot from the extensive overuse of that music video style described above. Together with the metal soundtrack completely break the atmosphere of the story and look strange and out of place (as the characters are far from teenagers). The flashbacks are for the most part a well used device, although they too tend to break the momentum from time to time. Most critics have labeled the script of ""unbelievable"" and numerate the many plot holes the film has, and while they are right in many ways, ""Saw"" manages to work fine with all those plot holes because in the end, the core story is well-handled.<br/><br/>In some way, ""Saw"" came up as a wake up call for the horror genre, in many ways superior to previous attempts to revive the genre like ""Cabin Fever"", but still far from perfect. Still, it's safe to say that James Wan and Leigh Whannell have crafted a nice and original new entry in the genre and may represent a new source of thrills in the future. While maybe not a classic yet, ""Saw"" is a very recommended films for fans and non-fans of the horror genre. 7/10"

","Two men named Adam and Lawrence wake up chained to pipes in a filthy bathroom with a corpse lying on the floor. they slowly realise that they are the latest victims of the ""Jigsaw Killer"", a madman who is known to not kill people but to get his victims to kill themselves in his twisted games such as finding antidotes for slow acting poisons and crawling through sharp objects towards a door before it seals shut.<br/><br/>Lawrence is instructed to kill Adam so his wife, daughter and his own lives will be spared but the time is ticking.<br/><br/>I think this film sets a new standard of horror, the camera-work is brilliant and the acting is pretty good, but the main reason is the claustrophobic setting and the throughout tension created by not knowing whats going to happen next unlike the Friday the 13th series when every death is pretty predictable.<br/><br/>The gritty picture gives it the feel of a horror movie, I also liked the puppet which kind of reflects some peoples fears of ventriloquists dummies and china faced dolls when they were young.<br/><br/>Overall, The film is a must see for all horror fans and the following quote by David Quantick on 28 days later is what I would say about Saw ""I've never been so frightened by a modern film in my life""."

","Keeping it short, I have to say that there are many good things about this film. The storyline, the plot twists, the scares - all spot-on. If you like horror films and thrillers, you'll really like this regardless of what I'm about to add... there are just two things that let the film down:<br/><br/>1) Cary Elwes - Despite seeing him in a number of films, I still don't know how to pronounce his surname. Generally he's good in most films, (especially Glory), but in this his limitations really are shown. At the end of the film I was laughing because he had such trouble acting scared, which really detracted from the film. The fake stuttering is the worst part. It's not his fault, not everyone can act scared, but if you can't do it then you shouldn't appear in this kind of movie.<br/><br/>2) Cary Elwes' makeup - Maybe they wanted him to look like a distinguished doctor, who knows? To me he looks like someone threw a bag of flour over him. Rather than treating patients, it's easy to think that he actually spends most of his time baking cakes...<br/><br/>So overall, a very good film, but sadly let down by some minor (but in my opinion important) issues."

We were finally out of the WB, UPN horror generation of self mockery and now back into the glory days of the late 70's and all of the 80's when the blood was king. Thank you James Wan and Leigh Whanell, you are gods who are now as high up as the masters Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, and the best Sean S. Cunningham. This movie changed the world. The acting was a little choppy but who cares when you are rewarded as well as this film does. The killer Jigsaw or John Creamer as we would learn in the follow up is now already as noticed as Jason, Michael, Freddy, and Leatherface.

","I viewed this movie about a year ago, and because of all the internet buzz i expected a whole lot. Usually when this is the case the actual movie is a disappointment, because my expectations tend to get too high, but not in this case....<br/><br/>i don't get frightened by a movie that often, but in the case of Saw i sat in front of the television with a very unpleasant (but yet pleasant :-)) feeling in my stomach. the whole movie breathes an unpleasant atmosphere, and although the acting isn""t top notch (sometimes even ""overacted"")you really feel for the people in the bathroom. Also the actual killing scenes aren't all that gory, but they are shown in a way that makes your skin crawl (except for the actual 'sawing scene"" that actually WAS gory)<br/><br/>I was also told the movie had a surprise ending, but when the end of the movie was getting nearer and nearer, i was afraid that the ending would actually disappoint me, boy was i wrong..... I'm not going to put it here because i don't want to spoil it for the people who haven't seen it yet, but those who saw it will understand me if i say i was blown away. I was staring at my screen for an few moments in utter surprise after the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>that being said i can honestly say that if you like exciting movies, and horror in particular, THIS is the movie you wanna go see!

"Evil_Magus","6","0","2","15 July 2006"," Starts With a Bang, and the End Saves it From Ending With a Whimper.
","I happened to catch Saw the other night (being that, during the wee hours of 12:00AM and 1:00 AM, the only watchable thing on TV are horror movies). I expected next to nothing from this, other than a good shock. I'd seen the commercials, which didn't make me want to see it. I'd heard the mediocre reviews from the critics, which didn't compel me, and the raving reviews from some of my friends (which didn't compel me to watch it either, as we don't share common tastes in movies). I say this because I must; it's necessary to understand my review. I chose this movie on the SOLE basis that it was late, I didn't feel like going to bed yet, and there was absolutely nothing else worth watching. I expected absolutely nothing, but was surprised to find a decent bit more.<br/><br/>I'll begin with the acting. The acting is extremely uneven. In the beginning it was quite good; not great, understand, but definitely above-average. This lasted for roughly the first 30 or 45 minutes. The acting then shifted to a realm somewhere between average and sub-par. It was definitely palette-able, but a noticeable step down from where it had been. I began to think outside of the film and started analyzing (which is never a good move for any movie to make, because the shift from quality to something less than that rarely shifts upward again). <br/><br/>This lasted for a little while until a third shift happened that lasted for most of the remainder of the movie. The acting became unquestionably horrid. Believability of character was shattered and the quality of performance gave way to utterly terrible work. Moaning, screaming, crying and wailing replaced dialog and action (although this might be more of a writing problem), and I thought that, just as the poem says, it would end, not with a bang, but with a whimper. In fact, I was sure of this, and wanted nothing more than for the movie to end. Literally every second that ticked off of the clock lessened my opinion of the movie, and I wanted to think of it as best as I could; I really did. It grew painful to watch. But, then, something happened. In roughly the last five or ten minutes of the movie the acting picked up and became, once again, above average. This trend occurred with the cast in general, and not in any singular member of it. This above trend is not reserved only for acting, but to the entire film. The story grabbed the viewer right away, and for roughly the first 45 minutes I was enthralled in what was happening. I, literally, nearly threw up (in a good way). This never happens to me, where I have such a violent reaction to a film (although the feeling subsided after a while). That this movie could have that effect on me was a wonder, and a testament to it's quality. For this rare occasion, I was literally horrified of the movie that I was watching.<br/><br/>However, this soon gave way. The compelling story died away with the acting, the gritty dialog (gritty, not witty, by any means) became intolerable. The quasi-complex characters that had been developed somewhat fell apart until the only thing that was left was the doctor's annoying-as-Hell moaning in the background.<br/><br/>But this, too, gave way. Right when I found the police-man's actions implausible, right when I thought that I could stand the pathetic moaning no more, right when I thought that what had begun so wonderfully was utterly ruined, the last ten minutes saved this film. I won't ruin it for anybody, but the twist at the end really saved this movie, and brought it back around to what it had started as. While it wasn't enough to make up for the previous... half hour... it was certainly more than enough to save it from a bad review.<br/><br/>There are some parts of this film that just bothered me. The car-chasing scene was terribly shot. I understand that it was shot on a very thin budget, but it looked exactly like what they were doing (set in a dark garage, with people rocking the car to make it appear in motion). I'm sure that there had to be a better way to shoot it then that. The police officer's character near the end became confusing and I was unsure of the exact time-table that the movie had acted upon. The character of the doctor was intolerable from after the first 45 minutes, and continued as such until the end. I found the puppet annoying, but still rather creepy.<br/><br/>This movie is not Se7en, which some people seem to think it is and then are angry when it disappoints. I do, however, understand the comparisons drawn between the two movies. In many ways they are similar, but they're still two very distinct, very different, movies. The directing is tolerable, but far from brilliant (I'd place it in league with the remake of Dawn of the Dead).<br/><br/>This is an extremely gripping, shocking and horrific movie. It's a tremendous achievement in horror, and should be commended for the boundaries it's both stretched and broken. I'd recommend this movie to horror fans only, as I doubt anybody but horror fans will like Saw. I'd recommend to save it until you're alone, at midnight, in a dark room, for maximum effect."

I read it a review by Leonard Maltin i think where he compared it to Se7en another movie I love i thought spaceys sinister villain was very creepy and I thought the overall story to be interesting. Both dealed with some messy subject matter ( well you had to use your imagination with ""Se7en"" ) ,both have great endings so I'm asking what movie u guys would choose? ...personally i think Se7ens better"

","One of the best thriller/mysteries to come out in a while. This film just trapped me n engaged me from the beginning. The performances were first rate, the plot was perfectly crafted, screenplay was written pretty carefully and crafted perfectly. I liked Elwes a lot in this film, just shows how much of a talented actor he is. Wan did a great job with this project, this is one of my favorite thrillers ever. The screenplay is what shocked me because it was perfectly written with great funny parts and good story telling scheme. The cast delivered and the suspense was exhilarating throughout the film. This is one of those films a lot of people liked and i thought would be regarded by me as overrated, however i was wrong, its worth the recognition it receives. 10/10"

","""SAW"" has to be the best thriller I've watched so far. From beginning to end I did nothing but sit in the lounge and have my eyes glued to the TV. The movie captured my attention, as I had watched Scary Movie 4, and recognized the scene. The way that the film makes you feel, it's incredible. I don't know if I was shaking cause I was cold, or cause I was nervous about what was about to happen. The ending of the film completely astonished me! I never expected the dead man lying in the room the whole time, to actually be ""Jigsaw"". When the guy pulled out the tape player from the guy's( who he just bashed to death) jacket, the whole story started to come together like a Jigsaw. ( Sounds suitable.) But the biggest shocker of the whole ending, was that it was the man from the hospital. I had to explain it to my mum, cause she didn't quite understand. But I understood it completely, and I can't get over how they put it together so well! A job well done on this project! Definitely 10/10! A must see thriller!"

","Now when you are asked to watch a movie called Saw, where two people are locked in a dis-used bathroom with merely two saws, you should logically give an answer in the ifermative. But Saw is not your average splatter movie. With Jerry from Liar Liar and the main bad man from 24 season 2, as the infamous jigsaw killer, your in for a bit of fun. With the 18 certificate reasonably expected for a movie like this, but it is not the gore from inside the bathroom which effects the rating. With flash backs to gruesome murders previously made by Jigsaw, just designed to waste time, 1 hour and thirty minutes in a bathroom could'nt be achieved, even Phone Booth lasted for 1 hour 20. The other story line follows Lethal Weapon star Danny Glover who is hard on the trail of Jigsaw. But will he find the two in the bathroom before its too late. Oh and there is a foot on the front for a reason. A brilliant film with a superb twist to follow. Saw 2 was also very good but not as brilliant as the original. Dare you see saw?"

Of course, the movie doesn't ONLY take in there, it also explains other things, about who is the guy that does all the killing.

","This is a great film. It grabs you at the start and holds you right to the end. It's quite unlike anything you have ever seen before, and is thought-provoking as well as entertaining.<br/><br/>One of the best things about it is Leigh Whannell, who I thought gave a great performance. The one niggle that prompts me to give it a 9 rather than a 10 is Danny Glover, I'm afraid. His portrayal of the troubled policeman lacks substance and holds the film back. But this is a minor drawback really, and the pace of the film, together with the quality of the other performances and the series of brilliant twists, easily overcomes it and holds the movie together.<br/><br/>I'd recommend 'Saw' to anyone who enjoys good acting and a good script, built around an original and compelling idea.

","you can see Jigsaw's finger move on his left hand when Dr. Gordon crawls by Jigsaw when he's about to shoot Adam 1hr 32min and 6 seconds into the movie. I laughed because I don't think he meant to move and so the ending isn't surprising. Also in the second movie the girl being the bad guy was predictable because while everyone else was being sick from the deadly nerve gas they were breathing she didn't show signs of being sick like the other people were. I just think the big dude in Saw 2 was stupid because he didn't work together with the other people he was keeping the number on the back of the head a secret which is so stupid because they could have beat the game had they worked together. Also Danny Glover was stupid for not killing Jigsaw while he had the chance instead gets sliced with the knife in Jigsaw's coat."

","Saw is one of those sort of movies where the less said about it the better.... but the whole plot surrounds two men who wake up chained in a dirty bathroom who soon discover they are playing a psychopath's game where the only way to escape is for one man to kill the other...<br/><br/>Saw is a pretty interesting movie for the most part - with heaps of plot twists and ""killer"" scenes - it delivers the requisite thrills and chills that a good horror/thriller movie should.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are just soo squirming disturbing - it should have the horror fans begging for more...<br/><br/>But for all its pluses - I find that the acting in Saw is a little undercooked. Leigh Whannell, an ex-Australian TV presenter feels a little out of his depth in the more emotional scenes (not to mention that his accent seems to drop in and out of being Aussie) and Cary Elwes character seems to go from ""perfectly sane"" to ""insanely mad"" in about two seconds at the climax of the film.

"Sfpsycho415","8","0","2","9 May 2006"," One of the best horror/thrillers since The Shining, and possibly the best ending ever-----8/10
","Saw crept up on us like Jigsaw creeps on his victim. Completely out of nowhere but not easily forgotten. The movie starts of in a large bathroom where two men are chained up and a dead man is lying between them. They don't who each other is or how they got there. The script by Leigh Whannell (who also plays one of the captives) is ingeniously clever and very twisted especially when showing different victims in various booby traps and deadly. My favorite is the guy that is locked in a room with numbers all over the wall. A taped message tells him there is poison in his veins and that the antidote is locked in a safe in the room. The combo to the safe is hidden in the numbers on the wall. However, the room is dark and he has to use a candle, but his body is smeared with a flammable goop. Oh and there is broken glass shards on the floor. Now only a truly sick individual can come up with something like that. The movie really isn't as gory as many people believe, but it wouldn't make a difference in a movie that actually relies on mystery rather than horror. The whole movie is really solid, but the part that makes the movie a highly rewatchable classic is the brilliant ending. I promise you will be shocked at the ending. Even after the third viewing it had my heart pounding through my chest. This movie also kicked off an interest in me for independent films. They seem to be made with more TLC than most Hollywood stuff, but of course since this movie made big bucks at the box office it is turning into a franchise with two sequels in two years. Neither will be as entertaining as the original and not too many movies have the ability to make you watch it over and over. Bravo! 8/10"

","I heard a few mixed things about Saw before I watched it, some people said it was really bad, some said it was really good, and others said it freaked them out, but one thing I noticed was that people couldn't stop talking about it, so I decided to be brave and watch it, and I was very surprised.<br/><br/>Saw is a very superior thriller. It is no where near as gruesome as it is described. It is more psychological than anything, with the characters dealing with the predicament they are in, the history of Jigsaw, and the terrifying recollection of a survivor of one of his games.<br/><br/>This film would have been perfect if it had not been for a few faults. For one thing, the movie is just far too short. Danny Glover's character could really have done with some more screen time, and it would have been nice to see a lot more Dina Meyer. Also, the plot seems to begin to resolve a little too quickly, how the characters know each other and how they are connected. This could have done with a little more development.<br/><br/>No problems with the acting, and considering every scene was filmed as a rehearsal, just imagine what it would be like if it was given a little more production time.<br/><br/>So, all in all, good stuff.

I sat there on the edge of my seat waiting to see what else Jigsaw would throw there way. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised at Cary Elwes acting too. I'd only ever seen him in Hot Shots, Robin Hood Men in Tights and Liar Liar. He should move into the Horror or Thriller genre.

They soon realise they are playing one of the ""Jigsaw"" killer's sick games, in which he teaches the victims how much life is worth.<br/><br/>High on logic and (reasonably) low on gore, James Wan and Leigh Whannell seem to unmask the killer pretty early on in the film, before cleverly misdirecting you.

The rest of the cast were great in whatever roles they had to play.<br/><br/>I however seem to have a problem with this movie being slotted as a horror because somehow i didn't quite see it as one maybe i am from the old school where horror always implies some otherworldly elements.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movies are the plot and character holes some of them are:- 1)The detectives who are obviously trained to think on their feet and are probable well versed with detaining criminals behaved in a matter most inappropriate to their training, even a normal person would have behaved in a manner that would have much better outcome then what we saw when trained professionals confronted a known possibly armed murderer.The circumstances had to be different and more difficult for the outcome to be the one we saw.<br/><br/>2) The ending though thrilling seems unbelievable in otherwise a believable movie.<br/><br/>3)Also the intelligence and resourcefulness shown by the protagonists throughout the film was absent and could have easily have prevented what was another memorable scene. Again the circumstance could have been different for what had happened to happen.<br/><br/>(however these things though annoying were important in the movie and don't harm the movie much) Save for this everything about this movie was brilliant and although i am not a great fan of the brushed up versions of such films i thoroughly enjoyed the R rated version.<br/><br/>A movie that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, its not one of those high brow , arty festival premium release movie that it has been wrongly positioned as.<br/><br/>Do watch this film."

When I did, I loved it. There was not a moment that I thought I don't want to be here watching this film. I watched with a friend very much like me, and we had the best time watching it, being terrified the whole time, and loving every minute! Not only was the story amazing, but also I thought that the acting was some of the best acting I had ever seen. The fact that the director never shows you what is actually happening (i.e. you never see first hand the horrific things that are going on, for example the scene with the girl in the bear trap, you don't see her cutting into her friend) is what I consider to be the sign of a great director, the human imagination is going to create something much more realistic than a movie can. But it is the actors that create these images because of what they are doing because of what they are supposedly seeing. I may be alone, but I thought Adam's reaction to the horrific ending was Oscar winning, and it brought the whole scene the excellence in needed for the brilliant ending to this incredible ground breaking film.<br/><br/>After this, I can't stop; I have become an addict to the horror genre.

That's the secret that Hitchcock knew and used to perfection. Not knowing a thing about this movie, I was completely unaware of the storyline or what secrets the filmmakers were going to throw at me. From the very beginning, I was completely in the hands of the filmmakers and they played me like a fiddle - misleading me, confusing me and ultimately scaring the bejesus out of me.

"vertigo_14","7","0","2","2 April 2006"," The Culture of Morbidity. (spoilers)
","If there is one thing that American filmmakers seem to possess little talent with these days, it's horror films, sometimes trying to replicate the unmatched genius of Japanese cohorts (although in this case, the reverse has happened with one segment of 'The Three Extremes' trying to copy 'Saw'). The result of which is often an abundance of amazingly bad remakes and other failed efforts, plenty of which were produced in the past five years alone.<br/><br/>But 'Saw,' although not it's sequel (which refuses to experiment further in novel elements), actually manages to accomplish an effective amount of suspense. It may be the instincts of young Malaysian director, James Wan (who hails from Australia), who may have immersed himself in Asian horror film-making and therefore, fine-tuned his own craft accordingly.<br/><br/>True, the story of a rather vigilante dying man who is ""playing god"" by personally endowing punishment on those who he believe is worthy of it is nothing new. Several of the psychopath tales, especially of psychopaths with sophisticated torture trials, has been done in the past quite a few number of times.<br/><br/>Here, the Jigsaw (aka, the psychopath) has imprisoned two men (among others) and forces upon them an elaborate game whereby one must kill the other by a particular time or risk the death of his family. Despite the extremely grotesque show (made more acute by green tinting and Cary Elwes increasingly pale and almost zombie-like complexion), the undying suspense does not come from cheap scare tactics trying to reinvigorate bored audiences as say, films like The Ring does. Rather, it is all authentic suspense that continues with the never-ending action and uncertainty on-screen. The audio elements provide much of the thrill as well, particularly in the climax of the film where the men's screams are coupled with pounding overdrive chords and other arrangements intended to churn your stomach and get your heart racing just a little more.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a good, American horror film, but are skeptical based on so many laughable and embarrassing productions to have come out in recent years, I would suggest giving this one a chance."

"barrydwriter","9","0","1","1 April 2006"," Fresh, Unique, and Original...with just a few flaws
","First, a spoiler warning: ! ! ! S P O I L E R S ! ! ! I've seen this movie three times now, and I can safely say that what we have here is a fresh, unique spin on the serial killer genre, and although it's marginally flawed, the good outweighs the bad, and it ultimately leaves me applauding every time.<br/><br/>I could spend days writing about the better parts of this movie and not even come close to finishing - so, instead I'll focus on the minimal problems I had with it. There are only three of them, so it's easy to explain.<br/><br/>First off, I just don't like Cary Elwes, at least not in this movie. His character is one thing, but his delivery leaves me feeling that Dr. Gordon is an unlikeable jerk. Maybe that's exactly what we're supposed to feel, but maybe it also says something about Mr. Elwes' personality - either way, I am definitely bored (even annoyed) with his melodramatic reactions in the second half of the flick. Oh, and he has infinitely better chemistry with Jigsaw's secret notes than he does with his family - the whole bit with playing ""This Little Piggy"" with his daughter was laughable. But enough about Mr. Elwes, and onto the more concrete problems that could - and should - have been so much better.<br/><br/>My next problem is actually in two separate scenes, both of which involve completely different characters...and yet both result same in the same annoying turnout for the same annoying reason. When the two detectives (played by Tony Leung and Danny Glover) break into Jigsaw's hideout, they get him at gunpoint...but they don't shoot. Not even when they're demanding to know how to turn off one of his machines that is about to add to his victim count. Ultimately, Danny Glover's character gets a slashed throat (but he survives), and Tony Leung's character gets killed. Then, fast forward towards the end of the movie. Monica Potter's character manages to squirm out of her ropes, then pretends she's still tied up. She manages to surprise and overpower her captor (the ""fake"" Jigsaw), trains her gun on him...and she doesn't shoot him. Instead, she talks...and naturally, gives him the complete advantage of knocking her feet out from under her and almost killing her. Granted, in both cases, the main characters survive their respective ""surprise"" assaults, but why, oh why was there even a ""surprise""? They both should have just fired at the antagonists when they had the chance, even as accidentally bad shots through the leg or shoulder, or something. It really annoys me that almost no movie is safe from this clichÃ©, not even something as innovative and original as SAW.<br/><br/>Finally, I have a major problem with a fight sequence between Danny Glover's detective and ""the Fake Jigsaw Twerp."" Wait, a fight sequence? How could there have even been a fight? It's almost as embarrassing as Mel Gibson fighting Ned Ryerson in BIRD ON A WIRE: there should have been a couple of swings, then game over. But no...apparently, someone felt bad for the (very) little man in both instances, and gave them a chance to kick the arse of a well-known action star. Here is a man in his early-to-mid 60's, and without even knowing what kinds of big, strong, and tough personalities Mr. Glover usually brings to his roles, we know that this detective would not be an easy fight. So what happens? He gets his arse handed to him by a little twerp, the very same pseudo-""Jigsaw"" who got lucky because Monica Potter's character was an idiot, resulting in his death...I'm sorry, but if that was supposed to happen, they should have gotten a smaller, older, and/or weaker actor to take the role - especially considering that an amazing actor like Mr. Glover shouldn't have been taking on such a small role to begin with - or at the very least, made the fight more believably rough on his part.<br/><br/>For such a cutting-edge movie (pardon the pun), these things added up to major annoyances that took me out of the movie, and really took away from a full star rating. Again: the good outweighed the bad, and I still value this movie as something so fresh, unique, and original...which is more than I can say about most horror movies nowadays."

If you feel the urge for crime, complexity, edge of seat chiller/thriller this is THE film you should watch. <br/><br/>The story is chilling, moving and shocking. And if that isn't enough, the gore will cool your blood as cold as Jigsaws.<br/><br/>Oh yes, there will be blood....."

","I saw saw and i couldn't believe what i saw in saw. Well, the film was also similar to what i just said now, it was clear in what it was trying to say yet lot tweaks. Its great because the suspense in the movie is revealed only when the credits roll. Excellent in the way the whole movie moves, right from the beginning. The sets was apt and the ideas of the story writer was truly psychic. The make-up was good and the background score was apt. I liked the way the characters getting revealed in scene after scene. The concept was good, fresh and new. Performance was fine by all. One among the best suspense/thriller movie i have ever seen, saw gets 8 stars cause most of the film now a days fail to thrill you sparing few of them. Nobody is a stranger any more after you see this film, thats is the world is too small for the other person to be a stranger. This SAW is too smooth still you will love it."

","I have to say that Seven was my favorite horror movie since it came it in 1995... it now takes a back seat to Saw. The story line is absolutely incredible. I'll have to say that the trailer in this case didn't do the movie justice. Many times you'll have a trailer that makes the movie look better than it really is. Not the case here! A definite must-see for any horror movie fan. I'll say this... I have not yet talked to anyone who saw the movie (no pun intended) and wasn't absolutely astounded. The movie, from beginning to end, is filled with twists and turns keeping you on the verge of insanity. You'll be sorry if you miss it. I can't wait to see Saw 2!!!"

","LOVED IT!! wonderful entertaining and shocking. If you haven't seen it watch it tonight. I'm always looking for a well crafted thought through suspense/horror/F.B.I. thriller. I have been very disappointed in the recent years but SAW was a wonderful surprise. Usually I can tell how a movie will end 1/4 of the way through, not this time. I enjoyed this and can honestly say SAW is in my top 30 all time favorites. This is a movie to own and watch over and over. It is intelligent and worth every penny. SAW II is maybe not as good as the original (of course) but definitely worth the price of a movie ticket or DVD as well. Maybe there will be a third??"

","Lets face it, this movie is very low budget, but because this was so could, they made a huge profit. This movie started out as a small idea in James Wans' head, and turned into a 10 minute short. The short was actually about the trap that the girl who survived was, but was played by the guy who played Adam. James showed these people he really knew who had connections. Thye thought it was really good and said they should make a movie, and off they went. It kind of shows how anyone could make a movie. The character who plays Adam is Leigh Whannell and him and other including James, are actually Australian, and to see a pure born Australian change his voice to a typical Americans is amazing.<br/><br/>Its not like this movie had insane action scenes, it wasn't even too gory, except for when the girl had to go through that guys body to get the key. But its a really a classic. I mean it starts off making you wonder, what the heck is going on? There's these two average Americans are locked in a prehistoric bathroom, having no clue how or why they got there. The movie just keeps you into it. What are these people doing here? So as you figure things out, they figure things out, its like you're in the same position as Adam and Lawrence. I figures they would make a saw 2, and I was right, and now it appears there will be (or is actually) a saw 3. So I think this is an awesome series. Not a waste of money, you WILL be satisfied, how could you not?"

He plays with the past and the present.It has a surprising beginning and an excellent end but during the middle of the film is all the same and somehow it starts to get boring.

I would like to hear about films like this one in the future. Is not as other terror films, is new, is great. It's an original film that would like most of the people who love terror.

"rebellion602","9","0","1","15 March 2006"," An intelligent horror film that does not insult the viewer
","Two men wake up in a deserted and decayed bathroom, each chained to a pole at opposite sides of the room. Lying in the middle is a dead man, with an empty revolver in one hand, and a tape recorder in the other. It is a simple beginning. Yet this uneventful film, takes you on a roller coaster ride that is smart, well paced, and unforgettable. What drives this movie is such a well laid plot. Initial appearances are deceiving and become forgotten by the end of the film. For a horror movie, I believe it was wrongly advertised. there was some very gory scenes in this film, but, surprisingly, it is not a film that is driven by the blood. Also the gut wrenching scenes audiences could come to expect from R rated horror movies are not as frequent as one might expect. While there is gore, it does not populate the move, the scenes are few, but still pretty messed up. No what makes Saw so much fun, is the psychological terror. Watching these two seemingly random men, unfold the terrible events that got them there is where the thrills really are. to make the psycho terror even more intense, the man who put them there, is so much a factor, yet very invisible. its hard to explain but the serial killer who does not technically kill his victims, without making flashy appearances, still scares the bejesus out of the audience. To make the film even more active are various puzzles that captivate the audience, hoping to figure out what it could possibly mean. For a gory film, it its relatively tame. For an uneventful film it is action packed. For a horror film, it is extremely well crafted. Highly recommended for those who like films that don't insult our intelligence, and those that like a really really good scare."

","The title, 'Saw' about says it all, though not in the way you may think. This is a thinking man's psychological thriller. The plot is rock-solid, the story powerful and well written, and the acting perfectly matches the mood of the movie. Although macabre in places, this is necessary to emphasize the intentions of the main character - and the intention is very clear - value the life you have, or forfeit it.<br/><br/>The pace is fast and intense and you find yourself wincing at some of the scenes, but unable to look away from the screen. An excellent soundtrack and sound effects work to keep your heart thumping while these poor souls attempt to free themselves from the predicaments in which they find themselves. Not for the squeamish, but for those of us who like hunter/hunted thrillers, SAW is manna from Heaven. The second episode, SAW II is as good, if not better than the first, as the story unfolds and all becomes clear. Just when you thought you had it all worked out, think again!"

The only problem I saw with the movie was the acting which was somewhat flawed with a cast of unknowns with the only actor that I have heard of being Danny Glover who played his role in the movie to perfection. Though some may not realize it this movie brings up a great topic for discussion: How do we appreciate life? Most people do not deserve the life that they have been given and don't enjoy the little things. Those that watch this movie can gain a better understanding of what it means to be alive.

","Poor Wesley. For Cary Elwes, former beloved of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this is about as far away from the beautiful, fairy-tale perfection of the fields of Florin as you can get. Now, he's Doctor Lawrence Gordon, barefoot and chained in the most hellishly nasty abandoned washroom you could possibly imagine, just like his fellow captive, Adam, (SAW'S author, Leigh Whannell.) They are both the latest victims of the dementedly brilliant serial killer, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell from THE X-FILES, amongst other things), who actually never kills any of his victims...he gets them to kill themselves, or each other, depending on what sick rules he's set for the twisted games he plays.<br/><br/>SAW did gangbusters at the box office, and has many admirers...amongst those who probably haven't seen a lot of movies of its kind. But what Whannell and director James Wan have actually done is steal from the best, which is what most great filmmakers do. The biggest problem with doing it, is that when you do ""borrow"" certain plot conventions, you have to do it in a way that one-ups the great sources you're stealing from. And since SAW cribs from SE7EN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and the cult classic THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, it has already shot itself in the foot...so to speak, before it even gets started.<br/><br/>Plus, in spite of some great photography, truly disturbing images and some well done moments of outright creepiness, you can't quite shake the feeling that Whannell and Wan were feeling a little too pleased with their own cleverness as they made it. The ""cherry"" on top is one honey of a shocker ending, which unfortunately places it in BLAIR WITCH territory, as a film whose first 85 or so minutes just aren't as good as the last five.<br/><br/>I wasn't as P.O.'ed by the end as I was with HIGH TENSION. Not a bad first effort, but the script could've definitely benefited from some more tweaking. And it might've helped if it had been an entirely unknown cast, instead of having the perfunctory low-budget ""guest appearances"" (THE SHIELD'S Benito Martinez, STARSHIP TROOPERS' Dina Meyer, ALONG CAME A SPIDER'S Monica Potter, and most wasted of all, Danny Glover.) Good if you have never seen a serial killer/psycho-thriller before.

"JosephLee411","Null","0","1","28 February 2006"," Best Horror Film of 2004.
","The Joe Cool Review: Saw(2004)<br/><br/>Starring: Leigh Whannell as Adam, Cary Elwes as Dr. Gordon, Danny Glover as Detective Tapp and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw<br/><br/>Plot: Two men find themselves locked in a dirty bathroom, chained to pipes and with a dead man laying between them. One of them, Dr. Gordon soon realizes this is all the work of a serial killer named Jigsaw, who really isn't a killer, but finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Now they must figure out how to escape, and to avoid having Gordon's family killed before it's too late.<br/><br/>Openers: What a blast this movie was. I mean it seriously was just a crazy ride to go through. The movie opened in pitch black until you realize our main guy is under water. He wakes up and the lights come on, he's trapped with another guy in this strange room. It certainly is a surprising beginning. Reminiscent of the Cube movies where they wake up and are locked in a room and have no idea how they got there. But this movie is nothing like Cube. It's very very messed up.<br/><br/>The Good: First of all, the Jigsaw killer concept was truly amazing. He actually never kills anyway. Not once. He sets up traps to help them ""appreciate life"". One girl has a device strapped to her head which will rip her jaws open if she doesn't find the key inside of the dead man's stomach. One guy has to escape by crawling through razor wire. The situation the two men find themselves in is that they have to find a way to escape or be trapped, and one of them has to kill the other or lose his family. I thought the voice work in particular for the Jigsaw killer was creepy. And his motives, which we find out in the end, are very unique. The acting was top-notch as well. Cary Elwes has been known to me as the guy from Robin Hood: Men In Tights and The Princess Bride. Up until SAW, I thought he wasn't a serious type of guy. He proved me wrong here, playing a dramatic role perfectly and sold me when he broke down and cried, right before doing something drastic. Another thing this movie has was plot and script. The movie had be locked in from the very opening frame and kept me engrossed throughout the whole thing in it's suspense filled story. Not only that, but there was many a twist and turn which made me think one thing, but then turned around and gave me a truth of something else!<br/><br/>The Bad: The first time I watched this I would have said nothing was wrong with it. But upon reviewing I've discovered some problems that bothered me. Cary Elwes is thought to be the over actor here, and I don't agree. Leigh Whannell was very annoying. Danny Glover's character should have been more fleshed out as well, as he was just playing the generic grizzled veteran/paranoid cop. I've seen it before, and am not impressed with the copy-and-paste version here from other more effective roles. Lastly, the movie sorta kinda ends abruptly and I was not okay with that at all.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Well it's not ugly as in a flaw for the movie, but this movie does have it's strong share of gore. We get a blown off head, a man DOES have to crawl through razor wire, bloody entrails, a slit throat, lots of gunshot wounds and a amputated leg. Other than that, nothing.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: SAW is the best horror film of 2004, regardless of how my opinion may change of it. It's still a great movie, but not as great as I believed it was on my original viewing. Still highly recommended.<br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"

","Saw was a disturbing film with some really gruesome scenes. This movie was definitely a psychological beat down in my experience of watching it. The over the top acting was a little too much, but it got its point across.<br/><br/>This is a movie about a serial killer named Jigsaw. He wants to teach certain amoral people how to value life, but he does so in such a horrifying way that his victims must overcome vicious tests where they either do what they need to survive or die because they didn't try hard enough. With his tests there is always a way out, but it is up to the victims to show how far they will go to survive.<br/><br/>Dark and disturbing, with very little hope for it characters, this was one of the most depressing horror movies I've ever seen.

I was ready for anything you could chuck at me, DOOM was so terrible.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was in an unmarked cover (my brother having lost the original)<br/><br/>The starting scenes made me think 'Maybe Rings, or Ring 0...hmm', but as the title popped up I conveniently ducked out for another coffee and missed it.<br/><br/>Well, after that...put it this way, I'm now paranoid of hacksaws.

","this movie along with many others proves that you can make an entertaining thriller that audiences can enjoy without the 100 million budget, if your into movies like this. It was only made for like 1.5 million dollars and it grossed 50 mil in the US alone and i think another 50 mil overseas. It is a graphic thriller that pits 2 strangers in a cellar somewhere and they are forced to play this game from this serial killer named Jigsaw and they only have until a certain amount of time to complete each of their task or both will be killed. It is a cool concept that teaches the victims the value of life, not like all these other serial killer movies. The little ventriloquist puppet was a freaky looking thing. The movie has some cool flashback scenes to tell the story (or lack there of) of the Jigsaw killer and how he captured the 2 guys stuck in the cellar. As the movie goes along you start to understand more and more about the detectives that chase the killer, the Jigsaw killer himself or herself, and the 2 main characters stranded in the cellar, you find out why he/she chose them. There are Hitchcock moments and many twist and turns but not so many that you don't know whats going on. If you like ""Se7en"" you will like this one.

","Saw is a very good movie. It's dark and gruesome. A doctor and a photographer are kidnapped and put in a room. There are clues and stuff to where items are hidden. The best parts are outside of this room, where Danny Glover(the guy from Lethal Weapon) is looking for Jigsaw with the help of his Chinese partner.<br/><br/>After Danny Glover's partner is killed in a trap, he goes crazy and starts paying the guy who's trapped in the room 200 bucks a night to take pictures of the doctor. All this stuff is happening before they're kidnapped.<br/><br/>Saw is a pretty good movie. They've already made a sequel to it and I think a Saw III is coming out. I give this a 7/10. Pretty good movie."

","Let's get the negatives out of the way first. The film does draw heavily on classic horror/slasher themes: it's not much more than ""take a bunch of people and chop 'em up"". Secondly the film seems padded; every time we move away from the room and the two main character the intensity drops. Also, I didn't find Cary Elwes remotely convincing. He is acted off the screen by an unknown! Even the ""corpse"" shows more personality! And yet.... the shocks keep coming, and there are some real shocks in this film. The gore is not as extreme as I had been led to believe, but it is used effectively and judiciously. The plot twists make you jump, even when you wonder why you hadn't seen them coming. I was saying to myself ""so who is the dead man?"" and ""why is Jigsaw such an nonthreatening geek?"" but still didn't crack the code until the final scene. It's also the kind of movie that makes you realise what you can do with a tiny budget and some balls."

I have written dozens of comments that are succinct and to the point, and hardly 4 lines. The above 6 was plenty, I thought. But it wouldn't ""go through."" Why force users to commit to 10 lines? Don't they realize most people read shorter comments than longer ones? Even in the newspaper. Keep this in mind when threatening punitive actions on faithful IMDb users.

","Just as I thought that the horror/thriller genre had been put to rest due to the multitude of crap recently being offered by Hollywood, I have come across this peach of a film.<br/><br/>Two men find themselves opposite each other chained to metal piping in a dilapitated toilet and just for good measure their is a dead body right in between them. They are mice in a trap waiting to be played with by their tormentor.<br/><br/>This is a great concept and a solid foundation for the fun and games to come. The dynamics between the two men are great to watch. They know that they have to communicate with each other to escape but at the same time they know that their interests are not necessarily mutual.<br/><br/>This is a genuine thriller to the end as it does not fall into any particular mold for too long because of the plethora of twists and turns. The tension throughout the film is thick and the direction is tight.<br/><br/>If you liked Seven or Silence of the Lambs you are sure to like this film. It has a twist at the end which rivals the former and the tension/atmosphere of the film is a mixture of the two. This film has given me hope that the horror/thriller genre still has something to offer."

I love how he isn't the typical bad guy and I love how there is a way out for *some* people. I do wonder, what was Adam supposed to do? Or was he just destined to die, no matter what he did...

The storyline co-insides well with the first movie. I hope there will be a sequel. I would definitely see it if like suspenseful films.

It's important because at the end, which I will talk about, is going to sum up everything you heard or saw (no pun intended). Always keep in mind an guess as to who the killer is. You will most probably be wrong on your guess, and the real killer will, if you don't know who the killer is, flabbergass you.<br/><br/>The ending is one of the best of all-time, and when the real killer is revealed, you will understand.

"Cloud20","7","0","1","11 February 2006"," Sawing Saw Up.
","Saw (2004) <br/><br/>Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannel, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Ken Leung, Michael Emerson, Dina Meyer, Tobin Bell.<br/><br/>Newcomer director James Wan presents us with a shock-fest that makes Michael Mann's Collateral looks like a purely calm drive down the street. Saw is a hell of a thrill ride, but not without its flaws. It does have holes throughout and parts that I didn't care for, but makes up for them in suspense and tension in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Two men wake up in a dirty bathroom, with no idea knowing how they got there. One is a married doctor, and the other a young photographer. In between them lies a man who just shot himself in the head, and a tape player in his hand. They each find tapes in their pockets, and play them both with the tape player. They find out that they both have just a few hours until ""the jigsaw killer"" threatens to hurt the doctor's family, unless he follows the rules of the Jigsaw's ""game"". Meanwhile, a cop is hot on Jigsaw's tail after the murder of his friend.<br/><br/>From the giving of the plot, you would think that ""Saw"" would be an unoriginal tripe piece of cinema trash. But you are quite wrong. I thought that the trailer looked very good, and figured I would give it a try. After seeing it about a year ago and then just a few days ago again, I felt very entertained the whole time through and didn't feel copped out in the end. However, from the flaws that this film has, it's mostly from the script and the acting.<br/><br/>Most predictable thrillers and carbon copies from classic noirs use the basic ""from the cop's point-of-view"" scenario. But from Saw, it is given a much more terrifying view, from the victims. Considering that I'm not much of a fan of the Horror genre, ""Saw"" is one of 2004's biggest thrill surprises and ones that I actually liked, along with the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake.<br/><br/>The acting is one of my biggest complaints, however. Cary Elwes tries very hard to succeed in a dynamic performance, but he goes a bit too over-the-top in the film's most gruesome scene. Whannell is OK for a first timer major role, but isn't really convincing once you've been with him for a while in the film. Danny Glover gives probably the best performance in the film as a retired cop (opposed to the one who always planned to retire in ""Lethal Weapon"") out for revenge.<br/><br/>The direction is good as is the cinematography, editing, and music. The script is good, but tries a bit too hard to act original, and some of Jigsaw's lines are too similar to that of John Doe (Kevin Spacey) from Seven. With all of the hype from the trailer, it was inevitable that this would be compared to similar thrillers, two main ones being Seven and The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>The killer uses the same moral excuse as John Doe, or even Mickey Knox from Natural Born Killers. Ridding people from the world because they don't give ""living"" any real purpose, or because they really give no thought about their own lives. In the other films, the killer murdered them in different ways, but here the victims murder themselves in the toughest ways possible, and if they make it out alive, they really want to live.<br/><br/>The DVD is pretty fair among the New Releases, nothing that special. We get a featurette, a couple of trailers, and a music video of the song ""Bite the Hand that Bleeds You"" by Fear Factory, a ""Making of"" the song, and a short photo gallery. It's just a basic, average DVD that did need more features, and if they sometime make a Special Edition of it, it'll be sucking away my money most likely.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very effective thriller in the end. The twist, if not very realistic, was very surprising and had me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend Saw for a fun flick to watch on a Friday night, but it isn't nearly on the same scale as ""Se7en"" or ""The Usual Suspects"". 3.5 out of 5 stars."

","I again sat down to watch this movie again the other night (I first seen it when it was released). After watching it twice, I am still confused at parts of it. I find myself thinking afterwards about what actually happened. The storyline itself is a bit blurred at times which could have been improved on at times. At times also, this movie did remind me a bit on an average video game. The idea of 2 guys stuck in a room, chained to the wall, with no possible hope of getting away without following the rules of ""The Game"" is kind of exciting. It's also good to know what ""Jigsaw"" has been up to before during his other ""Games"". It is excellent the way he plans all of them down to the T. <br/><br/>Could have been scripted better but still, a good watch and I am really looking forward to Saw 2"

""Saw"" is not about gore, ""Saw"" uses gore to strengthen itself! Let me tell you: it works. The acting is also done well. Of course the situation this movie is about is not that plausible, but the way the characters act make it plausible enough to get a bit scared yourself.... ""What if...""<br/><br/>What makes this horror movie so special is the combination of it all. This is one of the movies in which you should actually pay attention to what the characters have to say, pay attention to detail, try figuring out what is happening and more importantly... why these things are happening!

","A strange little 'bottle' film where not enough happens, and certainly not on a broad enough canvas, to justify its cinematic dreams, but it would have made a blinding TV thriller.<br/><br/>While not as clever as it likes to think it is - one particular flashback-within-flashback sequence is pretty much guaranteed to scramble the viewers concept of plot flow - the script is gifted with a killer twist that almost makes up for many of the films perceived weaknesses.<br/><br/>It is also helps to treat the central villain - the Jigsaw Killer - as an 18-certificate incarnation of Batman's nemesis, The Joker. That mindset also helps justify his otherwise unexplained access to presumably very expensive 'toys' to kit out his torture rooms.<br/><br/>Perhaps I think too much about these things ..."

They soon learn that they're victims of the Jigsaw, A man who devises sick games for victims who don't value they're lives, but not actually killing them himself, but finding ways for them to kill themselves.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly told in flashbacks, when Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes) tells Adam about some of the past victims and how he is set up by the killer and how Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) is convinced that Dr Gordon is the killer. During this the 2 men have to follow tasks, while pitted against a clock and survive Jigsaw's game and save Gordon's family who have been taken hostage by the Jigsaw Killer, And may even mean Gordon killing Adam.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely 10/10, with plenty of twists and turns, and even the major twist at the end will shock you. The performances in this movie are great Leigh Whannell is great as Adam, Danny Glover is great as the obsessive cop who will stop at nothing to catch the killer, Monica Potter was OK as the wife in distress, Dina Meyer should have had more screen time, Shawnee Smith who plays Amanda the only survivor of Jigsaw's game was great and glad she'll be in the sequel, the only disappointing performance was Cary Elwes who plays Dr Gordon, he weren't very good.<br/><br/>OVERALL the movie was excellent and can't wait for the sequel"

","It's hard to come up with a realistic horror movie. Ever since the infamous Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, movie makers have struggled to balance reality with horror. Many have failed. Saw comes along as a bloody thriller that actually succeeds as a horror movie. This makes it a rare gem among its peers, if there were any.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in a small, abandoned bathroom where two men are trapped with their legs in chains, namely Adam (Leigh Whannel) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). A dead man shot in the head lies between them, and all they could salvage from their hopeless attempt to escape are a small recording and an even smaller key. From then onwards, the movie builds upon flashbacks, with our doomed heroins sharing memories and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>The movie has some flaws, like some overreacting and a slow pace, but the whole experience is truly an art in itself, and should appeal to horror/thriller fans everywhere."

This is a story where the overlap between present and flashbacks is perfectly done, it actually enhances the flow of the film rather than detract or distract from it. It reminded me of the Usual Suspects in the cleverness of the script and the final twist(s), even though the subjects matter is completely different. The way in which people 'must' die or kill is in every case perverse and brilliant. I am not much for this type of movie but this one left me wanted for more.

The film begins with a doctor, Larry and a photographer, Adam whom are chained in a bathroom at opposite ends. They don't know how they got there. They find tapes in which they play that says Larry must kill adam by 6 in order to save his wife and daughter. So, the 2 find objects and other clues as they try to free themselves. Then flashbacks are seen through out. It seems Larry has an idea who did this, a serial killer named Jigsaw. It seems he was once a suspect in the serial killings. So, throughout we learn about some of the tests Jigsaw has put his victims through and about how he escaped from 2 cops: one of whom has become obsessed with the case.<br/><br/>Not much of the tests are shown, but the descriptions about them are enough to make you lose your lunch. There is quite a bit of blood, but the camera cuts away before you get the really gory shots.<br/><br/>Then, there is the twist at the end. It was shocking and just floored me.

Jigsaw locks people who are unworthy and if they pass their task, he'll know they'll care about their lives instead of using them for something sinister.<br/><br/>This film is really not a horror film but more like a crime thriller. For those who don't want to see it because they think it's scary, it's not because it's no even a horror. Well, the acting is kinda good as for their first rehearsal during the shoot of the movie. During the movie, we see part of the face of the killer. I ask why would they show it to us since they don't want us to know who the killer is? The question will be answer at the end of the film where the huge twist occurs.<br/><br/>This film is entertaining and ingenious. It's clever, like Se7en, but really better than Se7en. I was disappointed in Se7en but this movie is Saw and not Se7en so I'll say nothing about that. Go see Saw!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","2","23 December 2005"," An experiment, and a mostly successful one at that
","This is without a hint of doubt the most sadistic film I've seen in quite some time... possibly in all of my life. Quite cynical, as well, if not beating the DC ending of The Butterfly Effect at that. Being an independent film that aims high(possibly too high?), it has to cut a few corners to make due... a chase is filmed with only two angles, to give a quick example. The plot is interesting, as is the way it develops(if not particularly original). The film opens with a 'bang'... not unlike Dawn of the Dead, which I saw the day before this. However, unlike aforementioned horror masterpiece, in this film, it's not particularly effective... I found myself not being terribly interested in it. That says a lot... when a film manages to lose you before it has actually begun. The main difference is that in aforementioned film, it creeps up on you, slowly drawing you into the terrifying world, creating atmosphere... here, it just throws you into the situation, as if pushed into a cell. I'm quite certain this was intentional, but it just shows director James Wan's (disturbing?)lack of faith in renowned cinematic values, such as build-up and mood. You can't create terror just by showing a situation, you have to build up to it. And you can't expect the mood to come from seeing a person in a room in any given situation... you have to create that. Create. Something Wan doesn't seem too good at(except for, of course, sadistic, cynical scenes and machines). The pacing is somewhat daft, the film loses momentum half-way through. The acting is half-decent, but that's easily explained... take one look at the Trivia page for the film: ""The rehearsal takes were actual footage for the film"". So, Wan not only disregards established values of film-making, he also underestimates the importance of solid acting, which has a grounding in thorough rehearsing? It's no secret to anyone who's ever acted that if you're unsure of your lines or how the person you act opposite will react to them, your performance is hurt by it. The special effects are solid. The cinematography is lazy, but usually works. Too few shots result in a dull pace for much of the film, and a sense of watching a movie, rather than experiencing it. The stylized tone is overdone at times, producing a noisy and visually assaulting final product. The characters are well-written and credible, and much of the psychology in the film is quite accurate, something which is definitely to Wan's credit, presumably Whannel's(Leigh, co-writer) too. Something not to their credit is that the film breaks quite a few of the rules it establishes. I realize that few movies manage to avoid this entirely, but this one just breaks too many to let it go. I can't point them out here, as they spoil important parts of the film... but I doubt anyone will miss them, even on the first viewing, even if they aren't looking. Then there's how the film seems to take place in our 'world', with a fair amount realism... but there are details that just don't work out for real, that are too cartoon-y. A blade pops out of a character's sleeve at one point. Yes. Seriously. Think Kroenen from Hellboy. Very cartoon-y. It was in that film, too, but that was a comic book movie. This (supposedly) isn't. The film relies heavily on twists, gaining almost all of the thrills from this. The biggest has to do with the identity of Jigsaw, and it's practically the easiest one to figure out, though I must admit I did not see the final twist coming, and there were some surprises, due to fairly good execution in that area by Wan. The twists, obviously, lose all effect on subsequent viewings(I've only seen it once, but I have no desire to do so again, plus, a friend who highly recommended I watch it watched alongside me, and didn't seem to enjoy his second viewing in the least). Yes, I know, I know... that was the main shortcoming of several, if not most, of Hitchcock's pictures as well... but he did keep people guessing and entertained throughout the films. Compare this to Psycho and you'll see that it's no contest. Wan may possess some talent, but he lacks experience. Come on, James... prove you've got more than a somewhat perverted mind, a partiality for sadism and a truckload of cynicism. Writing is fair, with somewhat dubious plot points, too many repetitions and dialog that is almost painfully bad at times. All in all, the film is a mostly successful experiment in film-making... but that's the problem, only 'mostly'. When you mess with values in film-making, you need something solid to keep it going... Memento had it. This film doesn't. The film is entirely based on the theme of fighting to survive, the self-preservation instinct, something I like to use a lot in my short films as well, but a theme even I realize you can't base a whole film on. You need more. Oh, and then there's the idea of nearly dying to start appreciating your life... again, kind of thin. The old ""you don't know what you've got until it's gone"" isn't enough to drive a whole feature. It should be noted that the film contains quite a lot of gore, very graphic stuff. Make sure you've got the stomach for it before watching(nowhere near as extreme as what is seen in Dawn of the Dead, though). Finally... what can I say? James came, he made Saw, and judging from the public reaction, he apparently conquered. But in today's world of movies, by today's quality standards... does that really say that much? I recommend this only to huge fans of horror-thrillers, and I urge most true fans of horror to think hard before even considering to watch it. Go back and re-watch one of the classics instead, says I. Not to watch more than once. 7/10"
"Lechuguilla","Null","0","1","20 December 2005"," Budget Cinema
","If you've ever wanted to write a screenplay, ""Saw"" is a good film to study, because of its financial profile. The film was made on a budget of about $1 million, super cheap in today's feature film market. Producers are more apt to take a new screenwriter's work seriously, if the writer can write a script that, when produced, doesn't break the bank.<br/><br/>Despite the cheap production costs of ""Saw"", it earned over $100 million, worldwide, resulting in a huge ROI, to the delight, I am sure, of the film's financial backers. Cost was kept low as a result of, among other things: single location shooting, an eighteen day completion schedule, and minimal speaking roles. Even with these restrictions, the film still managed to include some elements that normally would be expensive, such as: gunfire, stunts, and a child actor.<br/><br/>Of course, the film's popularity, as expressed in its revenue, does not necessarily equate to film quality. Indeed, I would argue that, relative to the quality of other modern films, ""Saw"" is no better than average, and well below average when compared to older, classic films. The original concept of ""Saw"" is intriguing. And the film does provide some fairly good tension, especially at the beginning. But, beyond the concept, the plot unravels into a mass of laughable predicaments and character reactions.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the script. The plot is hopelessly illogical. Characters say and do things that make sense only in the context of a screenwriter trying to maximize screenplay conflict. There's a complete disconnect from reality. Further, the film's main characters are not well defined. It's hard to care about them, if we don't know much about them. Finally, from the use of flashbacks, to dialogue, to acting, to production design and costumes, the film has an amateurish quality to it. You get the feeling it was put together by kids just out of film school.<br/><br/>In summary, this film is useful to new screenwriters, as a tool to gauge those elements that can be included in a story, at a bargain-basement cost. The flip side is that while you may be able to produce a profitable film, there's no guarantee that it will have qualitative merit."

","Gripping, suspenseful thriller about a sadistic serial ""killer"" who doesn't actually kill his victims, but instead devises elaborate schemes in which they'll either save themselves or die trying. The story focuses specifically on two men (one a renowned doctor with a wife and child) who are restrained inside a room and must play the killer's deadly game in order to escape with their lives. Grisly, at times unbearable horror film is inventive, well-crafted, and well-acted, placing it above the norm for most films of the genre. With shades of Seven the script is intense, thoroughly intriguing, and packs a real punch, but it's let down by a disappointing and unnecessary ending.

It grips from the opening scene where the two main characters find themselves chained at opposite ends of the bathroom from hell. To me personally there is a flawless performance from Australian actor Leigh Whannel who actually made me laugh out loud with his angry and sarcastic portrayal of ""Adam"" alongside a lesser performance from Cary Elwes who's character ""Dr Lawrence Gordon"" was a touch ham-fisted with a side salad of overacting but was still powerful.<br/><br/>The scene with the reverse bear trap on Amanda ( the gorgeous Shawnee Smith) has to be one of the most memorable I've seen in a horror movie for some time. Although the film reminded me of that other gem ""Seven"" I actually thought it was creepier. The ending is a fantastic twist which I defy ANYONE to say that they had guessed beforehand.

While every other directors were making movies with strong and yet cheap gory action full blast for two hours, Director James Wan and screenplay writer Leign Whanell was making a complex story with frightening and fascinating characters as well as a TRUE PSYCHOPATH who goes by the name of Jigsaw. Since the 40s, 50s, 70s, 80's and mid 90s ended horror movies have been a load of **** with lots of cheap magic tricks and junk like that to make it look attractive to the eye. But true horror is something intricate as well frighteningly realistic and with a very dark and twisted visual style.<br/><br/>Many of the ideas were very interesting and intriguing, it wasn't too scary nor too stupid or silly, instead it made many ideas come together. Jigsaw is the new horror icon.

"thejadeturtle","7","0","1","28 November 2005"," No spoilers, Both Good/Bad Outlined
","Overall, I think this is a must-own movie. I understand why the powers that be classify it as a Psychological Thriller. I ranked this at a 7 because there were some obvious plot holes. However, those holes weren't so much that they detracted from the film being fascinating to watch. In fact, I really didn't think of them until I was done watching, which I think is one of the trademarks of a good film.<br/><br/>GOOD POINTS: 1. FAST-PACED. The movie hit the ground running and never let up. 2. INTENSE. Same comment. 3. MAKES YOU THINK. My mind was racing after this film, trying to wrap around everything that happened! Regarding plot holes, to be fair, I'm also not in a life-or-death situation sitting on my sofa, so it's easier for me to think of these things. 4. NOT TOO MUCH GORE. There is a bit of blood, but it was very tolerable. 5. NEVER GUESSED JIGSAW. At the end when Jigsaw is revealed, never saw it coming. Never ever. 6. WATCH IT MULTIPLE TIMES. Speaks for itself.<br/><br/>BAD POINTS: 1. A BIT DRAMATIC AT TIMES. At times, the acting by both Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes was a bit much. For the most part, they did well with their roles but I've definitely seen Cary Elwes in better. 2. PLOT HOLES. Again, once the movie finishes and you start to think about the storyline, etc. there are some holes. 3. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. There are some unanswered questions for me at the end. I don't know if they had already planned to do 'Saw II' when this was released, but at the end of 'Saw' you're left with some ""But what happened..."" questions. Incidentally, if you feel the same way, many of my questions were answered in 'Saw II.'<br/><br/>That's it for me. Happy viewing!"

The acting and characterisation is debatable, especially that of Dr.Gordon's, but this is totally overlooked by the gore, sub-plots and suspense as the audience is led through a series of mind games and deceptions.

"PainCakesxX","9","0","3","14 November 2005"," A breath of fresh air in the movie industry.
","""Saw"" is one of those horror movies that has an actual point and a killer that actually wins. Too many of the movies that are put out by the movie industry have an idealized ending to it. There just aren't enough horror movies that end with the killer winning and outsmarting the protagonists. The reason is simply because the audience go to movies as an escapist attempt from the stress of daily lives. A movie such as ""Saw"" with a very disturbing and thought provoking storyline and ending is thought of as unsavvy to the general audience. ""Saw"" provides not only solid proof that disproves that theory but it is a powerful film that has impacted the movie industry in incredible ways.<br/><br/>When I first saw ""Saw"" (no pun intended) in theaters the year it came out I was blown away to say the least. And to think that the movie was shot in under twenty days with little to no rehearsals under a million dollar budget is unthinkable. Many critics criticize the actor who played Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Ewles) for overacting and being unbelievable. I agree at times in the film Ewles acted very bleak and unusual for somebody in his situation but one part I felt was very powerful and he did a great job on was the end where he broke down. Many people who criticize this scene have never witnessed a breakdown in reality. I unfortunately have, and Ewles is not too far off.<br/><br/>Two actors who I believe ought to deserve the most recognition in this film is first Michael Emerson who played the character of Zepp. I believe that he delivered his lines in the most convincing and was quite creepy throughout the film. I would also like to recognize the actress who played Diana Gordon (Mackenzie Vega) who proved to be able to portray a believable young child in fear for her life and that of her mother's. Although her part was relatively brief, considering her young age and the lack of rehearsals I thought that her performance was outstanding.<br/><br/>My final shout-out goes to the writer Leigh Whannel for writing such an amazing plot line in both ""Saw II"" and ""Saw."" For those of you that have not seen ""Saw"" I can state very clearly it is not for the squeamish types. With a very intelligent storyline and powerful ending ""Saw"" is a very disturbing and thought-provoking film. I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys good horror movies.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

","Saw is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It has managed to unburden itself of the more conventional settings for horror films. Most other horror films follow the police officers tracking the killer, where in this case it follows the victims, and then of course you have your conventional slasher film where in the killer is a guy in a freaking mask trying to kill you, where as in this case it's the victims doing things to themselves. The ending is incredible, and really made the film the masterpiece that it is. Saw was a well needed break from movies like the Ring and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The writing is incredible and the acting is the best acting in a horror movie since Carrie. Jigsaw's plan works methodically and flawlessly.

","This movie is absolutely unworthy of being compared to a thriller like ""Seven."" James Wan's directing was awful, the cinematography was awful (especially in the scene with Danny Glover in the truck), and the acting was awful altogether. This was easily the worst performance I had ever seen by Elwes, Leigh Whannell acted terribly and should stick to writing, and I feel bad that Danny Glover even accepted this role. The only credibility that I will give this movie is that I liked where Whannell was going when he wrote this, and for that, it would have made a better book. There was not an enthralling or suspense-filled moment in this movie. An auxiliary reason for me giving a 2 instead of a 1 is the hilarity I found at the clown on the tricycle (that was supposed to be scary or something) that kept me laughing for quite a while, and the acting kept me laughing the rest of the movie. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell make Keanu Reeves look like Tom Hanks in this movie. Once again, the storyboard was good, however, the directing and acting in this movie will keep it rated in a state somewhere between awful and abysmal."
"semi_cool18","2","0","1","2 November 2005"," Huge disappointment
","I gave Saw 2/10, and those 2 stars were for the one good thing about the movie: the premise. The idea behind the movie is a great one; the idea of a killer who's deranged ""games"" teach his victims something about how they are living their life. Also, when his next two victims wake up in a room together, chained to opposite sides, they must follow his clues in order to escape. This intriguing and dreadful (in a good way) premise is a great start for a horror movie. So what went so wrong? The first thing that went was the plausibility. When the two main characters wake up chained up and all the worse for wear in a strange room, remembering nothing of how they got there, do they freak out in any way? Nope. Instead, they react surprisingly calmly and with even some dumb jokey lines. Which leads to the next failure of the movie: the writing, and most importantly, the acting.<br/><br/>The 2 characters chained in the room (one is played by Cary Elwes, the other I've never heard of) put on such a spectacular show of terrible acting that it almost seems like a joke. The idea that they're actually trying to act in a serious movie, let alone this horror movie impressed by its own seriousness, is laughable.<br/><br/>The final mistake in this movie is one that horror movies so often slip into: a degeneration into an unexciting action-sequence ending. A confusing chase scene near the end is unnecessary and uninteresting, and it's too bad it wasn't replaced with something more unique.<br/><br/>Despite its fatal flaws, it has a few memorable moments. A couple of the situations the killer puts his victims into (the snapping helmet, for instance) are bizarre and twisted. Also, the ending does have a decent twist. However, with so much wrong with this movie, these few good points don't do much to salvage the wreckage."

","When I fist saw the trailer for the movie I thought to myself 'Oh great another slasher flick, I'll definitely miss this one,' It seemed like an unrealistic $2 movie that would spawn 600 sequels and eventually die like most other horror movies... But I ended up renting it for Halloween if for no other reason to kill time. Within minutes my opinion of the movie had changed quicker than the main suspect. Although it is still unrealistic in a lot of respects (yeah like the saw can go through a foot but not the cheap chains binding our victims) It has an intelligent wrathful life lesson, which is simply be grateful for what you got or some diseased lunatic will start playing sick games with you until either you die or do something you really don't want to do (like part with your foot or roommate). The acting in this film is what really pulled it together especially Elwas, the poor floundering doctor who's family is taken and held for ransom, and Glover the cop who becomes obsessed with the case once his partner is killed in the line of fire. <br/><br/>So if your into slashers and plot twists definitely rent SAW, and skip lunch."

","Have to say this film was extremely good except the choice of actors. This film has everything to scare you and has just the right amount of gore not to make it look cheesy. The plot is excellent and could not see anywhere were they could have improved in terms of it. Again the only thing I see which could have been changed was the actors and though this does not make it a bad film, it doesn't make it fantastic. Worth seeing if your a fan of scary/mystery, as I am. This is not a copy of seven, saw no similarity between the two as it had a very different storyline and Saw was a lot more gross, in your face and had clearly no intention of being sensitive to the audience. This is great and what any horror fan loves. Even if you aren't a horror fan but can stomach gore, this film has a lot more to it. If you took out the blood it would still have enough to make a decent movie and this is what makes it fantastic. Worth watching. Try to avoid if you hate blood or psychological pain."

And what a star it is.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that it is almost impossible to talk about without spoilers so if you have not yet seen this film, look away now.<br/><br/>There were times near the beginning of the film where even a seasoned film-goer like myself felt a little uneasy at some of the 'games' that the 'Jigsaw Killer' employed but I am glad that I stayed through hose for the story proper.<br/><br/>Jigsaw's careful selection of his victims and the meticulous planning that went into his schemes unnerved me because the people he selected were not the usual whiter that white companions of the hero we were to be rescued in the nick of time, as is usually the case. These people were all the morally tarnished characters who are the ones who usually fall prey to the killer to prove what a difficult task the goody-goody hero is going to have to face to get out in one piece.<br/><br/>Usually we don't care when these axe fodder fall as it is all part of the journey, but without the stock hero character, we are drawn more into these other characters only to discover that they are in fact just normal people like we the audience, this is where the true horror lies. The safety of the 'Rules' has been thrown out. The young survivor we are introduced to appears happy that Jigsaw put her though this ordeal as it made her appreciate her life more muddies they waters still further, is Jigsaw the evil character we expect? His methods may be twisted but his desires appear benign, do the occasional successful ends justify the sometime rather messy means? After all, the young survivor appears cured of her addiction more thoroughly than dramatically than any humane counselling could have archived in years.<br/><br/>At times the flow of the story is a little hard to follow and it can take a little while into a scene before you know where it fits in the overall timeline and the pace doesn't let you spend a great deal of time trying to figure this out and you can get lost for a while but this may have been intentional as it did open up a certain degree of empathy with the leads as neither you nor they really have a clue what s happening I'll close the way I opened, the story is the star, and that is a style that I hope to see more on in the future, Another triumph for substance over style. Hurrah!"

","I have seen this movie twice, and the second time I saw it, (no pun intended) it got me thinking. Anyone out there who has seen it knows how it works. The mastermind of the killing sets up an elaborate plan to force his victims to kill themselves. The mastermind also teaches life lessons, as twisted as that may be, with his killings. Technically, the mastermind does not kill his victims. I really admire this guy. His setups are so amazing. I really liked the plan where he had the guy and he had to open the safe to stay alive, and the combination was written on the wall and there were numbers over every square inch of the wall. Also, he had a candle to see by and there was a flammable poison that was rubbed over his skin. He died, obviously. I just thought that it was so interesting. Another plan was where a girl would get her head blown up if she didn't cut out this living man's stomach and get the key that was in there. She made it just in time and she survived. It really got me thinking. What if I was in a similar situation? What would I do? Would I be able to take another life, to saw off my foot, or set someone on fire? I don't think I could, but in that scenario, I think that I would have put my morals aside and just do it. Just something to think about in the form of a horror movie."

","You need to have a strong spirit on this one! Wan(director) and Whannel(Actor and Screenwriter, i think), come up with some seriously nasty stuff, but also manage to hold the plot nicely together, and leaving out the typical slasher-style effects. the horror is more on a phycological level. Also the directing part is top-notch, with fantastic camera movement and great use of slow-motion/speed-ups. The only thing that keeps this movie from getting 10/10 is Cary Elwes; slightly overplaying on the emotional side. But apart from that almost everything is done extremely determined, and you end up with a movie in the top of the Horror-chart. Cult-classic!"

","Unlike most modern horror films, 'Saw' left me genuinely scared after watching the film, on my own, late at night. Not the cleverest of things to do. Most horror films have scary elements, average twists, and decent plots, but I feel 'Saw' was an individual and impressively terrifying horror film. Two strangers wake up to find themselves in a disgustingly dirty and isolated bathroom. Neither knows how or why they got there, but together they are set a time limit to escape death. The film really involves the audience, and I was on the edge of my sofa throughout. Few horrors truly frighten me, but 'Saw' was an exception. The dramatic twist at the end, which I would never have anticipated, startled me and delivered immense shock, to myself and other viewers I know. The film is crammed with twists, terrifying moments, immense empathy towards the characters and disgusting amounts of extreme gore. This film is not for the faint-hearted. The characters are interesting, but the acting is not fantastic. Leigh Whannell who plays Adam, is convincing and interesting, but Cary Elwes who plays Dr Gordon is rather unrealistic and forced. 'Saw' has many similarities to 'Se7en'; the distressing planned murders, the failure of America's society, the selected victims for reasons only known to the murderer, and the obscene twist at the end. Despite the usual annoyance of these similarities, I enjoyed both films and did find them different. Both 'Saw' and 'Se7en' are incredibly successful and frightening, and truly express the horror genre. I give 'Saw' 9/10 and would recommend it to any horror fan!"

","This movie really creeps me out on how ingenious people can make a script and portray it as this movie was done. <br/><br/>It's creepy in a sense that another human would have done this to other people to just teach them a lesson. No spankings, no timeouts, no in the corners with a dunce hat on. More like life threatening messages that may get it's message across whether you live or die. Either way it teaches us, as well the victim a lesson. <br/><br/>The atmosphere was chilling, dirty and fit the scenario very well. Acting was on and the story kept you drawn in on what's gonna happen next. It's also interesting because the serial killer doesn't necessarily kill. Rather he gets the victim to kill themselves (in some cases with little chances) and he even has a moral code in a sense that he'll teach lessons to people who deserve them and may take extreme actions (like taking hostage's indirectly) for him to get his message across. In terms of horror it's very very well done. One of the best in (in my opinion) a rather ignored category of horror that doesn't rely on body counts and how they die to get an audience wooing."

","I have never seen a film anything like ""Saw."" It is indeed a different/unique kind of film even though the concept behind the film is sick/disturbing. The film begins with two men chained in a room Adam (Whannel) and Dr Gordon (Elwes) with a dead body between them. They learn that in order to save themselves they have to kill each other. Whilst this is happening police work out the latest clues to the ""jigsaw"" mystery, where a killer places victims in a life or death situation to see how dedicated they are to living. It turns out the jigsaw killer is a cancer victim putting people through hell as it annoys him how ""healthy"" people do not appreciate their lives. I didn't expect the twist at the end, (I enjoy twists as so many film these days are predictable i.e romantic chick flicks.)

"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","5","8 October 2005"," The biggest surprise of 2004.
","""Saw"" is an unlikely little masterpiece. It's low-budget, mostly set in one room and at first wasn't even supposed to get a theatrical release. As a matter of fact, I believe it wasn't even released in every country but went straight to DVD instead, in most European countries anyway. But ""Saw"" is a surprisingly near perfect thriller/horror movie that you'll not forget easily. It's truly the biggest movie-surprise of 2004.<br/><br/>I have to admit that at the beginning of the movie I was skeptical. I wasn't quite fond of the way the story was told and the way it used some visual tricks. However as the movie more and more progressed, I got drawn into it. The movie has more than enough surprises in it and has a unforgettable ending which I hereby vote the best movie-ending of 2004.<br/><br/>The movie has a very tense and at times almost unbearable tension and chilling atmosphere, which are supported by some gory and original moments. The combination of the highly original thriller and horror elements are what make ""Saw"" an unforgettable movie experience. It makes ""Saw"" an absolute must-see, especially for the fans of the genre of course.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the acting isn't always top-class. Cary Elwes simply isn't a good main-lead actor. He is always at his best in roles such as he played in ""Glory"", ""Days of Thunder"", ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and ""Twister"". At times in the movie it gets obvious that James Wan is just a beginning director that still has to learn some things when it comes to storytelling and actor-directing. Still of course, this movie remains an impressive theatrical debut for this young director and fellow screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who also portrays one of the main characters. I'm looking forward to their new projects.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of 2004! An absolute chilling, tense must-see, already for the last 30, or so, minutes alone.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","If you like good acting, mystery, suspense, horror, violence and gore, then you'll love Saw. From debut director James Wan (also writing) and writer Leigh Wannell (also introductory star), this is one of the most gripping film I have ever seen. Basically Adam (Whannell) along with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Liar Liar's Cary Elwes) find themselves chained by their ankles in a dirty, disused bathroom, along with a dead man who shot himself. They find cassette tapes in their pockets, and Lawrence must kill Adam before 6 o'clock (there is a clock in the room), and they find hacksaws in a toilet. They realise they are wanted not to cut their chains, but their feet, this leads to their knowledge (and flashbacks) of who has placed them there, The Jigsaw Killer. Through the clues given in the room, finding ways to kill or help each other, there are many twists that help you to determine that Adam and Lawrence know each other, and this eventually will lead them to discover the identity of who they believe the killer is. Meanwhile, in a series of flashbacks you see events before going to the bathroom, including Lawrence trying to rekindle the breaking relationship with his wife Alison (Patch Adams' Monica Potter) and daughter, Adam secretly photographing Lawrence for suspicious Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) who is obsessed with catching Jigsaw. The ending is fantastic with Lawrence putting the saw into use, the man they suspected, Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson, who appeared in TV's Lost) is himself a victim, and the dead guy on the floor, John (Tobin Bell), a patient of Lawrence's is alive, and involved in ""his own sick game"". Also starring Ken Leung as Det. Steven Sing, Dina Meyer as Kerry and Billy the Jigsaw Puppet (LOL). Traps in the flashbacks include: a guy in a room of razer wire and a timed trap door to get to, a room of combinations on the wall to the safe with antidote inside and the guy is covered in a flammable substance with a candle and broken glass on the floor, and of course, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) has a timed jaw trap and the key is inside the stomach of a guy on the floor. Very, very good!"

Dr. Gordon is told that if he does not kill Adam in a specified amount of time, his wife and kids will die. Each are given clues by Jigsaw in order to accomplish their individual ""goals"" .... <br/><br/>We soon learn that Jigsaw has done this before ... forcing a woman to kill another man to take off an apparatus that would rip her face apart ... forcing a man to climb through razor wire ... forcing a man to burn himself to death. Jigsaw is able to make people kill each other (or themselves) in order to survive. Detectives Tapp and Sing (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are hot on his trail.<br/><br/>The plot has good twists and turns and the props / production value is high. There are a couple of missteps with the editing, but all in all good. Just wish they would have recast the leads."

Let's face it - there hasn't been a decent thriller or a horror movie in years so I must say that the Saw is really refreshing. I think it was directed quite well and must compliment this innovative script. OK at some point the movie gets similar to Seven, but that's not a handicap. The movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll.

All the situation is so weird that makes you not to see the obvious and that's why I like the movie, it keeps you totally out because I was wondering all the movie who, and why is a dead man in the room? it didn't fit in the scenario for me, perhaps for the poisoned blood? maybe... and how a so perfect killer - ""Zep"" - made so much mistakes...! all that no-sense factors all fit at the end...<br/><br/>I went to the video-club hoping to see a movie that surprise me, and happened!..."

The DVD features are disappointing:you get an over 2 minute featurette of the film, making of a unrated music video, rated and unrated music video, trailer, t.v. spots and promotional art gallery.<br/><br/>The new DVD from Lions Gate is the original uncut version of this film.

","Saw is one of those movies that come along and whacks you really hard. Much like ""Halloween"" did when I first it and the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Saw"" ranks up there as one of the best horror movies around. <br/><br/>The movie opens up with a guy in a bathtub (one of the films screenwriter's) chained to a large pipe (maybe a steam pipe?) he quickly realizes he is not alone as another voice calls out to turn on the lights. When the lights are turned on we see another guy (Carey Elwes) on the other side of the room chained to a large pipe as well and in between them is a dead guy. The dead guy has a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The plot begins. What's great about this movie is it never lets you in on what's going on, however, on second viewing, you see the clues left and right (which is a true sign of a great movie.) We quickly find out the police (Danny Glover) is looking for a notorious serial killer named ""Jigsaw"", dubbed by the curious ways he leaves his victims. However, what's interesting, and as the police point out, is that he doesn't do the killings...or does he? Since this movie is very intricate it's hard to explain the points without giving away crucial plot/turning elements, but it's that very thing that makes this movie great. I have seen almost every horror movie out there and I'm pretty numb to most, but this movie, let me tell ya, I had dreams/nightmares about this movie days after I've seen it, trying to figure out what I would in the same situation.

","Released in theaters nationwide on October 29, 2004. I figured my dad and I would watch it just in time for Halloween. It occurred to us that this would be another entertaining thriller, living up to our expectations. 'Saw' unleashed something far more on the contrary than what we expected.<br/><br/>Simply, it's about two men held hostage by a madman in a room with a dead body between them. They must find a way out while one of them has been given the burden to murder the other. Throughout the film, you understand what the so-called 'Jigsaw killer' has done to other people. He forces them to play lethal games of survival to appreciate life. Not many of them live to tell the tale, so you can understand how mad Jigsaw really is. Conflicts arise between the two men in the room as they struggle to stay alive and outwit their kidnapper.<br/><br/>You find out that the storyline and the 'title character' Jigsaw are far different than ordinary thrillers. Jigsaw's killing techniques are much more unique since he does not in fact do the killings personally. If you're open minded enough, you might appreciate the effort that the producers did to film such a unique picture.<br/><br/>Although it's entirely graphic and maybe unbearable to watch, it helps you to get an idea of how the victims in the film felt. 'Saw' put so much adrenaline into me, I couldn't believe that the filmmakers were able to pull off something like that. This horror/thriller is worth watching and sharing over and over because of its many surprises and twists. Even today, 'Saw' chills my blood with fear, numbs my legs with shock, and quickens my pulse with excitement. Many audiences have criticized this movie for the many questions the film leaves behind at the end. But that's why 'Saw II' is nearly completed in production.<br/><br/>I hope this comment was useful to some of you. I completely recommend watching it; you won't be disappointed. The ending will no doubt leave you speechless. 'Saw' helps you understand how far off the edge desperate people can be pushed to...and most of the time the solution involves shedding blood."
"kbbradley","8","0","1","3 August 2005"," A Movie for Psychological Thrills and Abject Horror
","Watching the movie is a guilty pleasure like coming upon a car wreck, you can't turn away! It has the horror, blood and gore aspect without being cheesy. It does borrow from early slasher films with a touch here and there of the morality play (do a bad deed get punished) but even that has some unexpected twists. There was more fun in just enjoying the emotional acting than to spend the energy to identify the culprit. The mix of more well known actors like Danny Glover and Monica Potter playing secondary roles and relative unknowns in lead roles was refreshing. Any movie where I catch myself talking out loud to it and exclaiming random expletives got the reaction from my psyche I look for in a film. Worth watching and talking to others to see if you both came to the same conclusions regarding the ending. If you watch late at night be prepared to stay up after for an hour or so to clear your mind or if you enjoy nightmares go directly to sleep, we all have choices. The mind can dismiss the evil and horror of what is questionable in it's possibility of occurrence. It is much harder to see the evil that men hold in the hearts and act on and say it couldn't happen. Highly recommend to those who enjoy being taken to the edge, but watch with someone!"

","This definitely isn't one for the faint hearted. There is a very disturbing scene in this movie involving the girl from Becker, but as much as it disgusts you, try to watch the movie past that point. It's that point in the movie where it shifts from horror movie to thriller. I have to admit I saw (get it) this movie thinking it would be a bit of a stinker. I mean a one million dollar budget for a horror film made in Hollywood, usually means trouble. Damn me if it wasn't one of the best horror/thrillers I've ever seen. Take out Cary Elwes average acting and this movie is sensational. That camera flash scene is so clever I wish I had thought of it. I can understand why so many people walked out, as early on this movie is pretty horrific. However I believe the movie is worth it, and if you are one of those people always whinging about Australian movies, remember that this movie was directed, written and acted in by two very talented young Australians. Now pass me that blunt saw I have an itch to scratch."

","This movie is my kinda movie, a little bit of action some good scary parts and a few funny parts too. The best thing about this movie was that it could actually happen although not a true story, The movie is about a sick maniac person who has a history of taunting people and capturing them, and then locking them in a room playing games with there minds. What a movie! huh see for yourself! i recommend this movie for anyone who can handle Blood and Gore... or 13,14 plus. the only setback is of course a few blood gory scenes. well please tell me if you liked what i wrote here by checking yes or no.... i would love to here your feedback......."

","This movie was awesome. There were some parts when I was confused as to who the killer was. For instance, when Danny Glover was in his apartment across the street from the Doc's place it you saw the orderly guy in Dr. Gordon's house, so you think the orderly might be the killer, but then Glover kept saying,"" I should have never let you go"" and staring at the pictures of Dr. Gordon; You don't really find out who the killer is til the end. From the scene where they show Dr. Gordon talking to the residents in the hospital and kept referring to the patient as ""the patient"" and the orderly walks in and says"" his name is John"" I thought for sure he was the killer. The schemes on the decisions the victims were put in was very creative. The ending was the best ending I have seen in awhile. I can't believe they made this movie in only 18 days!!! You should definitely see this movie...."

","It has a great ending, completely unpredictable. It is very twisted that someone actually thought this up, very original; commendable... or committable. It reminds me of Se7en, though not as good. Se7en has a lot more research involved, in keeping with the whole deadly sins; Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are beyond reproached. Saw is completely original ideas, however based solidly on the concept of peoples apathy and lack of respect for their own lives. The actors here past mustard and the story is what drives the film, but being second to Se7en is still excellent. Innovated death scenarios keep you interested and prevent the usual boredom and monotony that accompany films like theses. Takes place mostly in two or three sets, but it doesn't diminish it in anyway. Cinematography reflects the mood to tee, that is deranged, twisted, psychotic, panic and primal. Anyway, very pleased, all story and no fluff."

","Two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes), wake up, chained on the wall, in a small room. In the middle of the room there is a dead body, holding a tape player. Men find tapes from their pockets and they soon find out, that they are in the middle of a sick game, organized by a sick serial killer. The name of the game is: Kill the other man and be free. They are also provided with two saws. You do the math. Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) tries to run against time to catch that sadistic SOB, called the Jigsaw, because of twisted games he plays with his victims.<br/><br/>I really can't say Saw is for the most faint hearted people in the world: It's gruel, sadistic and bloody. It rolls along its sadistic rails, steadily to the end, even though the plot has some small details, which were left unpolished or unthought. Some aspects of the story are rather silly, if you start to think about them, but those things won't get in the way of the horror, no matter how illogical they seem afterward. <br/><br/>I'd recommend this one for the horror genre fans, but I would think it twice if you are just a regular ""Scream"" or ""I know What you Did last summer"" type of horror watcher"

But what I don't understand was this, Zip was the only person that was nice to the guy, making Lawrence say his name. Why would he hurt him.

","'Saw' is a thriller I really enjoyed. It reminds me a lot of the old school superb piece 'Seven', but still it doesn't turn into some sort of spin-off. This is a movie who has a kind of original story who entangles its viewer. The acting is great, and some of the characters nearly freaked me out because of their neat acting. Danny Glover is superb, and Leigh Whannel as well! I did get forewarned that it might get too much at times due to horror scenes, but I was just bluntly pleased. :) Great piece and well worth the time!<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who liked 'Seven' and anyone who's into psychotic horror thrillers!"
"yousrekh","9","0","1","18 July 2005"," Saw takes the biscuit.
","I love Saw. Wan and Whannell have created an amazing experience together, and I will remember their names forever. I've decided to refer to it as a 'terror film'. When I think of 'horror films' I think of films like Halloween, Friday The 13th, and even teen-horror films like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. I think a new genre of 'terror' should be established. The films that I've mentioned don't really do it for me. They prioritise startling the audience with music, sound effects, etc, but that's not enough in my opinion. Saw made my stomach turn deliciously; it tempts the viewer to imagine these crazy situations and wonder how they'd endure, mentally, through such panic.<br/><br/>A lot of people have complained about plot holes and so on. That doesn't really bother me too much. Indeed, discussing them is a lot of fun; working out the mysteries of the timing of events, and the actions of the antagonist, but mistakes happen. As a debut to the genre and the industry, this film is flawless in my eyes, and I'll support these guys as long as they keep writing this stuff!<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the cinema was brilliant. Everyone in the room was so moved by the themes and the heart-racing pace of the film that we found ourselves laughing in an effort to comfort each other - laughing at our own reactions to the terror on screen. This talented duo can rest assured that I'll be there in September for Saw 2, and, thereafter, Silence!."

","Personally, I am sick of crappy teen horror movies coming out nowadays that are either bad remakes, sissy PG-13 C-movies, or having a little child in it for scares, Saw is definitely NOT one of those movies. This movie is completely original and there is plenty of blood and guts to spare! No little girls, no PG-13 rating, no J-horror clichÃ©s. This movie ROCKS.<br/><br/>The movie begins and two guys wake up in a dirty bathroom with a dead body in it. They are chained to opposite sides of the room and the only thing they can use to escape is a saw. Either that or one of the men must be killed by 6 AM. Throughout the film, the two find clues and hints throughout the room, and we see Danny Glover's character investigating the killer's past cases and Monica Potter's character dealing with a psycho at her house. Despite some bad acting and crappy dialog, Saw is a great horror movie with a great concept. It's intense, disturbing, scary, fast paced, and it has such a killer ending! See this, folks, and for God's sake, STOP SEEING THESE Piece OF CRAP TEEN HORROR MOVIES."

","The movie was a very good movie in general and much better than I expected too! The idea was innovative and very smart, so thrilling and breathtaking in some parts too.<br/><br/>But there were two things about this movie that I didn't like 1- There were no reason what so ever for the doctor to cut his leg!! I mean common it's not that hard to get to the cell phone!! He should have used his shirt, like they did in the beginning of the movie! I think that cutting his leg like this wasn't realistic at all and not logical (at least to me).<br/><br/>2- The first seen in the movie when Adam wakes up in the dark and talks to the doctor and tells him to turn on the lights and he answers saying ""If I could"", and the doctor have been awake before than Adam, so he stayed sometime in the dark and in the middle of the movie they turn off the light to see the X mark!!

"big_fat_gary","8","0","1","13 July 2005"," Very solid film from a first time director
","Saw this film on my own, in the confided space of my own room, with the lights off. Have to say not many films made me want to turn away and not look at the screen, but this film's done it, and did it well. <br/><br/>This film, very clever in parts, and truly disturbing. I love the sense when the main character Adam, he found a intruder inside his flat. With all the light switches not working, in pitch black with only his camera in his hands he still try to look for this intruder. And he did the only logical thing, which is to use the flash light on his camera to allow him to search through the flat. So we get to see these snap shots, once every 4, 5 seconds of the surroundings. A little like the disco strobe light effect, but with every flash, you know you are only waiting for something to jump at you right in front of the screen. <br/><br/>I'd think that this sense has a missed opportunity not to make it scarier (e.g. have things changed while the same places being shown twice, suppose this is more the sort of Japanese horror films style). But that's fine, it's scary enough already.<br/><br/>In general I love this film, however very clearly this is low budget and a rushed job. Low budget is never a problem, there are millions of low budget classics. But when rushed, you do feel a few rough edges in the film especially towards the last half an hour. Some shots were out of focus (maybe it is done on purpose to add to the atmosphere, but truly no need when the shot is dead serious when two people are just having a conversation) and the story and relationship of the characters ran a little dry. It feels like the director couldn't wait to reveal the final twist of the story.<br/><br/>Well, after the film, clicked onto the special feature / making of the film; all my questions were answered. It tells you that it is a rushed job, the crews were working on a 18 days schedule. I'd say it's no excuse, but still have to say 'bravo!' Surly I had more than 18 days to do my GCSE art project, I still only managed to make something slightly better than any junk you'd call a piece of crap. <br/><br/>Secondly it shows that the director James Wan, is very young. He looks almost my age, which is very rare for directors. But this also shows why this film does give you a little of this computer game feel. It's just like Silent Hill / Resident Evil the first 10 minutes of the film. Now you find a tape, so how to play it? Oh you find a key, I wonder which door this unlocks? Suppose this is not a criticism, it's all fine, and I love it.<br/><br/>Ratings OK, very solid film from a first time director, I'll say 8/10 overall 9/10 for jump out of your chair / cover face with hand factor<br/><br/>Footnote: SAW 2 is in post-production at the time of writing and is due for a 2005 release in the US; Maybe because the director is Chinese, the Chinese girls casted in the film, they are all very pretty"

"stereoplaysjunk","10","0","1","7 July 2005"," Double Act 'Play A Game' With Innocent Heads.
","Having read numerous reviews for 'Saw' I've discovered that it's a bit like 'Marmite'; you either love it or you hate it. But c'mon! What's not to love. Aussie double act James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannel (screen-writer/""Adam"") present to us something I don't think has been done this successfully in years. 'Saw' won me over the first time I saw it, with its creepy story-line and bizarre camera angles and it's grown in my estimation over the course of the years. <br/><br/>Saw starts when Adam (Leigh Whannell) awakes in a bathtub to find himself chained up in a darkened room and very confused. When the lights go on his cell-mate Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) is revealed to him as well as the dead body of a man, a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. As Lawrence and Adam start talking, clues are revealed to them. They both find tapes in their pockets, each carrying a sinister message and a task they must complete to escape with their lives. Adam's task is to save his own life, and not to sit back and watch himself die. Lawrence's task is to kill Adam; the consequence if he doesn't is that his wife and child will die. Lawrence begins to tell the story of Jigsaw, a serial killer who captures the morally wayward, in life or death situations, intended to make them appreciate their own mundane lives. Adam and Lawrence are not Jigsaw's first victims, he's targeted self-harmers, drug addicts and benefit frauds and now, seemingly innocent Adam and do-gooding Dr. Lawrence are victims in his next game. Clues are revealed to the two characters as they are revealed to the audience, we find out that Lawrence has been cheating on his wife and that Adam has been paid to take pictures of him by obsessed ex-leading detective on the Jigsaw case, David Tapp (Danny Glover). Meanwhile, as Adam and Lawrence are being held captive in a bathroom, Lawrence's wife and daughter are being terrorised by creepy Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) a quiet janitor in Lawrence's hospital. Eventually, Lawrence's time runs out, Adam is still alive and Zep leaves the Gordon's to carry out his work and go and kill Lawrence, pursued by the ever observant Tapp. As the story unfolds and Lawrence's situation becomes more desperate he takes drastic measures to release himself from his chains. Zep and Tapp, brawl in the tunnels which lead to the room in which Adam and Lawrence are trapped, which results in a fast-paced action and Tapp's murder. As Zep enters the bathroom, the gruesome finale climaxes in a terrifying twist - and trust me, you'll be screaming as loudly as the characters on screen. <br/><br/>Altogether a very well brought together film, which exceeded my expectations and shows Whannell and Wan as the true geniuses they deserve to be credited as."

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Two complete strangers, a doctor (Cary Elwes) and an apparent waster (Leigh Wannell) awaken to find themselves in a brightly lit room chained by the foot in close proximity to each other. They soon find they have been placed there by a sadistic psychopath who wants one to kill the other in a battle to come out alive. As they sit around waiting for their time to run out, the doctor starts recalling in flashback events that may have possibly led up to their present predicament, the waster does the same and before long they are piecing things together as their sanity gradually deteriorates that lead up to a shattering final revelation. Whilst recounting events, the doctor also leads onto a story of a detective (Danny Glover) who became obsessed with hunting the killer down and may still be playing a part in events as they speak...<br/><br/>There is one original angle of how the killer isn't technically really a killer after all and there are some interesting slants on how he selects his victims, but the movie as a whole actually borrows ideas from other, superior movies. Many have compared it to Se7en, but I actually think it has more in common with movies such as Cube (the concept of them waking up in an unfamiliar place with no idea how they got there!) and Phone Booth with the killers reasons for selecting those particular people.<br/><br/>It's a fairly slick effort, genuinely suspenseful and with a great central performance from Elwes, not to mention having a well developed plot. But it's downfall is that it has aspirations of being a really high concept film when really for the most part, it's ironic that the killers name is 'Jigsaw' since that's what it's really like in terms of piecing all the bits it's stole from better movies together. ***"
"DubVersion","9","0","1","30 June 2005"," Masterpiece
","This movie has it all. Horror has become a main stream genre over the best years, and this movie reaps the benefits; a very well made production with outstanding acting of all actors. Gently inspired by other superb movies like ""the Cube"" and ""Se7en"", this movie is remarkably original. It's very well edited too; perfectly balanced between action, drama, horror and suspense. And a well made ending, which deserves extra points.<br/><br/>I voted a 9/10 for this movie because there are some flaws. But sometimes to make great suspense you have to give in on realistic plot turn. There may be one of two moments in there which i personally find flawed, but they were put in there for a reason; to show more of the artistic scenery, atmosphere and certainly suspense.<br/><br/>The blood and gore level does not supersede its intention; the twist plots do not overlap the pace. If you're looking for just a great horror you won't forget for a while, go see this one. Best watched alone in the dark."

Saw is fantastic, the best horror movie I have seen, gruesome and so very clever. Whoever wrote it must have a very vivid and twisted mind. I can't go into too much detail without ruining the story. Two guys wake up in a room and they are chained by their ankles to thick metal pipes. There is a dead man in the middle of the floor and they are given instructions; one must kill the other or else his family will die. The creepiest thing in the whole film was the horrible clown like doll that rides a tricycle and relays the killer's messages.

","I thought this movie was one of the best scary movies I've ever seen. In the past few years ""scary"" movies have been disappointing to me such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Exorcist the Beginning."" Even the ""Ring."" Until Saw, most movies used cheap scare tactics such as loud music or silence, but in Saw, it was the viewer's imagination of what could be or what would happen that made it scary. While watching this film I was thinking that it takes someone with a very wide sense of imagination to come up with a plot like this. I felt like the scriptwriters of this film were serial killers, thats how satisfied I was with this film. I mean, having victims kill themselves with horrific alternatives instead of the standard murderer was GREAT!!! In addition, I liked the puppet-like character that spoke throughout the movie--I thought that was real unique. When I heard there was going to be a sequel for this movie, I got really excited. However, I hope it wont be disappointing and ruin the original."

The characters are believable and, thought very scary at some times, it isn't horrifying to the point that you'll be up for weeks thinking about it. The best part of the movie, though, is that it's relatable because it's about everybody's mind, not just the narrow one of an unbelievably smart and brave or a stupid and mindless character. The movie begs the question of what the viewer would do in that situation, since it could theoretically happen. This makes it doubly good because it is not only mindless terror, but you realize that logically it could happen to you. It wasn't a classically perfect movie, but it was close."

It has a lot of horror and blood that is not recommended for child because despite it is a good movie for some persons, it can jury the sensitive of other persons. On the other hand, if you are a fan of horror movies do not doubt on watching this movie because you will pass a terrifying but entertaining moment with many horror. I hardly recommend this movie because it's a good horror movie and the main idea is original."

","Thriller fans can finally breathe again, or better hold their breath again; because once again there is a good no-nonsense thriller out there that stays away from Hollywood clichÃ©s and will chill you to the bone. Although the film is very original overall I'll among the first ones to admit that it sort of leans on a premise similar to that in Cube (in some ways). Now originality, for starters, are already two big thumbs up for this film, since it is unpredictable from beginning to end. Every once in a while you will catch yourself thinking: ""Now I get it..."" and I bet you: You do NOT get it! But there is much more to this film than originality. What I especially liked about this film, was that it was shocking and disturbing, without being too graphical. You know, many films (especially horror and splatter films) are very graphic, but in being so they lose every chance at being gory or disturbing. A film like this though (or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)) is maintains a certain sense or realism and becomes truly disturbing because it avoids visual overkill. This cannot be accomplished though without the help of a good script, good actors and a capable filmmaker behind the camera and let me tell you Saw has it all. James Wan really put himself and fellow writer Leigh Whannell on the map with this one. There is not a single hole to be found in the entire story and the directing is good (although somewhat messy in some scenes with the head gear). I for one am excited to see Wans next picture (with Whanell contribution of course), although I'm not too keen on seeing Saw 2. To me it seems as pointless as a Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, but hey they even made American Psycho 2 and Cruel Intentions 3, so I guess there's no stopping the Hollywood machinery...nonetheless some things are better left alone! <br/><br/>8 out of 10<br/><br/>post scriptum: I know it's hard to believe but I actually saw the Dutch premiere of this film"

If you cut your foot off at the ankle, you would quickly bleed to death. Elwes is a better actor than this... and the little putz on the other side of the urinal is a horrible actor! Does anybody really care about these characters? Has Danny Glover sunk so low after ""Lethal Weapon?"" Please tell me they're not going to waste more film on a sequel..?

A film with such a low budget like this one doesn't come around very often but when it does, BAM! it hits you hard. what a fabulous film, I had heard bits about it but nothing could have made me sit up like SAW did. Costumes, sets, dialog, make up all fitted in like a big budget film, but this had an edge and an ending fit for an Oscar nomination. I brought the DVD and watched it twice, then with the narration on with Whannel and Wan. Even that was so entertaining because they really enjoyed talking about the movie and the great time they had making it with the caliber of actors and producers.

I think the makers of these movies try to outwit this silly talkative know-it-all guy sitting among the audience; by making the most unexpected ending. This blows the whole logic of the movie..

"spoon_qb","10","0","1","6 June 2005"," Best thriller ever...
","Best thriller ever! No thriller can compare with this one. Everything links in the end in a beautiful conspiracy to learn man to appreciate what they have. The ""killer"" (he never killed anyone with his bare hands or a gun from his hands) puts the victims in very delicate situations. The victims are not ""angels"", they all are guilty of various sins. The killer kidnaps them and when they wake up they find themselves in a adrenaline rushing situation. They all get a tape that tells them their faith. This is the most important choice in their entire life. Whether to live another few hours or to live forever (untill their time is up), because in comparison with the few hours in captivity they have, any second outside is an eternity. The missions they have to complete are very hard and they change your perspective on everything about life. The propose is to make you appreciate what you already have (family, life,...). <br/><br/>The killer himself is a dieing man. He has cancer and he is very tired of the people unappreciative for what they have, always running like hypnotized creatures after more and more, always complaining about something in their life. The killer wakes them up with a very cold and life threatening shower. The killer's plans are perfect. No one was able to catch him or to see his face (no one still alive). He makes a mistake but he is to well prepared for everything. <br/><br/>The actors are amazing giving that psycho feeling to the movie. The film ends beautifully. Until the end you don't know who the killer is, but you have a man with a gun ready to shot everyone, so you think that's the killer. But in the end you realize that everyone is a puppet for the real mastermind. <br/><br/>See this movie! It's worth it. Ohhhh...and please be found of what you have...Wake up!"
"SteveHevetS","1","0","1","28 May 2005"," Very strong -- if only the budget matched the script, this could have been brilliant
","***Mild spoilers*** There are two things that stood out for me in this film. The central concept was very good. The killer contrived inventive ways in which to effect his kills. This plot device provided a basis for incorporating a purposive interaction between the killer and various characters in the film. The motivation for choosing victims is one that is often used, but to me that is Okay, because it is one that rings true. His actions were justified, in his mind, on what were essentially moral grounds. There's an interesting spin on this in the film though, with the emphasis placed on valuing just being alive. Ironic, sure, but this is common in life, with some of the most horrific crimes perpetrated by some of the most professedly religious or otherwise moralistic of people; that is, some of the most hypocritical people.<br/><br/>Some very interesting moral dilemmas unfolded in Saw, as is almost always the case in a good movie. The ending was also a good one. The pace was pretty good. At times a little slow, but generally a lot happened, and without any obvious holes. There were some questions I had about the plot, but that may be because I've only seen the film once. I am unsure about the specific motivation and rationale for the killer's choice of victims, or at least participants in the scenarios.<br/><br/>The only thing holding the film back for me was the budget. They made the most of what they had, don't get me wrong. Still, with better actors in a couple of key roles, this could have been a brilliant film. I didn't find Adam all that convincing, personally. In an ideal world, you wouldn't rate a film based on its budget, but I watched this on home theater, and really good effects can complete a film like this. Great films have compelling actors in all major roles. Having said that, they did a damned good job with what they had.<br/><br/>Better than Silence of the Lambs, which had to much psychobabble for my taste. Saw is smarter. On a par with Cell, though the effects in Cell were stunning, while the story is what makes Saw really strong. Thought long and hard about giving this one an 8. Maybe I will after seeing it again, depending on just how strong the story is. Definitely worth seeing, provided you have the stomach for this sort of thing."

","Aside from ""Amityville Horror"", there were a bunch of BAD, and I mean really BAD, horror movies out in the past few years. Especially ones that try to force plot into you but don't work, or ones that can't hold a plot for Cadbury bunnies! Movies that only work on scares and doing them very poorly throw me off, and I've grown rather irritated at them. <br/><br/>SAW came out in theaters some months ago, though I haven't caught a chance to watch it, because of my overly bearing skepticism. Now, I have caught myself a chance to watch it, and the uncut one for that matter. <br/><br/>What SAW gave me was amazing breadth of tension. Yes, I've never felt so much tension mixed in with extremely well-thought-out cleverness. Here we have starting off with 2 guys who are confined in a skanky secure and dank bathroom, with their feet cuffed up, by some maniac who's given them their ultimatum; to kill each other and be set free if done so. They are given a variety of options and clues to help themselves free, though they all turn out to lead to the extreme of measures taken, no matter how hard they try to outwit this sick mastermind. A myriad of other individuals are plunged into this terrifying game that is being set up, and they are also enforcing their own methods to be set free of their ultimatum. <br/><br/>What happens towards the end is gradual breakdown. And not just the tidy measures, but extremes are enacted in their breakdown. You wouldn't expect it at all, but the moments are gripping. Frantic pacing and extremely clever screenplay are the trademark of a film of this caliber. It's a serious recommend to those like me who hate horror movies, and instead go see it for the brain-jogging it puts the viewer in. Even gore fans won't be disappointed by this. Let's just hope the sequel (err-hum!! sequels....) that will soon come out will not be disappointing at all. <br/><br/>This non-murderous mastermind has a way of grabbing you by the leash and fastening it to steel, and not letting you go until the very last threshold where the credits start rolling..........Go see it."

","Saw is a very good scary movie that keeps your attention throughout. The main premise of the movie is pretty original and never gets boring. Two men awake in a dingy bathroom chained to opposite ends of the room with a dead man lying in between them. They must learn why they are there and how to escape alive! However the movie's B story lines are not nearly as well done. But the story keeps moving at a pretty good pace and does not bog down which help keep the audience's attention. The movie's look and feel is perfect and this helps to overcome the generally poor acting. Especially by Cary Elwes who is often emoting way over the top throughout the film. The film is also a needlessly gory with lots of blood and guts. If you like a creepy film that is clever and can keep you guessing then Saw just might be for you."

I also liked Danny Glover, Ken Leung and Michael Emerson is superb as a very creepy character, Zep. Saw is great because it is one of the few movies that doesn't have a happy ending, but has a spectacular ending none-the-less and is the most surprising I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Saw is also heavily compared to the excellent Se7en, but it is surprisingly fresh and it never feels like it's copying. <br/><br/>This Saw is dangerously sharp and if you haven't seen it already I recommend that you do because it will simply blow you away."

The so called ""games"" that the killer puts his victims through are horrible and made me cringe in most places. It has a strong story and (just when you think it's going to follow the predicable ending path), it comes back at you with a twist worthy of the usual suspects! I love this movie, plus it also has a soundtrack composed by Danny Lohter of NIN fame and Page Hamilton of Helmet fame.

","Saw is the best horror film to come around in the last ten years. Yes, I said it.<br/><br/>You have a amazingly cool premise, perfectly written story, and surprisingly decent acting for a very low-budget film. Jigsaw has to be the coolest villain in this kind film to come around in quite some time.<br/><br/>The film starts out with two men waking up in a bathroom. They have no idea how they got there. On the middle of the floor is a dead body, a man who apparently blown his brains out. Next to his hand is a tape recorder. After figuring out how to turn on the lights, the two men find tapes and listen to them. Adam has to kill the other man before six am, or else Jigsaw will kill his wife and daughter.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Adam explains to the other man how he knows who has done this to him, and kind of the back story of Jigsaw. We see the other various situations he's put people into and the outcomes of them. Very gruesome stuff. And perhaps, the major downfall of this film is Danny Glover.<br/><br/>Of course we all know a film like this won't do very well at the Box Office if it doesn't have at least one big name in it, however, Danny Glover's role in this movie is just kind of a big waste. It feels more like filler to get to the ending of the film rather then being interesting.<br/><br/>Without giving much more away, Saw is a film that everyone should see. I highly recommend it. It got mixed reviews by critics everywhere, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The ending of Saw, which is the best part, is shocking and probably the best ending of any movie you'll ever see. It's crazy, and next to the twist ending of ""Matchstick Men"", it's the best ending I've personally ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>Saw is a violent film, but it's not nearly as disturbing as I thought going into it. You should be able to handle everything. Most of the gore occur's off screen. It's more psychological then anything else.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Grade A-"

Mostly what I've found are comparisons to Se7en. No move compares to Se7en; end of story. Saw takes place in what appears to be a vacant bathroom that's probably been abandoned for 20 years or so. As they say the first 10 minuets of the movie are the most important. Well that is true, and this movie will have you going until the acting begins. The acting in the beginning sucks, but it does get better as the movie progresses. The ending was played out beautifully, which is probably one of the best parts of the movie. The death scenes in here are pretty good too. And of course the gore factor... it's really not that bad. The only nasty parts are when the girl is going through the opium-upped guy's stomach to search for a key, and the part where one of the cops gets a portion of his head blown off.

"jpschapira","6","0","2","2 May 2005"," Being different...
","I was truly looking forward to see this movie. It was one of the most talked about films from the last months. Some consider it as one of the best movies of 2004; some think it's a terrible movie; some didn't get it; some were amazed by itOne friend of mine, who loves movies, or so I think, told me: ""It was too weird for my taste""; and another friend said it was great. Maybe I'd explain ""Saw"" from the first idea (although I won't), but I would never start from the second one.<br/><br/>The movie is different in its own good. Different is great, and more when it comes to horror movies (wait, ""Saw"" is not exactly horror, but I'll explain later). It's one of the bravest movies in the genre I've seen in a while. It commences with James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who are probably close friends and workers. I imagine they had this incredible idea that could step out of everything we watch every day, and developed it. Later, it became a phenomenon. What they got with the project? Recognition and probably (although not luckily) success. Wan has an eye for this stuff. His style is riveting as it is exuberant and in some way trapping. He got his team, he worked hard and that's why he generated what he generated.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie seem exaggerated but unforced at the same time, so they can seem realistic. Julie Berghoff, for a first important job, did an outstanding job designing the production. Excellent visuals in this piece. Mysterious sceneries and characters wander through the set; prepared for anything. When Wan uses the typical compilation of scenes with strong sounds, so everything seems scary and freaky (then we can say ""weird"" here); or when we sense the problems the movie has with time, because during most of the film you can't tell if a thing is happening or if it has happened We just keep watching, and don't care about it, because he has done the rest so well (but we still can't forgive him everything).<br/><br/>Don't say about the narrative. Both Wan and Whannell managed to create realistic characters that are also quirky. I mean; quirky is common in movies from the genre, butRealistic? Not common at all. Then he drives us to his unbelievably original story, which involves the ""weirdest"" villain mask since ""Scream"". This plot is extremely intelligent, dealing with the issue that a crazy sadistic killer bastard might have the purpose to save people trying to take their lives away. It could be. Even when we don't see him, he says phrases: ""People are so ungrateful to be alive"", or ""no one appreciates their blessings"". That's why this man invents perfectly detailed games for people to kill themselves. Anyone can call him the ""Jigsaw Killer"", but Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) explains: ""Technically, he is not a murderer. He's never killed anyone"". These games you'll see; I won't even say the most important one of the movie, because is one of the great things the movie has. What the hell has happened? This is what Dr. Gordon and Adam (Leigh Whannell) are wondering when they wake up in an isolated room. A whole movie ensues in there.<br/><br/>Performances are adequate and precise. Without risking too much, actors level up with the complex material. Even Leigh Whannell gets his acting chance as Adam (writing has benefits). His performance is alright; he could have done better when he wrote the screenplay and new more than the rest. Cary Elwes remains unrecognizable in every role he does. I hadn't seen him since ""The cat's meow"", where I didn't recognize him either. He stands out, and made me forget about the stupid character he played in ""Liar Liar"". Danny Glover, away from movies since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", plays Detective Tapp as he only can. It was good to see him again. I can also talk about Monica Potter (Alison) who had clearly been away since ""Along came a spider"", where she was as unnoticeable as she is here.<br/><br/>It happens to me, as I see some movies of this genre, that I notice a certain complexity. I recently saw ""My little eye""; I'm talking about movies when not everything is blood and death. There is also an amount of persons, who have their own personalities. It's not, I told a friend, ""the guy with the gun"", ""the other man"". And that's another adding to the movie's stand out originality. It's not horror; I would take a chance to say. It's suspense, and even drama. You won't jump off your seat. You get what I'm saying? But what is it that makes this a regular movie, if there are so many great things about it? It's about taking the risk of finishing the challenge; about not falling into the abyss of cliché and ordinariness. This film's triumph would have been achieved if they had written everything with the same intelligence. But they arrived at the ending and met the dilemma. Did they finish the challenge? No, they didn't. And it doesn't matter what their objective was."

","'Saw' is a horror film that works and this is not small stuff in a genre that was that much loaded recently with pretentious productions, expensive actors, but with no real effect on the screen. I believe that the quality of the film starts with the story which has logic, develops at a good pace and surprises the viewer at any corner from the very beginning to the end. The Australian director James Wan does best with a team of anonymous actors, and leads us through the twists of the story without any visible flaw. The movie has a high amount of ketchup blood and tough scenes even for its genre, but when solid logic stands behind it is perfectly OK for the viewer who comes to expect it."

","I don't usually give movies of any kind ten stars, particularly the slasher send-ups; I will gladly make an exception in the case of ""Saw"". Up until now, ""Candyman II: Farewell to the Flesh"", was my fave, but this offering beats it hook, line, sinker, pole, fisherman and the ding-dong boat--which is probably a mixed metaphor, but I just got done watching this thing, and I'm still not down enough yet to be overly rational.<br/><br/>Not only are the murder situations schizophrenic enough to make me glad that the kid that wrote it lives in Australia (at least, I hope he still does), but plotwise it had more twists than an India rubber man making love to a Circe du Soleil contortionist with a copy of the ""Kama Sutra"" nearby for reference. And without a doubt it has the best ""surprise ending"" since ""The Sixth Sense"". The only reason I can imagine that more has not been made of this little depraved effort is the deep-seated prejudice that most ""mainstream"" (read: stupid) critics have against horror.<br/><br/>Ten Stars!

","The movie Saw is a ""horror"" movie, featuring a serial make-other-people-kill-other-people killer. So, technically, he's never killed anybody. Nice.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a perfectly entertaining whodunnit which posits a villain so clever that he can orchestrate elaborate do-or-die scenarios for his captives to accomplish. I won't spoil it because I recommend it, at least inasmuch as you overlook the plot contrivance that would require the master villain to be a person of immense wealth who also has the ability to Excel spreadsheet all the various possibilities of his plan and account for them, down to the insanely small possibilities.<br/><br/>The basic premise is two guys chained to pipes on opposite ends of a bathroom, one charged with killing the other by six o'clock, the other charged with preventing his own death. Why? so the serial non-killer can show the value of living. Blech. But, still, it's well done, well acted, even though all the while you're saying to yourself nobody could concoct such a Bondian method of killing the protagonist. You have to ignore the realities that would intrude, and you can do this, since the plot tries to be true, but then at the end of the film, when you get the gotcha moment, you realize it could never have really happened.<br/><br/>And not just because the writer/director fooled you with all the misdirection, which I liked because that is good movie making, but because it would have been physically impossible to do. It's good because it's not predictable, even though you're predicting it. It's got all the ""if you've seen a horror movie then do this"" moments in it that the characters don't do, and at one point I was talking to the TV saying, ""Shoot him now. Shoot him now. Don't ask a question. Shoot him. Maybe in the femur, but shoot him."" I mean, if you've ever seen, say, 19 horror films, you know that once you get the gun from the bad guy, you don't do anything else other than subdue him. For sure, you don't call someone on your cell phone. Puhleese. He might get the gun back. Shoot him in the leg, at least.<br/><br/>All this was intentional, I'm guessing, which would make this a post-modern horror film since the characters surely recognize they're in a horror film and try to do sensible things, at least for a while. I mean: the film does end with a gotcha."

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this smart. It was predictable in spots, but if you roll with them, you'll still be pleasantly surprised at where you end up. The acting did leave something to be desired, but the plot and story lines more than make up for that. Danny Glover was a nice addition to the lineup. I think he anchored the whole movie in way.

","This is a pretty good movie, it moves along from the beginning and keeps going. Not as gory as I thought it might be but still quite a bit of blood. It suffers from the same illogic of most of these kinds of movies, i.e. when the bad guy is *almost* captured and could be either quickly killed or disabled, they don't shoot him but talk or otherwise allow themselves to be distracted and of course the bad guy regains control. Also, how does the bad guy manage to get access to all these spooky gvt abandoned places AND why is someone still paying the electric bills to keep the lights on in buildings that appear to have been abandoned years earlier? Still, you expect this kind of illogic in a SAW style movie and as long as you can put that aside it's a lot better movie then most of the blood and gore flics that pass for suspense nowdays."

","This was definitely one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen. The plot was pretty good, not the best, but still amazingly good for a horror movie. It was scarier the first time because I didn't know what was going to happen, but when I saw it a second time I could focus more on the plot and what things tied together. There were a few bad scenes, like the chase scene where those 2 cops chased the killer, but no movie is perfect. The killer really played with your mind, and Saw was gory, scary, and just psychologically freaky. <br/><br/>The end of Saw was very satisfying, but I hate the fact that there will be a sequel - that just ruins the whole 1st movie. There's nothing more that can happen without it seeming stupid and drawn out. So if you see the second one, my advice is not to judge the 1st one by how the 2nd one is. <br/><br/>So, I think that everyone should see Saw - it's truly a great movie."

","There has been a recent surge in horror movies lately, from remakes of classics to supposedly original films. Most of these are hissably enjoyable - that is, one can think of them as flights of fancy, whimsical farces that deserve to be laughed at, not with.<br/><br/>Saw, however, fits under a different category: movies that grab you from the get-go and never let go, relentless keeping you on edge, so much so that even after you've turned off the TV and are safe under the covers in your Happy Spot, the unease sticks with you.<br/><br/>Two men, Lawrence (Carey Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also co-wrote the story with James Wan, the director), wake up in an abandoned public bathroom. Stuff is oozing along the walls. There's a foul stench. BOth men are chained by the ankle to huge, imposing pipes. And there's a dead man in the middle of the room, laying face down in a pool of slowly drying blood. Neither man knows how he arrived in his present state. Then an unseen killer informs them that one must kill the other by 6 pm that evening - or Lawrence's family will be murdered.<br/><br/>Lawrence and Adam figure out that they've been placed there by a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jigsaw, a psychopath who manipulates his victims into killing each other. The movie dances back and forth in flashbacks to explain what the killer's done in the past (but not, of course, what he plans to do with Lawrence and Adam), which only heightens the suspense.<br/><br/>See, this isn't a typical serial-killer movie, wherein your garden-variety Serial Killer Dude picks a theme (Ten Commandments, Seven Deadly Sins, zodiac symbols, alphabet, what have you) and then the scriptwriters get creative with the gore. Uh-uh. Now, don't get me wrong, there's gore in this movie - so shoo the kids and make sure the dog's looking the other way - but so much of the horror is perceived, rather than presented. And that's what I love about Saw. At times, it's inventively icky, but it never dwells on the sicko aspect of the killer's machinations. What it does particularly well, I think, is that it constantly keeps you wondering what's going to happen next - but never satisfying, never letting you settle into a comfort zone. Good horror films make your skin crawl not by how many buckets of blood they can spatter across the screen but by the mere anticipation of them; what's more, the best horror films make you honestly and unequivocally believe that what's happening to the protagonists could happen to you, too.<br/><br/>I mentioned there's been a surge in horror films, but it's more of a glut of mediocrity. Saw rises far above its brethren."

The terror and fear the film produces is of a brand I haven't experienced for quite a long time (not since ""Session 9"" at least, albeit for different reasons). More chilling than a supernatural story simply because, however far-fetched it may seem to the cynical viewer, the events depicted in ""Saw"" are possible of being concocted by the sick mind of a serial killer, and are not completely outside the realms of reality.<br/><br/>Without going into it too much through fear of spoiling the ending, the film's ability to surprise you at every turning is excellent and doesn't fail to impress until the end credits are rolling.<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch."

""Saw"" is a cerebral, edgy, disturbing ride, and that's no joke. What it's about? Well, as you probably know, it's about two guys locked in a room under very grim and confusing circumstances, with a corpse laying between them in a bloody mess. From the get-go, all that they really know is that it has been orchestrated by a very sick person who has found ways to get his victims to kill themselves in some VERY creative and yucky ways. ""Saw"" works as a murder mystery, a horror/splatter movie, and a downbeat thriller. Naturally, some people wanted to see ""Seven"" and were disappointed; too bad for them. Good mileage is got out of the cast; even the newcomers and various unknowns turn in wonderful performances. Also, if you can figure out who the killer is before it's revealed, you have got to be one intelligent viewer! I myself was kept guessing and guessing. All I can say further is that ""Saw"" bears my highest recommendation, and, again, if you want either ""Seven"" or just another slasher flick, this great movie can't be blamed for such disappointments.

"mottaboy66","8","0","3","28 March 2005"," Mmmmm... juicy!
","In the spirit of movies like ""Seven"", ""Saw"" is a juicy mix of graphic horror and psychological trickery. This is not a horror movie at all. There are no boogie men or spooky ghosts in this one. The bad guy this time around is just a man, though he seems to lack any real humanity. Dubbed the Jiggsaw killer, this evil antagonist kidnaps people and forces them into nightmarish situations, which is where we find our two main characters Adam (Leigh Whannel) and Lawrence (Cary Elwes) at the start of the film, both chained to the walls of a disease soaked bathroom. With only a pair of saws and instructions from their captor to make a decision of whether or not to kill the other to gain freedom, the story of how the two men are connected unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Mixed in with them are also scenes that show the aftermath of the Jigsaw killer's other crimes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as the detective assigned to investigate these strange events as well, though his role is second to most of the other characters. What struck me the most as I came out of this movie was how well the director used different styles of fear throughout the film. There were a few jump scares, but they weren't over-used by any means. The concepts that the killer comes up with to torture his victims were some of the most grizzly and well thought out ideas I've seen in a serial killer film. The movie isn't nearly as gore-filled as the previews may lead one to believe either, which I felt was another nice touch. My only beef with this movie would have to be with some of the actor's performances. I realize that acting scared can be tricky sometimes, but when you make a career out of it, I honestly think you should be a bit more convincing than some of the actors were in this movie. The soundtrack has mistakenly been said to be a nice mix of heavy metal and grunge music, featuring bands like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails and Fear Factory. While these are hardly what I would consider ""heavy metal"" bands, (Fear Factory excluded), the music that is used does fit well in the movie's context. BOTTOM LINE: One of the best balances of jump fear, juicy splatter-punk and disturbing suspense I have seen in a while. An underdog of a scary movie in a time with very little hope left for the genre."

","SAW is the purest horror film that has been made in a while. It is one of those movies that sucks you in and leaves you feeling as if you've just witnessed something that's not just horrendous, but ground-breaking. This must be what people felt like in 1984 when they had seen A Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time, or in 1978 when people saw Halloween for the first time. When it comes to franchise horror, there have been no major players since Ghost Face (Scream) in the 90's. Jigsaw will be the franchise horror villain for the early 2000's.<br/><br/>Watching the games that Jigsaw has created is an experience in itself, in that you feel as if Leigh Whannel (Adam/co-writer) is a sick man. But that's what it takes to write good horror. It takes a creative mind that sits back and asks the question ""What is the worst thing I can possibly do to someone?"" Well, Leigh Whannel figured out exactly what those things are, considering that the things Jigsaw does to people is not only horribly brutal, but absolutely genius.<br/><br/>If you are a horror purist, SAW gives you everything you could possibly want. It's disturbing, it's scary, it's brilliant. To pass on SAW is to pass on a true movie viewing experience. SAW is the next big thing of franchise horror."

If you dig movies like Freddy Vs Jason or The Exorcist IV, this movie isn't for you. Sorry. This movie is about the jigsaw killer, a killer that NEVER and I mean NEVER kills people. Yeap, he can be arrested and free the next day. But I won't tell you the plot because after you will say it's very predictable & any crap like that when it's not! That movie deserve the perfect TEN for the category of movie it is and it's psychological thriller. When the horror appears, it is for a reason, to tell you something, not just to scare you but to make work your brain something Hollywood don't like to do the past 20 years. Don't rant it, BUY it if you're a fan of pure psychological thrillers."

","I admit, I walked into this film with preconceived assumptions and ideas, and to my dismay I was right . . . again. Were it not for the fact that I've long since accepted the overly cliché nature of films (especially horror/action flicks), I probably would have found Saw abysmally disappointing and feel the need to bash it to pieces in this review. The overly ridiculous premise would not have set with me at all, and the inevitable plot turns would have elicited a yawn and a ""been there, done that, what's new?"" attitude. Note  that's not necessarily calling Saw bad, just lacking any real ambition which is a crime that describes the bulk of the film industry.<br/><br/>I anticipate faux-originality, and I fully expect Saw to take the wrong path in trying to keep the audience on guard--throwing more shadows, more masks, more sheets (whatever) than any other genre film before all so it can keep the mysterious Jigsaw killer hidden longer instead of, I dunno, taking a genuinely different approach to get the suspense. A game of ""Let's guess the killer"" that tries so hard to outdo the film that came before it. Who will be the first to direct a film that consists of nothing but unmasking scenes only to find there's nothing there? I wonder . . .<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the film is the jerky sped up sections for more intense moments; it felt like even the director didn't want to sit through a large section of his own film and hit the fast forward button. Granted, the unnatural speed and rhythm could set up tension; however, instead the effect fails miserably, it even comes across as music-video silly, effectively killing any potential suspense and we get a neat/annoying visual gimmick.<br/><br/>My second complaint deals with the writing behind Danny Glover's character, who exists in the movie for the sole sake of revealing the next step of the plot and letting the killer get away (usually at some personal cost) at pre-destined points in time as outlined by the handbook for generic scriptwriting. No fault of the actor; the writers just did not bother trying to cover up this formula driven character and his virtually worthless existence in the film.<br/><br/>And lastly, the murder-mystery/action film clichés that managed to take a firm grip in this film and never fully let go. Congratulations in advance for figuring out that the killer, when cornered, is not actually caught--when the gun is pointed at the bad guy, he's not shot when he should be shot and some distraction comes up so he regains the gun, and add in about 20 minutes worth of these back to back.<br/><br/>Really, the clichés shouldn't bother me as much as they do; I have no idea how many films I've let slip by without commenting on their cliché factor. I guess it's because by most other accounts, Saw is pretty good. It has some worthwhile production values, good actors, a few slick camera moves here and there, and a nice score. Maybe these elements bothered me because part of me sincerely hopes that one day I'll be able to walk into a film like this completely wrong in my preconceived assumptions and find myself impressed that the creators did, indeed, have real ambition, and do something genuinely different.<br/><br/>Saw, unfortunately, while a decent horror experience, was not that film."
"Boulizon","9","0","1","14 March 2005"," Saw- the next generation of suspense movie
","SAW... The next generation of suspense, the movie directed by James Wan was successful in the high way of suspense. No need to wonder about WHo the psychotic murderer will kill but now on we watch how the VICTIMS kill each others. The Murderer is a kind of John Doe saw in Seventh and you can be certain that his theory about life and death was taking the audience into a deep reflexion. The angles filmed give the screen suspense so high. It isn't blood and gore and language that freak someone but in which circumstances the chain of events happen and how it's ending. That film is strong and gigantic example of how Freaking movies should be. The Epilogue of the film takes the public to some unpredictable and unseen ending. The music scored a powerful freaking audio in which the suspense is taken. Always the suspense as along as it is correctly taken. In the end when we heard about the recording tape from the Jigsaw killer we can easily freak a little and feel that the ""punishment"" of been ungrateful to life is just starting back.<br/><br/>We never know about the two main protagonists if they will die or not but we can surely presume that the Jigsaw killer had predicted their deaths."

","Clever film, but in no way can this ever compare to the suspense and ingenuity of se7en.<br/><br/>Se7en was the only film ever I have been to see where the lights came up in the cinema, the end credits rolled and the whole audience (Me included) sat there in stunned silence.<br/><br/>This film seems a little amateurish for some reason and I don't think it's Danny Glover's best work.<br/><br/>Se7en's John Doe has a more chilling agenda than the terminal cancer patient angry off that everyone who doesn't have cancer is self destructive. Doesn't seem a good excuse .<br/><br/>I also don't like the level of violence towards the doctor's child. That was very disturbing and it put me off the film.<br/><br/>It would still have been suspenseful if it had just been his wife that was taken hostage."
"Systematicer","7","0","1","5 March 2005"," It's OK
","How long did I wait to say this: I saw ""Saw"". Yeah!<br/><br/>Well, it was OK. The last 20 minutes were pretty stupid. The twist (if you can call it that) had nothing special, but it was alright. I mean, who cares who did it if you don't see this guy during the movie or has any special relation to someone in the movie anyway. There was a point in watching this movie when I had hopes it's gonna be good, but every minute that passed made it a little more mediocre. The soundtrack could have been better and better placed and the plot had so big holes, I could have thrown my foot through it. But the filmmaker did a pretty good job. The acting was not that great but at any rate bearable.<br/><br/>It was shot in 18 days and it's budget was $1,200,000. According to that, it's pretty good. It was suspenseful, even if it didn't pay out in the end. But at least it didn't give me a reason to be p!ssed off about watching this.<br/><br/>I'll give it 7/10, even if I thought about giving it a 6 because of the bad and sometimes over-the-top plot. But it's sometimes intense and has some good stuff.<br/><br/>Funny fact: Tobin Bell lay on the bathroom floor, perfectly still, for six days. He was not replaced with a dummy because the filmmakers could not afford one.<br/><br/>My personal favorite was the guy who had flammable substance all over his body and had to carry a candle to save himself. He kinda lost.^^ That was funny."
"jaredmarks","2","0","2","4 March 2005"," Great Script, worst acting ever
","The script for Saw is absolutely genius, obviously very well thought out and intricately designed; however, the acting was so sub-par I feel it drastically takes away from the movies ability to move the viewer. During many scenes, I felt like I was actually watching actors ACT, not watching real people behave as they would. The two characters, one of who is the writer and should stick to that line of work, were so unrealistic and UNbelievable. Their screams and bits of intensity do not seem genuine in any way. I fear the production of the film was rushed because this could have been an 8 or 9 for me. Also, I think with respect to Saw trying to be a horror/thriller, it could have been even gorier. The puzzles were absolutely amazing and very provocative, so I give them that. Lastly, some of the dialogue was so far from anything I could imagine writing. Doctor Gordon, while trapped in a bathroom for hours, seemingly permanently chained to a pipe, and well aware of the extreme nature of the person he's dealing with, says something like, ""I'm gonna kill you when i get my hands on you."" Like, are you kidding me? Nobody in that situation would say something like this."

","I usually hate horror films and never watch movies with some mad psychos mutilating their victims, but i had to see ""Saw"". When I first heard about it I was like: Who the hell wants to watch such nasty crap? But it really made me curious and so I went to see it. Already the beginning of the movie is absolutely ingenious. From the very first second on the movie creates a unbearable suspense filled with cruelty that's a lot worse than in ""Seven"". Seeing those people struggling to get out of their traps is something not everyone can cope with. (I didn't and that's why I had to leave room twice during the movie) I don't want to tell you to much, but the best thing about the whole film is the end, when the identity of the killer is revealed.

Not to mention that I did not think the doctor would actually cut his foot off. I mean, that part actually made me sick to my stomach. They did an incredible job of making the doctor's face super pale after he cut off the foot and the blood left him. Well done. I didn't quite get that it was a doll, either. I thought the crazy face was a mask that the killer was wearing, not a doll. The face was utterly disturbing no matter whether you thought it was a doll or not, though. Overall, top-notch thriller with a solid plot, sick theme and generally scary crap going on the whole time. It was one of those movies where I try and put myself in any character's position and ask myself who I'd want to be if I had to be someone. This movie?? No one. Wife?

","A well thought out horror/crime/thriller that plays along the same lines as Seven. All the clues to working out the mystery are available throughout the movie - this is done in a very clever and deliberate manner.<br/><br/>One critical comment is the acting ability of Cary Elwes as Dr. Lawrence Gordon, his range of emotion throughout the movie is a little unbelievable at times, he comes off as wooden, which is fine in something like Hot Shots where he's playing the straight funny man, but not good when you have to use a lot of different emotions in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>I thought Danny Glover provided a solid supporting role and he certainly helped to add to the tension of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for those that enjoyed Seven, it is just as graphic and on par in way of script and direction."
"somf","8","0","1","21 February 2005"," Revives my interest in the horror genre...
","It was about the time that ""The Blair Witch Project"" made a jillion dollars when I decided that I no longer understood what made a good horror flick and that the genre was something that I was no longer interested in. The big budgets can't get it right anymore and neither can the indies. I've enjoyed the recent Japanese remakes somewhat, but have not been enjoyed all the video game flicks or the recent popular remakes of horror classics. (Of course, I don't care for either of ""the dawn of the dead"" flicks so I'm stretching to call the original a classic). But ""Saw"" is really good. It had a clever script with a twist that I did not see coming. Yeah it was a bit over the top a couple of times on the disgust-o-meter, but only a couple of times. I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel; although the clever twist cannot be duplicated effectively which may dampen the sequels effect. But here are my gripes. I can't stand Cary Elwes. Never have liked the guy. He's a pretty boy that never was that pretty. Now at 40 something....well let me put it this way, if you're a male wearing eye makeup or eye shadow or whatever the hell he was wearing all during ""Saw"" you probably wouldn't have a wife and kid to worry about. And the guy is so fey to go along with it. Was that the character or the actor. If that was the character I say bad choice. If that was the actor I say bad actor. Actually, I say bad actor in either scenario. Second gripe. For the sequel, Mr. Wan, 86 the editing while on meth. Those speed cuts are really annoying. Like when Danny Glover has a car chase with the orderly guy and those flashback scenes. Take a deep breath and slow it down. Your entire audience does not have AADD. A lot of them probably, but not all."

","With more sickness than the average hospital ward, and more devilishly twisted situations than any other film released in the last ten years; Saw became an almost instant cult hit upon release. And for good reason. It's always reassuring when you see a film like this that was made recently as it shows that filmmakers haven't become so jaded that the possibility of producing a film that isn't afraid to disturb its audience is beyond the realms of possibility. Not since 'Seven' have cinema audiences seen a twisted psychological thriller that works, and Saw is by far the best on that front since the release of Finchers modern semi-classic. Although it doesn't have the high quality production values and big name cast that Seven had; it still succeeds in being repulsive and actually quite frightening, so the production values are never a problem.<br/><br/>Saw has received much criticism for the fact that it doesn't have a lot of backbone, and this is, actually, true. The early sequences are little more than one twisted situation after another, which will no doubt annoy some viewers - but not this one! The situations that our killer puts his victims into are some of the most ingenious I've ever seen in a film. Rich with irony and inventiveness, never mind annoying - I wanted more! Once the first half hour or so has elapsed, it's then that the film starts to explore the minds of our two central characters. It's also then that it starts to get really interesting as the tension mounts and we begin to put ourselves in their macabre situation. Sure, the acting is rubbish, with The Dread Pirate Roberts being of particular note for turning in a half-assed performance, but when a film is this dark and unpleasant - who cares? The atmosphere in the movie is it's best aspect, with various gadgets including dolls and masks providing more than enough shocks. Saw is a slick and stylish thriller that wont do much for the feint of heart, but is a must see for the more morbid-minded film fans amongst us. My advice to those people is simply ""see it now""."

The directors did an excellent job of keeping their viewers attention throughout the entire film. Plus, the fact that ""Jigsaw"" could very well be any of the characters lets you trust almost nobody.

It does have a straight to video feel to it when you watch it, but nonetheless it delivers. As in any straight to video film, you don't expect much from the acting, but the acting in Saw was pretty much on point. Pretty neat twist at the end as well.

","I thought this movie was going to be good. Mistake number one. I didn't set my standards very high, but it still didn't meet them. Clue number one that I was watching a bad movie, when Cary's character is telling the story he gives a detailed description of the cops point o view at the various murder scenes. But I gave it the doubt and kept watching. The plot is established that Jigsaw wants the Dr to kill the photographer. This would be the most interesting element in the story if they would have made the characters actually think about doing it. But the instead want to help each other. When the Dr. saw the photo of his family it should have set him off on a kill rampage.. but later when it's ""too late"" and his wife is actually calling him to say she was alright, he snaps cuts of his foot and attempts killing that photographer... bad story telling.<br/><br/>THE ORDERLY! When I saw him first pop his head into the movie, I sarcastically thought to myself, ""Wow, I'll never see that guy again."" And like clockwork he returned holding the family hostage. But there must be a second person working with him, cause how could he kidnap the to captives and be at the Dr.'s house. Seconds later... The cop is spying on the orderly. OH i sad, he's the murderer and he's gone Crazy! Next scene, shows that he's not the murdered and he's crazy for another reason. BUT THEN was the purpose, later, of making the ""shocking"" plot twist of having the Adam actually knowing the DR. He was spying on him, for the crazy-ex-cop. And they already ruled out the cop as a suspect in our mind. And if Adam's only connection to the Dr is the cop, why did the murderer choose him to be locked up? No good reason any way. this movie drives many unsuccessful plot twists.<br/><br/>Also... Adam's diologue was so contrived. There was about 5 lines he said were he tried to be funny, but it came off just really stupid. <br/><br/>One part I did like **super spoiler** was the body getting up at the end of the movie and scaring Adam... but then he just leaves him there screaming in the dark... and I thought, well that was cool, but wtf? now what?<br/><br/>Here's the other parts I did like. In an attempt to remake Seven, (ha, an f grade on that one) they had a bunch of crazy death scenes. The reverse beartrap was a cool scene, despite us already knowing she would make it. The other death scenes were neat too... Unfortunately there was nothing to back up the blood lust. And the death scenario behind Dr. and Adam was pretty weak, mostly because they didn't pull it off at all.

","To anyone who watched Russel Crowe stick two swords into the chest of an opponent and then remove the two blades only to use them as scissors to ""remove"" the head of said opponent in ""Gladiator"" and thought that was bad-- don't see ""Saw.""<br/><br/>As any good twenty-year old in the 21st century will tell you, movie violence is often times fake looking and our desensitized out-look on movie gore and things of that nature often makes us sneer when a movie attempts to scare us with gore and suspense. ""Saw"" will make you rethink how desensitized you truly are... but in a good way.<br/><br/>A film that was shot in 18 days and cost just a million dollars would probably sound like some crappy student garbage or a low-end indie flick- but ""Saw"" was a better film than a lot of its competition, and even some films in other genres, in 2004. It may have even been one of the best 5 films of 2004... but lets not jump ahead of ourselves.<br/><br/>""Saw"" starts off with Elwes and Whannel waking up in a industrial-like bathroom chained to the pipes with seemingly no way to get out- at first. The film then follows a similar formula to most horror movies with one exception. The ending to ""Saw"" is absolutely brilliant and I was honestly not expecting it at all. Alone, the ending is worth watching the entire movie for. And not many movies are like that, if not the exact opposite.<br/><br/>While I've never seen ""Seven,"" I've often heard ""Saw"" compared to it and even heard it billed as a ""cheap knockoff."" Saw is a film that may not be phenomenally different (yet, still one of the best of '04), but it does just enough different to keep you hooked and maybe more. It is a film that makes you seek out the others like it within its genre, because it was that good and you just need more. While I'm not sure that ""Saw 2"" is a great idea, the original ""Saw"" is probably already a cult classic, and for good reason. The story is engaging and it has an excellent ending- one that will leave you breathless."
"tombstone81","9","0","1","15 February 2005"," Best thriller I've seen in a long time!
","In an era when the classic horror movie seems to have gone the way of the dodo bird...along comes ""Saw"". It's tough to extol the virtues of this film without giving away any elaborate plot details...but suffice to say it's so nice to see an intelligent thriller for a change, one that chills us through its diabolical nature and psychological discomforts as opposed to gratuitous gore and ""jump"" action sequences.<br/><br/>Despite it being ripped by some reviewers for a number of reasons, I didn't think it was that poorly written, casted or acted. The story draws you in to the point where the actors and their lines become secondary anyway.<br/><br/>I've long since stopped being scared by monsters, demonic possession, serial killers that border on the ridiculous (i.e. Freddy or Jason)... but I'm still frightened of sociopaths with intelligence and access to the right tools. The main bad guy in this movie, Jigsaw, could easily be walking amongst us in our neighborhoods. Now THAT's scary.<br/><br/>Great flick and highly recommended for horror fans. 9/10."

","This film is by far one of the greatest horror films of all time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed and fell in love with everything about the movie. The cinematography, with its crisp, sharp dark feel, is a great element of this film. The story, with its originality, made this film attractable. The acting, with the memorable performances and deliveries, showed greatness.<br/><br/>The direction of this film is an excellent element to the film. A tone of darkness and mystery displayed itself throughout every moment of this great film. The angles, as well as the lighting, were executed to perfection, and nothing is wasted. The dark atmosphere grabbed hold.<br/><br/>Two men wake up chained to an old, dirty bathroom. The greatness of the story develops throughout the course of the story. Clues are given, clues which show who is holding them there, and what must be done of them.<br/><br/>Now, many horror villains have shined on screen. Michael Myers, Pazuzu's possession of Regan McNeil, and Freddy Krueger just to name a few. The villain in Saw is no different, and paralleled. ""The Jigsaw Killer"", a psychopath that finds ways for his victims to end their own lives, is presented here. His look, atmosphere, methods, and traps are what make him unique, and the twist ending enhances it.<br/><br/>At the end of this great film, there exists a very delightful treat to top things off. It tops everything that has been presented already, in terms of enjoyment. Unlike many recent films that have used the twist ending, and failed in executing it correctly, Saw contains a twist ending that can not be summed up in any word other than ""awesome"". It makes you end the film with a giant smile on your face. A devilish smile of confidence: Confidence that this horror film is a work of absolute genius.<br/><br/>Extremely recommended."

Surely you know that the only bullet there was, was the one Gordon had shot Adam with.

"sxyby47","2","0","2","9 February 2005"," No redeeming quality about this movie.
","I'm sorry, but this movie was a mix of Seven and Phone Booth. The man who is about to die hates that people go through life and don't appreciate every day. That was the concept, somewhat, of Phone Booth where the killer tried to make people repent their ways and love everyday after, or they die. In order to do this in Saw, the killer takes a page from John Doe's marble notebook in Seven and tortures them into realizing this, or they die. It was just a rip-off of so many movies, as is the case most of the time in Hollywood nowadays.<br/><br/>The orderly as the killer was too neat to be true, so there has to be some twist at the end, which is another trend going around Hollywood. Everyone knows now that the end of a thriller today is not really the end, there is still another five minutes that will show the real ending, and this one wasn't a good one. This movie was built up as the most horrifying and disturbing picture since 8mm, and it did NOT live up to the hype. It was not disturbing in any way and I don't think I jumped once watching it. Seeing what the killer did to his victims was not scary or horrifying in any way, and just about any rated R movie that comes out now is as, if not more, bloody and gruesome than Saw is.<br/><br/>The plot is old, the concept is old, and Hollywood needs to find some new material. 8mm was much more disturbing and horrifying than this movie, as was Seven, and Seven was a hundred times better in every single way. <br/><br/>A dying man's wish to make everyone see life the way he is seeing it: can't the killer just be a psycho who was loved as a child by his parents and just turned out wrong instead of there always having to be some reason why he or she is torturing and killing random people?"

","Saw grabs hold of you from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the end credits. This movie caught my attention from the trailer but it was way better than I ever expected. Leigh Whannell did a good job as the character Adam, providing SLIGHT but effective comic relief at the right moments. The rest of the actors did a good job as well. I'm a fan for all types of movies but I've always been a sucker for a good horror/thriller with a good ending which most of them have been lacking in recent years. The way the victims are killed will send chills through your spine. It's very original and shocking. It's more of a thriller than horror but I thought it was cleverly written. Kudos to the writers and director. Job well done. This movie was supposed to be released straight to video but due to the overwhelming response at early screenings, it was decided it would premier in theatres. Good move! <br/><br/>To all fans of a good thriller...watch Saw and be prepared to be totally shocked by the surprise ending. ""Wow!!"" will be your only response."

","I wanted to see this film from word-of-mouth alone, or rather the buzz I had seen about it on the internet. Glad to say I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>A clever thriller/horror film that very much keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat with feelings of suspense, anxiety and fear. A stylish film, but as somebody else commented it does seem a little overdone in some areas. That would be the only flaw I could pick in this flick.<br/><br/>Saw does have moments where you will squirm in your seat but it's because of what is being suggested on-screen more than anything else. I think that's the true mark of a good, effective horror film. There is a dose of blood 'n guts but not to the point of being gratuitous (unlike a recent remake in Texas).<br/><br/>The story is disturbing, engrossing, entertaining, it has an original streak - pretty refreshing with all of the other crap masquerading as horror movies at the cinemas right now. I loved the twist at the end and it's wide open for a sequel (which according to IMDb.com is on the agenda). The acting was decent enough and definitely carries the film well. Elwes seemed a bit forced sometimes and newcomer Whannell had a bit of uneasiness about him, but all in all they and the supporting cast did a great job.<br/><br/>A very solid effort and for casual and hardcore fans alike, you can't miss it."

"SteveLKay","2","0","3","27 January 2005"," Weak plot, yet another horror strip
","I saw the film in a sneak preview (without knowing the title), and I'm not the kind who's especially interested in horror films. This film is yet another which uses (wo)man's lowest instincts to generate attention and attraction, here the instinct of survival. This film, like the others of its genre, hasn't got another message than to scare you. I haven't taken anything to reflect on out of it. When I left the theater, the film was gone in a few minutes. Maybe that's because from the first pictures on I'm inevitably forced to deny my feelings for the main characters, since the scenes would be more or less unbearable if I really felt for them. It draws me into a voyeuristic position (""I don't care what happens to them, they're not me""). What if all people would develop that tendency in their daily lives? Our world would be a doomed, cold place. Some people might say this is the case already. I don't really blame horror films for this, but maybe they are a symptom or (more maybe) even a catalyst for this. <br/><br/>Sorry for the moralizing undertone, it's just my personal opinion. I've left it in here since it makes my judgment about the film more understandable. If you deny the horror like I do, the plot of the film is very, very patchy. The motivation of the killer is completely unclear and remains unexplained to the end. There are twists in the plot that try to be unexpected at the expense of the consistency and credibility of the characters. Even if I try to, I'm unable to relate to any of the characters in the film. The measure of clarity regarding plot and characters is exchanged for pictures of blood, desperation and death. The film intermittently tries to scare the audience by more or lees clumsy, predictable non-visual effects. <br/><br/>In short, what is this piece all about? I don't know. I feel sorry for the money."

The film had those but they were used very well. The direction and acting were all up to par. <br/><br/>The film starts off with two guys in a barren wash room, decay is present everywhere. The two fellows have no idea why they're chained to some corroded pipes. During this time, a crazed killer is on the loose preying upon a select group of individuals. Their tormentor communicates to the two through a hidden speaker and telephone. What unspeakable horror awaits them?<br/><br/>I don't want to tell you any more. The best thing about this film is the surprises that awaits the viewers. To give it would ruin this movie. All I can say is that I highly recommend this film.

There is not one believable thing he says in the entire movie. Instead of focusing on one characters fight, the movie takes the audience into flashback after flashback that simply bore us. Worst of all, the unrealistic lines and actions result in laughs from the audience when it was clearly not the intention in the scene. Hellen Keller could have played a more believable cop than Danny Glover in this movie. It is a horror movie not a comedy. I think horror movies have really become out of touch with people latley"

There always has to be a peaceful message at the end, a moral to the story, or a happy ending. Not in ""Saw"". I was amazed with everything in this movie. It was deeply disturbing, with horrifying imagery. They really don't make movies like this anymore. It was comparable to older horror gems like Night of the Living Dead and Carnival of Souls and Dementia 13. It had a frightening, sad ending that left me and the people I saw it with having an uneasy, creepy feeling, a feeling I haven't felt since I saw the original 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The plot was amazing, so creepy, about a maniacal lunatic that tortures people in sadistically morbid ways. The acting was so-so, and it had its share of minor plot holes, but this is all stuff I thought of later. The duration of this film, I was in heaven. I forgot all my problems in life, and I was just sitting there rooting for these people to survive, and cringing at the horrors that lay before me. I was legitimately angry when it was over, because I was enjoying it so much. There was no moral to the story, no happy ending, just horror. Horror at its gory, disturbing, macabre best.

","How long have you complained about your life, taking it, and everything, or everyone you've ever loved for granted? Or better yet, what exactly would you do to protect these things? How far would you go just to stay alive? Would you kill another person; possibly ripping apart their innards in order to find the key to your survival? Would you crawl through a room full of barbed wire, cutting yourself so deep that your stomach acid may pour out? Or, would you just die a terrible death? Well, to keep things short, James Wan's SAW raises, and vaguely answers all of these questions in a very grungy, cloying, and macabre kind of way.<br/><br/>SAW opens as two men, Dr. Laurence Gordon (Cary Elwes), and Adam (Leigh Whannell) awaken, chained to the walls of a pitch black, rundown bathroom with a bloody corpse lying, mutilated, at its center. After they each find small tapes in their back pockets, the only information they, and thus the audience is left with is the simple notation that if Dr. Gordon doesn't kill Adam within several hours, his wife and daughter will be murdered.<br/><br/>At the same time, a parallel story proceeds between the characters of Detective Tapps (Danny Glover), and his young partner Steven Sing (Ken Leung), as they investigate a recent onslaught of gruesome murders; all apparently at the hands of a ""serial killer"" known only as Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The catch, however, is that Jigsaw isn't actually a killer. He only places his victims in certain horribly sickening situations, where they must either fight for their lives, or end up unwillingly killing themselves.<br/><br/>A perfect example of this would be one popular scene in which a young woman, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), wakes up in the middle of an abandoned building with a rusted bear trap locked into her badly bleeding jaws. As she cries out in pain, a conveniently placed television set turns on, and a sadistic looking on-screen puppet informs her that if she doesn't get the bear trap off of her face within the next sixty seconds, it will forcibly open, ripping off her entire lower jaw. The catch is that the key to the contraption is lying in her drugged up cell-mate's stomach; so she must choose between dying, or killing the man, and ripping apart his insides with a switchblade.<br/><br/>However, even with its many scares, and gross out moments, SAW is far from perfect.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting, mainly between the two main leads, is absolutely terrible. Cary Elwes, and Leigh Whannel overact so much, that by the movie's second act it'll seem like you're watching two William Shatner clones interact, using trademark ""overdone"" facial expressions, and incontrollable volume. Because of this, many scenes, which should've been completely terrifying, ended up making the entire audience break out in laughter.<br/><br/>Second of all, SAW's screenplay is very slowly paced, and badly put together. Nothing, except maybe the film's expected twist ending, will surprise you, and because of the story's slow nature, many people will lose interest in the plot within the first half hour of the film.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that James Wan, as a first time director, did an exemplary job directing the film, using amazing lighting techniques, atmospheres, and colors to benefit the entire movie. If only he could write as well as he could direct, the film would've been a lot better.<br/><br/>All in all, SAW is a mediocre thriller plagued with bad acting, slow pacing, and too many funny moments that should've been horrific. Because of this, what could've been a wonderful, scary movie suffers in the long run, and becomes less than your average Halloween chiller. See this movie, but wait for the DVD to come out in all of its uncut glory first. The theatrical version just isn't worth the nine bucks.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5/5"

I'll admit, there were parts of this film that were very creepy (ie: the razor wire and the sped up filming used there). But some parts that were intended to be creepy were way off the mark. For example, the bathroom scene to me was lacking greatly in acting and the timing was off the mark. I found myself laughing at the doctor when he was trying to talk to his wife on the phone. Also, the doll to me was the funniest thing i had seen in a long time. Mr. Glover's character has to be the most stupid person in a movie i had ever seen. Not even a good kind of reckless.

Awkward acting, jumpy edits, and a trifle too many open ends in the plot lines leave this mainstream horror film more gross than great.<br/><br/>""Saw"" opens promisingly. A man awakes in a freezing bathtub in a dingy room with two other men. One as we find out is a doctor (Elwes) and the other is a corpse holding a tape recorder containing cryptic messages. To the men's terror, they are captives of a known serial killer who prefers to let his victims kill themselves (in horrific ways) than do the honors himself. What emerges is an orchestrated game of survival in which the pawns must perform acts of violence to save themselves and those whom they hold dear.<br/><br/>What begins as a game of Clue come to life disintegrates into a mishmash of forced flashbacks held together by sub-par acting. Even veterans like Danny Glover seem to be fighting to hold together a script which is big on technical quirks, but low on dialogue. The interactions between Whannell and Elwes (which make up the majority of the movie) are almost silly at times and ham-fisted at best. The movie is downright boring for stretches and significant discoveries made in the prison room often fail to elicit the correct response. The pounding climax and ending is a mixed bag of visceral cool and baffling open-endedness.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the dark atmosphere of ""Saw"" lends enough creepiness to make it a worthwhile movie experience. The murderer makes brief appearances in grotesque masks and dots the landscape with his sadistic devices. The modes of self-mutilation and murder he subjects his victims to are sadly more inventive than the film as a whole. Danger lurks around every steel curved corner and booby-trapped door as heavy breathing and heartbeats dot the score.<br/><br/>On a whole, the film's greatest weakness is its failure to connect with the viewer. ""Seven"" featured not only a complex villain, but characters whom you could empathize with and track their moves with tension. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" offered two stellar actors lending a complexity and chemistry which had been rare in a dark thriller of its kind. The characters of ""Saw"" are too conventional, weak, or vague to truly elicit a response. Even the killer's grand purpose is obscured by a tendency to see past the viability of characters involved, unlike the twisted truth which could be seen in John Doe's work in ""Seven.""<br/><br/>Perhaps it was not meant to be placed on the level of those films in the pantheon of the dark thriller. Yet the grandness of its vision and poor execution leaves ""Saw"" a lightly entertaining movie that never really was."

","Saw starts off with two strangers waking up in a bathroom chained to pipes, one man on one side of the bathroom the other man on the other side, a dead person with a gun thats far enough for them not to reach which is when they find two hack saws. Soon enough they realise whats going on, that their in some sort of sick game and they must listen to their captive known as jigsaw in order to get out of this game alive or dead which will apply to one or both men. Both men have their own secrets which is where the magnificent script writing comes in. Although there may be a some plot holes, the movie plays along beautifully, there is no way of guessing what will happen next. This is one of the few movies(because i cant remember any others)that keep you in suspense right to the end of the film, not one moment of this movie is dull or boring.<br/><br/>Now many people say this is a scary movie and will give you night mares for weeks, for me it wasn't that scary but it is a very good movie so don't go into the movie thinking its a movie full of gore and scares, it only scares you to think that this could actually happen to you.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the top movies of the year because it is so smart(although i cant say the same for the cops).

"Sweet_Ophelia","10","0","1","22 December 2004"," Chillingly excellent. An absolute must-see!
","I must admit, I went and watched 'Saw' because there was little else on offer at the cinemas; apart from the typical mind-numbing Christmas movies which I try and avoid at all costs until they come out to hire on DVD. But I was most pleasantly surprised with this thriller, written by Australian's James Wan (who also directed) and Leigh Whannell (who also stars).<br/><br/>The film opens with a man in a bath-tub. He climbs out and finds himself in a large, dirty bathroom, chained to a pipe along with two other captives; one alive, and one with his brains blown out. And so the film begins... the audience is completely in the dark as to how the two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr.Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, from 'the princess bride') came to be imprisoned. Small clues have been left by their tormentor, to help the men slowly piece together their predicament. As they follow the prompts, Dr Lawrence notices a chilling connection between their situation and that of several other victims before them. The Dr, it seems, had recently been suspect in several killings where people found themselves in a 'do or die' situation; A woman woke to find herself with a bear trap locked to her head, and was told via video from the mad-man that she had only a few minutes to cut the key for the trap's lock out of a dead man in the cell with her, or else a timer would be set off and the head gear explode. Another man woke to find himself in a barbed wire maze, a timer was set to go off in three hours, after which the only door to the cellar he was in would be securely locked and he would rot. All of these sick tasks, the mad-man tells his victims, is designed so that, IF they survive, they appreciate their lives more.<br/><br/>Now Adam and Dr. Lawrence have till six o-clock; or else meet a fate similar to that of the victims before them. Its a race against the clock, and many twists along the way ensure this film is a thrilling watch, if not a haunting one...<br/><br/>This movie is so well written, and will keep you guessing the entire way through... not a moment goes by when you are not entertained or scared senseless! And no amount of guessing will prepare you for the HUGE twist at the end, just to entice. All round, this is a great film. The flash-back scenes of the crimes are well done; with speed up's and close up's, making everything that little bit more intense.<br/><br/>My one complaint is perhaps the casting of Cary Elwes; sometimes his cardboard performance makes you chuckle during even the most intense and terrifying scenes. It just seemed to me that this role didn't suit him at all; or he just didn't have the chops to pull it off. But I was pleasantly surprised by Leigh Whannell; delivering a very natural and gripping performance with a role that could have become very mundane and miniature if not for the right casting.<br/><br/>Look out for this Aussie duo; James Wan & Leigh Whannell. This is a fantastic debut film and I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood came knocking again to see if they could come up with another horror as gritty and intense as ""Saw""."

","No spoilers.<br/><br/>I watched this movie two times, the first time was with my father who came in to my room for a sec and saw me watching this movie. He found it exciting and stayed. I believe we both enjoyed it the first time, it's the regular Fincher style movie with fast cuts and sophisticated sets and cold-blooded killers. What resembles from Finchers Se7en is the philosophical approach the killer makes. For example his argument goes: ""I'm tired of people who don't accept their blessings"". I can't exactly recall what Spaceys character makes in Se7en but it's just about the same thinking. We are not supposed to really understand what the killer wants. His motives are complicated and all but rational. <br/><br/>So, what's up with this new low budget picture ""Saw""? Well, it's nothing that is going to academy awards and will probably not be remembered as a profound and well directed masterpiece either. It's the average entertainment where you jump and get scared and feel confused. You are not supposed to know anything, you're just supposed to tag along and enjoy the ride. The second time I watched it I made some more notifications of course, that's always what happens when you see a movie for the second time and I must say I felt less amused this time. My biggest disappointment is Danny Glover who gives a sad performance and you really get the feeling that he's done as an actor in Hollywood. Other than that it's Cary Elwes who brings the acting to some remembrance. Because he did well, and according to me he was the only one who should receive some credit for his acting performance.<br/><br/>The second time I saw it was with two friends who both enjoyed it a lot more than I did. Not that I was surprised but their thinking is far way more different than mine and I'm certain that's the way with most people who watched this movie. If we all think about it, very few scary pictures that come out are actually any good. Most of these horror/thriller pictures are blunt crap and I rarely see a picture in this genre that I enjoy. So I urge you to read other peoples review of this picture, it wasn't something phenomenal but it might be the average entertainment you are looking for. Me for one can be pretty boring when it comes to this.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Fantastically intriguing, Saw is an incredible thriller of epic proportions. Whilst it won't suit everyone it will thrill most. Possibly the strongest point of the film is the fact that it's rather unique. From the stylized plot to the camera work, Saw keeps you guessing, and whilst some elements may be predictable, the majority of the film is packed with enough surprises to keep in the dark until the very end. It may appear that the film is a little weird at times (although not as weird as ""The Cell"") ""Saw"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film features a fantastic ending which I will NOT reveal here, and overall ""Saw"" is a definite, must see."

","Like other low-budget shockers, I'm almost positive that 'Saw' will travel by word-of-mouth  it has already gained a slow but steady audience in the United Kingdom and its intake will surely increase in the States. It premiered at Sundance and garnered some great reviews and critical accolade -- inevitably the resulting hype is a bit strong for such a modest movie (every commercial ad features at least one reference to 'Se7en') but I purposely avoided reading anything about the movie, and now  in retrospect  I'm very glad I did. If my assumptions are correct 'Saw' will become another cult classic thriller and its popularity will gradually increase."

","This movie could have easily been a great film. the plot is unique, creative, very sadistic, and in some parts, shocking. But let me tell you right now that this movie was not worth the $7.50 admission I had to pay. The movie starts off very well, but ends as being one of the stupidest movies I have seen. The plot of the movie in my opinion, is actually one of the most original and sadistic stories that i have seen in a movie. So for that, I give the movie a 5. But the cool plot is easily ruined by some of the most terrible acting I have ever seen. Danny Glover makes an exception, because he's great in everything he does. The plot is ruined at about the last 45 minutes of the movie. All of a sudden this movie turns into a completely different story than what you paid to go see.

The co-writer who played Adam was an awful actor and, when teamed with the director, a pretty shitty writer too. This movie had the year's worth of cliché lines in a single minute of footage as Danny Glover ""the obsessed cop"" stumbles around trying to find this deranged serial killer isn't really developed at all. In fact none of these characters were developed and their acting was terrible. Not a single thing about their lines made any sense (example: Elwes' wife begins a scene by asking him how he can ""just walk through life without being happy"" and she does so for no real reason except to be confrontational and dramatic.)

","This film was basically an expression of a writer's ability to come up with really twisted ways to kill people. There was little in the way of back plot, motive, or anything really substantial. It started to get deeper in the sense of character development but never really took that road anywhere.<br/><br/>Overall Saw is just a poor imitation of Sev7n without much of the redeeming qualities. 'Saw' did have an interesting surprise twist at the end, however the more I thought about it, the more flaws and plot holes I found with it. Overall this film wasn't all that entertaining. While the suspense kept it going, its dependence on shock value as opposed to good writing and film making (some of the camera shots were ridiculous, e.g. a particular car chase) hurt it more than its twists helped. <br/><br/>As a horror film I'd give this a 7/10.

"tastyworm","7","0","1","2 December 2004"," A brilliant debut
","'So many people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you - not anymore.'<br/><br/>'Saw' is the project of James Wan and Leigh Whannell; two Melbourne boys who between the two of them wrote, directed and starred in a psychological thriller that has made the big-time in Hollywood. Shot on a budget of a little over one million US dollars and shot in only eighteen days, this dark, grungy and bloody film is a true testament that the Hollywood dream of nobodies turning into somebodies overnight can come true  with the film currently grossing over US$53,000,000 and being screened world-wide.<br/><br/>The film opens with Adam (Whannell) and Lawrence (Elwes) waking up in the dark, only to find that they are chained in a filthy bathroom with a dead body between them, a tape recorder, two hacksaws, a gun and one bullet. It is the beginning of a game by a disturbed serial killer who asserts that unless Lawrence kills Adam by six o'clock, his wife (Potter) and daughter will be killed. With that said, we now historically backtrack through the killer's games he has played with other victims, and follow the exploits of Detective Tapp (Glover) as he attempts to apprehend the violent psychopath.<br/><br/>Whannell's performance, with the exception of occasionally slipping back into an Australian accent, was very good  much better, unfortunately than Elwes performance  whom I think was mis-cast. James Wan's feature film directorial debut is excellent - very horror noir-ish  with most of the violence implied rather than shown  although you still feel quite uneasy during many of the flashback scenes despite not actually seeing the gore.<br/><br/>During an interview, Wan mentioned that he was limited due to timing constraints rather than budget constraints, and that the idea for the film was deliberately produced as a low-budget film. He said that what you see in the film is only about thirty percent of the vision he had for the film  having said that, I'm not sure if I could handle his full hundred percent and found the thirty to be plenty for me.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this film and absolutely adored the ending  with the exception of one spoken clichéd line of script at the very end  which, if you go and see this film, will find out what it is. <br/><br/>If you're after a violent storyline, don't get turned off by a bit of blood and loved films like Se7en, then Saw will probably really appeal to you."

"conan4742","Null","0","1","28 November 2004"," Se7en without the depth
","I'll start right out and say that ""Saw"" is a fairly decent movie, depending on how high your toleration of utter brutality and viciousness is. If it's high, then it'll be decent until the end when you're kicked in the face with one hell of a plot twist. <br/><br/>""Saw"" is one hell of an abrasive movie. It seems as though the creators intended to relentlessly torture the audience along with the characters in the movie by way of some of the most cruel inventions a human mind has ever come up with. This, surprisingly, is the heart and soul of the movie. It's a series of plot devices and twists meant to stun and shock the audience, and it will do that quite well. <br/><br/>The problem is that it is ALL this movie does. It's another in the tradition of Se7en, a gruesome movie with the intention to shock and enlighten you. However, Se7en started with its tone and purpose and THEN went to the polt twists, whereas Saw starts with the plot twists, tries to go to the depth, but fails. The characters are unsympathetic and shallow and, even though the film implies this, they lack any real sins that deserve the punishment they receive. The killings are random and pointless. Whereas the killing in Se7en had a twisted depth and meaning to them, the ones in Saw are simply twisted. We wind up with a bad guy we're supposed to respect due to his brilliance, but instead we hate him and spend the entire movie either in agony waiting to know what happens or waiting to see if he gets his comeuppance. His reasoning for what he does winds up being ridiculous and fragmented. It's a shock, but that's all. <br/><br/>This, and the movie is tainted by the goth/metal/S&M underground cult fetish. Every scene is given bleary, dead light and they try to make every other shot trendy by saying, ""Hey, why don't we speed up the film and give it a metal headbanging soundtrack?"" It seriously gets annoying very quickly and makes the rest of the movie seem trivial. <br/><br/>The acting is all right. Nothing special. There are several times when the audience screams out ""Just SHOOT the guy!"" but they never do, of course. The trail of clues Adam and Lawrence go through from their confined positions is interesting but, stretched over time, makes the audience impatient. Also, the difference between the past and the present is not indicated very well. <br/><br/>But if you can sit through all of this, you'll get one of the greatest shocking movie endings of the year."

","You can believe a certain amount of the hype surrounding James Wan's shocker. It's gory, gruesome, garish and does succeed in plummeting the audience into some butt-clenching scenarios. There is also a semi-interesting narrative, as various character arcs dovetail. But Saw doesn't have the courage of its convictions. Finally, it's a damp squib of horror flick with a promising start.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw killer has evidently taken inspiration from Seven's John Doe. He's never directly 'murdered' anyone  depending on how you define murder. Instead, he places people into a revolting situation: if you don't undertake the unthinkable you die. To escape a gory, grotesque fate, you must do something horrible. I could give you a detailed example of Jigsaw's plans, but I'll just throw these words at you: razor wire, slow-acting poisons, important items that have been force-fed and (my personal favourite in the best bit) jaw-breakers<br/><br/>Some may be enticed with the film's ballsy stance. I was, certainly. It's been a long while since cinema, whether it be mainstream or independent, has truly gone for abject horror that is not simply gore, but thematic. I'm talking about something revolting, something prepared to send the audience reeling. Something that rejects taste and intends to appal. I wanted to see a film like that. He he he he he There haven't been many really go-for-the-gut-and take-the-head-for-afters horror flicks since the '70s. Well, that's what I think, and I thought Saw could fill the void. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The first third of Saw is promising, to say the least. Jigsaws actions are introduced in a neat flashback technique, and the opening moments are the equivalent of kick to the head. The film forces you against the wall with a battery of editing, flash images, monstrous carnage and some terrifying moral implications. AND THEN IT BACKS OFF!!!<br/><br/>Saw becomes tiresome. The twists and turns aren't particularly surprising, not do they add to the film's impact, and slowly but surely, Wan trivialises the monstrosity of his set up, resorting to classic race-against-time plotting and an unimaginative ending. The film's cinematography and production design are fine at the start, but they fail to build on the urban Gothic themes, so what you see in the first act is about all the film has to offer stylistically. The characters are your stock types, and all credit to the actors for having real gumption: they look the part and manage to portray unthinkable suffering very well. <br/><br/>But ultimately Saw is not a film that'll haunt you, because it loses sight of its terrifying premise, failing to make it really possible to the audience. You won't come away thinking: 'that could happen to me'.<br/><br/>The films feels sealed inside a bubble, unable to escape into the auditorium, which is what films like The Living Dead Trilogy and Rabid (to name but a few) did. In short: maybe enough for a night out, but nothing to take home."

With characters caught in the middle of scenarios as described, things are naturally more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Much of the narrative is spent in a stanky toilet, and it's disgusting enough to rival the one in Trainspotting. The film ups the gore factor in treating you to other sickly designed ""kill or be killed"" methods.<br/><br/>Saw kept me at the edge of my seat, and never did I see the twist at the end coming, with all the red herrings, some of which are very obvious, thrown in.

But the hilarity of the lack of skill detracts from the creepiness of any situation portrayed in the movie. I was especially enthralled near the end when the characters were reaching the heights of their horror and Cary Elwes must have figured fear is best portrayed by suddenly adopting a Shakespearean English accent. This did especially well when playing off of Leigh Whanell's new Mexican speech. Coming home after seeing the movie, I was anxious and eager to warn any and everyone against it, and was horrified to hear that other people had heard it was a GOOD MOVIE. OK, please, gory scenes, contrived suspense, and story ""twists"" ( the movie never really took the time to identify a PLOT, so a plot twist seems somewhat impossible ) do not a good movie make.

This movie has it all, the gore, suspense, twist and turns, and as far the killer is concerned, that's for you to find out but I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised. The gore went a bit beyond the typical ''R'' rating around today. There's even an unrated version out there. Face it, some movies with today's ''R'' rating could have passed for ''PG-13'' a few years ago. I hear ''Seed of Chucky[Not Rated]'' is going in the same direction which I also look forward to seeing. If everything goes to plan with this and that I got to say this will be a very pleasant start to my holiday season. As for the suspense, there's a lot especially at the end which I was pleased that it did not use that to take the easy way out like some other thrillers. It was perfectly relevant through out the whole movie. The twist and turns filled up the whole movie especially when it came to figuring the deal with the killer[I'll stop right there]. Some people may have some complaints about Danny Glover's lack of screening time, but with the script nearing to perfection it was actually enough. His performance was also a real delight after not seeing him in the movies for awhile. Another plus was to have a Japanese director James Wann at the helm and judging from movies like ''Ringu**1/2[2 1/2 Stars]'' and ''The Grudge***[3 Stars]'' these Japanese directors know their sh*t when it comes to horror thrillers. Wink wink, there's word he is also planning on doing a sequel."

This was especially disappointing since it was from the climax of the movie onward, which causes the movie to go out with a whimper rather than a bang. Granted, the acting was not spectacular in general, but it was at least ignorable for most of the movie. Such a shame to see bad acting detract from what was otherwise a very respectable film. Overall, it's still a must see for suspense/horror movie buffs."

","****MAJOR SPOILERS WARNING****<br/><br/>A young man named Adam wakes to find himself chained to a rusty pipe inside a decrepit subterranean chamber. Chained to the opposite side of the room is another bewildered captive, Dr. Lawrence Gordon Between them is a dead man lying in a pool of blood, holding a .38 in his hand. Neither man knows why he has been abducted; but instructions left on a micro cassette order Dr. Gordon to kill Adam within eight hours. If he fails to do so, then both men will die, and Dr. Gordon's wife, Alison, and his daughter will be killed.<br/><br/>Recalling a recent murder investigation by a police detective named Tapp, Dr. Gordon realizes he and Adam are the next victims of a psychopathic genius known only as ""Jigsaw."" With only a few hours left to spare, they must unravel the elaborate puzzle of their fate in the midst of mounting terror. The killer has provided them with only a few clues and two handsaws - too weak to break their steel shackles, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone. <br/><br/>Lawrence realizes that the person responsible for putting himself and Adam in this room is an all too familiar person. He was a suspect in a series of murders that were committed by a killer known only as, the jigsaw killer. A police detective named Detective David Tapp and his partner Detective Steven Sing are committed to bring Lawrence Gordon, whom they believe to be the killer. Now Lawrence is a victim in a crime that he himself was accused of. He was not found guilty, that's not to say he is innocent.<br/><br/>The two police detectives peruse the killer to where they believe to be his place of business. They find one of his victims who are tied to a chair with a drill bit on both sides of his head slowly moving towards his head. The victim's name is Jeff. Soon, he will be dead if the two detectives do not act soon enough. Sing shoots off the two drills and the killer arrives, and they think they have him. But the killer brings out a knife and slashes Tapp's throat and Sing chases the killer.<br/><br/>Sing corners the killer and fires at him. He thinks the killer is dead. But Sing triggers a trip wire, which is tied to several shotguns, which fire at Sing killing him. Tapp is not dead, and finds Sing dead, and the killer is nowhere to be found. Tapp survives the attack only to be fired from the police force, becomes insane on his quest to bring the man responsible for his partner's death. His aim towards the killer has become much more personal.<br/><br/>The killer makes his way into Lawrence's house and keeps his family hostage. The supposed ""killer"" is one of Lawrence co worker's named Zep Hindle. Hindle threatens to kill his family. Lawrence knows who he is because of a photograph taken from a window onto his apartment. Here is where the film really takes off. Lawrence gives Adam his wallet to look at a picture of his family. Adam see's a picture of Lawrence's daughter. ""She's beautiful"" he states. Lawrence tells him to look at the picture behind, the one with all of them on it. But there's nothing but a picture with his wife and child tied together gagged.<br/><br/>The film's finally scene begins with Cary Elwes completely losing it. After a while Adam finally shows Lawrence he picture of his family tied to a bed. Thinking his family is in danger, then he takes one of the saws that were in the package Adam found, and saws his right foot off. This scene is very brutal, graphic and disturbing. He then grabs the gun that the supposed ""dead guy"" has near his hand, and shoots Adam. But only in the shoulder, wounding, but not killing Adam. Lawrence does this because he wants to be sure his family is indeed alive.<br/><br/>Zep Hindle, one of the nurses for Dr. Lawrence Gordon is the supposed ""killer"" and enters the bathroom where Adam and Lawrence are chained and Lawrence demands to see his family because he believes he has completed the killers ""game"". But he is too late, and Zep Hindle raises his gun, as if to kill Lawrence. Adam grabs Zep Hindle from behind and grabs a piece of the toilet seat and bashes Hindle's head in until he is dead. This is also a very brutal scene.<br/><br/>Lawrence than leaves the room to find help for himself and Adam. Adam then searched the body of Hindle to find the keys for his chains. He doesn't find a key, but rather a tap recording similar to that of the one that he found on the dead body in the room to play his and Lawrence's tape. A tape is in the player and Adam listens to it. Adam now learns that Hindle was also a part of the game. He was set up by the real jigsaw killer to convince Lawrence to kill Adam, saw his foot off, (which was the only way they'd leave) and within a certain amount of time. <br/><br/>The challenge to Hindle was that if he does convince Lawrence to kill Adam, he would have to kill Lawrence's wife and child to keep his own life. He must kill two people to keep his own life. Or he would die himself. Another possible challenge is that if Hindle did not convince Lawrence to kill Adam, he would die. All of the killer's victim's either don't value their life, or have committed a crime, or have cause anger, or just are not a good person. He challenges them to game. He wants to know how much do they value their life. Enough to kill another?<br/><br/>But anyways, after listening to tape, Adam is in shock. Now comes the REAL shocker of the flick, and the single greatest movie ending, or twist rather, ever. The dead body in the middle of the room rises and removes a semi-mask, the gunshot wound. The dead body has been the killer all along. He tells Adam that the key to unlock his chains is in the bathtub. Adam remembers waking up, and something falling in the drain of the bathtub. It was the key. The killer leaves the room, and leaves Adam to die in the room alone. And that is where the greatest movie of all time, SAW, ends.<br/><br/>Prepare yourself for a gut-wrenching trip into the heart of terror with SAW. Gritty, terrifying and gruesome, SAW is a taut, squirm-inducing film packed with moments of indelible horror. Director James Wan expertly spins this intricate tale, creating a chilling landscape of dread where nothing is quite as it seems. An edge-of-your-seat ride bristling with emotional intensity, SAW will keep you guessing until the very end. Keep the lights on, you won't sleep easily tonight.<br/><br/>I'm not going to beat around the bush. Saw is the single greatest thriller I have ever seen. Saw is simply everything a thriller should be. The thrills are not based on relentless blood spurts; these are wink-at-the-audience scares of modern day horror. There's no villain spouting cheesy catch phrases. These are legitimate scares brought on by a story, which cleverly draws you into the twisted world of Jigsaw. <br/><br/>The situations he puts his victims in are scary in themselves with some of the most disturbing scenes in cinema history. Saw throws many many many thrills at you for good measure. As soon as you think you have the figured out, it throws another twist and thrill at you that WILL keep you guessing until the very end, with it's shocking and utterly brilliant conclusion.<br/><br/>Take whatever expectations you had of this film, and throw them out the window. Weather they were good or bad, this film will shock and amaze you. It is not what you will expect. Even if it's good, or if it's bad, you'll be surprised. There is not one single moment in this movie where you will not be saying to your self, ""What the hell is going now"", ""Did that just happen?' ""Whoa!"". You will loose yourself in the insane amount of twist and scares in this movie. <br/><br/>You just can't help but wonder, who could think of something like this? Saw is best viewed when you know little or nothing about it going into the theater. The less you know, the more shocked you'll be. That's not to say that knowing anything about it will ruin it. Far from it. The film is extremely original and a taut and sense movie. The acting from the three main leads is excellent. Why is it independent low budget films seem to almost always be better than Hollywood pictures?<br/><br/>Saw accomplishes the kind of gritty, edge of the seat thriller that the studios rarely accomplish with budgets 20 times larger and months of shooting. It gives so called ""scary"" Hollywood horror flicks like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" a total run for their money. It shows you how to make a horror flick. Saw is more than just an impressive accomplishment for two young filmmakers, it's one of 2004's standout films and the scariest film in years.<br/><br/>*****/****"
"time_waster","Null","0","1","14 November 2004"," Started out great, plunged at the end (WARNING: Spoilers)
","Two men, Lawrence and Adam, a physician and a photographer respectively, awake to find themselves chained to the opposite ends of an abandoned restroom. Between them, out of reach, is a dead body, and scattered about the room are clues as to their abductor's identity; the doctor (played by Cary Elwes) figures out that it must be the ""Jigsaw Killer"", who places his victims in traps where they must kill or risk death in order to escape. The woman from the movie's publicity posters is the best example of this: her head has been placed in a ""reverse bear trap"" that will crash through her skull unless she can cut the key out from another victim's stomach in time.<br/><br/>I got the same feeling watching Saw as I did watching Jeepers Creepers. Started out great, and fifteen minutes into it, I thought I was watching the Next Great Horror Movie. Then the whole thing plummeted rapidly and never got turned around again. Admittedly, Saw started its decline later than Jeepers Creepers did. For most of the movie I felt the rising tension that a horror movie is supposed to evoke. But when the story neared its conclusion and we see how it all got started, I couldn't see how this movie got off the ground without a major re-write. The following is a list of spoilers, so if you still want to see it, read no further. But in order to explain why the movie was such a disappointment, spoilers are necessary.<br/><br/>SPOILER 1: The villain ""Jigsaw"" is really a cancer patient--yes, a CANCER PATIENT--who looks like he's been on chemo for about six months. And he's supposed to be able to overpower everyone in the movie, including a much younger and fitter Adam (Leigh Wannell). Huh? If someone looked as bad as he did in his early hospital bed scene, I can't imagine him getting up and walking without assistance, but here he is enacting his evil schemes on people who should be able to beat him up with one arm tied behind their backs.<br/><br/>SPOILER 2: ""Jigsaw"" is also the 'corpse' in the middle of the room, lying between the two men. He plays dead. For seven hours. Next to a medical doctor who has examined him before, for heaven's sake. It strains credulity that the ruse could go on for that long, no matter how panicked Elwes is supposed to be. In seven hours he never notices the man breathing or moving, even when Jigsaw responds to his actions. (At one point, Adam gets electroshocked to see if he is faking his own death.) And Adam at first doesn't seem to recognize the doctor, even though we later find out he has been tailing him and photographing him for some time. If they were blindfolded, it would make sense. They aren't, and it doesn't.<br/><br/>SPOILER 3: The plot hinges on too many people doing too many stupid things. Wannell's character thinks there's someone in his apartment; he doesn't get out and call the police or anything, but tries some ripped-off-from-Rear-Window trick with his photo flash. Well, in Rear Window, Jimmy Stewart only tried that trick because he was a paraplegic and had no other options; in this movie it's just plain dumb. And the cops don't act like cops, they act like Nancy Drew and let the villain get away, getting one of themselves killed in the process and the other (played by Danny Glover, who must have some blackmail photos hanging over him to be in this movie) seriously injured.<br/><br/>All in all a great, horrific premise that got mangled because Wan and Wannell (who wrote and co-starred) wanted a 'dark' and surprising ending, but couldn't or wouldn't think up an ending that lived up to the initial premise."

","There are some movies that are just better when you unexpectedly find them on the television on one of those late late Friday or Saturday nights when you can't sleep. Generally, these are movies that have a few scares and thrills and probably due to the fact that you are just happy you found something other than an infomercial, you are prone to giving it a higher recommendation than had you spent a few bucks at the theatre. <br/><br/>Movies such as From Dusk 'Till Dawn, Evil Dead II, Jacob's Ladder and Angel Heart are good examples of movies that might have been hard pressed to garnish more than a 2 ½ star rating had you not seen it with a tub of Hagan Das Ice Cream in your lap at an hour reserved for REM's. <br/><br/>Add to the fact that movies after a certain hour also tend to scare us more than daytime horrors. My niece recently viewed The Exorcist for the first time and I surprised afterwards that the 14-year old said she had laughed her way through the experience. I later found that she watched the film with a bunch of friends in the middle of the day. Not exactly setting the mood for this type of fare to be sure.<br/><br/>All of this came back to memory after my viewing of the new thriller Saw, out in theaters now. The movie starts with two men who wake up in an abandoned washroom with heavy chains around their ankles. In the middle of the room lies a body soaked in blood with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in another. The two men - Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) - have been drugged and take some time to realize the severity of their situation. As they begin to shake out the cobwebs, their recollection of how they may have been abducted and who may be responsible lead to a grizzly conclusion. <br/><br/>Dr. Gordon is able to shed the most light on their circumstance. When a tape is found in each of their pockets and played on the recorder left in the dead man's hand, it is revealed that the psycho that has entrapped them wants Dr. Gordon to kill Adam with the one bullet he has left with the gun. If Dr. Gordon does not kill Adam before 6:00PM, his wife and daughter will be killed. Adam's chance of survival comes from the two hacksaws that have been left in strategically in a toilet tank. It becomes evident that whomever has put them in this situation wants them to consider cutting off their own foot in order to gain a chance at freedom. From here, Leigh Whannell's screenplay throws countless darts at the plot board in an effort to make the story plausible. In fact, for two people secluded in a warehouse washroom, there are plenty of items found that made me think of one of those video games where countless things are hidden in a room, you just have to move you cursor around to find it all. Within the few hours of their incarceration, the two find a picture of the doctor's wife and child, pictures taken by Adam the day of his capture, two cigarettes, a key, two hacksaws, a video cameraetc etc etc. And to think, I can't even find the converter most times if it falls between the sofa cushions. All of this occurs, of course, as the police try and hunt down the psycho behind the master plan. Danny Glover will be the one recognizable face as the officer who goes mad trying to bring the person known as 'Jigsaw' to justice.<br/><br/>I suppose this movie is going to have every reviewer mentioning Se7en among its review. Saw does have many similarities. Most specifically are the lurid ways in which people are killed. Ten years ago, Se7en pushed the envelope and its legacy can be seen in any of the CSI television programs today. Saw tries to match this ingenuity by issuing in a villain that never kills anyone directly. Instead, he carefully orchestrates (to great lengths) scenarios whereas one person must kill another or put themselves at great risk in order to survive. A female has a rusty contraption on her face that will destruct in minutes unless she can get the key out of the stomach of a helpless man lying drugged on the floor; a man must climb through razor barbed wire in order to gain freedom before sealed in an underground tomb. Who thinks up this stuff?<br/><br/>But for all its creativity, Saw still never really quiet clicks. It's as if it was trying too hard to become a trendsetter that it neglected to do anything other than find new and interesting ways of putting people in various stages of jeopardy. Danny Glover is absolutely wasted in a role that could probably have been cut from the film altogether and the conversations between our two men in peril (Elwes and Whannell) is too forced to be believed as banter between two strangers who must rely on each other to find a way out of their predicament. <br/><br/>I am not saying that Saw is a complete waste. Shot in only 18 days, the film does have a real independent feel to it and had the script been given the same 18 days as the shooting schedule, they may have really had something here. Instead they leave us with a movie that audiences will either love, or will trying sawing off their own arms so they can release the popcorn and make a run for it.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

","OK, first off...I thought the movie was pretty good. I'm not looking for a masterpiece every time I watch a movie...I just want it to keep me entertained. And this movie did that. If you didn't like it, great, that's why they have vanilla and chocolate, but I don't need to hear about it in this thread. <br/><br/>The main thing I don't understand is how did Larry get the Dr's pen light? I thought he might have snagged it when the Dr was trying to explain what the patient had to the younger doctors and gets interrupted, but that's when he gets interrogated by the police and they already have the pen light at that point. I guess Larry was the Dr's patient for a while and we should assume he grabbed the pen light at some earlier time right?<br/><br/>Do you think Cary Elwes (Dr) was overacting the entire time to make the audience think he might be the killer or that he might have something to do with it? Or was it just bad acting?<br/><br/>And what did you guys make of the end? There's now way the Dr had enough time to crawl out so do you think Larry go to him and killed him and left Adam to die in the room?"

","I have a problem understanding how Zep fits into all of this. All the other victims were tortured in some way but Zep got to hang out and watch TV all day. How did the killer force Zep to make a choice to kidnap and kill the Dr.'s wife and kid? Zep was never bound or restrained in any way. Did the killer just say, ""Do this or else..."". I understand since Adam only plays a portion of the recorded message intended for Zep we the viewer are supposed to imagine the rest but really, Zep had free will to do as he pleased. Am I missing something?? Where was the game Zep was playing in because his actions were not very torturous? Please some one tell me how all of this came about? Or at least your guess?"
"setanta-","Null","0","1","10 November 2004"," Laughably bad
","This movie seems more like a first year film school project with a big budget, than like a professional film. The acting is corny and false, the edits jump so quickly and contextually that it almost seems like a parody. However, the worst offender is the script. There are moments so preposterous in this film that not only does it break the tension, but it made me laugh out loud. At another point I actually thought, 'I hope this character does die, he deserves to for being so stupid.' Not exactly the right mindset to create in the viewer for a horror film.<br/><br/>The direction and the camera work are all right, and could have made for a better film. But the collapse of everything else doomed the project. Most disappointing was Cary Elwes, his performance was as floundering and weak as he has allowed his physique to become. Where is the actor from 'Kiss the Girls', 'Glory', or even 'The Princess Bride'? Danny Glover was equally bad, but he wasn't the lead so he gets a slight pass. Leigh Whannell's acting was of course the worst of all, but since I had no expectations for him it couldn't be a disappointment.<br/><br/>However, it turns out that Leigh actually wrote the screenplay as well. And since the screenplay is the real problem with the film we'll have to lay the blame at his feet. I liked 'Se7en' too, but perhaps he just should have watched it again and moved onto another idea."
"Bonnie40933","3","0","1","10 November 2004"," Soap Opera/Horror movie
","This film was quite literally a joke. The acting was so terrible that people were literally laughing the whole way through. The plot is certainly original (I give them the credit of adding a wonderful twist to the end--something that even I, Queen of predicitng endings, didn't catch on to), but this makes no difference because the soap opera acting takes you completely out of the film. I found my friend and myself looking at one another the whole way through the movie, Possibly the worst acting from Whannell and Elwes that I have ever seen in my life. I truly cannot say enough about it. Obviously the other movie goers agreed--people were coming out of the movie saying things like ""That was ridiculous"" and ""I want my money back"". My friends, indeed, wanted me to give them their money back, since I was the one who begged them to go--hey, the previews looked good. Worth renting, but definitely not worth the cinema price."
"alexfrank","Null","0","1","8 November 2004"," A celluloid abortion
","James Wan should be permanently barred from directing after forcing upon the world this fetid turd of a film. Leigh Whannell should be forced to watch his girlish performance of his own hole-ridden, moronic script for eternity. And Cary Elwes should retire from acting in repentance for his dreadful job in this embarrassment to the art form of the motion picture. Seriously, I think Elwes' performance is the worst thing ever captured on film. It's hard to imagine watching him audition these corny, moronic lines in his barely veiled English, or whatever, accent with about as much grace as Casper Van Dien in ""Starship Troopers."" <br/><br/>With idiotic, MTV-inspired directing, Wan took a potentially interesting premise and completely botched it. The twists are pointless, the dialogue is beyond hackneyed and everything about this film is completely unnecessary -- except, of course, for the closing credits, which let me know that this exercise in unintelligence was finally over. Aside from a few cheap scares and some admittedly clever murder plots from the film's utterly random villain, ""Saw"" is the film equivalent of wrapping a t-shirt around a hockey stick and hitting yourself in the head for two hours. This crapfest attempts to replicate David Fincher's admirably executed ""Seven,"" but instead comes up at about ""One and a half."" All jokes aside, though, kill yourself before paying to see this abomination."

This insane tension shows the directors skill, and the no name actors' ability. One could have a lower budget movie, without the over rated, and over paid actors in it. Where a 15 millions dollar payday only hurts the film's budget, and the movie over all. The only notable actor is Danny Glover aka Lethal Weapon. The conclusion tells all of motives, reasons, and why the film is called saw. I never saw the ending when it hit me. 10/10"
"trixon51","8","0","2","2 November 2004"," ...one of the only recent horror movies to genuinely scare me
","Well, I have to admit that beforehand, I thought the previews were pretty darn good, but I was prepared to be potentially disappointed because of other scary movies that had MUCH better previews than their movie turned out to be. After seeing Saw, the previews weren't nearly as good as the actual movie. I have to say that it is one of the only recent horror movies to genuinely scare me, mainly because of how UNPREDICTABLE it was from beginning to end. I have to say that the storyline of Saw was written more brilliantly than any horror film in recent memory at the least. Once you think you've figured out what's going on, you will be totally thrown off. EVERY big part of the plot is explained and it makes sense later on if you think of earlier scenes in the movie and why certain things happened or why they didn't happen. It is one of those movies that if you watch it more than once, you will completely understand reasons for things that happened that you may not have before...comparable to Fight Club is how good this movie is. I sincerely hope that this gets some kind of Oscar nomination, because I don't think a better movie will be coming out this year or anytime soon. On one of my extreme rare occasions when rating movies, I am obliged to give this one a 10,or ****, however you rate movies, anything less would be criminal. I strongly suggest seeing this in theaters while you still can, and a bit of advice also would be to not take any bathroom or snack breaks while watching this movie; if you blink or look away once, there's a good chance you will miss something very important to understanding this movie. Anyways, my point is that this movie deserves to be dubbed an instant classic; I know I consider it one, and I can't talk about any parts of the movie because I wouldn't want to be responsible for listing spoilers, so sorry about that. THIS IS A MOVIE-LOVER'S MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!"

","SAW could possibly be the best horror/crime/thriller movie since the magically works of David Fincher when he created Se7en. SAW delivered in every way possible, from the intriguing plot, to the gruesome scenes of torture, to the moderately good acting. Did it live up to the hype? It did more than you ever thought.<br/><br/>Right off the bat we get into the problem where Adam (Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a bathtub in the dark chained up with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained up on the opposite side of the wall already awoken. The room is a rundown, drenched, shabby bathroom with a dead body lying in the middle of the room with a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Both men discover a tape in there pockets, and when they play them, the message says: Play my game, or face a grievous repercussion. Let the games begin!<br/><br/>The plot was something very fresh and unique. We haven't seen this kind plot in a very long time. The man behind all of this, which has been named 'Jigsaw,' is a one of a kind mastermind that puts his victims in a set scenario that makes them give up something for their life. It was highly enjoyable to see how Jigsaw came about with using flashbacks of his previous crimes, all remorseless in there own way.<br/><br/>I don't know if anyone else noticed, but the Muppet did have a symbol behind it, which is like Jigsaw is the Muppet Master and all the victims he picked are his Muppets. So in a way he controls them by giving them a choice to make, which is basically live or die.<br/><br/>What I can say made SAW standout was the setting. Everything was perfectly set so you could feel the dark, gloomy, creepy setting. In that bathroom, you actually felt like you were in another world, in another dimension, if you may. The whole movie felt dark, which created the perfect atmosphere throughout the whole movie, so you never actually felt like smiling during the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was far from perfect. An underused Danny Glover, who played the part of Detective David Tapp, didn't help the acting situation either. However, it was decent enough to get by in the movie, and the rest of the good things in the movie helped out cover the bad performances.<br/><br/>SAW in the end works out to be a very disturbing film that delivers in more ways than imaginable. SAW took us to a place where we haven't been in a long time, and it was refreshing to see a film with the likes of Se7en being made. SAW had one hell of an illogical ending, but I just didn't care, because it all made sense in the end. James Wan gave us one hell of a twisted movie, and after it was all said and done, SAW kills.<br/><br/>Story: A+ Acting: D+ Visuals: A Cinematography: A Overall: A- (Not an average)"

","It takes a lot for me to write a review. I try to write reviews that are positive and critical. But, as you well know by now, I have nothing good to say about SAW. I have to say that this film ranks as one of the worst movies out there. I was paralyzed with fear....knowing someone agreed to finance this monster. This movie was 100% predictable. How can anyone be afraid when you know what's about to happen? Please don't get me started on the camera work. This movie is a sad reminder than many of these new directors spent their youth watching too much Mtv for inspiration rather than investing their time in watching films directed by talented individuals.<br/><br/>I would rather the audience spend their money renting ""The Shining"" or at least donating the eight dollars to a worthy cause. <br/><br/>If you want to be scared by new a recent film, I propose watching ""The Others."" <br/><br/>I am just one of many thousands who writes reviews on this wonderful website, and my opinion has no weight, but please believe me, this film will be a waste of your wonderful time."

","I am a horror/thriller movie connoisseur as is the person I went with and we both absolutely loved Saw. After watching scary movies since a child I became used to seeing people die in all different manners and always look for a new killing style. This movie provides that plus there is tension which is what I like too. So if you like who dunnit thrillers, this is the movie for you. If you want to enjoy the movie more, don't try to guess the killer as you'll be wrong and that's not spoiling it. I thought I figured it out, but was wrong, although the person I saw it with guessed it. Look for weight gain in Cary Elwes (I didn't know anybody else). Those who didn't like this are probably the ones who loved Blair Witch project which was actually the worst movie ever made."
"JWFisch","5","0","1","2 November 2004"," You'll be sorry you ever ""Saw"" this movie. Bad pun, i know...
","This movie just moved way to fast to be taken seriously. A lot of the events were horribly circumstantial, and the movie really dragged on a lot of the way through. The acting was very subpar as well. Elwes was just laughable in his father-daughter scenes, and didn't fair much better in the bathroom scenes either. This movie reminded me a lot of Butterfly-effect. In that it contained a very good overall idea, but lacked a strong story throughout, and had poor execution. <br/><br/>Saw provides further proof, in my mind, that modern film-makers have forgotten how to turn a potentially scary idea into an actually scary film. Overall, I give saw a 5/10."

","I am not a huge fan of the horror/thriller movie genre. I do appreciate smart, thrillers such as se7en, and was pleasantly surprised when it was the same type of movie. EXCEPT that the acting is so incredibly terrible that you will laugh out loud. Carey Elwes what happened?? I was almost embarrassed at times for him, he was so bad. His powdery made up face did not help matters. The other actors in it, were just as awful. PLUS SIDE: I love a good twist and hate when I can guess an ending, although some might find the ending stupid, I honestly did not guess it..which makes it worth a watch for me. So definitely a wannabe- se7en, and not nearly as good, but if you want a good twist and laugh out loud acting then this movie is for you."

","""Saw"" fails to deliver on so many levels, it would be a waste of (more) of my time to go beyond the minimum of 10 lines required by IMDb to review, but i'll try: If you loved ""Se7en"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" - you will NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>It is no where near the caliber and everything about it is completely sophomoric including the acting. There is nothing scary about this movie - not once did I find myself scared, on the edge of my seat or confused about what was to come. ""Saw"" is predictable, full of plot holes, and a huge waste of talent (Danny Glover, looking at you). I would recommend waiting for rental and paying the $9.00 to see 'The Grudge"" instead, which is not much better, but at least, scary."
"webmistress-1","Null","0","1","1 November 2004"," We came, we SAW, we giggled
","Saw offered the ideal blend of gore and silliness to make my Halloween fun. It's an enjoyable low budget B-horror movie with ample plot gimmicks to make up for its apparent lack of production funds.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something like Silence of the Lambs, forget it. Expect ""People Under The Stairs"" and you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>One could point out how Saw borrows from other films like Phonebooth, Cube, Seven, and Panic Room ... but why bother? You can play the same ""connect the dots"" game with any Dario Argento movie. Indeed, Saw owes much to Argento. I wish Argento could have made Saw -- it would be a truly superior film instead of an above-average b-flick.<br/><br/>These days I hear a lot about new horror film directors who want to emulate ""70s styled-horror movies."" The directors of Cabin Fever, House of 1000 Corpses, Resident Evil 1 et al. claim 70s inspiration. Unlike those films, Saw is the real deal in respect to capturing a 70s horror tone.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Lots of gory fun with a sly wink. Granted, Saw is clearly NOT going to have the psychological impact of a film like Seven. Saw is cute and clever, but not terribly moving. With Saw, I found myself giggling as often as I was wincing.<br/><br/>Even when the plot treads too far into preposterous terrain, the actual story remains compelling. Gimmicky, sure, but Saw's twists and turns are nicely assembled.<br/><br/>I also liked the creepy imagery of things like the jester doll/mannequin and the ""bear-trap"" device. The understated gore achieves its goals 100% of the time ... that's noteworthy in and of itself.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The Memento/Reservoir Dogs out-of-sequence plot reveal wears out its welcome too soon. Most of the out-of-sequence scenes would have benefited from another round of editing ... they drag. The abuse of temporary amnesia as a plot device smacks of laziness, too.<br/><br/>THE UGLY: Cary Elwes! I usually LOVE Elwes, but he's just awful in Saw. He's so terrible that he's the main reason I'm writing about Saw! Good LORD what happened? He seems like he's trying to emulate a supporting Dan Aykroyd performance ... with Keanu Reeves' anti-flair for regional accents. Perhaps Elwes was so focused maintaining his bad American accent that he couldn't concentrate on his acting ... or maybe the only American actor he had time to study in advance was Scott Bakula.<br/><br/>Danny Glover isn't much better than Elwes, so perhaps the director or the dialogue coach didn't have a handle on the project. Or maybe there wasn't enough time for the actors to prepare/rehearse. Whatever the reason, the acting in Saw is unusually poor given the talent involved and it almost seems as if the less-seasoned actors have a better handle on the material than the vets.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, Saw is among the more enjoyable modern b-movies I've seen in a while. It's far less disposable than films like Ghost Ship, Jeepers Creepers, Urban Legends, Darkness Falls, Cabin Fever, or even Final Destination. Saw is a fine debut effort from a promising young writer/director ... and it made for a terrific Halloween night at the movies."

","Wow! This movie was an upper and downer for me. The score was all over the place throughout the movie, and in most circumstances that is a good thing, and it is here too.<br/><br/>Once you've seen the entire piece you do see that the script is excellently put together, and you are left with a shed load of questions afterwards, wondering and confused but with that childish excitement of realisation.<br/><br/>Well filmed, it's dark, enclosed and precise with what you should see, more and more pieces of the puzzle. There are some interesting styles of filming, but one excellent one which I am so sure I've seen before somewhere else, the use of a camera flash to repeatedly illuminate a room. It's well done, and keeps the you feeling in that closed, dark and controlled manner.<br/><br/>I was very happily surprised, after a couple of stock Hollywood plot points which really hit me and got me thinking I was in a poor attempt of a movie, there are surprises which just make you look wide eyed at the screen and the slow dawn of realisation. Very, very well done.<br/><br/>Downsides? Well, for me one was Cary Elwes. The accent and acting kept popping me back into reality every now and again. It didn't quite hit the mark of reality enough to keep me in the movie for him. However, that was far from spoiling it for me.<br/><br/>The two Hollywood script writing moments did annoy me though, in such a well crafted film to see these two moments which are stock library scenes dropped in merely to help the story along really did bite in, and that's what dropped the score for me. If they could have just seen that and worked something else in their place this film would have been wonderful.<br/><br/>Cleverly crafted, exciting, dreadful and disturbing, an excellent film that surely lets James Wan print tickets galore for himself from now on."

"djinn667-1","Null","0","1","4 October 2004"," Great film, bad acting!
","I saw this movie last night and i have to say that it is a very imaginative storyline. The suspense is great, the twist is excellent and the gore is pumped up to a puke-inducingly satisfying level. I only have one complaint and it has to be in the direction of Cary Elwes. Now, his finest moment will always be as Robin Hood in the Spoof movie ""Men in Tights"" and to be fair, he should stick to comedy acting. He seemed OK (just) up until the final fifteen minutes. Without giving too much of the end of the film away, Elwes needs to portray someone who is in intense personal agony and despair and unfortunately does not carry it off to any extent. Earlier on in the film, he found it necessary to shout a lot to show he was angry but at the end when the agony and desperation of the moment is meant to show through, he struggles and kinda takes the edge off an otherwise-great movie.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see a better actor in the role myself. But the casting people make their decisions and who am I to argue...i'm just a movie fan...it's not like we pay these guy's wages or anything is it...!"
