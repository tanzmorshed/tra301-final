","My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.<br/><br/>But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.<br/><br/>War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."

","Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it."
"dedjim","Null","792","1001","10 June 2001"," Actually it's pretty GOOD history
","I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.<br/><br/>There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)<br/><br/>The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.<br/><br/>And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?<br/><br/>So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.<br/><br/>Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.<br/><br/>I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you."
"ToldYaSo","9","362","460","16 August 1999"," War is hell, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" peeks into the gates of Hades
","I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.<br/><br/>There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. <br/><br/>I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.<br/><br/>Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.<br/><br/>What ""Saving Private Ryan"" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience."
"morales123","Null","599","806","17 May 2000"," This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
","To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.<br/><br/>Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.<br/><br/>I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in."
"weiz_one","10","399","535","17 November 1999"," Breathtaking
","I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me.  That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain.  Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else.  Simply amazing.  An all time great."

","It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine."
"janesbit1","9","215","324","25 January 2000"," Numbing experience of SPR redeems baby boomers...
","It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.<br/><br/>The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.<br/><br/>Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.<br/><br/>After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.<br/><br/>In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","266","454","27 February 2006"," I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made
","Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).<br/><br/>It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.<br/><br/>The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. <br/><br/>It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.<br/><br/>Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.<br/><br/>As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.<br/><br/>The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.<br/><br/>This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."

"bob the moo","Null","182","325","11 September 2002"," Excellent despite some Spielberg slips into sentiment
","During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed.  In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.<br/><br/>What can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.<br/><br/>It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.<br/><br/>A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie  when America joined).<br/><br/>However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film  why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc.  Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.<br/><br/>Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be."

"Gandalf-2","6","53","99","11 October 1998"," I have some things to say here.
","Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like ""proud to be an American"" or ""part of American History"" or ""every American should see this movie"".<br/><br/>First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.<br/><br/>Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.<br/><br/>Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.<br/><br/>What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.<br/><br/>I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  ""The Bridge"" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be ""good"" or ""best""? ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with ""Schindler's List"", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.<br/><br/>So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality."
"Trashman-4","Null","33","64","8 May 2000"," America saves the world - again!
","Very good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The acting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film a bit for me.<br/><br/>The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war ended.<br/><br/>Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of the German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and for a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the Americans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representations.<br/><br/>With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of the Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before America even entered the war!<br/><br/>The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American POW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end."
"aimless-46","2","146","329","15 November 2006"," Wise Up People
","War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. <br/><br/>An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is ""Saving Private Ryan"". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). <br/><br/>Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (""Paths of Glory"") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (""The Enemy Below""). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (""The Longest Day""). <br/><br/>This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Among the most obvious:<br/><br/>A sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns, which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. <br/><br/>Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry, driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of anti-tank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. <br/><br/>A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older second-tier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.<br/><br/>So just what is ""Saving Private Ryan""? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the ""Longest Day"" whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistake-ridden, choppy, and contrived remake of ""The Big Red One"". Ultimately, this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than ""Kelly's Heroes""- a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. <br/><br/>Then there is the finale, a total rip-off of Arthur Pohl's ""The Bridge"" (1949), which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan, most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost (that is not particularly unusual), but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.<br/><br/>But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting post-war portrayals (such as ""Das Boot"" and ""Cross of Iron"") of the German soldier as something more than the sub- human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series. <br/><br/>The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim, this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized (and unexamined) by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema, where McCarthy-paralyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements, away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial release<br/><br/>Although ""Saving Private Ryan was popular, remember that the ""Rat Patrol"" ran for 58 episodes, watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Visually, the best WW2 movie. In other ways, far from the best. The movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the German soldier and praising the American. A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard of<br/><br/>the capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -""Macgyver/Rambo scene""-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated."
"kitteh_harbls","1","168","386","26 October 2006"," Typical Spielberg: All Frosting, No Cake
","In a historic and artistic context, here's a question that would bother Spielberg if he thought about it for a second: what if there was no such thing as special effects? If we take the special effects from his movies, would they still be great? What, you're waiting for an answer? Just like every Spielberg movie, we find Steve desperately clinging to special effects like a fish to water. Like Bush to oil. Like Uwe Boll to a video game-to-movie conversion (last one is not necessarily bad, by the way).<br/><br/>Just like everybody else, I was amazed by the ""realism"" of the first 5 minutes. Once you get past the battle scenes, there's not much to work with. I'm glad people (as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here) are starting to realize this.<br/><br/>Let's set aside the absurdity of the ""plot"" (I use 'plot' very loosely). That's just a vehicle; a pretext; an excuse to use special effects (Spielberg's one and only leverage). The main plot is that a mother lost a number of her sons, so the general (or whatever his rank was) thinks she shouldn't lose her last remaining son, Ryan. He reads a letter Abraham Lincoln sent to a mother who went through a similar experience during the civil war. Using musical cues and closeups, Spielberg is not trying to tell us how to feel; he's practically *begging* us to do so. After all, he knows better than anybody that people will - during the course of the movie - realize that the battle scenes aren't that numerous or long, so there better be some story to back the movie up.<br/><br/>Since he knows that he's addressing a crowd that made movies like Armageddon and Independence Day box office hits, he (correctly) realized that the script needs to be comprised of one element only: text. So long as the script contained text, it was good enough. And he was right. With enough flash and special effects, he was able to appeal to the idiocy of the average American, a tactic mastered by Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay and their likes.<br/><br/>Now, back to the 'plot': once you set it aside, you'll realize that this movie is trying to instill many ideas into the minds of the movie goers. When he shows German soldiers, he shows them from a distance, so by not giving them a face, a human side, he teaches us that it's totally OK to thrill at killing them. Bad German bad! After our heroes free a German, Spielberg makes is very clear that he came back later to kill Tom Hanks. Spielberg is saying: they should've killed him the first time. The only good German is a dead one, apparently. Astonishing dishonesty and malice on the part of Spielberg. Not a trick was a spared to demonize every single one of them.<br/><br/>Unlike masters of movie making (a title Spielberg will never come close to) like Scorsese and Coppola, he desperately needs musical cues to tell when to feel sad, fearful, excited, etc. His approach to emotion is so utterly sappy, shallow and downright laughable that it's virtually impossible for him to let the scenes and the story speak for themselves. He must have very clear cues to give the viewers signals. The music is like a slap in the face. Spielberg manifests in moments like ""tell me I lived a good life"", grabs you by the throat and ORDERS you to shed a few tears. Insulting. Pathetic.<br/><br/>The only good part in the movie is the whole scene of the mistaken identity, where they realize this whining little weakling crying his eyes out is not the Ryan they wanted. Other than that, and looking at the chutzpah of the musical cues, the absurdity of the plot, the dehumanization of the Germans and the hilarious warfare errors, the movie is only good for another laugh, albeit not one Spielberg was aiming for."

","(1/1/2017 Update edited for corrections; written as is.)<br/><br/>Of course the first combat sequence was great. But unfortunately, I was considered a sociopath for snickering at a man wandering around to pick up his dismembered arm, while the camera is still shaking on the ground -- it became obvious that Spielberg tries too hard to elicit the emotions from a cynical person like me. <br/><br/>I eventually became sick and nauseated at having been forced to watch the ultimately annoying and repetitive guerrilla cinematography, while the violence and mayhem prevails. Is it supposed to depict the reality of war? Maybe yes, but all it does is always impact, impact, impact, and I felt little or no emotion. After the first sequence, SPR stooped for the lowest level -- and I tried to keep awake during some tedious parts, but I ended up snickering and laughing at a few utterly lame and manipulative scenes (Remember Edward Burns' arrogantly stoic character and Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller's speech?). <br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with the film is that the audience at first showed disdain for the translator because he's a ""coward"" (why the critics say this in their reviews is beyond me), and then cheered when he shot one of the German soldiers to death just to show his courage -- I found this disturbing. After the final battle, the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax I've ever seen -- from the slowly progressing (and clichéd) morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the U.S. flag waving for another 25 seconds. <br/><br/>After I left the theater quietly, I let out intense rib-aching laughter all the way driving home. This is what Mr. Goldman observes as ""phony and manipulative, to serve our Country."" I'm sorry if I sound crude, but I debunk SPR for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with Patch Adams, another worse movie that year.<br/><br/>This is my honest opinion -- to observe, dissect and criticize -- and I don't trust the critics anymore, because they went overboard just for the realistic depiction of war violence, calling the movie ""the greatest war movie ever made!"" In truth, older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting (Paths of Glory and The Longest Day) -- despite the fact that they're tame for not being profane and gory.<br/><br/>And most importantly, SPR shouldn't be shown in English classes in high schools just as another critically overrated The Clockwork Orange shouldn't. It only serves to desensitize the kids because of the ""war is bad"" propaganda coupled with the U.S.-saluting totalitarianism.

","Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile ""characters"" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD. <br/><br/>The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List). <br/><br/>The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.<br/><br/>Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.<br/><br/>At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF pussy - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!<br/><br/>The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda."
"the_bike","1","90","202","1 September 2003"," Pretty bad history
","I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change (take a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example). What Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonder<br/><br/>which Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who know little about the battle (that's almost everyone who's in the theater) probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.<br/><br/>Believe me, the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if it<br/><br/>were as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon, which they did. I wonder, for example, how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film it looks about a couple hundred yards. It was, in actuality, almost ten miles wide. The timing was also inaccurate - Hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM. Another historical error is the implication that the events at Omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches (Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah). That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach, for example, the other US assault beach, took about a dozen casualties - many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action. But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script. Here we have the US Army sending a squad(a squad!!!) to march straight thru the entire German 7th Army (something two Divisions, with total air superiority couldn't do for weeks), waltz around an area of 300 square miles, and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this nonsense, the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning. ""Gliders, what gliders""?  said Spielberg. That's what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't know very much about his subject.  A stupid, stupid film. What a waste of $100M or so."
"osloj","1","142","330","22 September 2004"," Morally Weak Film Based on Flawed Sentimentality
","Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the ""glorious, morally superior American armed forces"", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. <br/><br/>He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all ""good guys"". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the ""communist threat"" and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. <br/><br/>And after the war, things got even worse, the ""Red Hunt"", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>It is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the ""best wars film ever"" as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen. Perhaps, instead of giving Spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre, they should go out and rent ""Come and See"" (Russian), The Burmese Harp (1967), Fires on the Plain (1959) or Paths of Glory (1957), truly far superior films to this Hollywood-bastardization and candy treatment of war. There is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at D-Day, according to Spielberg, was in some way just a side show to saving ""Private Ryan"". With such a simplistic statement, it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that 'action, action, action' is equated with 'greatness'. I only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth. While most viewers, who are safely tucked away in their houses, waving American flags and discharging a few tears, saying, ""You German scum! You German scum!"" can truly appreciate blood and guts as ""cinema"" then there is a market for it. After you get through the puerile premise, then you can sit back, have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most cliché-driven rubbish that has ever been produced. <br/><br/>The scenes themselves are overdrawn, stolen from previous war films from the 1950's, namely the Longest Day (1962) which was a great film in itself. The beach landing is too long, and it shows only the Americans as ""heroic"" while the Germans are seen as ""evil Hun scum"". Tom Hanks, in his most idiotic and candid self, seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save Private Ryan and in one completely absurd scene, the remaining 15 Americans defeat a battle hardened, superiorly trained SS special unit group with just a few guns. Now, if you know anything about history, then you would know that the SS were not an ""easy group"" to defeat, they were some of the most fanatical and well-trained soldiers of the German Reich but since Spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots, he'll continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines. <br/><br/>This is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else, I would suggest watching ""Hell Is for Heroes"" (1962) with Steve McQueen, because it is a lot better and we don't have to be forced to carry an American flag at the end."
"the_bike","1","81","182","22 October 2003"," Not a valid portrayal of Neptune
","The problem with Saving Pvt Ryan is that is is basically a<br/><br/>fraudulent portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Every single detail may, for all I know, be authentic for the group portrayed, which I assume was Goranson's Company C, 2nd Rangers. But that company, with one notable exception, experienced the worst that Omaha Beach<br/><br/>dealt to the assault troops during the hours 0630-0800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (Col Schneider) (6 companies) landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded.  It all depended on where your landing craft touched down (or allowed it to touch down - Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was , Dog Green, but had the sense to order the craft eastward), and Capt Hanks landed<br/><br/>at the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes, they didn't crawl up, inch by inch, etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes - very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14,000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves (0630-0800)was not much over 10%, far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disasters,etc. Beside, Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of non-existent eyewitnesses.( It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to ""authenticate"" the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers).<br/><br/> Anyone who sees Pvt  Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenes,the rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase : ""Call the 101st on the radio, and tell them to pull Ryan from the line."" That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.<br/><br/>Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan, while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then, that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be (I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together - they would never have done that ) the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story, although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait, as is obvious from the casualties taken (approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces ""O"" and ""B"" (60,000 troops))."
"Fiona G.","1","92","209","9 July 2000"," Self-medication, Mr. Spielberg?
","This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with ""Schindler's List."" That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of ""Armageddon"": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.<br/><br/>
The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all. <br/><br/>So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as ""All quiet on the Western Front"" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a ""real"" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an ""Oscar"" until ""Schindler's List."" That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.<br/><br/>If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch ""All quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot."""

What follows then, is just stupid, one-sided and is - at least from the viewpoint of a German - invidious. I cannot understand that a man with over 50 years of life experience (Steven Spielberg) can make such a stupid film about second world war in 1998, or my explanation is that this man has no character. The second disappointment, perhaps the bigger one, were the reports that in the United States this movie was received with overwhelming applause and ecstatic feelings of patriotism. This is only a film, but it also tells you something about what people really think. Before that, I had thought the Americans were (at least since 50 years) our friends. After this film and especially the reception of the film by the broader audience in the USA (as I had read about it in newspapers and magazines), I thought: they may be our collaborators in many ways, but they are not our friends."

This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens.

Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is.

Basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on Ohama beach with Captain John H.

After surviving this, they are given a special mission that they don't understand the significance of, to find one man and bring him home. They are now on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and when they eventually find him, he doesn't know why he is needed to get home.

","""  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN   ""<br/><br/>I thought that this Movie was going to be a masterpiece. Topping those great Anti-War films of ""Apocalypse Now"" ""The Boat"" and ""All quiet on the Western Front""<br/><br/>But alas!  What am I to expect from America?  The Truth? NEVER!<br/><br/>Yet another great, expensive war film, where the Germans fight like Italians,  TOTALLY arrogant to anyone else.  I mean HONESTLY an American flag at the start and at the end.  Showing the American and French flags.  The ENGLISH and CANADIANS DID land on Normandy too.  The only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about Monty.<br/><br/>The Germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the Americans in France, but that doesn't matter because they were on the wicked side.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film simply made to win another Oscar for Speilbergs already crowded shelf.  Not a ground breacker, not a truthful film. NOT even historically correct!!<br/><br/>1.  Radar was a TOTAL secret.  No American privates or captains would have ANY idea of what Radar was.<br/><br/>2.  Germans, especially those of the SS, would NEVER be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with Tanks first. It was common military knowledge for both sides.<br/><br/>3. The P-51 D mustang, which blows up the Tiger Tanks on the bridge,  were NEVER tank destroyers, they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion.  The only Tank destroyers being employed at that time were BRITISH.  NOT AMERICAN. So of course the Americans would take out this imperfect feature.<br/><br/>Frankly, if you're American, you can go get your gun an' feel patriotic once again, as you have done with ""The dirty Dozen"" ""Where Eagles Dare"". <br/><br/>If you're not American, avoid this, and stick to ""The Boat"" for your WWII viewing."

","I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: "" Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man"" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.<br/><br/>Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.<br/><br/>I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.<br/><br/>So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director"

","Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar. <br/><br/>It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his ""real"" film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup). <br/><br/>And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all  how could it not?  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.<br/><br/>Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil. <br/><br/>You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but that setup was disjointed. <br/><br/>So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.<br/><br/>And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.<br/><br/>With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from ""Come and See"". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it."

","I finally made time to see this film, expecting a visceral, emotional experience.  Instead I was (in order) bored, angry, sleepy, and bewildered. Is this the groundbreaking film that everyone was gushing over last year? From all the talk I expected a head-on assault at the beginning of the movie.  What I did see was a heavy-handed and frankly uninteresting battle scene.  From there the movie only got worse.  I didn't care a bit for any of the characters, least of all the Tom Hanks lead and the obnoxious Matt Damon.  While the film looked spectacular, that's all it was: surface. There was no depth whatsoever to any of the characters or situations.  I feel like maybe there is something wrong with me that I don't see what all the orgasmic gushing over this film is about.  Plain old boring."

"domino1003","10","20","39","30 June 2005"," One of Spielberg's Most Haunting and Visually Stunning Films
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, you see an elderly man (Whose identity is not revealed until the end), standing at a headstone, in tears. Why? You soon understand the story as we go back in time.<br/><br/>It is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach. And it is INCREDIBLY bloody. Soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.<br/><br/>Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).<br/><br/>This is not an easy mission. Every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns)believes that Pvt. Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. It is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film: will their sacrifice make a difference? By taking a stand to defend the bridge, the answer is obvious: yes.<br/><br/>The performances of the actors are powerful; Including Hanks, Burns and Damon, you have Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies. John Williams, who always works well with Spielberg, provides a powerful score. The battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history (And is not for the squeamish). It is a very moving film, and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it."

","I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.<br/><br/>An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many Hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done."

","Up until this day, there had never been a time where I was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie. Never. Then, I saw Saving Private Ryan. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a very accurate presentation of World War 2. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Spielburg's camera-work, which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier. I felt like I was running along the beaches of Normandy. I felt like I was with them in the final battle (won't reveal specifics). That's how good it was! Now, even though this movie is really good, it is not for the faint of heart. The first scene of this movie (D-Day) contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. They do not hold back on the violence. So, unless you think you can handle it, I would not recommend seeing this movie, because it does have some very disturbing moments. Another thing they do not hold back on is swearing. If soldiers shouting out the f-word constantly doesn't appeal to you, then you might want to skip this movie.<br/><br/>Besides all of that, this is a great film! I can't think of anything wrong with it at all. I would definitely recommend this movie (if you can handle the gore and language)."
"Charles-31","1","65","149","7 November 1999"," What an awful movie (some spoilers)!
","I was looking forward to seeing Saving Private Ryan.  I had heard many reviews that called it one of the greatest war movies ever made.  I was not expecting to see something as poorly put together as this movie was.  From the begining I found myself wanting to scream at the screen.  I must admit the acting was good, but they had little to work with.<br/><br/>
Just about every other aspect of the film fails.  It manages to portray D-Day as the smallest battle I've ever seen.  Basically, the goal was two machine gun posts.  Sorry, but that battle was not realistic at all and was intentionally bloodwashed worst than the Friday the 13th movies.  The film is loaded with mistakes including the rediculous helmet rank insignia. They knew better because they told someone not to salute Hanks because it might give away his rank.  Then they put bars on his helmet!  Structurally, the movie was a disaster.  It was supposed to be about the irony of many men dying for one man.  In the end, though it turns into the defense of a bridge and the main plot is almost totally forgotten.  The soldiers are stupid. They have to defend or destroy a bridge, but don't leave the detonator wired up and someone (who should have been Ryan) to blow it as a last resort? Every war cliche in the book gets dropped into this film.  ""Save my child"", the wounded soldier just out of reach, the sharpshooter who never misses, ""I'm not leaving my buddies"", etc.  They are all there.  Did they have to end the the waiving of the flag?<br/><br/>The movie does not feel like WWII, but rather feels like Vietnam.  Lots of mud and rain, ""what are we doing here"", a bungling military command.  One of the most successful engagements in military history is portrayed as a confused, poorly planned mess.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely loaded with red herrings.  Hank's hand problem has no bearing on the plot and is not present when it might cause a problem. They fight a machine-gun nest for no real reason other than it provided a fight scene.  Was I the only one to notice that all of the towns were destroyed before we even got to them?  Didn't France surrender?  The climactic battle is sure to be lost, but is won when air support arrives. Of course, they did not call for the air support.  Can you say ""Deus ex machina""?  Did we have precision guided tank bombs in WWII?  Did our protagonists really have anything to do with the outcome?<br/><br/>I was shocked that this movie was not ripped apart in reviews.  It has everything possible wrong with it.  Is it now unpatriotic to indicate divel when you see it wrapped with an American flag?"

","The greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of Normandy, and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.<br/><br/>Out there in that beach, Dog Green Sector, Omaha beach, hundreds if not thousands of courageous American soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent. Their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victory.<br/><br/>Too many young Americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free. This source of American pride moves me in so many ways. We love the American heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors: the American soldiers.<br/><br/>This movie, starring a great American actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of Captain Miller, 2nd Ranger, shows the American attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest American victories in world history. It is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for America and world freedom to win the most important war in history. I will always love America for that.<br/><br/>Other fantastic American actors like Vin Diesel and Giovani Ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kind-hearted soldiers in the face of evil, showing all the heroism we can expect from an Army Ranger.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a must-see and it is worth to buy the DVD.

","I went to see this film back in 1998 with my father, who is a WWII veteran who happened to serve in the Pacific Theatre, on Iwo Jima. While on line, he struck up a conversation with another veteran who did happen to serve in the European Theatre, and they discussed old times. But near the end of the conversation, my dad said, ""For what? For what?"" Something that still resonates with many WWII vets who are still alive, and saw that war was not the prettified heroics pumped out of the Hollywood studios, but a very real, bloody and bewildering hell, fought by the young and vital, male and female alike.<br/><br/>The premise of the film being a young man who has already lost several brothers in the service, being saved by a platoon unknown to him has its basis in fact. During the Second World War, many families had several sons who either enlisted, or were drafted, and went into different military units. The five Sullivan brothers, all of whom were lost during the sinking of the USS Juneau, were the most famously representative of this tragedy, and after the war, the practice of multiple draft recipients from one family was eliminated. Does anyone remember the scene where Private Ryan's mother sees an Army car pulling up to her porch? The serviceman and her local clergyman approach her, and she sinks down, struck by the horrible reality they are about to convey. The terrible simplicity of this is deeply moving.<br/><br/>There is also a brief scene in the beginning showing a secretarial pool for the Armed Services, where letters for medals, both posthumous and for the living, were typed and sent to families around the country. My mother worked in one of those pools, and it was not an easy job to deal with day by day.<br/><br/>Some have asked - why no British soldiers here? This is an American platoon on the Omaha beachhead, not one of Montgomery's units. The daily dangers and horrors of war are vividly portrayed. The deaths aren't pretty, and some of the characters aren't pretty, but that's the way war is (and was). You were in a unit with all types, from different states, and your common goal was to survive - kill, or be killed. There were gloryboys and cowards, and some are shown here.<br/><br/>The only maudlin note (and Spielberg can't seem to resist injecting some sentimentality here) is when the mature Ryan, visiting the military cemetery with his family, stops at the grave of his commanding officer John Miller, and asks in tears, ""Am I a good man?"" In other words - why them, and not me? Why am I here, outliving everyone? It doesn't seem justified to him.<br/><br/>There are some terrific performances to take in : Tom Hanks as John Miller, Matt Damon as Pvt. Ryan, Tom Sizemore, and Vin Diesel, to name just a few.<br/><br/>The sacrifices of our fathers, uncles, and grandfathers' generation were exemplary. They were the lucky ones who came back to lend their voices to history, and without them, many of us, including myself, would not be here. At the end of the film, I sat there, next to my dad, who was also in tears. I would say, ""God bless them, one and all."""

","The movie is nothing but a dummy package. Under the guise of a feigned authenticity - the construction of unreflecting patriotism, tear-jerking worship of heroes, a naive black-and-white portrayal and a pathetic ""good against evil"" mentality - it does not leave a doubt that only a dead German is a good German. Tom Hanks and the folks gathering around him may do a good job, but still cannot avoid the old cliché: Captain Miller's colorful troop is not much more than the regular bunch of war movie stereotypes who mutate to heroes. Where the Vietnam movies of a Oliver Stone (Platoon) or of a Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket) mercilessly condemn, do Spielberg's shocking pictures justify all committed atrocities in retrospect. Therefore this movie is rather a tribute to the US World War Veterans, than an anti-war movie. An absolution, which illustrates the horrors of war but not its senselessness. All in all, this is a movie we did not need and we could have done very well without it."

Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions! In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2½ hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence. RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.<br/><br/>Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#33-IMDb Top 250 today), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only ""shades of gray"" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of on screen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie""Just watch, eventually you will understand! <br/><br/>Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise ChamianIf the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel badshe did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian!(Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of Americabut RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion) <br/><br/>The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever! To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre labelThis is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see!

","Together with ""Schindler's List (1993) and ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like ""Platoon"" it gives the viewer an ""in the trenches"" experience.<br/><br/>Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.<br/><br/>Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom."
"highkite","9","14","26","25 July 2006"," The perfect war movie..
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.<br/><br/>The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.<br/><br/>The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else."

","The story happened in the Second World War. Private Ryan's three elder brothers were killed in battles. The US army decided to send Ryan back to home to alleviate his mother's pain. Captain Miller accepted the task, though he was not satisfied with it including other members. It was said that Ryan was in German-dominated-France-area. Every team member knew its hardship.<br/><br/>The opening battle that happened in Omaha beach was fierce and unforgettable. The similar scenes also occurred in wonderful TV series Band Brothers. When Miller led seven people to execute the mission, that reminded me of The lord of the rings. Of cause the task in TLOTR was more difficult.<br/><br/>Life is precious. However a war can easily kill many people. The war is ruthless so that you must be cold-blooded or get killed in battlefield. Peace is really what we should cherish.<br/><br/>An excellent thought-provoking war drama. 9/10"

","It may not be the MOST overrated, but it's certainly up there along with Scream and Fargo and There's Something About Mary.<br/><br/>Oh what a battle scene - the fantastic motion sickness inducing cinematography, the masterfully overhyper editing, the gore, oh the wonderful gore.  And so forth.<br/><br/>The Omaha beach landing was quite intense.  It was brutal and affecting. But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.<br/><br/>After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes: reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah. Also painfully stereotypical are the characters: we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life, we've got the hardnut sergeant, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the New Yorker, and so forth.  And all the Germans are skinheaded bastards - and by the way, where the hell were the other allied troops?  Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).<br/><br/>The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring.  Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome.  The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.<br/><br/>Then there's the final battle.  Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator).  Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.<br/><br/>5 Oscars?  Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved.  Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world.  Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line.  I suppose the two sound awards are justified.<br/><br/>For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now.  This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is.  This can't even be described as the best D-Day/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**.   To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film.  Schindler's List is superior.<br/><br/>To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked.  If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave/press stop.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour."

","Lame, revisionist crap. What the hell kind of squad does no recon, talks out loud, and stays bunched together? Also, many of the weapons (esp. the German M 60)are improperly, and fantastically used. How can you use a sniper scope out of the box, with no sighting in? Idiotic. Spielbergs enthusiastic portrayal of the murder of German prisoners is disturbing in the extreme."
"ReelCheese","9","12","22","18 February 2007"," Spielberg Takes Us To War
","The genius of Steven Spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience, and then takes them there. If he wants to tug at our heartstrings, he'll make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque. If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White. And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.<br/><br/>Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.<br/><br/>But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.<br/><br/>The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.<br/><br/>And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close."
"Xophianic","10","12","22","2 February 2000"," One of the most outstanding movies ever
","Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.<br/><br/>When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.<br/><br/>The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.<br/><br/>The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.<br/><br/>The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.<br/><br/>If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed."

Some scenes are outrageously unrealistic, such as when those American soldiers shot the Germans using the mirror. Also, studies have been done showing that only about 1/3 of American troops landing during D-Day fired their rifles.  Not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be.  It's laughable that people call this film ""realistic.""<br/><br/>The audience is given very little credit.  The dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission.  It's as though Spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail.<br/><br/>It also overused action sequences.  Those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty, excessive scenes of violence.  All in all, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen."

","Saving Private Ryan is a military movie based during World War II. The movie starts with the invasion of Normandy at what is now known as D Day. Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks, leads his troops onto the beaches of Normandy against the Germans. Once they are able to take the beach, they learn of story of Private James Ryan. James and his other four brothers are scattered throughout Europe battling in World War II. The United States Headquarters learns that all of James's brothers have been killed in action, leaving James the only sibling to survive. The United States Military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action. In a plot to give his mother some type of comfort, the Military sends Captain Miller and his troops on a hunt to find Private Ryan and tell him what had happened and to get him back home.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is courage. Throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end. The soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from World War II and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach. After they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find Private Ryan. They had to search throughout Europe to find Ryan while going through several battles and their own battles with each other. They lost many men including Corporal Caparzo. All of those men lost, just so that they could get Private Ryan and send him home to his mother.<br/><br/>Lighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer, and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life. When Caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark, it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog. The surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there. The sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in. It makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if that's how it really was.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best military movies of all time. The courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic. They made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in World War II. This movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom."

The opening D-DAY sequence was beautiful. The final battle was also great. There were moments that really grabbed you (the Giovanni Ribisi monologue especially) but the film as a whole makes no sense.<br/><br/>It said nothing. It simply contradicted itself over and over agian. The great D-DAY sequence tells us about the insanity of war, and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is. But after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing, the movie goes full circle right into hollywood. The ending attempts to justify all the madness, by saying that it's all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country (as we fade out on the american flag). Mr. Speilberg and company, What exactly are you trying to tell us?<br/><br/>NOTE: This movie pales in comparison to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.<br/><br/>Although I must say, if it came down to this movie and Shakespeare in love (perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar... oh wait thats titanic), I would have to go with this one."

","Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off  his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone dropped<br/><br/>behind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers are<br/><br/>already in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st  and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision."

That being said, did Mr. Spielberg forget to actually add a story?  Lots of movies deal with the ugly side of humanity.

","This movie is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. This movie is hard to look at if you can't stand gory scenes. Tom Hanks plays his role extremely well in this movie. Along with other actors in here such as Matt Damon and Vin Diesel. Spielberg really got the costumes down pretty good. As well as the graphic explosions of the tanks. This is an adventure of Capt. Miller and his crew to save this one pvt., Pvt. Ryan. This movie was made on the 60th Anniverrsery of the invasion of Normandy. So this is the movie to see if you need to see a good WW II movie. Another movie that might be enjoyed if you liked this movie is Schindler's List."

","This movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come. Why? Because it helps shows war with real decency. No one would want to watch a movie with only killing, blood and gore. No one really does. This movie manages to let us, the viewers, watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went through.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks was at his best yet, with superb realism which he displayed. Good job to others: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burn, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and of course Vin Diessel.<br/><br/>The Director: Steven Spielberg directed the best movie he ever made. This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.<br/><br/>The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.<br/><br/>This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.<br/><br/>I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude."

","**** out of ****<br/><br/>
Five years can really put a lot in perspective. At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.<br/><br/>The question is: how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.<br/><br/>Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.<br/><br/>The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre. It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective. Whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably won't reach any satisfying conclusion. Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic. Viewers should at least be open-minded enough to absorb the film's moral quandaries, they're partially the glue that holds the film together.<br/><br/>The camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film. There's an equal mix of humor, tension, respect, and pathos between these men. Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler: oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).<br/><br/>That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous.  Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality. SPR is no different, there's a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments, but to say it didn't affect me would be a complete lie. I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.<br/><br/>In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.<br/><br/>The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.<br/><br/>First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be."

","Winning 5 Academy Awards Saving Private Ryan is without doubt one of the greatest war movies of all time. Director Steven Spielberg does an excellent job with this film. The choreography,  film editing, sound, and directing are superb. Specially the D-Day scene, which veterans called a precise re-creation of the real landing on Normandy. Along is the powerful cast of Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and Vin Diesel which makes the movie even better. The greatest war film of all time and one of the best films over all."

","I'm afraid that I hated every moment of this film. Spielburg overused emotional hokum to try to give his film wieght when we actually didn't care whether Private Ryan lived or died. The first twenty minutes, I accept are excellent, but they are just a rip off of someone else's hard work - and frankly I would rather see the original footage from the Second World War rather than the director's interpretation of it. Although it tried to be realistic and historical, it was neither. The history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic. (I imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummie's boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base.) I'd rather watch the notoriously bad, Objective Burma anyday. At least it doesn't pretend to be true."

","OOOOH! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks!  It has to be good! And that is why so many fools actually think this movie is worth something; they were told it was before they ever saw it.  Tom Hanks playing the same character he has in every movie since ""Philidelphia"" sans ""Forrest Gump."" Spielberg trying to make us think this movie is as realistic as they get. Lots of bullets, blood, and heads blowing apart does not mean it qualifies as real.  It can't be real.  We've seen all of these characters in a hundred other movies.  Tough, tobacco chewing sergeant.  Cynical, mouthy private. Even the sniper getting shot through the scope.  Spielberg is ripping of a schlock tom berringer joint.

"brv","2","26","58","12 August 1998"," Fantasy reigns supreme
","Spielberg just about had it here, at least for the first half hour or so. He looked at the bone-crunching, grisly history of D-day and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality. Then, with his Hollywood sellout lack of vision, Spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy. The 'true' story the film may be based on has some chaplain in France discovering Ryan after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to America so his mother still has one child to work the farm. Or, the story could be straight out of the writer's head but it hardly matters. The premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a half-hour of complete slaughter, the seas red with human blood and gore. We are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over Private Ryan and his family while the assault on Normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives, while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and Hitler's machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass. What romantic rubbish and so typical of Hollywood. And the portrayal of the German prisoner is morally offensive. The German people have never been less human than Americans, even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war.  To portray them as Spielberg does the prisoner, a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake, hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an American chest, is low-brow, hateful stuff. But nobody is going to notice. Believe me. In fact, we love to see the world in black and white, simplistic terms.  Here come the Oscars for Spielberg. Americans (and my own Canadians too) are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves. Capital 'D' Denial reigns supreme, especially at the box-office. Spielberg's big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth. If he'd stayed on the beach at Omaha, he'd have a nine out of ten. Instead, he rates several points less for this updated version of that old T.V. series called Combat. Please see Amy Taubin's review at the following URL. It's much more articulate and generous than mine. <br/><br/>http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/film/30taubin.shtml"

You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.<br/><br/>I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.<br/><br/>Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem was my expectation.

This movie is an example of what is wrong with Hollywood and the way big studio movies are made, thier #1 objective is to make money off the movie at any cost even if that means turning out a piece of garbage that leads the public to believe this is the best out there, when in fact the opposite is true."

","I can't be the only person who thinks this is Starship Troopers with the Evil Nazi Scourge standing in for the Bugs.<br/><br/>For one, the combat scenes are no more war-is-hell realistic and bloody than Starship Troopers.  It's nice to see protagonists who aren't superhuman, but this is only a (moderately) original take for big budget blockbusters, it's hardly ground breaking cinema.<br/><br/>Just as in Starship Troopers, the characters barely qualify as one dimensional, and I can't be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that SPR almost qualifies as a parody.<br/><br/>A particular point of interest is that Mr Spielberg's Evil Nazi Scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the Bugs in Starship Troopers.  If you get your knowledge of history from Hollywood (which a lot of people do), then you'd be forgiven for thinking that every single German was a soulless Nazi who deserved to die, and that WWII was just USA vs Japan and Germany.  I do have a fair amount of sympathy for Spielberg's stance, but it's interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930's Nazi anti-Jewish, anti-Romany propaganda.  It's sad but not really surprising that Spielberg's audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the German moviegoers did in the 1930's.<br/><br/>The idea for SPR is actually sound, but the implementation is just so overdone that I really can't bring myself to care about any of it, other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history.  If I'm going to watch good-vs-bad fantasy, I'd prefer to stick with Starship Troopers which at least doesn't try to pass itself off as something significant and profound."

","I give this movie a four out of ten because the cinematography was good. Other then that it was crap. The acting is terrible especially by Vin Diesel, how the heck did he get that role anyway? The plot was ridiculous and boring, the script was very poorly written and over all I am disappointed in both Tom Hanks and Mr. Spielberg. Now I know Spielberg loves to make movies about that era, of course he was too young for that war and too old for the next one, but hey, he's richer then god, he can exploit anything he wants. The movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy. (best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to rescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat. So almost every man from Hanks' squad dies but eventually Ryan gets saved. The Germans, of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men. In reality the war was fought by a bunch of twenty-somethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into. But the Hanks-Spielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers. So do yourself a favor, skip renting this, pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of B of B. It's a true story based on real heroes of WWII, and the acting is not bad. Thats all. Save your money if you want to see saving private ryan, wait for it to come on ABC."
"da cissy pimp","1","20","44","18 March 2001"," THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
","Yes, I know lots of people regard this film one of the greatest war movies ever made blah, blah, blah, but I personally found it one of the most grotesquely overrated pieces of crap I have suffered through in a long time (as far as World War 2 movies go, only the recent version of ""The Thin Red Line"" was more torturous).  While its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking, I found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself, and during the initial scenes where the Allies were landing at Normandy and getting massacred, I found myself inflamed with feelings of BESTIAL WARLUST and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent and/or gory moments (eg where that troop carrier opens up, only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by German machine gunners).  Once this part of the movie had ended, however, I found the whole thing rapidly getting boring: so much so that, during the violent scene right at the end, I found myself squirming and fidgeting in my seat, wondering when it would all be over.<br/><br/>One of this film's main faults is that it doesn't have much of a storyline to speak of and its whole premise (while admittedly based on a real-life incident) seemed rather ridiculous to me.  Stupidly going for the bad guys (as is a habit of mine when watching movies) also didn't help, and I particularly detested all of the overt religiosity in the movie (such as all those highly offensive scenes of cross-kissing, and all those equally nauseating comments by the Americans about how God was on their side in the war (quite frankly, if God exists, I don't think he cares about stuff like this)).  In addition to all of these other faults, the final scene is VILE (last long enough to get to it and you'll hopefully see what I mean).<br/><br/>In summary, therefore, A HUNDRED MEGATON THERMONUCLEAR BOMB!"
"ahuvia-kahane","1","26","60","15 December 2007"," Dangerous, as we know.
","Between hobnobbing in Martha's Vinyard, Spielberg has, as we know, been trying to claim the holocaust, slavery, war, and other ethical properties as his (American) own. Now there is an ambition.<br/><br/>The message for this film can well be construed as Do What the General Says, Because It's the Right Thing to Do. Feel Good About Agonizing Over This Question, But Do What The General Says (AKA ""shoot and weep""). It's an old (my apologies) Fascist trick. Raise a genuinely important, painful issue, then sooth the pain with a quick, unambiguous appeal to both duty and moral recognition, the split between moral recognition and action here acts as the ethical seal of approval. Would we not all like life to be so simple...Sadly there have been other cases in more recent history where a similarly confident recommendation, Bear the Pain of Pulling that Trigger with Loyal Pride, seem to have landed everyone in serious trouble. History may never repeat itself, but Spielberg is out to prove us wrong.<br/><br/>Rating should, perhaps, be, not quite ""1"" for ""awful,"" but rather ""10"" for inducing shock and awe."

","Easily the worst movie ever made about World War II and the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, Spielberg has taken the heroic story of the 5 Sullivan Brothers who lost their lives in the Pacific, renamed them Ryan, moved them to Europe, and turned them into cry-babies. Spielberg has said on TV that he never understood why America had to fight World War II to begin with, and this movie proves it. The infamous ""first 20 minutes"" -- was touted as a super-realistic hardline look at the horrors of combat. Hint: Look elsewhere, such as in Mel Gibson's outstandingly raw combat scenes in ""We Were Soldiers."" Spielberg's opening combat scenes are a dreadful special effects show, and any viewer involvement falls flat for lack of either character development or contact with Earth. When fighting a war, it's better to not send cowards or airheads to do a man's job. The same can be said for making movies about war. Spielberg ought to have evolved into a grown-up at his age, but so far he's just devoid of character and backbone. This is sadly reflected in this dreadful unpatriotic movie."

I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically.

It is a journey through World War II's harshness and a journey with these men. We come to care for these men. They aren't given huge amounts of development, but they don't need it. The actors really make us care for these people, as does Steven Spielberg's skillful directing. This is definitely one of his best movies.<br/><br/>It is also a lot different. If any of his movies contain violence, there is very little of it. This, however, contains some of the most graphic violence I've ever seen. It truly shows the violence, dirtyness and uselessness of war. It doesn't offer anything but pain and misery. John William's score also creates a very suitable mood.<br/><br/>The only reasons I have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end. The American flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and I found it unnecessary.<br/><br/>4½/5."

","I remember when I first went to see this movie. I was 14 and when I was going to turn 17 I was determined to join the army - u know, spend the summer with friends, learn new things, meet new people, and most importantly be a soldier for my country.<br/><br/>All that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie. I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: ""So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans"" or ""Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys."" You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.<br/><br/>Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies.

","This movie is the greatest war movie ever! Tom Hanks was a perfect captain and Matt Damon was such a great Private Ryan. The beach scene was such a great scene, although it was pretty intense the way that Steven Speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic. Another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didn't know where her forth son was. It made me feel like crying and I'm sure that all the other fans out there felt the same way.<br/><br/>The ending is very dramatic, but Steven didn't go overboard. When the old James Ryan almost starts to cry I felt the same way. When Tom Hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie. It was awesomely brilliant, but very sad.

"Medabloga","10","6","10","26 April 2005"," a true masterpiece
","Saving Private Ryan will probably be remembered as a true classic, the best war movie ever made that presented World War II as good as possible... For those who haven't seen the movie - Run, Run and don't look back, go rent it, and enjoy every minute of it. <br/><br/>The movie begins with the well known American invasion to Europe in operation Overlord at the problematic Omaha Beach. Never in filming industry had there been a better war scene, so true, so real, making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion... Spielberg didn't censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood, less dead and less wounded. In fact, this scene, showing zero regards to Human life isn't just to make the viewers feel excited, its true purpose will be understood only later, after watching the film...<br/><br/>Following the invasion, Cpt Miller (Tom Hanks) gets another mission - ""straight from the top"" - Rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war. Eight men, rescuing one. <br/><br/>After the bloodsheded scene in Omaha, this mission looks rather stupid, one life? is it really worth endangering the lives of eight? Omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes... How is one life that important? Without a doubt, Spielberg didn't randomly choose a mission to base a movie about. This movie isn't just an action film... It has an hidden message, It shows that on the side of war, with so much dead, zero regards for human life we are all still human- those who die at war aren't just soldiers, they're men, with lives, desires, needs - they have names, brothers, sisters - and each and every one of them counts... Omaha is war, it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie - well, thats humanity... Suddenly, one life does count, and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie is all action. true hardcore action... The rest of the movie, following the invasion, escorts the small squad led by Cpt. Miller as they search for one soldier, Private James Ryan, in occupied France... Endless battle-scenes, action, suspense - actual war... <br/><br/>I will stop here without spoiling any part of the film - This movie cant be described in words... Abseloutly amazing... best movie i have ever seen - A MUST SEE! although i doubt any true movie-fan would skip watching this movie..."

This movie is the only movie to have left me in awe, in shock, in sadness. On all levels this film was perfect. I do not know how historically accurate it may have been, but I know one thing. This is one of the most memorable films ever made, and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date. I am a proud Canadian citizen, but this film gave me a greater respect for what the Americans were trying to do in Europe. I used to protest the fact that they joined the war late, however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that war.<br/><br/>The film truly was an epic, an epic that will leave me to think for some time."

How can you take their comments seriously, when they don't know the good guys from the bad guys.

","I try to understand why people like this movie besides the realistic gore. I can't figure it out the story was not good at all in any way. also it makes the enemies seem heartless and idolizes america. What also makes me mad is the people who say it is the best war movie ever. I could name so many more that are better like the thin red line, paths to glory, glory, ran, Dr. Strangelove, lawrence of Arabia, the deer hunter, das boot, the killing fields, brave heart, stalag 17, and in my opinion the greatest apocalypse now.

","I would have given ""Saving Private Ryan"" a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during WWII (they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war). But don't get me wrong: watching the movie, you can literally feel the bullets hitting you. Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.<br/><br/>I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters themselves. Aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all Americans out to be good and all Germans out to be bad, the Americans are basically clichés. They're all wholesome, hard-working guys out to make something of themselves. Moreover, there's the wise-guy New Yorker and the cowpoke Southerner, and Pvt. Ryan comes from Iowa (read: America's heartland).<br/><br/>But otherwise, it's a very good movie, and it goes to show what an incredible director Steven Spielberg is (although I still wouldn't have given the movie Best Picture; I would have given that to ""Life is Beautiful""). Also starring Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti and Dennis Farina."

","From the invasions on Omaha Beach (D-Day), to the final battle in Ramelle, this movie was as action packed and graphic as possible. Anytime Spielberg and Hanks team up, it's pure gold. Especially this time. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire duration of this movie. If you're a war movie fan, I guarantee you that this will make the top of your list. This is as real as war can get on a TV screen. War movies completely changed after this film was released in 1998. It has influenced the film industry as much as any other movie out there. In my opinion, this is Spielberg's best work ever, as well as Hanks. There are so many realistic parts of this movie, it's insane. After all, it is based on a true story. People said that the D-Day scene was so accurate, it might as well had been real. When it comes down to it, this film is one of the most iconic films ever, and arguably the best war movie ever created."

"ironhorse_iv","9","5","8","6 June 2013"," This film is a masterpiece. A tribute to the greatest generation and those who serve during WWII.
","The fact that it didn't win Best Picture is outrageous. It was great from start to finish. The opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional. The music score by John Williams is amazing. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story of a mission following the D-day invasion. The movie starts Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. His mission to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him back to the United States so that it can save the family's bloodline and help softly the mother's grief. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore starts as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. I understand the everyman quality of the average soldier. There were also a lot of actors that you wouldn't have thought for once, playing soldiers as supporting characters such as Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and Paul Giamatti. Who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever. I like how the characters were written with everyday blue-collar Joes. It gives the movie realistic. They are brave while scare. Good, but also bit morally reprehensible. A great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a German Soldier. All of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free. It's toward the middle of the film, that the violence of the film dies down enough, to get a few character development. It was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here. Some people thinks that the movie glorified war or it's over patriotism. I think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war. In movies that glorify war, there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply don't represent the soldiers who fought in war. In Saving Private Ryan, the characters are down-to-earth-ordinary. This movie also shows that in war, there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive. It portrays war as what it is: violent and ugly. As pure hell. As for patriotism, I don't believe that the film is patriotism. There are scenes of American soldiers being as crude, cowardly, or just mean-spirited as some of the German's soldiers. I don't think the Germans are portray unfairly. About the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an American film presented to an American audience. Would it had been nice to see a British soldier in the film? Yes, but it wasn't needed in the film. The film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war, while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got. The film was balance between pro war and anti-war themes. Yes, there were a few historic accurates that wasn't corrected, but overall, many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. The first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the Normandy Invasion. The visuals are grainy, de-colorized, and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then, and since after Saving Private Ryan, many directors have used for their war films. The audio is astounding, and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film. Exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional, positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings. After this movie came out, I saw an interview with several D-Day survivors. They all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen. It was like they were there again. That is strong praise from someone who would know. Every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film. Show them how it really was. It's not what it is. Overall: It is a must-watch. It's a story of normal, average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it."

John Miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home. The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!<br/><br/>10/10!!!Highly Recommend"
"Strglove","3","5","8","2 August 1998"," Righteous, Embellishing, and slightly Jingoistic
","Any movie that opens with a lengthy shot of the American flag has got problems.<br/><br/>In general, I thought it superficial, poorly written and poorly directed. Spielberg has a penchant for thrusting his movies upon his viewers, spoon -feeding them morality in doses of banal righteousness. I personally don't go to the movies to be treated like a schoolkid and taught a lesson so elementary, vague, and though ultimately true, trite.<br/><br/>Those who see Saving Private Ryan as a revelatory view of war obviously slept through High School History. War is gruesome, war isn't fun, war sucks. Glad to see the truth Spielberg, but dizzying freehand camera shots, pointless music (the music sucked throughout), and timed successions of loud booms gave me more of a headache than visceral enlightenment. About 5 minutes into the D-Day scene, when the cacophony of camera shots and dead bodies reached its apogee, I asked myself:  ""Why did Spielberg put this in? Did he have any real reason except to embellish the gruesomeness of war? Does this really contribute to the movie?"" I found the answer to be no.<br/><br/>Then there's the plot and characters ... wait, what plot and characters? Here are 8(?) men meandering through French territory wondering why they are all such damn stereotypical and superficial characters. There's the bookworm, the Italian, the Southerner, the Jew, etc. In the end I can't feel very much for any of these characters  cause they're not even human to me; they're typecasts. Even Tom Hanks (who does a worthy job), remains distant and emotionally inaccessible (due to poor writing). (So we know that his hand shakes and he teaches English. BFD) Spielberg could take a lesson from, say, John Sayles, about character development.<br/><br/>Then there's the plot. From the title, I expected there to be more focus on Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the group wanders through Normandy and the hunt for Ryan becomes unimportant and adventitious. The movie's impetus is seriously lacking, and I accredit this to poor directorial focus. Spielberg had problems finding a point to direct the energy of the war to, and instead directed it towards some vague moral standard. Unlike, say, Apocalypse Now, where the search for Brando has a singular focus on him, the soldiers wander aimlessly and haphazardly stumble upon Ryan in the most obtuse and anticlimatic fashion possible. On their way they go through a perfectly crafted sine curve of battles and traumas, discoveries and enlighenments. And as soon as I saw Ted Danson I couldn't help but drift to place where everybody knows your name and guys in pasty blue uniforms named Cliff down Heneiekens. Now THAT'S poor focus.<br/><br/>In the end I could predict flatly what would happen. Yes, it's a true story, so Spielberg was limited, but the presentation was just too flat. The ending  is so utterly pitiful and righteous I wanted to puke. ""So, this is what the movie came down to?"" I thought as the American flag waved me goodbye. ""War is bad. America is good. Death is bad. Life is good. "" Drink Bud."
"gwbtoday","1","19","43","1 October 2008"," Amazing Stories and Kelly's Heroes in one movie.
","This movie is similar to the other Stephen Speilburg productions like ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers."" These productions focus too closely on the individual soldiers sentimental personal problems. Combat strategy and the historical accuracy of wartime is significantly diminished with the ""slice of life"" theme adopted here. Consequently, the poor screen writing matches the ""sentimental"" theme which is out of place for a wartime historical combat production. Saving Private Ryan was made using ideas from ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970)and an episode from ""Amazing Stories"" about D Day (Charlie Sean) and were put together to make a silly war fiction aka Saving Private Ryan. There is a scene in the movie where the squad of soldiers are seen casually walking in farmland of the French countryside near Carentan behind enemy lines (taken from Kelly's Heroes). The casual walk is grossly inaccurate to history. It would have been impossible to stroll in the open French farmland near Carentan as featured in private Ryan because the Germans had sophisticated defense lines or ""belts"" constructed everywhere and where machine gun nests and large caliber guns were often placed at several locations to intercept the same targets which proved very deadly for the allies. The Saving Private Ryan squad would have been spotted and dealt with very quickly. <br/><br/>The allies had to use combined operations with tanks, aircraft and artillery to destroy the sophisticated bunkers and dugouts the Germans constructed everywhere. The allies used high explosive shells to destroy enemy bunkers, cluster bombs, and special shells that would burst in the open air to kill soldiers caught in the open.<br/><br/>Operation ""Cobra"" scheduled for 24 July 1944 was delayed because of deteriorating weather for 25 July 1944. However, one squadron of US bombers which took off wasn't recalled. General McNair the most senior American General in Normandy and hundreds of US personnel were killed when the squadron bombed too close to the operation Cobra ""start lines."" <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a silly wartime fiction movie similar to ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" where there is too much emphasis with the soldiers sentimental personal problems. The combat scenes recreated by Stephen Speilburg are devoid of combat strategy and historical accuracy. The combat scenes in Saving Private Ryan are just slugging matches. I would prefer to have seen Jerry Bruckheimers productions of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brother"" and ""The Pacific."""
"Chrysanthepop","Null","8","15","29 December 2008"," Band Of Brothers
","After 'Schindler's List' and 'Amistad', Spielberg once again takes us to a dark path in one of his best works, 'Saving Private Ryan' (set during WWII, D-Day). He went through great lengths to make the film historically accurate. Though the movie is fiction, much of it is based on real history. At the same time, he manages to give the film a soul.<br/><br/>It is not just historical events, blood, gore, massacre, bomb blasts and firearms, but the viewer genuinely cares about the characters and roots for the platoon section to make it and feels sadness by the horrible death of each soldier. Alongside the director and writer, credit goes to the actors for displaying a brotherhood where these ordinary men, strangers to each other, are brought together by a very unusual circumstance. War can have a dehumanizing effect where people tend to get carried away and conflicts arise between the soldiers. We see the men get more frustrated as their hope slips away every time they think they are near to finding Ryan when reality says otherwise. But, these men cope with it and move on further.<br/><br/>In a particular scene when Private Reiben is about to walk away, Miller for the first time reveals his identity. His 'unknown' identity had given rise to a lot of curiosity among his soldiers but upon hearing that he was an ordinary school teacher, Reiben is able to relate to that and he stays. From then on, he sees Miller differently. Likewise with Ryan and Miller and Reiben and Ryan (in one small subtle scene).<br/><br/>There are two beautiful scenes: one takes place during a night, when the soldiers are chatting and they end up talking about their mothers. In this scene Wade tells his story as he slowly reveals how he wished he had spent more time with his mother. The next day his brutal death devastates the soldiers fueling their frustration while they are forced to stay in control. Another wonderful scene is when an Edith Piaf song plays on the radio. Upham translates the lyrics and this amuses the soldiers and they are drawn into the song allowing themselves a moment of calmness. It is such scenes that reveal the depth of these strong characters.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks arguably leads the cast as Captain Miller who is like the elder brother of the band. This is one of his most restrained performances and he is great. But, his supporting cast members that include: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and especially Giovanni Ribisi are at least equally excellent. Paul Giamatti makes a strong appearance. Even Vin Diesel, whom I normally do not like, shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small role.<br/><br/>Spielberg makes remarkable use of Kaminski's cinematography, whether it is long shots, jump cuts or various angles. Kahn's editing is smooth. Williams's soundtrack fits the film. The washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceral.<br/><br/>For me it was an overwhelming experience because I was so drawn into it. Many have criticized Spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewer's emotion. Well, I prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a magnificent film. It's one of the best and my favourite of its genre."
"Vampyroteuthis","5","8","15","11 July 2008"," Decent Action Film But Nothing Else
","When I first heard of Saving Private Ryan I was very exited since all my friends said it was an awesome and realistic war film. The truth was far from that. The first 5 minutes of the movie were excellent but it was all downfall after that, since the ""storyline"" doesn't make any sense at all why in god's name would the U.S Army send a small group of Soldiers after a single soldier who is lost possibly behind enemy lines possibly KIA or Captured. The whole operation would be a total waste of men and equipment. Also the Rangers did not operate in such small groups on special missions and the lack of any intelligence of Ryan's whereabouts would make the operation a waste of time, also the Germans don't seem to have any sort of intellgence this kissed good bye to realism alongside the ""10 Dead Germans to 1Dead American"" rule. When an American is hit he dies usually slowly and dramaticly saying something like ""Take this letter to my mother "" etc etc, when the enemy dies quick and is rarely or never injured. The portrayal of the enemy is ridiculous. The enemy doesen't have a face, a personality or any feelings the enemy is just a sadistic and evil killing machine. Saving Private Ryan does not differ from old propaganda films made during and slightly after the war. The reason I gave it a 5 was that it had some decent action in it but movie is overwhelmed with Spielberg's/Americans propaganda. I would not call this movie realistic under any circumstances. In short: <br/><br/>Good : <br/><br/>-First 5 minutes on the Beach <br/><br/>-Some good action scenes <br/><br/>Bad: -Propaganda <br/><br/>-Pointless Storyline"
"lee_a_scott","7","8","15","3 November 2007"," Not as great as you've heard
","When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older)."

This movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture.

","No movie will ever stand up to the ranks over Saving Private Ryan. Just wow. Thats really all I can say. Flawless special affects, definitely look real. No other war movie goes into this much detail to a battle scene. I can feel for the souls of those lost, and sorrow for that poor guy with intestines hanging out screaming, ''Momma!'' You think thats so typical, but what would you scream when you were in his position? ''Crayola Crayons! Ahhhhhh!'' But seriously I sat on my couch staring at the screen 5 minutes after the credits were over. Shocked that the main character was killed. But I liked it. Mostly everyone died trying to save PVT. Ryan except wimpy clumsy Umpham (sp?) and Reiben which was a little surprising but made sense. The only flaw is that if you were a Captain in the US Army you would NOT blindfold the enemy and have him walk to somebody finds him. 1) He could slip the blindfold off and run in the direction of a German platoon. 2) He may come back to haunt you.<br/><br/>And if you just go out there and buy the movie (worth every penny, simply a classic!) and watch it you'll know what I mean. Thats the only flaw I know of, but it does'nt hurt the way I feel about the movie. I just get this vibe that everything that happened in the movie just feels right, and is perfect the way it unfolded. Saving Private Ryan will remain in my heart forever. As well as millions of other. This is Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks at their best. (and everyone else who had to do with the slightest bit of this movie."

","This was one of the first war movies that i've seen, and it has to be one of the best. Steven Spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece. The movie is accurate,although there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is. From the beginning of the film, Spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on Omaha beach, a view of the whole allied advance on Normandy, once the Axis trenches and bunkers have been taken. The way Spielberg captivates each character within one another, and yet be different from one another is superb. I think Steve Spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship, which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers. The cinematography has to be credited, and the background music is fitting for such a film, thats why i gave it 10."

","In reading through the comments made on this page, I realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be (as people often do).  However, here's how I feel the movie was intended, and why I say that this is by far the greatest war movie, and one of the greatest movies of any genre. The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable. That's exactly what Spielberg wanted. First, the characters.  They were _intended_ to be stereotypical.  How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical?  Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people.  The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.<br/><br/>Second, the plot.  The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man.  He wasn't.  He was everyone.  Every person that was sitting in that theater.  Every person that has ever been a part of this country.   When he tells Ryan to ""Earn this"", he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident.  It took normal men (a school-teacher, for instance) to make sure that we could someday go on IMDB after seeing a movie and spout our opinions. He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given. So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not.  And they fought so that I could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion. Thank God."

"kgprophet","9","4","6","3 June 2019"," A Timeless Piece of Filmmaking
","I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.<br/><br/>These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.<br/><br/>There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.<br/><br/>The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank a soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.<br/><br/>Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.<br/><br/>The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.<br/><br/>I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps ""Patton"", but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as ""Apocalypse Now"" is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war."
"imseeg","10","4","6","28 September 2018"," Gets more impressive every time I see it. The most intense true to life depiction of combat ever recorded on the silver screen. Steven Spielberg masterpiece!
","Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Tom Hanks most magnificent performance. Winner of 5 Oscars and more than 70 other prizes worldwide. Unprecedented true to life combat photography. Dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those American soldiers who died fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. This is THE ultimate depiction of D-Day when the Americans freed western Europe. What a tragic and bleak, yet glorious epic war classic!<br/><br/>The story is literally about the rescuing behind enemy lines of an American soldier called Ryan, played by Matt Damon in a small supporting role. Tom Hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers, among which are Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Their journey to find and rescue private Ryan is a long, bleak and bloody one, in which soldiers are normal people with nervous breakdowns who go mental when confronted with so much cruel violence. This is not a gung ho funny action movie, this is how it really could have happened, with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally, when they are in combat.<br/><br/>The photography is stunning. Like I have never seen it before. Seen this movie many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography. Even if you might not like the story, which I would find hard to believe, the action photography on itself is worthy of an Oscar, which it deservedly got.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is dark and glorious. The sound effects were sonically blasting my ears when the tanks started rolling and the mortar shells were exploding all around. Editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen. I can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made, but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at it's core. This movie touches me profoundly. Only a few times during the last 40 years, have I ever been this fascinated by a war movie. Incredibly impressive!"

","The 1998 movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the all-time great war movies. While much of the movie is a fictional account, the premise behind Capt. Miller's mission is based on a true story. That is the story of the Niland brothers - Edward, Preston, Robert, and Frederick - from Tonawanda, New York.<br/><br/>The two middle brothers, Preston and Robert, had enlisted prior to the beginning of the War. After America entered the war the oldest, Edward, and youngest, Frederick, known as Fritz to his friends, joined up in November 1942. Because of the tragedy of the Sullivan brothers aboard the USS Juneau earlier that year, the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the Army. Edward became an enlisted pilot, with the rank of Technical Sergeant, of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying in the Burma-India-China theatre. Preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to Company C, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. Robert and Fritz both became paratroopers. Robert served with Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Fritz joined Company H, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. U.S. Army paratroopers are dropped near Grave, Netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier. This was the beginning of Operation Market Garden during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied losses. As fate would have it, three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland Europe.However, before the brothers could start their ""Great Crusade"" to liberate Europe, Edward was shot down somewhere over Burma. He was listed as Missing in Action, but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time, especially if he had fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Then, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Robert and Fritz joined over 23,000 Allied paratroopers in cracking Fortress Europe. Although Fritz's unit, 3rd Battalion, 501st PIR, was supposed to be the division reserve, the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups. These forces were able to secure vital causeways, bridges, and locks allowing the 4th Infantry Division, and Niland brother Preston, to exit Utah beach later that day. U.S. Soldiers of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, move out over the seawall on Utah Beach after coming ashore. Other troops are resting behind the concrete wall. Elsewhere, Robert Niland had landed outside of Ste. Mere-Eglise with the rest of the 505th as part of Mission Boston. After the 3rd Battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning, the 2ndBattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter. When a strong German counter-attack came from the south, Robert Niland and the rest of D Company's 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called Neuville. When two companies of Germans came at their position, they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south. When the position became untenable, Robert Niland, along with two other paratroopers, volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoon's retreat toward Ste. Mere-Eglise.While manning a machine gun in the face of the German onslaught, Robert Niland was killed in action. That very same morning, Lt. Preston Niland led his men onto the shores of Utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th Infantry Division on Utah beach, the battles beyond would be much tougher. Despite having made if off the beaches, the men of the 4th Infantry Division still had numerous gun batteries of Hitler's Atlantic Wall to clear. The task of capturing the Crisbecq battery, which had already sunk the destroyer USS Corry, fell to Lt. Niland and his men. On June 7, Niland led his men against the German position. During the heavy fighting Niland fell mortally wounded. The rest of his unit was repulsed. The battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th Infantry Division. The Niland brothers' parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time. Their only condolence was a letter from Fritz informing them that ""Dad's Spanish-American War stories are going to have to take a backseat when I get home. ""Fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers. When the War Department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return Fritz Niland to the United States. That task fell to the regimental Chaplin, Father Francis Sampson. Sampson located Fritz, who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home. Returning to the United States in 1944, Fritz served for the remainder of the war as an MP in New York.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This article was written by James Elphick and originally appeared on WeAreTheMighty.com"

","It'd be implausible to think that anyone who wasn't involved in World War 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time. Over the years we've had countless documentaries, novels, movies, games and TV series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the World War that claimed millions upon millions of lives, and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is Steven Spielberg's incredible Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>A film unlike anything Spielberg had made before or has made since, Ryan, with it's as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of Normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of Ramelle, is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt power.<br/><br/>Spielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of film-making wizards. Employing the services of now famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the screen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at its disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.<br/><br/>All around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was led by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man Captain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's religiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's gruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's jittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt Damon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of Bryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and even a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.<br/><br/>Filled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.<br/><br/>A deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the greatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.<br/><br/>5 greased up socks out of 5"
"parkerhaller","10","4","6","8 December 2013"," Most realistic war movie I've ever seen
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Saving Private Ryan is about a captain in the US army during World War II, who must risk him and his men's lives to rescue a soldier who has lost his three brothers. Growing up I was so fascinated with WW2. I read about all aspects of it, so I had a pretty good idea of the horrors of combat. But I got a very clear look at war with this movie. <br/><br/>The 20 minute opening of US soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy, is outstanding. Steven Spielberg captures every bit of gore and and violence, with young boys crying for there mother, soldiers losing their limbs, men having to muster every ounce of courage to survive the hell that is war. With amazing cinematography and sound that puts the audience right in the battlefield, we are shown how war can make even the manliest man weep like a child and what each soldier believes in and what they fight for. <br/><br/>For me there are a few scenes that make the movie great. Obliviously the beach scene is one of them. After Wade dies from the machine gun nest, there is one German soldier who survives, and the men let out there hate and rage on him. Forgetting what is the right thing to do, the men have been so damaged by combat they then fight with one another whether letting the German go or not. <br/><br/>The other scene is in the last battle, Upham is responsible for bringing ammo to Mellish, but Upham is so frozen with fear. And when Mellish is fighting hand to hand with a German, Upham is outside and able to save Mellish, but stays on the staircase crying, and when Mellish is dead, the German wouldn't even kill Upham. This movie does a flawless in showing the terrible effects war has on humans. This movie is so realistic, that when it was released in theaters, the army had to create a hotline for war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder.......convinced?<br/><br/>10/10"
"MrsRainbow","Null","4","6","2 March 1999"," amazing battle scenes, subpar story
","I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.<br/><br/>I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.<br/><br/>(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).<br/><br/>It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.<br/><br/>There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time."
"j30bell","5","10","20","2 February 2005"," Dirty Dozen for the 90s
","There was a time when Spielberg felt the film-making fraternity had overlooked him. Those days may be over, but the reasons why it happened, sadly, are not. The lesson seems to be, make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweight.<br/><br/>The sad fact is that Schindler's List is (in my opinion) a very good film, but not a great one  it is too heavy handed. I am in a minority. Likewise, bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography (which was not part of the original Spielberg grand plan) and transform a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal war-is-naughty-but-devilishly-exciting flick into a major cinematic event.<br/><br/>Can someone who loves this film as Art (I choose capitals for its ironic effect) explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games? Were Spielberg's motives so noble, so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his ""war-is-naughty"" message to the fans of first person shoot-em-ups? Now you may argue that it is hardly Spielberg's job to worry about such things. This may be true  but you have to wonder why it was that Saving Private Ryan is so eminently suited to such a transfer. It is difficult, for example, to anticipate a Thin Red Line or Apocalypse now video game. It would also difficult to paste scenes from Thin Red Line onto, say, Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon coming out of the sun, for example) and not be able to spot the difference.<br/><br/>At best Saving Private Ryan is a lukewarm, melodramatic, overly sentimental paean to good ole America, good ole family and the importance of killing nasty Germans before they kill you. The beach landing is extraordinary  I'm not denying it. But pardon me if I'm holding out for something more subtle. 5½ /10"

","The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which, if you know anything about The 'Berg's intention for the film, was not the point. This movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as ""one of the best war movies ever made"". Imagine my disgust when I saw it...<br/><br/>The opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the action/horror, but it relies solely on Spielberg's ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewing.<br/><br/>Personally, I knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on. To be precise, I knew it when, in the midst of this mind-blowing battle sequence, Spielberg thought it'd be fun to throw in a joke about Sizemore being Hanks' mother.<br/><br/>WHY?!? He had everyone on the edge of their seat (literally, I remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped) and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking JOKE?!?<br/><br/>From here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage, as we are dragged through a war-is-hell-by-numbers affair. Never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate, Spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising, Ted Danson trying to be serious (yes, Ted Danson), a token ""death of the youngest soldier"" tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue I have ever suffered, which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of two-dimensional characters ever assembled for a movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the premise; a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol' compassionate Uncle Sam thinks the titular soldier's poor Ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons. Is this a joke?!?<br/><br/>""But it's a true story"" I hear you cry. Wrongo! It may have been inspired by a true story, but that doesn't mean that anything beyond the name James Ryan actually existed. The words ""inspired by a true story"" don't mean a thing these days and, let us not forget, this is Spielberg.<br/><br/>Let us not forget indeed, as Stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces, even if they are overlong, predictable, and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it. The final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious, A-Team style montage that precedes it, in which we see our apple-pie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village, before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty Germans.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against Terrence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line', and subsequently taking the two Oscars which by right belonged to the latter (Best Director and Best Cinematography).<br/><br/>'Ryan's Privates' pales in comparison not just to Mallick's film (as well as to Spielberg's other ""classic"" manipulative-therapy session, 'ET') but to almost every war movie I have seen ('Cross of Iron', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'All Quite on the Wetsern Front'), even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously ('Mash', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Eagle Has Landed'). One great battle scene does not a great war movie make, but try telling the Academy that.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Don't expect more than a sub-par Spielberg offering and you won't be disappointed.

There was no point to a lot of things in this film. Sure this film was realistic, but I could care less about realism as long as the rest makes sense. There were scenes in this movie that came out of nowhere for no reason. Besides a bunch of nonsense scenes, this movie has a plot that drove me insane. The U.S. government risks the lives of 8 men to save one so that his mother won't be too depressed.

America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.<br/><br/>I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.<br/><br/>Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.<br/><br/>
The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end."

There was even a very appropriate moment of black comedy when the soldiers shoot the surrendering Germans, but not five minutes later they introduce clumsy Private Comic Relief and for me the movie was over. Everything from then on seemed a pale cliché of every other war movie I've ever seen, and I haven't seen all that many. Ooh the stars went through boot camp! Was I the only one who noticed how loud (obnoxious) and unorganized the troops searching for Private Ryan were? They would have all been dead in seconds. Oh yeah, very realistic!"
"Blondo","4","11","23","28 August 1999"," I enjoyed moments of this film
","I don't think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is  just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed  I found the chaos comparable to the scene in `Platoon' where they assault the V.C. bunkerhowever, it does not (any part of the movie, in my mind) match up the finale of Platoon, in which one is so confused, your heart pounds, and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in Private Ryan.<br/><br/>What really got to me about this film, were several things thoughfirst and foremost, is the `dumb German' syndrome, which leaves me with a bias feeling.  Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with almost twenty German's firing at them?<br/><br/>Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mineor hit by a grenadeso on, so on.  I won't pretend to be a war-vet, or someone who's witnessed this, but it seems unlikely to me.  However, I'll stress my own ignorance, and say `don't take my word for it.'<br/><br/>All in all, I found it to be a worthy action flick  comparable, in my mind, to `The Big Red one.'  It has sad moments, and moments of brutality, but in the end, just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequences.<br/><br/>As a sidenote, I think that the best ww2 films ever made are ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" two films that don't deal heaviliy with combat (TTRL more so).  Saving Private Ryan tried just a little to hard to force feed it.  I recomend all of these films, but for your knowledge, those are to me, the best."

However the dialogue is not up to scratch in some areas particularly when the band of soldiers first set out to find Ryan, its very banal. A major problem i had with the film (and it is a fairly big one) is the nauseating patriotism that emanates from it. This seems to be a problem with others here as well, it's just irritating and spoils the whole movie for me, it's hard to ignore it because it is felt throughout the movie, in some parts more than in others, especially at the end there where the American planes bomb the German positions and the viewer once again has America to thank for saving the day.

","Read dedjim's comments on this movie. His are the best by far. I'm sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie review.<br/><br/>This was a great movie about sacrifice, courage, loss, violence, revenge, folly, and most of all the strength of character it took (and takes) to defeat evil. The young people of that time defeated fascism (and later communism). Their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war. This reality explains much about the differences between the generations. Theirs was one of stoicism. The ones that followed were less mature, and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective - I say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bents.<br/><br/>This movie is a more accurate ""experience"" of WW2 than most movies made on the subject. My next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humor-filled men I have ever known. He never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated WW2 bomber pilot. But he was. He came from a humble background; was wounded in the war; lost many friends in the war; and met his future wife (Army nurse) during the war. Then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country, he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world. I came to know him better after his death by talking to his family about the experiences he went thru during the turning point in history known as WW2.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece made by one of the masters in Hollywood."

","Overall this movie was well made. I am not going to sit here and act like I know what happened over there, because I don't. This movie shows what the war was like through the eyes of the soldiers who fought in it. It is a vivid and graphic portrayal of war during World War 2. The movie is intense, but is important to watch. The cast does a great job. They put this feeling on you that is hard to describe. In my opinion this is one Spielberg's best films. He does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men, the struggle for survival. He also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter. This is one of my favorite movies because of the action, plot, and acting. At the end of this film you might feel sad, but not disturbed. This film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country I live in. It also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace. If you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies, I highly recommend this masterpiece."

","I have to agree, this is really good historical fiction, one note however... there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a Yen-yang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet, which would be the 29th Infantry Division (a National Guard Unit), instead of either a diamond with a #2 (2nd Rangers, which we saw) or a #5 (which we didn't see).  As far as I can find, only the 2nd and 5th Rangers were in the first wave of the assault, led by then LTC James Earl Rudder, and thus there should have been no 29th Inf, at least not in the first wave.  A couple of really good books on the subject is ""Rudder's Rangers : The True Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion D-Day Combat Action"" and ""The Liberation of Pointe Du Hoc : The 2nd Rangers at Normandy, June 6-8, 1944""  One thing that would probably suprise most people is that LTC Rudder came onshore with his men, and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach, and that he lived through it.  Of course, he was a Texas Aggie, that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed.  Read the books, you'll never watch SPR the same way again."
"tfrizzell","Null","7","13","24 June 2000"," Along With ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg's Best
","Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department.  The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998.  Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture.  Tom Hanks is also excellent.  He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better).  In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever.  All in all ""Saving Private Ryan"" is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s.  It's a film that will be remembered for decades to come.  5 stars out of 5."

","Having read 'All Quite on the Western Front' just before seeing this movie, I found a sour taste in my mouth while watching.  To tell a story that so clearly dehumanizes the enemy in this day and age is shameful.  It is, to me, propaganda.  Despite fighting for the side of the Nazis, most German soldiers were just people.  We proud Americans were just as evil and just as exploited during Vietnam.  Until people stop believing that 'we' are justified the holocausts will continue.

But unlike FOOF which does have some truth behind it, this one looks like it was made up as they went along. Tom Hanks is OK in what basically is a no-name actors movie.

(Why else does he churn out rubbish like Jurassic Park II? I'll tell you why - money.)<br/><br/>SPR is dishonest, silly and trite, an insult to the men who died in the real D-Day landings.  The story premise, as others here have pointed out, is risible, the framing device unnecessary and stupidly sentimental.  How anybody over the age of 9 can rate this film higher than genuine masterpieces such as Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front or Cross of Iron is beyond me.

"colinmetcalfe","5","6","11","10 May 2017"," Weak plot and uninspired characterisations betrays special effects and cinematography
","I've been put off writing this review for many years because I feared it would turn out to be a negative pile of invective directed against a man whose work I have largely admired for many years. Now though I've mellowed and with the film coming up to 20 years old and there being already more than 2000 reviews already on this website I'm confident nobody is going to waste time reading this review anyway.<br/><br/>So, what can you say about the first 25 minutes? Probably the finest piece of action film making ever. This opening ruined every war film I saw before and every war film I've seen since; nothing comes close (apart from BoB of course). Exceptional! And for me that is the strange thing about this film – part of it fills me with rapture, while other parts make me cringe and irritated.<br/><br/>But let's get onto the story. Well I'm no military expert but sending a handful of men, some of them high value experienced soldiers, out into the French countryside to find a Unit with a certain individual in it – well I'm not sure I buy it. No, the story is weak and disappoints, as do the over familiar characterisations.<br/><br/>Alright then we move onto the inevitable, and the source of all the carping from all the other non-US reviewers of this film - the lack of representatives from other allied nations. Well the answer the great man gave is very much the same as many defenders of this film provide on this website – that this is a war film concentrating on the US sectors and their German adversaries. Sounds reasonable enough – doesn't it? It's also sound film making as well as keeping it simple ensures audiences don't get confused with all those different uniforms and dodgy accents.<br/><br/>The only problem, well only if historical accuracy of real events bothers you, is that Historians tell us the demarcation between the sectors wasn't that clear cut. As James Holland of CNN states by quoting the actual resources provided respectively by the US and the British, if you were a GI there was a very good chance you would leave the English coast in a British Royal Naval vessel. You would more than likely transfer into a British Royal Naval Landing craft. If you needed air support it would be almost definitely provided by the British Royal Air Force or Royal Canadian Air Force. While the night time air drops apparently deposited paratroopers all over the place and not necessarily where they should be. (Remember, this was the reason given for not knowing where Ryan was.) The statistics tell us this, these are facts. So, although it is possible a 'Yank' could fail to encounter a 'Limey', 'Canook', or 'Free French' on June 6th 1944, it would be very unlikely.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of an interview the great man did to promote the film in the UK for the BBC. When he was challenged about this point he gave the example of 'The Dambusters' as a British war film that just concentrated on the double header of Brits versus Germans. Sorry 'Steve' not a great example. Unfortunately the young interviewer either didn't know his war films or didn't fancy irritating his esteemed interviewee.<br/><br/>The Dambusters features Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, and Rhodesians along with the English/Welsh/Scots/Irish. There's a scene where they are selecting crews for the mission when Colin Todd, as Guy Gibson, exclaims: ""Hang on, don't forget the English!"" Even the jingoistic extravaganza that was the 1969 film 'The Battle of Britain' included a Polish fighter squadron in recognition of the brave and resolute contribution they made to the defence of the UK.<br/><br/>There is also a plot problem with omitting allies from the story in that you have nobody to portray as inferior, incompetent, and cowardly (tick as appropriate) to compare with your own brave square jawed heroes (Think: The Hurt Locker and those useless Brit mercenaries). You don't want your enemy appearing pathetic, evil yes, but they have to be a worthwhile foe to legitimise the struggle towards victory. So this film tries to get around this restriction by including a dig at the British General Montgomery, the overall planner of Operation Overlord (D-Day), but not a man universally popular even within his own nation.<br/><br/>While it is entirely realistic that troops from one Army criticise the performance of another the way it is done here – out of the blue exposition and with no supporting evidence, exposes this line for what it actually is: a cheap shot.<br/><br/>So perhaps these facts explain why many reviewers have been disappointed about others nations' exclusion. In order to allow US audiences to identify with the film, and others around the world (Some French and Germans both have their own reasons for depreciating the role of the British, but that's another contentious point!), history has been bent for commercial purposes to produce what looks to some (including me), a mean spirited and self-centred production.<br/><br/>This film gets so many things right, and gets them excellently 'right' so the areas where they get things wrong stand out as really, really wrong; and that is the chief problem with this film. It goes to great trouble and expense to present realistic events and situations for certain parts of the film, but in other parts it is lazy and dismissive.<br/><br/>I wonder if Mr Spielberg was ever the slightest bit bothered by this international hoo-hah? I wonder on cold winter evenings when he's at home polishing his 'Knight of the British Empire Medal' for taking advantage of the lower production costs in the UK, erm I mean services to the British film industry, he feels the slightest bit guilty. Of course not, that is a ridiculous image; cast it from your minds immediately. He will have a professional come in and polish all of his awards!"

","""Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage,"" according to the film's official synopsis.<br/><br/>Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called ""The Greatest Generation""; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.<br/><br/>Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's ""Ryan"" (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the ""war mother"" dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.<br/><br/>Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' ""Miller"" in his final words to student Damon's ""Ryan""; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual ""Upham"" character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.<br/><br/>It's tough to rank performances in an ""ensemble acting"" film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor ""Wade"" to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to ""Mama"". Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's ""Horvath"" serves as the ""voice"" of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line (""Except this time, the mission is a man"").<br/><br/>Spielberg's use of ""flashback"" is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term ""gut-wrenching decision."" <br/><br/>********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi"

","I have read most of the comments about SPR and I must say I agree with those who resent and loathe the film. I went to see it last week, and I was terribly disappointed. I was disappointed mainly because of the: 1. The sentimental awkward frame 2. The vomit-inducing score 3.Rotten dialog 4. Moral hypocrisy <br/><br/>But most of all I was disappointed by the predictability of the plot. We all know from the beginning who will die and how. It is no surprise that Tom Sizemore.. dies last followed by Hanks..maybe this is the love-story of the film? When the best buddy dies Hanks literally throws himself at the bullets. American films don't really need women basically it's all about bonding in the forceful wilderness.. if it isn't Indians it's Germans and the rest of the world doesn't exist not even in Europe.<br/><br/>I know these comments may be a trifle vengeful or sarcastic but I love movies I am not one of those freaks who only watch French films and thinks everything else is crap.But I HATE to be disappointed when I've had such great expectations. I totally agree with the comment on the motivations of the geek character shooting the runaway German. What was that all about? Wasn't the point of his release to show that the geek was more humane than the rest of them? The knife scene seems rather erotized to me two men so close to death(and not the little one I may add)and penetration, whispering ..slowly, slowly in German. I find this extremely disturbing where does this fit in? I don't have much else to say but I have lost my faith in Spielberg's abilities(What's the point of having a sniper citing from the bible?)As far as I am concerned he hasn't made a thrilling scene since Dreyfuss built that mountain in his living room in close encounter, and that moment is far more realistic than any scene in SPR !!!! What is the difference between this film and other violent films that earn money? The plot structure is exactly the same, the characters are the same, the music is the same. (The moral is the same pasted nicely to a waving American flag) The only difference is that something similar (so realistic...)happened in the past. If people can become wealthy this way I have given my support to Spielberg's bank account for the very last time. The best war film ever made is still STALINGRAD!!!!!!!!!!!

But I can't stomach the idea of another generation of people following their twisted view, so here goes...<br/><br/>No matter how much you want to stoke your own ego, there is no way that you can realistically equate the men who fought and died in WW2 to yourselves. Give up.  This film is a terrible blow to our veterans.<br/><br/>Spielberg tries to make the soldiers seem like they're the same as you and me, but they weren't.  All of the introspective musings in this film would make you think that these guys returned home after the war and started discussing Sartres in their local coffeehouse.  These are 40's people who are portrayed thinking like 90's people.  At least in ""Thin Red Line"", the film made no effort to portray itself as a true-to-life salute to those soldiers.  ""Thin Red Line"" was a juxtaposition of a WW2 backdrop with Vietnam-era sentiments, and it made to portent of being anything else.<br/><br/>The WW2 generation didn't feel this ridiculous desire to explore their feelings and share them to the point of fault.  They didn't have to connect to their fellows on some mystical, spiritual level.  The entire war did not revolve around them as individuals, nor did they feel the need to ponder some existential connection to the war around them.<br/><br/>This film is simply another attempt by the baby-boomer generation to ""prove"" that they are as good as any other generation before them.  This is their self-centered mythos.  If a film actually showed the superior qualities of these American soldiers, it would destroy that myth.  In truth, the American people felt a duty to their country back then.  And they did not feel the need to wax philosophic at every turn in some attempt to justify the world's existence in the face of how ""inconvenient"" it may have been to their own selves.  This contemporary psycho-babble had no place in their lives, and Spielberg had no right to put it there.<br/><br/>As for the characters who don't partake of this attitude, they are so paper thin that they add nothing to the film except to exacerbate the problem by making the mystics and coffeehouse types seem the more realistic.<br/><br/>If you have any respect for America, pass this film by."

The only appearances from other nationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a back-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough diamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a tear-jerking moment of sadness.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat silly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks. I really don't understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousness.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the movie was switched off. None the less, I would recommend viewing this film, as its qualities do outshine the flaws."
"crossfire-7","7","5","9","6 December 2006"," Excellent combat scenes - unrealistic dialogue
","I wish I could view this movie like the average moviegoer. In that case, I would probably have given it higher marks. However, I was in the Army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely, no, impossible, to have been said in real life.<br/><br/>The hierarchy in the service is very clear: privates do not contradict, interrupt, defy, or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film. I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy. The scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he is searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with Matt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believe.<br/><br/>The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against shooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some of the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45 caliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate. The scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his .45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle. <br/><br/>The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also didn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome weapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short volley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest of the GIs after that.<br/><br/>The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs curse up a storm. These guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome. Platoon gave a much more accurate account of how GIs actually behave.<br/><br/>These criticisms aside, the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer."

","Spielberg mines a sullied gem with this bloody classic. A family film, I say, a demonstration of brotherhood and integrity. For me the decision to seek Private Ryan based on the mother's loss simultaneously undermines and glorifies the honour of war. And it is in this background that Hanks delivers a compelling performance worthy of many rewatches.<br/><br/>The violence in this film is stark. So many examples you can think of - from the escaped German prisoner's revenge, to the sockbomb victim - show the arbitrary nature of violence. But the quieter moments between are tender and contemplative - Fubar anyone? Not a realist film, like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, but art to provoke, like Jar Head and Apocalypse Now."

In the overwrought, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg supplies his patented boyish sense of wonder; something, I believe, is out of place in a genre that is often appropriately somber.

"mdenvee","1","13","32","28 June 2009"," Skip Private Ryan and watch Band of Brothers!!
","After reading some of the 'immaculate' appraisals of this film, I am compelled to explain WHY this film sucks. Sadly, these days there is a declining number of people who can properly and objectively evaluate movies just as there are less and less movies worth evaluation. First, this movie DID NOT win Best Picture. Why? For a WWII epic from Spielberg with this Hollywood cast, unlimited budget, and the notoriety, it speaks volumes about the movie itself that it did not win. The movie had many aspects which merited praise. But far more of it deserved our disdain and disappointment. It is a shame that so few movie viewers can observe the following egregious flaws in a film trumpeted by most here as 'the best war film ever'. First, let me say that the film had only ONE redeeming quality- that of the battle scenes. Very impressive in every way. That's it. That's all. It's all downhill from here. The main failure of this film lies in the fact that it does NOT draw in the audience. There is NO cohesion of characters, zero empathy. I did not care at all about any of the soldiers. Why? Mainly because they were all well-known actors stupidly picked by Spielberg, and there were LOTS of them- just read the cast of actors. This is a huge distraction. I cannot feel the soldiers' pain and grief when they are ALL actors I've seen in movies and TV shows. What a STUPID, boneheaded, amateur mistake by Spielberg. Every scene in the movie has a another actor I know pretty well and whose personalities distract me. Further, all the actors seemed like they did not 'fit' in the 1940s era. They seemed too modern. Too anachronistic. They used too many curse words (which were not used in those days, at least to that degree) and were really 'cheesy'. They all seemed like actors, NOT real soldiers- AND cheesy BAD actors at that. After watching Band of Brothers, one can really identify with the characters, all the characters not just the 'band'. But in Ryan, there is literally ZERO compatibility with the actors. They didn't 'flow' together like fellow soldiers- all seemed to be out of place- hamming up the screen; too much for viewers to take in. Again, the fact that they are ALL well-known actors (and the cameos by Ted Danson and others made it really Hollywoodish and corny). Essentially, I just didn't care remotely about any of the actors- simple. Another annoyance were Hollywood 'touches' like the cheesy prayer the sniper man made every time he aimed for a shot or the annoying Jewish remarks actor/comedian Goldberg made throughout or Diesel's tough-guy mantra, or Tom Hanks' continuous confused 'look'. Spielberg also displayed a disproportionate amount of anti-German efforts. He made typical German soldiers (not the SS) out to be vicious monsters, a lot of which might be true, but the bias was very distracting in the movie. Seeing a freed German soldier return to kill Tom Hanks (the one who freed him) as well as the German who mercilessly and VERY slowly with a knife pierced the only Jewish solider's heart as he begged for mercy and cried...was a very excessive and blatant anti-German effort by Jewish Spielberg- upsetting mostly because it changed the tone of the movie in a very obvious way. Anyway, the entire movie needed more development and the characters (each of them) were severely miscast. It is an obvious Hollywood production which lacks authenticity NOT in the action and special effects, BUT in something far more important in ANY film---plot, script, good acting, and empathy. Private Ryan misses the boat. Strongly recommended is Band of Brothers. Instead of cheesy Tom Hanks acting in it, he directs and does a brilliant job. The series is addictive and priceless...and it makes Private Ryan look like a high school production- thank God the Oscars had the courage to deny it Best Picture. But not enough courage to deny Spielberg Best Director- they wouldn't dare do that. LOL. 'nuff said."
"mol4_99","Null","6","12","27 April 2000"," SPIELBERG SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!
","Our veterans of WW2 should definitely be honored. In fact, for what they did, we can never thank them enough. They deserve parades, memorials, and everything else you can name. Unfortunately, Spielberg exploits our veterans.<br/><br/>Instead of giving us an honest story, SPR paints our military as father-like and loving. The only true reason why the military would go out on a limb to save a person like Ryan is because if the story of his dead brothers reaches the public and the military manages to rescue the last Ryan brother, they can pat themselves on the shoulder and all the newspapers in the USA will be swayed into making propaganda articles of how loving the military is. In reality, the army views a soldier as nothing more than a tool for winning wars. SPOILER ALERT And why were the German troops not humanized? The Steamboat Willie character was shown as a human at first, but later on he comes back and kills the Jewish soldier in an awfully blatant  scene and later on kills Captain Miller. I have news for you people who loved this movie...THE GERMANS WHO FOUGHT IN WW2 WERE NOT NAZIS!!! Hitler and his Nazis took control of Germany and took control of the German army, navy, and air force. Just because Franklin Roosevelt was a democrat doesn't mean all our troops in WW2 were democrats. And remember this...OSCAR SCHINDLER WAS A NAZI, but like some Nazis, he did not believe the lies of Hitler and his supporters.<br/><br/>Schindler's List was a truly great movie, but Spielberg has become a liar when he made this awful propaganda flick."
"firefalcoln","6","4","7","26 August 2016"," worth seeing, but I don't get the hype
","For people who say this is the best war movie, I can't help but wonder if any of those people have some of Stanley Kubrick's war films. Dr. Strangelove and The Paths of Glory IMO are so much better than Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan visually and technically is far superior to the other films. But the story isn't a gripping story which feels like it has an very powerful message. Largely because it's centered around WW2 which was a war which was necessary for the allies to fight in. The more compelling films IMO are the ones centered around wars and encounters which represent the costs of wars for little if any benefit. I'd say that Warhorse is a better film than Saving Private Ryan too.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan does display the real bravery and horrors of WW2. But that is nothing particularly new. Just about every WW2 film does that. The main story-line of rescuing Ryan is what is the biggest turnoff to me. The film even addresses the issue of their order to rescue Ryan. It's not smart to put an entire team of many people in danger in order to try to rescue one soldier in the middle of a battlefield. Many other soldiers die, and Ryan, even when found doesn't feel he deserves to be rescued. He even insists that they keep fight off their enemy rather than leave right away. My inquiry is that if our Nation objects to too many family members dying in battle, why allow so many of one family to fight? Probably my favorite parts of the film were the side stories not directly related to Saving Ryan at all. I like the story of the translator going from a coward to a killer. I like the part of the film where they discuss whether it's right or wrong to escape a Nazi Trap or put themselves and their mission at risk in order to spring the trap. And of course the D-day invasion sequence is incredibly powerful.<br/><br/>The film is certainly worth watching, and many people it's great, but I just find it OK, and certainly not one of the best War films. I don't know if it would even crack my top 10."
"brchthethird","10","4","7","3 February 2015"," A brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war
","I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).<br/><br/>The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.<br/><br/>Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliché, but every main character is fully fleshed out.<br/><br/>This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a hand-held style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, ""Tu es partout"" before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).<br/><br/>Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone."

","""Saving Private Ryan"", is one of the most pivotal moments in both Steven Spielberg's career, and the War genre in motion picture history.<br/><br/>It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.<br/><br/>Most notably to be said about the movie, is the depiction of the Omaha landings. Basically, it was a war re-enactment consisting of 1500 extras and 30 or so amputees. Spielberg did not plan ahead in terms of storyboarding, but instead decided to place the camera where it was best suited for spontaneous reactions. Admist all the amazing locations and bombed out villages, every soldier is relying on one solid emotion to get through the war, hope, which comes in the form of the missing Private Ryan. Unfortunately, that hope is tested as inevitable casualties will demoralise and divide the squadron.<br/><br/>This film covers pretty much all aspects of war. The tension, nature and sadness of it all gets stripped bare, as all stones are turned and the end result is one of poetic beauty. However, I never really found myself caring whether they found Ryan or not. Though the ending can't help but feel forced, it's certainly touching and has a lot of patriotism in mind.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Definitely one of Spielberg's finest. I look forward to watching ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), and seeing what this man can do with more running time. 9/10."

The scene is a bit unbelievable, it only lasts a second, but something is lost to the viewer. I think the ADR might be part of the reason.<br/><br/>Speaking of, when he's laying there and takes out the note for his father, I'm almost certain there is ADR because his lines do not match up with his lips or body language.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I were to criticize that scene, I'd be nitpicking. It still gets dusty no matter what he's saying.<br/><br/>To address my earlier criticism, you might argue that the 'bookends' (the scenes in which we see Matt Damon all grown up, having fathered at least two generations) are necessary to provide redemption to the deceased characters.<br/><br/>This is a fair point, but I don't think we need this kind of handholding. I don't believe anyone would have wondered whether or not he went on to father children. Almost all of the characters are heroic (especially Private Ryan) and we know that he's alive at the end of their mission.<br/><br/>They are required to give him another chance, and that's made apparent by his survival during the film's climax. The viewer can presume he will make the best of the life they've sacrificed for.<br/><br/>But this is all semantics.

This is because of the action in the scene, as Steven Spielberg shows a good example of what happened to the soldiers that day, and what a struggle it was. Other than the D-Day scene, the film is still amazing, as it provides lots of drama, such as the scene with the tense sniper game, and the parents daughter being taken.

With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.<br/><br/>World War I is often considering ""The Great War"" or ""The War to End All Wars,"" but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.<br/><br/>One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.<br/><br/>The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.<br/><br/>Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

It really makes you feel like you're actually there in person.<br/><br/>Where other war movies often glamorizes the soldier, gives war that romantic ""Hero"" touch, Saving Private Ryan hacks into your mind like no other movie. It is rough, chillingly brutal, and beautiful at the same time. It tries in no way to give you an illusion, it simply tries to give the audience the feeling of how it was like to be there.<br/><br/>This is where Saving Private Ryan succeeds.<br/><br/>I dare say that no other movie has managed to put a given scenario into such a breathtakingly good movie.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Hanks does a fine job as Cpt.

My Grand-Father along with many other people who fought in WW2 would say it is very very very realistic. <br/><br/>Especially in the opening scene at the beaches and the final battle at the end.<br/><br/>Tom hanks is brilliant in it as well as the rest of the cast, It's brilliantly shot and very very well made.<br/><br/>It shows what the life was like for a WW2 soldier.<br/><br/>And it shows the Absolute Hell of war and what is what like to be there.<br/><br/>Many people would say they cried at the end, even men because it is just so moving to think how or why we do this and how could we have done this to each other, and Tom Hank's last words made it even more moving. It has Beautiful music and is a Gem of a film.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend it for 12 years and above, and it should be shown to every child out there to teach them the reality of war.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this already go and buy the DVD now! If there was a higher rating than 10 I would it a 100.<br/><br/>Brilliant"

","Words cannot describe the greatness of this film. Hell, if I type a long review of this film, it might take away the film's credibility. So I'm gonna keep this review short, sweet and simple.<br/><br/>ACTING: Superb. Likable characters and they put you, the audience, smack dab in the middle of the war. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Notable mention is Jeremy Davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier, Upham.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: Excellent. Frenetic camera movement, thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences. Spielberg is masterful, as always. He manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really is.<br/><br/>STORY/SCREENPLAY: Storywise, it is uplifting and inspiring. And during historical moments, it is accurate and realistic. Screenplay slips into sentimental state during times, but we'd look over that.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Mesmerizing. At times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish (there goes that word again) display of a blood-drenched beach and war-torn cities. The color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematography.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Is put into places where it should be. John Williams does a fantastic job once again.<br/><br/>OVERALL: In short, definitely in my favorite movies list, and on the critical side, one of the greatest movies ever made. This film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers.<br/><br/>9.966/10<br/><br/>Delton"
"michael-870","9","4","7","25 January 2008"," A gem amongst the trash
","OK first off let me be clear on a few points: I rarely, if ever, write reviews. Second, I am not American, I'm a proud Canadian. I'm not enlisted in our military, nor am I a veteran.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be, in my opinion, one of the most moving films in the last 40 years. So realistic that Veterans of the War and in particular Operation Overlord (or Operation Atlantic for the Canadians participation on June 6, 1944) have a hard time watching the movie.<br/><br/>Now, the events that the 8 soldiers in the movie participate in are an amalgamation of several different events that happened to different people throughout the real war: While Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers Battalion did participate in Overlord, they were at Pointe du Hoc, not Omaha Beach as depicted here. The rescue of Sgt Fredrick Niland was not done by a group of rangers, but rather by a French chaplain. Bridges were a common point of contention and it was not unheard of to see a small group of soldiers defending such an important transportation artery.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan takes these events and more and weaves them into an incredible story of the courage and honor that has left me stunned time and time again. Unlike so many movie characters these days, I see a depth to these characters. Mellish is a Jew. Miller is a schoolteacher. Jackson is a Christian. And of course the somewhat nerdy Corporal Upham.<br/><br/>On the other side we have Steamboat Willie, unfortunately the only German (being German does NOT make him Nazi) soldier we see a whole lot of. It is likely that, like the Americans, he is only following orders, as the Nazi Regime in those days ""recruited"" as many able bodied soldiers as they could - including POWs, like the Czechs.<br/><br/>In addition if you think that the blood and gore is an attempt to provide ""entertainment value"" to this film, then maybe you need to look up the real WWII. In contrast SPR is much more sterile in that respect than the war really was. War is a bloody, horrible, terrible thing, and SPR comes very close to that reality. Blown off limbs, spilled guts, and blood are unfortunate realities.<br/><br/>If your looking for a film to watch for entertainment value, don't bother with this one. If, on the other hand, you want to watch a movie that is a worthy tribute to our Veterans - American, Canadian, British - this one is well worth your while. Start to finish, this film gives me a sense of pride to think of all those people in our military who fight so hard and put their lives on the line just so ordinary people like myself can stay free and live our lives the way we were meant to. My hat's off to those people, with a heartfelt thanks and prayer.<br/><br/>One last note, I have heard of this film (and even the real Operation) being paralleled and compared with the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (or MOHAA for short). Let me be crystal clear on this point: It was a good game (I played it) but it was just that - a game. If you die, you can start over until you win. The same was not true for all the people that gave their lives during this bloody campaign. None of them had a health bar of 100 and a start button for another chance at the battle.<br/><br/>My hats off to Steven Spielberg and the Cast for such a superb effort!"
"McSqueaky","10","4","7","31 December 2007"," Far More Than Just Another War Film
","This movie is a masterpiece. It is very rare to see a movie and truly be moved by it. From start to finish, you are so immersed in this film that you are feeling every emotion of every character as if you were them. The true underlying message is often hard for most people to pick out, but if you truly grasp what this movie is about, you will realize just how beautiful a movie can be.<br/><br/>The audio in this movie and the gritty, unflinching realism grabs you and pulls you into the war that Spielberg has so incredibly painted on the screen. The opening scene of D-Day is perhaps the single most dramatic and immersive movie experience I have ever come across in my entire life.<br/><br/>Unlike most films, every death you witness in this film stabs at your conscience. You truly feel the adrenaline of the killer, the pain of the soldier, and the sorrow of the soldier's friends every time someone dies.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made, even beyond the war genre. Every piece of this masterpiece is a work of art. The terrifying and realistic sound effects, the emotional and beautiful soundtrack, and the flawless performance by the actors makes this movie unforgettable."
"dorotka24","10","4","7","20 November 2007"," Bleak, horrific, magnificent
","There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.<br/><br/>Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.<br/><br/>It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like ""Patton,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Midway,"" and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.<br/><br/>Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.<br/><br/>Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.<br/><br/>But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience."
"weekendwarrior78","10","4","7","8 November 2007"," One of the best
","Most of us will never know what it was like on Omaha Beach June 6, 1944. Saving Private Ryan has without a doubt been the most realistic war films ever made. This is as close as most of us will come to know what it was like that day on the beach. Every character in this movie is perfectly cast. Spielbeg shows us once again that he is one of the best directors of his generation. The way he makes every character in the movie seem like an everyman, is so realistic because after all these guys aren't superheroes. There normal blue collar guys who work for a living. This movie might just be the best war movie ever made, it is right up there with Patton, The Longest Day, and Stalag 17. Even if your not a war buff, watch it for the history. And as we all know ""If we do not know history we are doomed to repeat it."""
"dereklarma","8","4","7","23 September 2007"," Visually graphic and disturbing war epic.
","Saving Private Ryan is a WW2 film that begins on the Normandy beaches of France on D-day, June 6th, 1944. The first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war I have seen. The D-day beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again. The noise, carnage, and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer. Unlike anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>So far through the film you have been following Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) and his company on the beaches of Normandy. After the intense battle the US Army counts its dead. Three brothers were killed on that same day in Normandy. The 4th and youngest brother is James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon), and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown. Private Ryan is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings. He is the last of the sons that his mother still has. The army wants him found and brought back home to safety. Captain Miller is now given this task to find Private Ryan and bring him to safety.<br/><br/>Captain Miller now travels across battle torn French country side to find Private Ryan. But he does not travel alone. He travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company. On their journey they face hard struggles. The mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one? The men do finally find Private Ryan but Ryan does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with. So now Captain Miller and his men stay with Ryan and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives. The Germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks. Captain Miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on. What develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands I have ever seen in a war movie.<br/><br/>Spielber masterfully directed the battle sequences. The battle scenes attacked your senses. The special effects were mind boggling to say the least. The scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic. So much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer. War is shown as what it is. Nasty!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>The acting was very good all around except from I think Matt Damon. But Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance. The film also stars Tom Sizemoore and Edward Burns as part of the rescue mission. Throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like Paul Giamatti and even Ted Danson. Overall the acting was very good.<br/><br/>The dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much. Captain Miller's character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in France. And some of the lines, although not many, were a little cliché.<br/><br/>I felt the film to be a little biased towards the Americans which I hate to see in movies. Spielberg seemed to convey the Germans as evil jerks. German soldiers were just like the American soldiers. There is a difference between the German Army and the Nazi SS. So I was ashamed to see the German soldiers representing evil. War should represent evil, not German soldiers. Both sides are committing unforgiving violence. Not just the Germans.<br/><br/>Saving Privazte Ryan is a very good film. Everyone should at least experience it once, especially if you are a WW2 buff. Very educational! Not the best movie of all time but still very good."
"remikolk","7","4","7","25 August 2007"," Cut the first and last scene
","To be clear; I like the Normandy beach scene they're actually quite brilliant. But the first and last scenes are those on the cemetery with the old man and his family. Why are those scenes there? They are totally obsolete. I don't need to hear the old man ask his wife if his life was worth it. If the movie itself didn't make this clear then the movie failed and the movie didn't fail.<br/><br/>I saw the movie ""A thin red line"" a week earlier, and at first I was disgusted by Saving Private Ryan. It just doesn't have the same weight. But then again, you shouldn't compare these two movies as they are totally different. And when I saw this one a few times at later stages this became clear to me.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite simple, and rightfully so. A bunch of soldiers are send to save a last of four brothers. It needs to be simple; it's the little things that make the soldiers so unique. The little stories of Matt Damons, Tom Hanks and other characters make this movie. And the comradery between the men is portrait very good as well. It's not poetic, but men which are fighting (and trying to survive) in an unforgiving war.<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe it's just me. I just got a bit of a beef against Steven Spielberg lately. When the plot has been clear he seem to insert several more scenes that explain the plot again and again. He just needs to stop this. It makes the movie unnecessary long and dull. He does this with most of his movies in the last decade. And don't get me wrong, I got nothing against long movies, but the length needs to fit the movie.<br/><br/>Just cut the first and last scene and all will be fine."

","You both are dim bulbs to say the least. The film is a fictional story and purports to be just that, why people keep holding it to a documentary standard is beyond me. But it's stupid to do that and displays the limited intellect of those like twistedfieldofvision who do just that.<br/><br/>Carmad, you are not a writer. And nobody who works in your ward on the psych wing believes your ""I am Shakespeare"" proclamations. I'm sure your equally impotent teen pal who thinks he is Napoleon and occupies the bunk above yours believes you, but consider the source on that one.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant and is one of the top 3 movies S.S. ever made. The speech where the General reads Lincoln's letter is touching and very appropriate. WW2 was the moral equivalent of the war to free the slaves. Tom Brokaw labels the fighting allied men of WW2 the GREATEST GENERATION. He is correct. And their humility regarding what they did for mankind's future is part of the reason that label is accurate."
"arjunkish","9","4","7","27 July 2007"," Humanity in the middle of brutality .
","I've seen many war movies , in fact War is the genre that interests me the most . However , Saving Private Ryan is a movie that stands apart from all others . As soon as the film starts you know that the movie is something special , there is something different in this movie as compared to others on the same subject . Spielberg not only manages to depict the brutality of war superbly but also manages to blend this with the mission given to 8 American Soldiers . If you're a fan of Warfare and violence then the first half hour of the movie will be enough for you . It is an absolutely sensational and gripping depiction of what these brave men must have gone through . Tom Hanks is brilliant as usual , playing the role of Captain John H. Miller flawlessly . Some of his conversation scenes with the other soldiers are very well projected by Spielberg who again shows how good he is as a Director . All in all this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and certainly the best when it comes to a movie about War ."
"hchais","10","4","7","25 April 2007"," The greatest war movie ever made
","This movie is truly the best war movie ever and one of the greatest movies over all of all time. It is incredibly well made. The first 20 minutes of this movie is one of the greatest scenes of all time. It made people realize the pain and what it felt what it was like to be at D Day. It is truly amazing. This movie is very well made. The cinematography. The sound and special effects. The score by John Williams. This is easily Steven Spielberg's best movie ever. He totally deserved to win the Best Director award at the Oscars. It should have totally won best picture over Shakespeare in love. In the end, after the fateful battle at the end, i will not tell what happens, it justs leaves us with one question. Are the lives of eight men worth saving one? Probably not. One of the greatest movies ever. 10/10."
"im_veritas_photo","10","4","7","9 March 2007"," Impossible to Rate ""Saving Private Ryan""
","The long opening D-Day battle scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a true shocker, and you'd better believe what I say. I almost left the theater the first time I saw it on a big screen; I can just barely stand it on a TV screen. I can't watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" without bawling, and that's not like me at all. How can I rate the damn thing when I can't even see it through my tears? Tom Hanks as Captain John H. Miller. Matt Damon as Private James Francis Ryan. Ted Danson as Captain Fred Hamill. Jeremy Davies as Corporal Timothy P. Upham. And all the rest of the actors, even Vin Diesel as short-lived Private Adrian Caparzo. Stellar line-up.<br/><br/>Listen: Tom Hanks always turns in a great acting performance, even when the film into which he's thrust doesn't give him much of a chance. I don't mean this film; I'm thinking of an inferior screenplay like ""Cast Away."" Even there, Hanks almost made it great. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" the screenplay and Hanks are really, truly great.<br/><br/>I don't hand out tens easily.<br/><br/>Enough said? Yes."
"l-harris2","9","4","7","23 January 2007"," The mission is a man
","Saving Private Ryan is (in a word) outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours).<br/><br/>A brilliant innovation is the colour reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.<br/><br/>The storyline is a real strength and the characters & acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad.<br/><br/>But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered ""brothers"" in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, ""Steamboat Willie"" humanises the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.<br/><br/>Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context.<br/><br/>Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words!"
"Davi-Jones","10","4","7","13 August 2006"," How can someone make such a movie...
","To begin I have to admit that this is one of the best war movies ever made. No doubt Tom Hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country. The war scenes are excellent. One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked. Shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because The US has begun other wars in Asia and other sites. So FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THOSE PATRIOT BOYS AND ALL CAPTIAN MILLERS DO NOT RAGE ANOTHER WAR TO KILL AMERICA'S SONS"
"addaam78-1","10","4","7","10 August 2006"," A war movie which in fact is poetry
","I usually watch and give credit to European movies and usually hate the Hollywood production. And I usually see a political statement in ""Schindlers list"" which is commonly quoted as ""his best movie"" and ""the best movie about holocaust"".<br/><br/>However... after seeing S.P.R. I must agree that this is, if probably not the ""best movie ever made"", the most ""revolutionary war movie of all time"".<br/><br/>The movie structure is like a poem. It shakes you in the beginning, it calms you in the middle and it destroys you in the end verses. <br/><br/>First of all... the first battle on Omaha beach... the moving camera... the embed-ed reporter like camera... following the soldiers to the beach... the explosions, arms, legs torn apart, the fear on soldiers faces... the numbness... the on-and-off going sound after the bombs go off... MAN! After seeing it for the first time... I went out of the movie theater... and went to see it again for the second time! There has never been a movie that glued me to the chair... and made me stare for 25 minutes in silence! Well, that was a... romantic experience and I give Spielberg credit for that.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie... is exactly the opposite of the first. It's not loud and disturbing... but silent and green. I must say it's the greenest grass I have seen in a war movie... the soldiers walk and walk and speak about stupid stuff... like they never went thru hell in the landing at Omaha beach. When I watched this middle section I almost felt good, but it felt very unnatural... and that's why after the assault on the MG-42 nest... I felt shaken again. The dying red cross soldier shot in the stomach... dying... in the arms of comrades... UFFF. Some disturbing images.<br/><br/>And of course... the last part... the total destruction, the panzer's rolling thru the streets, the sniper... the self-made sticky bombs... the ruble of houses, the fights one on one... wow. Some serious sequences...<br/><br/>I admired the photography, the clean pictures, however it is the moving camera that makes this movie revolutionary... I think no director is able to make again a credible war movie without the Spielberg's moving camera... and that's why I consider him a GENIUS. I haven't seen a war movie with static cameras after S.P.R came out.<br/><br/>I must say that this movie can be judged in many ways... you can always see a ""shallow characterization"" or even a demagogic view on the Jew-German combat in the house... of course. However... if I exclude my political view of this movie I would say that this is probably one of the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Only the Russian movie ""Come and See"" (orig. Idi i Smotri) made even a harder impact on my view on what war is. And that's why I consider Saving Private Ryan if not the best, then second best war movie ever made."

","I first saw this film in the movie theater. The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind. It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film. Sorry, Shakespeare in Love!"
"moviesleuth2","10","4","7","9 April 2006"," The finest war film ever made
","During the opening sequence when I saw the man's face and I was preparing myself for a long flashback, a growing sense of dread overcame me. Yet still I was not prepared for the horror that I was exposed to for the next 2 1/2 hours. Horror is the only way to describe this film. I wasn't simply watching the film. I was absorbed into it. Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there, and for good reason too. He can make a film like no one else. Everything here works so well, the acting, the action sequences, the atmosphere and emotion. It's all here, and highly energized. This, along with Schindler's List, one of the greatest films in cinematic history. is Spielberg's masterpiece. One of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer Janusz Kiminski. The grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly, and the lighting is superb because even when it's a sunny day, it's still covered in darkness. People have criticized this film for having a bad storyline. That's not true, not at all. While the storyline is simple and nothing new, it's because that's what it would have been like in real life. Life is not a intricately woven storyline like say The Silence of the Lambs, and the people with this film know that. The key to making this film work is making it real. And that it does."

","I first watched this film in the cinema when it first came out, and how to describe it then... WOW! I was not the suitable age though, being only 13 at the time and as imagined my impression of the film got better the older i got. Too many people brand their favourite film as 'the greatest film of all time' but if you have seen this film, you will agree with this common statement. However, 'Saving Private Ryan' deserves more than a common statement. The action in the film is intense and the detail has clearly spared no expense. The storyline runs really well with the film and what a cast to play in it. This is Tom Hanks at his best! Not to mention exceptional performances from Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns. Matt Damon did well, however I felt he did not suit the part. Steven Spielburg should be credited for being the greatest film director; not from 'Schindler's List', but from 'Saving Private Ryan'."

","To say Saving Private Ryan is a great war movie would be an understatement. This movie deserves a place in the top 50.<br/><br/>This movie would have been nothing without the amazing directing of Steven Spielberg and I'm glad the academy honored him. This movie is incredibly violent, but it is to show us what the soldiers of WW2 had to endure. Without that, it would not have been as powerful.<br/><br/>John Williams also delivers a very good musical score throughout the film I especially enjoyed the cinema verite technique utilized by Spielberg to give us the feel that we're on the battlefield with the other soldiers.<br/><br/>And, of course, there is Tom Hanks. One of his best performances. He is undeniably one of the best actors of all time. I'm glad that he and Spielberg teamed up for this. It wouldn't have been the same without either of them."
"briangcb","Null","4","7","24 September 2005"," If you hate this movie then you should understand something...
","Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.<br/><br/>It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film ""this movie is based on a true story."" It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that."

If you like the turmoil and especially the drama part of WW2, then I'll recommend you to watch this superb movie. And of course, it's directed by Steven Spielberg :p (hope that my first review is alright) :D<br/><br/>Now, the only thing I have to do is to watch Band of brothers :D"
"PWNYCNY","8","4","7","5 August 2005"," War is Unpleasant
","The movie has a lot of gratuitous scenes of violence (Don't need Hollywood to show me that war is a violent activity). The movie has a lot of stereotypical characters (Don't need Hollywood to portray soldiers as being foul-mouthed and grimy). The movie has a pretentious story (Don't believe that even the U. S. Army would risk 10 soldiers to locate one, and an enlisted solder at that, in the middle of one of the biggest operations in the history of warfare). But what saves this movie from being a complete dud is Tom Hanks's portrayal of Captain Miller. Hanks's performance is not just wonderful, it is superlative. Captain Miller is a civilian who now finds himself in combat and the conflict between his civilian background and military responsibilities is what this movie is about. Because of this conflict, Captain Miller suffers, emotionally as well as physically. We observe how Captain Miller goes through a process of breaking down as his situation becomes more and more untenable. And when the private in question is found, yet refuses to leave, Captain Miller begins to completely unravel as he realizes that his mission has failed and that the men in his unit who died - under Captain Miller's command - had died in vain. Captain Miller literally becomes a nervous wreck, but nevertheless he fights on, courageous and strong till the ultimate moment arrives marking the end of Captain Miller's life. For Captain Miller is a hero and his character is symbolic of every citizen-soldier who answered the call to duty, and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country."
"kf4mgz","10","4","7","3 July 2005"," One of the best portrayals of war
","The plot of this movie was based on fact, which means that the actual events that are depicted in the movie may not have happened exactly as portrayed, but represent real events that did take place. If many who saw this film complain about the lack of historical basis, lack of minorities, lack of whatever, then get over it. Some events took place in World War II that did not actually include members of all races or nations. As for those who say the film is boring, then I can only suppose that real life situations don't hold much appeal for you. If you're that disconnected from the real world, go back to your video game.<br/><br/>World War II was a very grim time in the history of our civilization, and it would be difficult to find anyone who actually participated in battle during this period to disagree with me. I've known many soldiers, and I've never met one that wished for the awful, bloody, sickening carnage that is combat, especially the all-or-nothing circumstances that were all to real in this world between 1939 and 1945. Soldiers are simply people who are willing to fight for their country. In World War II, many of the American combatants were drafted, and some did refuse to fight, as is the case in any war, but most served, with or without distinction or recognition, but did what they felt was their duty. Infantry soldiers, even Ranger captains like John Miller were often ordinary people very much removed from the lives they wanted to be living. Every country that participated in World War II lost many John Millers, decent, ordinary people that were just doing their duty to the best of their ability.<br/><br/>For those who complain about the stark portrayal of combat as being too brutal, I suggest you just live in your dream world where when a steel projectile strikes human flesh, the body just simply falls to the ground. You are living in a dream world to think this is so. Combat invariably involves gruesome situations. Body parts are blown away, blood and gore flies. ""War is Hell"" is not just a saying; it's the absolute truth. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan depicts combat with more accuracy than most war films in the past have done. Watching this film will put the average person much closer to the actual feeling of being in combat than almost anything else. <br/><br/>As for those that hate to be reminded of accurate depictions of history, there is a saying: Those who ignore history will repeat it. This movie, and the war it depicts hopefully have taught us some valuable lessons. I hope we never forget them.<br/><br/>If you're offended by a movie that shows the American flag, then don't watch it. The realistic depiction of the USA as a patriotic nation in the 1940's might be a little too much for you."

","Saving Private Ryan is quite possibly the best World War II-inspired movie ever.<br/><br/>I know, it's not at all historically accurate. I know, there are plot points that don't make sense. I know and understand all these criticisms.<br/><br/>As a film, however, and as a statement on what war is and how war affects people, this film is Top Notch and should have won the Best Picture Oscar the year it was released.<br/><br/>This film has exciting, graphic, horrifying and realistic battle footage. The opening montage alone represents the best film-making possible regardless of technology.<br/><br/>The cast is simply brilliant, not a lame or hackneyed performance in the bunch. Tom Hanks is again Oscar-worthy, and if they had an Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast this film would have won hands-down.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely *nothing* like the cheesy WWII movies with John Wayne or Henry Fonda or Ernest Borgnine. This film is not all jingoistic patriotism, it is a real look at what real war is like, with heroic soldiers and cowardly soldiers and soldiers simply trying to do their jobs and survive. It shows the futility of war and the necessity of war. And it pulls no punches in showing the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrifically written, truly an amazing piece of film-making.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for an inspiring film.<br/><br/>Barky"
"dee.reid","10","4","7","28 June 2005"," War is hell after all...
","It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" (1982) or ""Hook"" (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with ""Schindler's List"" (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned ""Schindler's List""), but after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I cant fault this film in anyway,shape or form. Absolutely brilliant. Tom Hanks once again proves that he still is one of the best actors of our generation and there's also a little part for vin diesel. Now just recently i have started my war film collection and now own most of the best ones out there, but still this film has to be the most accurate and exhilarating one of them all. Private James Ryan's three brothers have been killed in action and to save the heart ache of their poor mother (even more) Captain John Miller and his squad of highly trained soldiers are sent further behind enemy lines to find Ryan and return him to his mother safely. As you can probably gather not everything goes to plan otherwise the film would be over before we finished our brews, faced with impossible odds, the men start to question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer- and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honour, decency and courage. If you like this and lets face it if u don't then u don't like a brill war film i recommend band of brothers, which is a mini drama series on a para squad in WW2. Tom Hanks also present that too."
"sharkycharger","Null","4","7","11 September 2004"," Brilliant, despite simplified characterizatins
","As of three years ago, I have made a point of watching this film on June 6th every year, so that the true meaning of this historic date will never be lost. I know it sounds trite, but with holidays such as Memorial Day quickly becoming an excuse for cookouts, I feel the need to reinforce the terrible and awesome sacrifices that have shaped the course of history. This movie does just that. For all of it's character development shortcomings, it still ranks as simply the most powerful cinematic depiction of war I have ever seen. <br/><br/>And as a side note, the whole character development issue almost seems moot, considering the context in which most of these men knew each other. Ready to die for their brothers, many ironically knew very little of each other's personal lives, except for snippets learned during the calm interludes, when the soldier would share stories or letters from a world far away. <br/><br/>That is why the betting on what Hank's character does as a civilian makes so much sense. To many, life at home was a carefully guarded treasure that served as a very personal and private link to sanity and hope. If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to do so. You will find a whole new appreciation for the ability of the common man who, faced with impossible odds and true terror, is somehow able to accomplish the extroardinary. It will renew your faith in mankind, while simultaneously horrifying you at man's folly."

","Being still a teenager, I realize that I am still relatively young and may not fully comprehend the true impact of war, if ever.  I know that many have criticized this movie for not truly giving the sense of war or whatnot.<br/><br/>In my view, this was not the purpose of the movie.  Instead, I believe that this movie was made as a tribute for those lives lost in the war and to give the audience a more graphic taste of the battlefield.  The viewer may only begin to get a sense of the horror felt by those involved, but I hope that most will never have to know such feelings.<br/><br/>Movie-wise, its terrific.  Superb acting, exciting and twisting plot, emotional moments, and edge-of-your-seat action.  I came away speechless with a better view of the true loss of war.<br/><br/>While the feelings conveyed are not as realistic as some would like, this movie is also not exactly a light-hearted take on war.  I feel that Hollywood has a responsibility to accurately reproduce the historical subject being represented to the best of their ability, and this is achieved.  The costumes, special effects, sounds, and sets are virtually genuine.<br/><br/>The bottom line:  While unable to truly portray the experience of war, the viewer still comes away feeling solemn and respectful with a true sense of loss for those involved.  The excellent production values are only a bonus."

"lilbgman","3","4","7","4 August 1998"," Lifeless characters die in battle
","The film may have been more than well-done gore-fest if any of the characters had been remotely interesting, I may have cared whether or not their lives were worth risking.  Their mission didn't seem any riskier than anything else they may have encountered.  There was no dramatic conflict.  The character-developing monologues were nauseating and the stories they told were recycled workshop material.  The true story upon which the film was based was totally undermined, and Spielberg's point of view is uncommitted, self-involved, and pedestrian.  He quotes Abraham Lincoln instead of exploring the issues, and asks for approval at the end. Frankly, the emptiness of the story, characters, and treatment wasn't worth the pain of the opening scene."

","The beach scenes are absolutely fantastic, and I'm not sure if I did breathe at all during those sequences. The sound and the effects are amazing, the use of small hand cams gave the whole thing a documentary feeling of the hell that met the men who landed on the beach. Sadly after that it is not too good, and the film quickly becomes a standard Hollywood WW2 film, with heroic Americans and stupid German soldiers. A better story and less sentimentality (everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director. The price for freedom is high)would have given this film a 10/10. I think the men who laid down their lives on the beaches in the fight to free Europe deserves more than this."

It was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the war.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was none of these things.<br/><br/>The message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience, as long as you're an American. Common everyday plain old American Teachers, as shown by Tom Hanks' character, are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men. We are shown, however, that the humanity of that Teacher is still there, even as he is fighting the ""Evil Bloodthirsy Germans.""<br/><br/>And this is where my problem lies. How can a movie that uses cookie cutter Nazis, that treats German soldiers as simply ""the enemy,"" even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans in Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently having lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The Thin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a joke.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so flat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either. Having said that, however, the dehumanizing of the enemy, the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity, is what allowed the Germans to kill so many Jews.<br/><br/>

That reminds me, the Germans, when they were speaking german, were pretty horrible (I watched the original english version) - I doubt those were authentic Germans, which is strange because Spielberg usually thrives on authenticy.<br/><br/>Finally, there was too much comedy (especially that ""Here, I am James Ryan"" thing, that was so weak) for a serious war movie.

"wmarkley","6","9","21","10 December 2005"," Very Overrated
","Yes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie, but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic: the attitudes, behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts. In particular, some of the major and minor characters of ""S.P.R."" exhibit very self-absorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during World War II. Sure, people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history, and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical, but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990's guys were like rather than 1940's men. For a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940's troops, try ""Battleground.""<br/><br/>Like many others here, I like war movies to be authentic in depicting things like uniforms, equipment and tactics, and ""S.P.R."" is successful in some of this, but to me it is more important for a movie to be accurate in depicting character, attitude and the actual events that occurred, and in this ""S.P.R"" is very lacking. It does a better job of demonstrating Spielberg's 1990's limousine-liberal biases. This is especially seen in the character depictions. Another kind of example which is comparatively minor is how the German troops' haircuts in ""S.P.R."" tend to look more like those of late-20th Century skinheads than what German SS and Wehrmacht troops usually wore.<br/><br/>Also, I think that the reviewer James Bowman makes a good point about movies such as ""S.P.R."" and ""Flags of Our Fathers:"" ""...perhaps showing too much respect for the suffering is not to show enough respect for the man. For if we suppose, as some of us still do, that these men suffered for something  to wit, their duty, their honor, their country  don't these thing deserve just a little bit of respect as well?...""<br/><br/>To get an idea of what the Normandy Campaign was like, you would be much better off reading non-fiction accounts of it, and listening to comments by actual men who were there. It takes much more than gushing blood, flying body parts and the message ""War is hell"" to constitute a great war film. If you want to see cinematic movies which do a better job than ""S.P.R."" of depicting some of the general look and feel of war, and the characters and attitudes of people of the World War II period, try ""Talvisota"" and ""Der Untergang."" Also, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is very good, especially for a blockbuster-type movie. ""A Bridge Too Far"" has a few very minor inaccuracies, some composite characters and some simplifications of the real events, but it does an excellent job of showing the characters of troops and civilians, and it is mostly factual. ""The Longest Day,"" while it includes some Hollywood flourishes, also is very good. It doesn't have the special effects and combat realism of ""S.P.R.,"" but it is almost completely based on facts, which counts for a lot with me, and for which I rank it much higher than ""S.P.R."" ""The Longest Day"" also has one of the most impressive large-scale depictions of combat in any movie, showing the storming of a German position by a Free French unit."

The film tries to have it both ways; war is horrible, but hey, we Americans are great and kick butt, especially against those Nazi scum. Total manipulation from a master; not that it would take much to root against the Nazis, but let's have it one way or the other: shades of gray, or black and white. Spielberg wants it both ways. And what about the cheap tactic of using the old veteran, who we later find out is Ryan, linking back to Tom Hanks' character? How about basic continuity, Steve?

There's too much of a jerky-camera effect.

Of course, a director like SS is hardly going to tell just a story, but has an agenda he's working behind the scenes, manipulating us into some snare or other where we have to accept his worldview on things.

"Wuchakk","6","5","10","7 July 2016"," Great WWII war action in France, but too much of the drama is weak
","RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.<br/><br/>No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.<br/><br/>In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).<br/><br/>Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.<br/><br/>In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>I've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father's stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it's resolved (ooh, the Captain's a high school teacher, whoopee).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can't beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.

","Another movie in which the American fighting man is portrayed as weak, stupid, untrained, and rebellious.<br/><br/>The Captain won't help a family get out of harm's way, but has no trouble assaulting a radar tower. Stupid. In one case, take ten seconds and point to the avenue of escape. In the other, avoid the tower; it's not the mission.<br/><br/>A well-manned squad has a sniper and a translator, but not a radioman or a machine gunner. What? <br/><br/>Bullets slice easily through all helmets except one. They wanted the irony of the guy pulling off his helmet and then getting the head shot.<br/><br/>The Star Trek philosophy of the Captain being challenged every step by his subordinates. Might be the way it works in space. Didn't happen in WWII. More people die when you ""put it to a vote."" <br/><br/>Snipers die when they fire continuously. Not their job. The German ate it because he tried to take everybody out; the American did the same.<br/><br/>A sniper's basic job in battle is to make the enemy keep low and go slow. He takes out the head (officers and radiomen), the muscle (mostly machine gunners, bazookas, and BARs, or the morale (medics). If the bad guys take out your chain of command, take away your strength, or take away any hope of surviving a wound, you tend not to fight as well.<br/><br/>If your man throws a hissy fit and wants to desert, you help him. Not gonna happen. Even if you are a pacifist piece of crap like the Captain, you have to keep your unit cohesive.<br/><br/>Tanks enter a hot zone in a city without firing a shot. Stupid. Tanks, like planes, provide massive firepower but also huge targets. The Queen of Battle takes the cities. Tanks avoid them and fire at them from a distance. Tank busters wouldn't have been used in this situation. They probably would have taken out the very bridge that both sides wanted to own, but neither side wanted to destroy.<br/><br/>You let the rookie hang back and cry. No. If you don't want to fight with the rest of us, you can do your part by attracting bullets.<br/><br/>The way to infiltrate the enemy lines is to crowd together, joke, and sing while you walk along through the pretty fields. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Spread out; keep quiet; learn how to use the 1,000 yard stare.<br/><br/>A Captain loses 96 men and rationalizes that he saved 10 times that amount. Not in our Army. I waited for him to say 104. That would have been believable, but I guess this Captain was leading a battalion, not a company. And somehow, he ends up leading not a battalion, not a company, not a platoon, but a mere squad. Most likely, a buck sarge or a corporal would have led that squad.<br/><br/>Non-combat pencil jockeys call the shots as the Normandy Invasion is going on. Uh, no.<br/><br/>If you have a prisoner, you let him go while you dig graves. No, to letting him go. No, to digging graves during battle. You take care of the living first; and of the living, you take care of your own men first.<br/><br/>Although communication was atrocious, all platoons had a radioman, and some squads did. The proper place for a radioman is two feet to the rear of the Captain at all times.<br/><br/>The horrid portrayal of the American fighting man goes on and on. They weren't wimps. Yes, everyone was scared silly, but they didn't challenge every fricking order. If you are part of the 10% of the Army known as line soldiers, the chances are good that you are not coming back. You know that going in.<br/><br/>War is terrible. You don't want to experience it. But if you have to, try to be like the sarge. Don't be stupid like the sniper, cowardly like the translator, ""conflicted"" like Hanks, treasonous like what's his name, etc.<br/><br/>And Private Ryan himself. At that cemetery, he should have been thinking about all the men he killed, not whether he lived up to the Captain's standards. He killed the Captain and most of his men. A fitting end would have Ryan eating a bullet.<br/><br/>The Screaming Eagles (Puking Chickens) and the Rangers were highly trained. They weren't wimps. They didn't have anybody in their units who was untrained in rifle fire. They knew that their job was to do the heaviest fighting and take the bloodiest losses. Every one of them knew how to fire, how to bandage a wound, how to use a radio, bazooka, Garand, BAR, how to lead. When one went down, another would take his place. Battlefield promotions were never more prevalent than in those units.<br/><br/>Those men volunteered to be in those units. They might have been drafted, but they chose to join the roughest and most courageous outfits that we had.<br/><br/>I salute our fighting men. Although I was a ground pounder, my contribution to American freedom was relatively small and insignificant. I only hope that I could have acted like one of the few valiant soldiers portrayed here.<br/><br/>And as to the movie itself: Shameful. Utterly shameful."
"ElMaruecan82","6","5","10","15 November 2010"," Many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great movie ...
","'Great' is such a big word, you can fill it with so many expressions like spectacular, thrilling, heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, emotional, inspirational etc. etc. My problem with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is that it has all these elements but still ... at the end, I have a big feeling of 'emptiness', it's like all these things cancel each other out.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see in a War movie, Spielberg knows how to deal with visual effects and the sound editing, the shaky movements of the camera gives a realistic depiction of the chaos dominating these battles, even the word 'battle' is too feeble to describe the intensity of the massacre. The sky is gray on this D-Day, the sea is reddened by the sacrifice of these young soldiers, the air is a vicious enemy that can send you a bullet where it feels like to. Your life is as worthless as money in a lottery. Indeed this opening sequence was very promising, but I had mixed feelings after. I hoped the movie would stay in the same level of realism and greatness on one side. On the other side, I wished it wouldn't contain other sickeningly violent sequences. Unfortunately, none of these wishes were satisfied.<br/><br/>The film flirts with fantasy right after the battle sequence, where the mission of Captain Miller's men is finally exposed. They will have to save one soldier, Private Ryan, the only one left to a family who already lost 3 sons, his brothers. To spare a tragedy for one soldier's family, eight of them will try to find him and risk their lives. We don't know this Ryan yet, he's only a name, a quest, but we get used to these characters, we follow them and have sympathy for them, but at each step of their odyssey, one will be killed. It becomes almost a routine. We're not supposed to think of their family, or the loss caused by this mission. They just die and the mission must go on. It seems that Ryan's life has more value. At this point, I remember ""Schindler's List"" beautiful statement ""Whoever saves one life, saves the humanity"" but the people who were saved, didn't choose their destiny, they were victims, the alternative was death. Ryan wanted to be a soldier, to fight, he never wanted to be saved, isn't the movie about duty, wasn't Ryan accomplishing his? So what's the point of risking the lives of soldiers who want to fight instead of looking for a man who's not a prisoner, to save one who didn't ask for it. Nonsense, and dangerous reasoning implying that some 'external' elements make your life more valuable than the others.<br/><br/>Which in fact, brings me to the biggest problem I had with the film. Life's value. The movies tries to be inspiring by making these soldiers heroes, but to make them heroes, it creates villains by totally dehumanizing the enemy, when a War movie makes me cheer for one human being killed, I feel manipulated, and I become distant ... when a coward like Upham becomes Rambo at the end, and when Steamboat Willie revealed himself as the sneaky bastard they thought he was ... I said, okay, Spieleberg is pushing the Manichean button a little too far. Of course, when you consider the atrocities committed by the enemy, it's impossible to root for the soldiers equally, but that's the challenge when you make a war movie, you can make a Manichean blockbuster (easy choice) or a disturbing masterpiece (challenge) ... I disliked ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the same reason I loved ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" or ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>This movie is great in all the meanings of the word and that's the problem, it's ""too great"", it tries too much ... I loved the opening scene, and another one will torture me forever, it's the scene where Melish begs for his life when he lost the fight, that part killed me ... it felt so real, I couldn't breath ... literally. To conclude, a solid block-buster movie with some unforgettable scenes but not the inspirational masterpiece they claim it to be."

","Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks ""Saving Private Ryan"" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.<br/><br/>Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"zardoz-13","5","5","10","11 December 2008"," The Mission Is The Man!
","Lately, when Hollywood produces war movies, they focus on the debacle of Vietnam. Not director Steven Spielberg! Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of ""Jaws,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Color Purple,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" skewers a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed. As demeaning as this criticism sounds, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the top 25 World War II movies. Since ""Saving Private Ryan"" swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo"" have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence. <br/><br/>If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" might have been a classic. Essentially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic. Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye. This is an egregious error! During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head. Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except that the film itself raises the same point. A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.<br/><br/>Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption. These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat. Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie. Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale. <br/><br/>Told from the perspective of the infantry, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" Samuel Fuller's ""The Big Red One,"" Lewis Milestone's ""A Walk in the Sun,"" and William Wellman's ""Background."" Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that ""Saving Private Ryan"" commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories. The muddled but high-minded screenplay by ""Fly Away House"" scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper. <br/><br/>Captain Miller assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate Private James Ryan of Iowa. Ryan (Matt Damon of ""Good Will Hunting"") has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion. When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of ""Fargo"") decides to pull the last Ryan out of action. Along the way, Miller's G.I.s bitch about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy. <br/><br/>Before ""Saving Private Ryan"" grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious. Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Darabont, seem confused. Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie? Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer? They pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies. Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence. Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas. The sadistic horrors that occur in ""Saving Private Ryan"" seems more commercially than philosophically oriented. We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.<br/><br/>The first 24 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach. Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery. This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics. After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders. Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines. Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch. Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst. This part of ""Saving Private Ryan"" has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show ""Combat."" Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders. Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise. Many soldiers have commentedamong them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powellthat Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated. Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.<br/><br/>Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities. The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera. The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops. ""Saving Private Ryan,"" for all its obvious flaws, still qualifies a movie any die-hard World War II fanatic should watch at least three times."
"fung0","3","5","10","31 May 2008"," Perposterous
","Spielberg is a highly competent director, who has a brilliant knack for making the right film at the right time. This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being ""the best war movie of all time.""<br/><br/>Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.<br/><br/>First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)<br/><br/>Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony. What country in WW II - other than the USA - could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died??? I can only imagine the jeers that must greet this idea when the film is shown in, say, Russia -- where tens of millions died, with no such convenient reprieves and nowhere to flee in any case. Or in England, where whole families had no choice but to soldier their way through the Blitz. The fact is, the soldiers of the USA were relatively unique in having a safe haven to return *to.* Saving Private Ryan not only manages to forget that fact, it somehow tries to make American troops seem the more heroic for it!<br/><br/>I say the irony is unintentional... In fact, I long wondered if Spielberg had *meant* the story-line of Private Ryan ironically. But a recent interview on TCM convinces me that he did not. That's a shame. Done deliberately, this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powers-that-be manipulate fighting men in the field. Instead, it's more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor. I have no idea how prevalent the ""Private Ryan"" reprieve really was; but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire force.<br/><br/>On the positive side, there's no denying the production is well-mounted. I give the film 3 stars, chiefly for the technical brilliance of the opening sequence - and for the presence of the always-watchable Tom Hanks."

","Oh, come on, this flick is nothing but patriotic filth! The first twenty minutes are an accurate and meticulous portrayal of the Normandy landing, and the cinematography is just beautiful! But the story, the plot: forget it! I believe it is very unlikely that any superior in the military would send a whole platoon on such a BS assignment! And when they finally find Matt Damon aka Ryan he heroically wants to fight on and not leave the battle field! Ridiculous. This is popcorn BS for the masses and it makes me angry how Spielberg exploits an actual event in history to make some entertaining, overly corny and almost nationalistic movie out of it! I think that Spielberg displays a lack of responsibility, because this movie has the following messages: <br/><br/>1.Americans fought bravely against the Nazis and all of them believed they were fighting for a worthy cause. 2. American men are young and handsome, and if not, they are smart or wise. 3. All Germans are bad Nazis and ugly, too. 4. The Americans are superheros. 5. There was no anti-smut's within the American army. <br/><br/>Well, people believe what they want to believe, and the more simplified the message is, the more they are willing to swallow it. If you want to take a deeper look into the real character of the American army, read books such as Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, but refrain from Spielberg, who is nothing but a lowbrow trying to look smart."

I have to say that I really do not like war movies, so thats an obvious bias against this movie, but there were sooooooooooo many things about this movie that just made it a laughing stock of me and my friends. The cinematography in this film is simply amazing, in fact i'd say some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, but despite it's technical excellence, SPR is a pathetic, manipulative attempt by Speilberg to make him feel better about himself. The only character development in the movie takes place in the scenes before that particular character's death, it's happens in EVERY case; it's like clockwork. The ending is absolutely horrendously manipulative, and in fact the whole story doesn't really make sense as a result of it. SPOILER ALERT - don't read any farther if ya don't want to ruin the flick for yourself. At the beginning we have the shot of that old man at the grave, then it closes in on him and his memory begins of what happened... the only thing is that we find out the old man is really Ryan, not Tom Hank's Character, so i'm wondering how Ryan has all these memories of the beaches and the rest of the movie. Theoretically shouldn't the 'memories' start when Ryan enters the movie? Oh well, I can see arguments against my point, but the use of some certain camera angles REALLY makes the point of saying that the old man is Tom Hanks. I found this movie, above all things (even manipulative) to be extremely boring. Here's another case of a movie that had a about a 12 minute story stretched out to infinity. There are hundreds of little things that made me laugh about this movie in the wrong way, and obviously I won't go into all of them but I do feel this movie makes the German Armies look rediculous, specifically in the tank scene. There is many shots of the American soldiers running across open areas with dozens of germans shooting at them but they hardly ever get shot, while the Americans seem to hit somebody with every single bullet, and three people with every explosive. Other humorous moments include Tom Hanks diffusing a potentially hostile situation by telling everybody that hes a school teacher and the weak,poetry loving-'i've never shot anybody'- soldier killing a guy for no real reason in the situation. The performances were pretty good, I guess, but the script was so laughable that most of the things the guys say make you crack up no matter how well they say them.

The war scenes are highly graphic and exciting, but it fails to shock us and reveal to us the true horrors of war.  It is pretty clear that the writers took about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon in between innings at the cricket to concoct this crap.

"wall17","3","6","13","10 July 2002"," Confuses Verisimilitude, Authenticity, Documentation, and Realism
","Much has been made of the ""realism"" of this movie because the<br/><br/>combat scenes are graphic, intense, and more accurate in the<br/><br/>range of detail than much of what came before it. But as much was<br/><br/>made of the ""authenticity"" of this movie because of the attention to<br/><br/>detail made in its preparation. For instance, Spielberg bought up<br/><br/>the last stock of original legging and strap material to make part of<br/><br/>the uniforms, real M-1 rifles, searched exhaustively for the beach<br/><br/>appropriate for shooting that was absolutely closest to the<br/><br/>appearance of Normandy in 1944, and so forth.<br/><br/>But let's think about that. What's the point of having an ""authentic""<br/><br/>cartridge belt, except that the audience knows about this from the<br/><br/>reviews, planted press stories, etc.? A replica can be made to look<br/><br/>more like the authentic thing than the authentic thing itself, given<br/><br/>the aging of the intervening years. But this was a sort of formalistic<br/><br/>post-modern exercise engaged by the filmmakers to convince<br/><br/>himself and the audience, before even seeing the movie, that<br/><br/>what they were seeing represented the ""truth"".<br/><br/><potential spoiler follows><br/><br/>The opening scene of the aged Ryan, walking the graveyards of<br/><br/>Normandy, reflecting on the sacrifice of so many of his comrades<br/><br/>just so he could walk there with his adoring grandkids, is a classic<br/><br/>example of Spielberg heavy-handedness. He has to inject a<br/><br/>tone-deaf repetition of the 'why we fight' message into the<br/><br/>beginning, end, and middle of this movie to show that it was 'all<br/><br/>worth it'. Spielberg, being a literalist, has every character in the<br/><br/>squad pontificate on the subject along the way to locate Private<br/><br/>Ryan.<br/><br/>Why? Why do eight guys get themselves killed just to save one?<br/><br/>Well, the needs of the one sometimes outweigh the needs of the<br/><br/>many. Frankly, Star Trek III made the point somewhat more subtly. <br/><br/>Or is it the words put into Tom Hanks' character's mouth, ""I'm just<br/><br/>fighting for the right to go home to my wife""? There's no elucidation<br/><br/>of this point here, just a ham-fisted morphing flashback and<br/><br/>flashforward to hammer home the point 'hey, this is connected to<br/><br/>the present' leaving the viewer to connect up the soundbyte dots.<br/><br/>I won't go into the many war movie cliches this film engages in.<br/><br/>Because Spielberg put together the celebrated first 20 minutes of<br/><br/>this movie, some of the most stunning combat sequences put on<br/><br/>film, does not excuse him the rest of the movie's repeated use of<br/><br/>B-movie props and stereotypes. Even the use of ""documentary""<br/><br/>film techniques in the combat sequences is a bit too precious: it's<br/><br/>referential to real film of real combat, but hardly 'documentary'.<br/><br/>Documentary evidence shows things that happened: this film<br/><br/>uses the technique to try to convince the viewer that a fictive,<br/><br/>simplistic interpretation of war, the whys and the whats, is ""reality"".<br/><br/>The verisimilitude of the visuals of the combat sequences does<br/><br/>not make it ""real"". Using authentic materials from World War II<br/><br/>does not make it ""real"".  At the bottom of this movie is one version<br/><br/>of a fairy tale about war.<br/><br/>For that reason I think 'Private Ryan' is a dangerous film, because<br/><br/>it's become the primary historical education for most people about<br/><br/>D-Day, World War II, and American participation in the most<br/><br/>cataclysmic event in history to date, and it's about as ""true"" to that<br/><br/>complex history as John Wayne was to the history of the West. An<br/><br/>exciting, hard-hitting action combat sequence that gets the<br/><br/>approval of veterans sixty-years removed from the events as being<br/><br/>""like what it was"" isn't history. It's constructing a virtual reality that<br/><br/>threatens to overtake, engulf, swallow, and become history, like a<br/><br/>pod person in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.<br/><br/>I am left mostly wondering what Sam Fuller could've done with<br/><br/>Spielberg's budgets."

","The first 30 minutes are great but after that the movie makes little sense. Aside from the totally ridiculous plot, the actions of the characters is pure hollywood fiction. The way they walk around nonchalantly, the bars on Hank's helmet (why not a bull's-eye), and the ridiculous notion of a sniper going anywhere near a bell tower are the things that bothered me the most. Why would they face overwhelming odds to save a bridge that the engineers could rebuild in a day? Denying it to the fleeing Germans would have been the priority. Faced with the odds that they were up against even a corporal would have had the military sense to blow the bridge before the Germans arrived and have everyone safely on the other side. Hey Spielberg, What's with the neo-nazi skinhead German soldiers? I have never seen a photograph of a WWII German soldier with a haircut remotely resembling this. I realize that actual soldiers were used as extras but you have to assume actors were given the speaking/close-up roles.

","call me cynical, or perhaps heartless, but on second viewing of this overrated film I saw straight through it. When I first saw it I was 13 years old. I was angry and angst ridden, and utterly impressionable. The film affected me. It made me rant for weeks about what evil ""ba*****s"" the French must have been during the war, and resent my French and German lessons. I didn't question it because before then I hadn't even seen a movie that reached the standards of The Shawshank Redemption, not that this is a bad film, on the contrary, it is beautiful and fantastic, but the point remains that I was decidedly naive when I saw it. <br/><br/>Fortunately, I have seen the light. I am now a film studies student and I have fallen in love with movies that make this one look, well, empty. It's nothing, really, to be honest, that Stanley Kubrick didn't do better in Full Metal Jacket. Ok, I admit that the first scene is well choreographed, well photographed, well conceived and genuinely moving. However, it seems to me that there might have been better ways to go about it, really. Someone else would have made a hugely better job of this. And well done Spielburg for Jurassic Park but I can never forgive him for inventing the Blockbuster movie with Jaws, paving the way for big family-fun action-adventure-explosion-fests. Grrrrrrrrrr. <br/><br/>The film was sickeningly sentimental to the point of being really ""corny"", in every American sense of the world. This is accelerated by the string score, which, like in most big films that want to pull the heart strings, it tells you, TELLS YOU(!), exactly when you should be feeling sad. EUGH! And what exactly is with the American flag filling the screen whilst blowing in the breeze and fading to the D-Day landings? This is such a blatant and screaming use of patriotic symbolism, it doesn't make me proud, it doesn't make me relate to the story, it doesn't do anything but make me puke.

","I saw this movie in the theater when it was released almost 20 years ago. This is what I recall: The first 20 minutes were pretty powerful. After that, not a particularly interesting, innovative or witty script, but still mildly entertaining (considering it's length). What I remember most though, is that the characters (and some dialogue) were clichés....done over and over through the years in American war films. One guy is very scared, another is super violent, etc. I don't remember the details now (it's been too long), but I absolutely cannot forget sitting in the theater thinking, ""wow, this is pretty bad - is it going to get better?"" Strip out the first 20 minutes and the multi- million dollar price tag (mostly special effects, expensive sets and pricey actors) and what you have is an average 1950s war film.<br/><br/>I'm not a Spielberg hater. I thought Duel was fantastic. I loved ET as a teenager and Schindler's List as an adult. I've seen many of his films. I can't say I'm a huge fan, but he's obviously talented.

"TomHarding04","9","3","5","16 September 2015"," Saving Private Ryan
","Summary: 4,413 men recorded dead in what is known as the turning point of World War 2, the day of days, D-day.... Until Saving Private Ryan there has not been a film that has come close to showing an entire audience through a cinema screen just how tragic, terrifying and real this war was. Saving Private Ryan is story about a group of eight men led by Captain Miller (Tom hanks) who have been assigned to bring one man home to his mother. A mother who has lost three of her sons due to this war, and to lose a forth is inconceivable. A story of courage, bravery, friendship, brother hood and belief there is hope for humanity where all hope is lost. <br/><br/>Until Saving Private Ryan there have been countless film adaptions of World war 2, but few have attempted to bring the harsh reality of war home to the viewing audience, and make you feel as if you are there. Well, Spielberg has certainly achieved this. For the first 27 minutes of the film, we witness one of cinemas most historical openings to a film, but also one of histories most tragic and important moments - D-day. You find yourself stunned into silence once the landing crafts door spins open, as instantly you see young men mowed down by German mounted machine guns, the sound of land mines, mortar fire and screaming all adds to this horrific moment. Ignorantly you find yourself questioning, and wondering why people are drowning? not running? and not firing back? But then you remember you are sat in a cinema or at home and will never experience the shear fear and loss of humanity in moments like that.<br/><br/>Like all directors, Spielberg is certainly not perfect, and there are moments throughout this film that 'lack' information, and are in some respect ""Hollywood"" such as we only witness the Americans running up Omaha beach (but never hear about Juno, Sword, Gold, Utah), and granted the majority of the soldiers storming Omaha were Americans, but where are the rest of the Allies who assisted in the Omaha landing (after all U.S.A won the war didn't they?). Regardless of some minor factual eras, this opening is none the less a cinematic master piece (which won him the Oscar for Best Director). Steven Spielberg not only aimed to show the needless, countless and horrific violence of this war, he also has tried to show us as an audience that in these dark times, humanity will find a way, and that is the basis of our story (although a fictional story, it is a heart felt and beautiful story, that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout). <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a film that has been noted, and criticised as being needlessly violent, bloody and chaotic. You cannot argue that violence, blood and chaos are entirely apparent from the get go, but you certainly cannot say it is needless. Spielberg has masterfully encapsulated a time in history where everything that was 'right', was most definitely not. <br/><br/>Cpt Miller, played by Tom Hanks, who in an Oscar nominated performance (which lets face it, you wouldn't expect any less) will embark on the mission of finding Private James Ryan (Iowa) the fourth brother, to bring him home to his grieving mother. Tom hanks is accompanied by an all star cast of seven men: Sargent Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). If this cast alone isn't an incentive to see the film, the story of their journey for humanity, justice and to risk eight lives to save one will have you by the throat throughout. As far as war films go, I can honestly say there has never been one so close to the bone that you are left speechless, and feel as if you are a witness to something you have only ever read or heard about. Each characters struggle for survival and to simply make it back home will remind you how lucky you are, but find also make you feel like you are part of this mission. One of the most powerful moments in this film, comes early on when the head of the US Army hears about the mothers loss, and decides it is right to bring the fourth brother home. Spielberg has included a letter Abraham Lincoln once wrote to a ""Mrs Bixby, in Boston"" during America's most tragic of wars, the Civil War. Although a letter written years before World War 2, it is written by one of Americas most iconic and notable presidents who's vocabulary and inspirational writing is still ever apparent today. The letter gives us a sense that somewhere in the mist of all war and unspeakable violence it is the families of these young men and women who are giving their lives that really matters. <br/><br/>""Executive Mansion, Washington, Nov. 21, 1864. Dear Madam,-- I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.<br/><br/>I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.<br/><br/>I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.<br/><br/>Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,<br/><br/>A. Lincoln"""
"tay-leff","10","3","5","30 September 2014"," Fantastic Movie!
","The 1998 war/drama film ""Saving Private Ryan"" directed by Steven Spielberg was an incredible film that was very realistic and had a storyline that kept viewers captivated until the very end. The film was rated R due to its gory war scenes and use of profanity. No young child should see the violence that this film captured to create realistic war scenes. The setting of this movie was the Invasion of Normandy during World War II. The explicit scenes had blood pouring out of soldiers, soldiers with limbs cut off, men screaming and shaking, and soldiers being shot. All of this captured the brutality of World War II in such a way that the audience could feel the adrenaline and fear that each one of those soldiers would have been facing out on the battle field. The gruesomeness of the movie forces the viewer to have respect for the soldiers for moving forward with their duties even though they are surrounded by death of not only their enemies but their friends. <br/><br/>The special effects throughout the entire movie were incredible. The explosions of fire and dust were very realistic to an actual bomb going off. All of the sounds of gun shots gave the image of a battle field even when one closed their eyes. It had to have taken a lot of effort to put together scenes where so many men were shot in various places. The opening battle scene, where the United States Army was trying to secure Omaha Beach was almost as if World War II was recorded and the real footage was put into the movie. Men had blood spewing out of their wounds where they were shot, some of their limbs were completely gone, and one man laid on the ground holding his intestines into his body. Another scene had a soldier being held by his friends after being shot many times. Each wound had blood pouring out of it so realistically that I had to turn away from the screen. These are just a few examples of the almost too realistic wounds that could make the audience feel nauseous if they were too squeamish about blood.<br/><br/>The storyline to the movie was one that could capture the attention of a wide range of audiences. It was a movie on history, war, friendships, comradery and family. Several of the infantry members sent on the mission to find a man who lost all of his brothers to war could not understand why they had to risk their lives to tell a single man he was allowed to go home. Many of them started out their journey mocking the boy, saying he would not be worth it. When they finally found him and told him that he was allowed to go home and he refused to leave the men he was with behind, it sparked a fire in the men that the audience could see. The inspiration the audience felt when a man who just found out he had lost three of his brothers stays to help defend the people in his unit was overwhelming. Not only did he stay and so did the rest of the men who came to find him, but most of those men died willingly to protect their country and save the young boy to give him a chance at going home alive.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks portrayed Captain Miller, one of the main characters throughout the movie. He did a fantastic job with presenting the characters mental dilemmas. We see him struggling throughout the movie with an uncontrollable shaking hand but whenever someone asked if he was alright, he avoided the question and just moved on. We are able to tell that the war is taking a toll on his mental health because often we see him staring off, hearing nothing, when he is in the middle of combat. The viewer sympathizes because we see the tremendous amount of stress he is under. He sees all of the same things that the soldiers he is commanding are, yet he has to remain strong and act as though none of the brutality phases him. The movie ends in a heart wrenching scene where Captain Miller dies saving Private Ryan, even though he had the chance to go home and see his wife before he made the decision to stay and help defend the small group of men Private Ryan did not want to abandon. His final words hit home to Private Ryan and the audience as he tells Private Ryan to ""earn it"". The impact that those two words had on Private Ryan are taken throughout his life because at the end of the movie we see him getting emotional in front of Captain Millers grave, where he asks his wife if he was a decent man. It was a tear jerking moment as the audience got to whiteness a grown soldier asking for the respect of a man who died saving his life. All 170 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were captivating and exhilarating. As I sat watching the film I felt as though I was on the battle field with these men getting to know each and every one of them. Each personality came through even if they did not speak many words. This film is a 5 star movie and is worth seeing because it will have you trying to fight back the tears, whether male or female at the end."

And not just over the top violence that you may find in a Quentin Tarantino movie. This violence is very real. It's horrifying to watch hundreds of soldiers die in the Ohama Beach scene.

","I've been an avid fan of war films ever since I was a kid. I was fond of seeing movies where soldiers are holding out on their own and winning against their opponent even though the odds are overwhelmingly against them. That's why when I got to see Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, I instantly got hooked. <br/><br/>The realism of the movie is great and it showed me another side of the war – its gruesomeness. It made me realize that no matter what rank or whether that person is of utmost importance, it won't matter in front of a speeding bullet heading towards his head or a mortar about to land near him. The way the movie was depicted, blown-off body parts and all, was very real that it sometimes made me shiver whenever I think that I was that person getting shot – lucky me, huh? <br/><br/>The portrayal of each of the cast was unbelievably real, especially that part where the general was about to send that letter to Ryan's mother and his story – I really got emotional right there. Well, I'm not going to spoil you the details, especially if you haven't watched it yet. The movie is a must watch and there are numbers that can prove it. In a nutshell, Saving Private Ryan is a movie that deserves to be called ""the best""."

","One of the remarkable piece of movie marvel by Steven Spielberg. If Spielberg has added the directorial ingredient then Tom Hanks has ensured the perfect cooking of the added ingredient.

In fact, the music resonates with the heart and soul of the viewer and delivers the essence of this fine art remarkably. The last few words by Capt. Miller ""James earn this...

","To call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement. What Spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making. This is emotional, unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there. <br/><br/>Now is this the most original story ever told? No. The storm of Normandy has been shown before. The story has been told before. (This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)<br/><br/>However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most real battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!<br/><br/>Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there. (Some could not finish watching the scene) So if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie. See this! It centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world. To be clear though, this movie is not just about that war. The story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a man.<br/><br/>OK, how about the rest of the movie? The searching and hopefully the rescue of Private Ryan? Excellent! You will be interested and want to know what happens. A great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end. Oh and Mr. Spielberg does a fantastic job in book ending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all together.<br/><br/>I original saw this with my dad on it's original release in theaters. After the movie I asked him what he thought. He literally could not speak for like twenty minutes. You walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie. A small glimpse of our history and US as human beings enduring all the horror, war, laughter, tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on."

","Wow... I've seen this movie once before, and I decided to watch it again this evening and it had the same effect on me that it did the first time I watched it. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that stays with you long after you watch it.It is affecting and moving, gritty and powerful. You watch this film and you see the hell that is war.You see what it does to people, it dehumanizes them , it strips away their moral compass, their values.The movie is violent and sickeningly realistic, but its violence and graphic scenes are not numbing, you are never detached from the what the soldiers are going through. You watch the action unfold and you are there, you are there feeling the pain of the soldiers.Steven Spielberg has once again drawn us in emotionally to the story. Just as he did with Schindler's list, he uses his gift for compelling story telling and character development, to immerse us in the story,to make us care for the characters.The acting was top notch as well. Tom Hanks,as Capt. John Miller, did an amazing job,probably one of his best roles(besides Forrest Gump and Philadelphia) as did Matt Damon (Private Ryan). The whole cast was perfect and fit right into each of their roles. The underlying score of John Williams, one of my favorite score composers(E.T, Jurassic Park, Star wars, etc.),was used in the right moments,creating tension and at other times, tugging at your heart strings.One of the best movies by Spielberg and ONE of the best WWII movies(not the best but one of them)."

","This movie is excellent. Historically accurate, great cast. I specifically started an account on IMDb so I could write a review on this movie. The only bit that made me cry was at the end when Miller whispers to Ryan those words. Great film, would recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>*Spoiler Alert* The film is very strong emotionally in the death scenes, especially at the end where Miller dies and I cried a lot! It is very gory in many parts, especially the beach scene, and the bridge fight which is very intense and results in 3 main characters dying unfortunately.<br/><br/>This is hand down my favorite movie of all time and would recommend it to anyone interested in those sorts of films."
"deathmybeloved","10","3","5","20 May 2010"," A thank you to all veterans
","Growing up, I knew that my family had a lot of history in the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. My grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the Pacific, and my grandmother's brothers were Marines alongside them. My grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there, and he always just bowed his head, swallowed hard, and told half truths and ""beside-the-point"" stories to appease whoever asked- never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow Americans were- heroes.<br/><br/>I had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldn't talk about WWII, but one day in my U.S. History class in high school I got my answer. This film opened my eyes to the horrors of war. I sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me, wondering how soldiers and Marines like those in my family lived- or whats more, were able to cope with the events that made them heroes.<br/><br/>My point with all of this is that in this day and age, we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we don't really realize what fighting men go through in times of war. We see ""10 soldiers killed in Iraq"" on the news, but it doesn't really register to us as civilians. This was Spielburg's goal in making this film. He wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us- you and me. Every American Citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safe.<br/><br/>As far as the film itself goes, it is absolutely amazing. No film is perfect, but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles. The emotion is there, the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt, the best war movie ever made.<br/><br/>One thing to note is that this is NOT a film for your kids or a film to watch casually. It is intense and should be treated as such.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Ziya90","10","3","5","13 January 2010"," No ideology can resist such a piece of cinema triumph
","I visited the forums, read reviews in IMDb, read reviews of critics, talked to the people around me and as I see, people are not excited about the movie like me, it means that they don't see the greatness of the movie? or are there some other reasons? I want to give the example of The Terminator 2. If you have seen the movie, you know that, according to many people, it is the greatest action movie ever made. In IMDb, you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie. Firstly, I want to talk about that, why Saving Private Ryan is not appreciated in its genre, war like The Terminator 2? People are very cold towards this movie, as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie. Or they say that Omaha Beach sequence was cool (enough?) but the rest was bad. Now, at this point, I want to say that now I am writing a review on the movie which to me, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is pure cinema, maybe not a work of art, but a truly cinematic experience. Direction, the cinematography, editing, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects (briefly mise-en-scene) are great, the shots are great. You know, if a war movie includes action, people say that disliked it, because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic, but what if this is the style of the director? The Thin Red Line was also very artistic, but is this really a flaw? Returning to the content or the messages of the film, people say propaganda, militarist, one sided etc. As a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda, I don't care about ideology while thinking about this movie. As for one sided criticism, always the same, it shows the enemy side as evil. Does somebody have to make two movies like Clint Eastwood if he makes a war movie? Well, if you ask me, No. By the way, the scene which the German soldier sings an American march is criticized, so people say Spielberg humiliates Germans. If you want to 'read' it like that, do it, but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene. The best (or the most horrible?) D-Day interpretation is here. At this point, as said before, a lot of people think that just Omaha Beach sequence was just cool. I think it is more than that. Also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success. Lastly, in the middle of the movie, there is a sequence, it rains and later they find a little girl, that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director."

"bobsgrock","10","3","5","27 May 2008"," Far more than just a film...
","Steven Spielberg accomplished something here; something that may rival Schindler's List as his masterpiece and the greatest work he ever did in his extraordinary career. Here, with this film, he shows a side of World War II we all have read about but never saw. While he couldn't completely make it a reality, watching this movie is about as close as any of us will get to experiencing such historical events like D-Day. That being said, this is so much more than just a film that chronicles the story of eight men sent to find one in the German-controlled areas of France. Spielberg here paints a picture of the price and the consequences of war and certainly doesn't glamorize anything. The first half hour of the film is almost exclusively set right in the middle of the action as US forces storm Omaha Beach and try to stay alive amidst the torrential downpour of bullets and bombs. This scene alone earned Spielberg the Best Director Oscar and makes this film one of the great war films of all time. Still, he takes it to another level and gives us characters that we can view as simple everyday men on a mission that they don't believe in trying to find a man they know or care nothing about. To be frank, this is more than a film. It is more than an experience. It is a lesson on war and the complications it brings and the sacrifice it requires. That is what makes this a classic and maybe the best war film ever made. These men gave all they could and something most of us will never have to worry about; they gave their lives and in turn saved so many."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","5","1 February 2008"," Visually rich with a stunning and honest depiction of war
","Many of us can't truly say we know what World War II looked like, but I would venture to say that Steven Spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg, in his second attempt to capture the WWII era on the big screen, has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiers.<br/><br/>Worthy of the most praise is the incredibly well-deserved second Oscar win for the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski. The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.<br/><br/>Here is wear ""Ryan"" succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.<br/><br/>The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do. Those of us who aren't veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it."

","This is one of many of my favorite Tom Hanks movies and also Steven Spielberg's too. This is movie is rated as the best war movie ever made and I felt same after watching this movie.<br/><br/>The especialty of this movie is the characters in the movie and all the actors played their part with par excellence. The movie is very much able to show the grief of the mothers and families. Major attraction of the movie also includes the combat scenes from the movie.<br/><br/>Although people can say that Tom Hanks character as the lead or main role of the movie but I say that all characters were major in this movie and that was because Steven Spielberg distributed the screen space so well between all the characters of the movie that you never feel that any of the character is left out or suppressed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks character is filled of different shades where he shows his intelligence with some brilliant strategy to win the battle at the coast then at the same character can seen weeping in the middle of battle field remembering his life post the war.<br/><br/>The dialogs in the movie are also very touching. I personally really liked the scene when the Army supreme (don't remember much about him) reads out a letter by president ""Abraham Lincoln"" showing condolence to the a mother who lost all of her kids in the war for the nation.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie due to any reason then I would recommend you to buy a DVD and watch it with whole family."

","Just leave it up to the genius of a master like Steven Spielberg to depict WW II in all it's gruesomeness, chaos and inhumanity. This is about the only war-movie that I have ever seen where you just simply become stunned, overwhelmed and shocked by a pandemonium of apocalyptic pictures, sounds and dialogs who ring nothing but true. This film doesn't shy away from stating a simple message, the message that war dehumanizes the human mind and bares open a bestiality that ponders on the verge of uneducated seaweed in terms of emotions. I congratulate you, Steven Spielberg, for being brave and courageous in your way of showing us that war is hell, that it is tedious, brutal, sometimes even boring but most important of all: definitely no laughing matter. This honest and depressing examination of the human condition should definitely have won the Best-Picture-Oscar in 1980. Oh wait, I just realized that this isn't the comment-board for ""1941""... sorry, my mistake!"
"dbararev","10","3","5","26 August 2007"," A Great Movie from a Great Moviemaker
","great movie.. from a great director but what else is new? I really like the movie and I will tell you why but let me first quote the even greater Charles Bukowski: ""You begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; all else is grandiose romantism or politics."" well lets emphasis on the romantism because romantism is the genre of this movie. why? What do the soldiers represent in the war - the simple man. The simple man in extraordinary circumstances - romantism, a genre in Literature. The war is the extraordinary circumstance and the ""one man at a time"" is private Ryan. Now most of the negativism about the movie comes from the grandiose story but Spielberg presents the story with historical facts so the film doesn't feel too distant or too Hollywood. The Camera follows the actors in the sand and the piles of dead bodies. We see guts, blood, limbs. We see from their point of view while the battle unfolds. Spielberg has always had ""an eye"" for the photography but here he puts it to the limit. His vision is undeniable because its personal and because its a movie, it brings out a world before the viewers eyes and they cant judge the characters who by the way are perfectly created by the actors, Tom Hanks in a blowing-our-minds-of-performance, because its an extraordinary circumstance in which the simple man tries to figure out a way to survive or to do the right thing.<br/><br/>In the end the old Ryan ask if he has lived a good life, if he is a good person, if he has earned it as Capt. Miller aka Tom Hanks told him before he died. In a way the movie is philosophical but I think that it is more like a book, you read it and think about it - what it means and what it is about, in contexts means, because its a great movie, it does what a great movie does - says what it suppose to say."
"anchorman360","10","3","5","17 August 2007"," My Favorite War Movie
","In my opinion saving private Ryan is the most entertaining and realistic war movie you can find to have been released. It takes place during ww2 and starts out with the invasion of Normandy known as d-day shown as excruciatingly violent. Right after this 8 men receive a mission to find a private Ryan because his other three brothers have already died in the war. The men begin to wonder why the 8 of them are risking their lives to save just another soldier. Tom Hank gives a very good performance as the leader of the team who keeps the group together when things start to go wrong. Tom Sizemore is the second man in command, Ed Burns is the soldier who doesn't like the mission more than anyone of them, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davies are three other soldiers in the group. Vin Diesel and Giovonni Ribisi are the two men who die before they find Private Ryan played by Matt Damon. The movie is 2 and 3/4 hours long but move along fast and ends before you know it. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on something special."

","Saving Private Ryan is such a powerful and necessary film and one everyone should watch at one point in their life.<br/><br/>It's a simple story; a small group of soldiers are given a mission to retrieve the last surviving of four brothers from behind enemy lines in France. The symbolism of this story and of Ryan himself are profound and personal for all of us today who are partakers of the rights and freedoms given to those liberated by the allied invasion of Europe. The graphic depiction of what these men went through to establish that freedom gives us a difficult reminder of how much we each as individuals owe these men  veterans that are still with us actually went through this! I remember feeling so grateful for their sacrifice, and I left the cinema not so much entertained but shaken. The depth and accuracy of this film remains a testament and a tribute to those brave people, and not the filmmakers themselves. The acting is honest and superb, and the characters are as rich and interesting and ordinary as the real soldiers they could represent. The first time I watched this it was difficult to watch and there were several times when I had to just look away. A technical marvel, an incredible achievement for Steven Spielberg, who remains for me the greatest filmmaker ever."

","After directing such films as Jaws, E.T., and Schindler's List, I don't think that anybody thought that Steven Spielberg could do anything better.<br/><br/>Well, he did.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan, the greatest war film ever made, is undoubtedly Spielberg's masterpiece. Forget that it lost the Best Picture Academy Award to the utterly forgettable Shakespeare in Love; This film transcends all other war films before it, and will continue to be the standard for all war films after it.<br/><br/>From the very first gunshot on the beaches of Normandy (which is still the most shockingly brilliant scene in any movie in history) until the final shot is fired in the small French town at the end of the movie (quite possibly the 2nd most shockingly brilliant scene in history), the movie grabs your attention and refuses to let go. You squirm as the camera follows brave soldiers into the heat of battle out of fear of being shot yourself, and you feel each soldier's pain when one of their own falls in combat. After Private Ryan's thank you to Captain Miller at the end of the movie, we can't help but thank Captain Miller along with him. And we thank Spielberg, too, for creating one of the best films of all time for us to enjoy."

","I have read several critiques of this movie claiming that the opening sequence and continuing doctrine are ""unrealistic"". These ""Experts"" claim that the opening scene is far too bloody and doesn't accurately describe what the fighting would have been like, and that the standard operating procedures of the squad are ""Hollywood"".<br/><br/>I challenge these ""experts"" to put aside their ideology and bias and look at how a military operation actually works and what is involved.<br/><br/>The Normandy invasion was the largest movement of troops and personal in the history of the world, and that mere accomplishment stands with the building of the Pyramids or the Hanging Gardens. It was a classic case of ""being willing to pay the butcher's bill"" for a victory. Saying that there were only 10% casualties is accurate, but it is an insult to the bravery of the 34,250 men that landed on the most heavily fortified real estate in the world. And especially to those going in the first wave, where casualties were known to be the highest (in some cases over 80%). 34,250 men don't all step off onto the beach at the same time.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" opens with the first wave of troop carriers going on to Omaha Beach. The defenders are there waiting for them, and therefore the casualty rates among these units will be high. The opening scene accurately describes this. My grandfather was part of the second wave onto Omaha and his eyewitness testimony confirms this.<br/><br/>The breakdown of US casualties was 1465 dead, 3184 wounded, 1928 missing (presumed dead) and 26 captured. In the Annals of American History, only Antietam ranks higher in American casualties suffered in a single day.<br/><br/>Several Airborne Rangers I've interviewed (including my father & grandfather) remark on the realism of the squad's interaction. These were not people sneaking through a jungle afraid of being ambushed, these were men that knew that surrounding territory was largely abandoned or populated by French that are hoping to be liberated. Virtually any patrol they encounter would be mechanized and be audible miles away.<br/><br/>As for being able to ""pick up a radio and contact Ryan's unit to get him out"", units in World War II were often out of radio contact for days, occasionally weeks, at a time and had to operate autonomously. There were no GPS satellites and no cell phones. Many soldiers didn't understand French or German. Getting lost was common and a wrong turn would mean hours of delay and confusion. While I can't say the mission made a lot of sense to me from a military point of view, once the mission was ordered this was about the only way it could have been carried out.<br/><br/>And yes, rank insignia was displayed (in muted color) on helmets of officers, just as it is today."

I really do feel for the American and other allies that fought in WWII, I pay great respect for fighting for our freedom.<br/><br/>Other note is the soundtrack, again John Williams has done this spot on, in fact the soundtrack to this film was the first movie soundtrack I brought. It is a very emotional soundtrack which I have listened to many times. All ten tracks are amazing and it's very hard to pick a favourite from them, although: 1. Hymn to the Fallen 2. Revisiting Normandy 3. Omaha Beach 4.Wade's Death Are most probably my favourites. This is a must see and must own film. <br/><br/>I rarely rate films 10/10 but this sure means that score. 10/10."

I mean Shakespeare in Love is a great movie, but I think that the patriotism exemplified in Saving Private Ryan is far more worthy of an Oscar than a romance film.

","After the assault on Omaha beach, a group of US soldiers, led by Cpt Miller (Hanks), are sent on a mission to retrieve the sole surviving Ryan brother (Damon). Success will earn them the right to return home.<br/><br/>After giving a definitive representation of the holocaust with the excellent ""Schindler's List"" and of slavery with ""Amistad"", Spielberg surprised the world again. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a synergy of old ""men on a mission"" style war films, yet completely redefined how conflicts are to be portrayed on film. The film set a tone of savagery, violence and futility that has marked all war films since (and was perfected in Ridley Scott's awesome ""Black Hawk Down""). As a visualist and action director, Spielberg can count this film as yet another resounding triumph. Whenever the tension goes up, as in the horrific opening battle (cinema's most visceral 20 minutes) or the closing siege, Saving Private Ryan surpasses almost any war film in existence.<br/><br/>the film is sadly not without its problems, and it is truly regrettable that Robert Rodat's script isn't up to the standards of Spielberg's direction. Whenever the tension dies down and leaves room for character moments, the film comes dangerously close to silliness or sappiness, ticking many of the worst genre clichés in ways that could make it seem like a flag-waiver despite the obvious overall absurdity the film tries to convey. It is a tribute to the acting talents of Damon, Burns, Ribisi, Sizemore and especially Hanks that the film survives such moments, even if a lame last scene undermines the film's power.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has proved its importance and relevance through the considerable influence it has had on cinema action."
"tnzk","9","3","5","2 October 2006"," One of Spielberg's finest.
","'Saving Private Ryan' is not meant to glorify war, rather, it tries to show the audience the pain and suffering of not soldiers, but people.<br/><br/>Beginning with the fateful D-Day which has influenced popular video games and other war movies, a company of soldiers is given the mission of pulling a private out from the war front. Confused and annoyed at this objective, the soldiers travel across Normandy in search of someone they never knew, let alone cared about.<br/><br/>The band of soldiers have a hard time coming to terms with such an obscure mission. However, they cannot bail out of the objective. After all, they are in the army. Obeying orders can be the difference between winning or losing.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg masterfully creates a duality in the characters: at once they are soldiers, yet at heart they are only civilians. The cast of characters are exceptional: Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks), keeps the group together and just wants to get the objective over and done with. Pvt. Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the Godfearing soldier who believes his Lord has given him such talent with the sniper rifle. Pvt. Richard Reibens (Edward Burns) is the one who questions the authority, and feels the mission is unnecessary, and the rest round up the company beautifully. These men are not cookie cutter soldiers: They talk with each other, have feelings, reflect upon their actions; Spielberg brings out the 'other' side of the men at war, and this is what the audience (especially war veterans) can relate to.<br/><br/>The direction is great. Spielberg's shots are moving: War is dirty and horrifying, and the bonding between the soldiers are sensitive scenes. The cinematography is excellent, some of the best I have seen from any movie. The sound aspects are just as good, if not better, in depicting the harshness of war.<br/><br/>'Saving Private Ryan' is a movie not to be missed, partly because it is arguably the greatest war movie ever made, and partly because it will deter those from the idea of another great war."

","I'm a high school student, and recently, before a trip to visit the D-Day beaches in Normandy, we had a vet who was a medic on D-Day come in and talk to our class. We asked him about his experiences AT D-Day, and he was disinclined to talk too much about it, but said that the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were like a newsreel. He even told a story briefly about trying to save a man, dragging the man behind him, only to discover after a little ways that he only had the top half of the man, and that the rest had been blown off, which was actually depicted in the movie. I really appreciated the artistic qualities of the movie as well. The muted color added a somber atmosphere to the movie, and the way Spielberg used realistic equipment and sound effects really impressed me.

","I'm usually a big fan of Spielberg,but in this film he comes across as a bit to anti-German,he may have his reasons and i think he has made them clear in Schindlers List,and i understand his feelings.But i think for a big epic like this it would have been better to have an unbiased portrayal of Germans so the film would have been universally admired,instead its coming across as anti-German propaganda especially when there is so much American flag-waving.Being English i have the same problem with Braveheart,Scots=good English=bad,this is really one dimensional character study,which just teaches people to live in ignorance,we all need to learn to move on.Surely its better to make films every culture is going to relate to,flag waving just promotes arrogance which leads to looking down on others.The other big problem i have with this film is that the Brits are not mentioned,or if we are i must have missed it,i must have blinked.This was a decisive battle and i know like thousands of other Brits we were involved,so whats the big idea?It would be like us making a film about the Somme or Ypes and not bothering to mention the Canadian and Australian involvement,that would be unforgivable."

I mean you show a seen at Omaha beach on Jun 6,1944 and the moment the ramps go down already the first three or four rows of solider literally get blown to bits. After that you see more solider get shot, killed, and wounded until some solider finally get up to the bunkers and take out the Nazis's, and to top all that off you see the beach after it covered with dead bodies and big puddles of blood. then you hear that 8 men have to save 1 man who lost all three of his brothers and after more violence you see that of the 8 men sent out only 2 are still alive. I can't think of any reason why you couldn't be moved by this film. This is a must see film for anyone interested in war films."
"kyle_style_111","10","3","5","3 February 2006"," Saving Private Ryan Is My Favorite Movie
","I am a harsh critic of movies. I bash everything. There is rarely a movie that I can sit down and watch and enjoy because most are crude and bland. I never pay attention to the hype, I don't care.I judge a movie on what it is about, what it is portraying, and how well it is made. Before I saw it, Saving Private Ryan didn't interest me. I liked dramas and war flicks and stories but I was just never interested in seeing Saving Private Ryan because of the title.<br/><br/>One day however my mother rented the flick and I decided to watch it. Man....the opening scene was a shocker. It also really showed how that day went down. I find it fascinating how Capt. John Miller takes charge. A soldier asks him, ""Where's the rallying point?"" Miller responds,""Anywhere but here"". I mean thats how you feel right there, like they need to get off that forsaken beach. It's neat how you get to see the characters in action on the beach before you even get into the main plot. So many different things happen in the movie. I pay attention and every time I watch it I see something new. I've probably seen it 20-30 times. I don't know why anyone would want to bash it. It is well directed, and well acted. It takes place during a time that should be well respected. It wasn't weak because it left so much of the other fighting in the war out. It is called ""Saving Private Ryan"", not ""the Documentary of World War 2"". Even though it is almost like a documentary. It's about a mission that is unlike other missions. It's about finding a soldier, and getting him the hell out of there. It's not about fighting with the British to save France and the whole Allied powers from Hitler. It was based on something smaller, but at the same time larger. A mother's love for her son, and how even in the military they respect that. We all got mothers and how terrible would they feel if they lost all their son's. even Cpt. Miller's squad was taught respect from the matter. They questioned it and some disagreed and sure they would rather be out fighting the war, but that was their orders, and they had to follow. After all, if they found Ryan, and made it out of that forsaken crap whole of a mess, maybe then they would all earn the right to go home. <br/><br/>Anyway I would just like to say I think all the characters are great. It was Vin Diesel's best movie, I think his only good movie even though he was the first of Miller's men to die. Pvt. Jackson, I think he is many people's favorite. The way he takes down the sniper that kills Caparzo (Diesel) and battles in the Church tower at the battle for the bridge. Nothing can describe the way Tom Hanks reacts when he see's the Church tower get hit by the tank round. He feels sorrow, because of the loss of such a fine sniper, but he just keeps shooting. I like how Reiben doesn't care about the mission at first and even steps out of line. He learns what it's all about though, and he even saves Ryan at the end from a tank. Sgt. Horvath, what a great actor. Tom Siezmore. Hanks couldn't ask for a better partner. You can really feel the relationship between Miller and Horvath. Like when Capt. Miller steps out to create a diversion and Machine gun Fire rains down but Miller gets out of the way in time and Horvath says,""Captain if your Mother saw you do that she's be very upset."" Then Hanks replies,""I thought you were my mother"". Lol.I believe out of all the men in Miller's squad Horvath is hit by the most rounds. He showed the mentality of a brave soldier that died for his men. Obviously Upham was the sensitive type, that finally killed someone in the end. Mellish portrayed a good soldier, that did also seem a bit sensitive, as he cries while finding a Hitler Youth Knife.(He is Jewish so I guess he's not really sensitive, just effected greatly by the events because of his ethnicity) Of course Wade was also well portrayed. When he died it was the saddest. <br/><br/>Anyway, in the end, Captain John Miller tries to blow up the bridge but a tank round launches debris and sends everything into chaos. Miller then tries to retrieve the detonator and is shot on the bridge where he falls. He then sits up and takes his pistol out and starts shooting at the tank that is about to cross the bridge. The tank explodes and in amazement Miller looks up to see the ""Angels on our shoulders"" P51 tank busters fly over head. Then with his last breath he says to Ryan ""James, earn this.....earn it"" And then it goes to James as an old man in the memorial in France with thousands of crosses. And he is of course kneeling down in front of Miller's cross with the rest of Miller's squad's crosses trying to make peace with their sacrifice for his life. James then looks at his wife and says, ""Tell me I've lead a good life, tell me I'm a good man"" Then She replies,""You are"" And it really makes me think about how I should live, that those died to save me. That I need to be a good man, and respect what I have because so many others lost their lives, just so I could go home. <br/><br/>To wrap it up, Saving Private Ryan had everything. Some comedy, drama, love, action, and even some good looking dames. You can't deny that James Ryan's daughter's were some good looking ladies. Anyway I didn't know a movie could be that good until I saw Saving Private Ryan. Go Stephen Spielberg!"
"bunjiworm","8","3","5","17 January 2006"," One of the most spectacular War Movies you will ever see!
","Where to begin? I have to say that 'Saving Private Ryan' is a modern masterpiece, and that negative criticism is basically aimed at opportunities which failed to make this the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>The plot is simple - Captian Miller, played by Tom Hanks, and his squad of soldiers are given a new assignment following the Normandy Invasion: to find Private James Ryan, played by Matt Damon, who happened to be a paratrooper of the 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>The War scenes, despite being truly upsetting and gruesomely realistic, are visually fantastic. The attention to detail by Spielberg is fantastic. The full frame is filled with explosions and whizzing bullets, not to mention with the main subject. However, there is not ONE British soldier in France. Not a single soldier. This definitely doesn't overshadow what I personally think is one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>The movie has no message. The movie is more sentimental, acknowledging the past, and what our older generation went through in order to keep our country safe, as well as to protect our current, or their future generation. We all know we owe it all to those soldiers. All we can do is mourn our losses, and appreciate, with all of our hearts, the soldiers that made it back home. And, in a way, this film brings people together. Don't watch this with elderly family members otherwise you'll embrace a several sad, and soppy moments.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. Watching soldiers cry is extremely disturbing in my opinion. They fight against their will to survive in order to complete their mission and fulfil a strategy. And when you are told to duck, you DO duck! Fantastic movie. If you liked Band Of Brothers and felt Thin Red Line could of been better, you'll faint by the effort poured into this excellent film.<br/><br/>Pocket yourself with cash and Rent it now."

I felt as though I was going through everything the characters in the movie went through, and when I was walking home, I distinctly remember feeling a sense of what is probably ""Shell Shock."" I remember thinking, ""What's the point to everything?"" which is something people often struggle through after going to war. This work is more than a movie, its an experience. Sadly its not possible to get quite such an intense feeling when watching it at home unless you have a terrific home theater. The giant screen I saw this movie on added to the incredible effect of the movie which fully enveloped me in the world of the story.<br/><br/>The opening scene is one of the best scenes ever put to film.

","I commented on this in a different thread, but I thought that it deserved mentioning again. How can any of you think that the German soldier Upham shoots at the end of the movie isn't the same one he convinced Cpt. Miller to let go earlier? Aside from looking EXACTLY like him (and don't reply some crap about that being just a coincidence and that's what all Germans look like) he says Upham's name when he is pleading for his life. How would the soldier know Upham's name (and don't reply ""he read it on his uniform"" just to try to make a point just because a smart ass idea popped into your head and you are more than willing to start a fight over the internet. You fat attention seeking nerd) * The German obviously said Upham's name in a desperate attempt to get Upham to let him go again. Aside from that, all of a sudden for no reason Upham grows balls and decides to kill this one German and let all the rest go? He shot him because he recognized him as the same German from earlier, and that's what allowed Upham the nads to finally shoot someone.<br/><br/>* Yes I know that I'm being redundant by calling those who seek to pick fights over the internet fat nerds, please no replies telling me this."
"jimboduck","8","3","5","5 June 2005"," Wartime Grit with an Unlikely Premise  8 (Very Good)
","This Academy Award Winning Best Picture of 1998 contains the grittiest, most graphic war scenes I've ever seen on film. On top of that, the film quality is pristine and the high-speed equipment used to shoot the movie is nothing short of groundbreaking in the war genre. That being the case, does the artistic quality of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN automatically overshadow/surpass the other movies of 1998 like American History X or Run Lola Run for example? Perhaps so.<br/><br/>Still, as I attribute the entire 8 stars to artistic merit, the last two gaping empty stars must be addressed. The premise that the movie is based upon, namely the mission of bringing back one soldier to his mother mandated by the war department, is simply something I cannot swallow. What's the word I want to use to describe how I feel about the impetus for the movie? It's not cheesy, nor is it saccharine. I feel as if it's an insult to my intelligence. Let me spell this out word for word...<br/><br/>First of all, I simply don't understand why history has been racked with so many wars. I'm not rabidly anti-war per Se. I just want to understand why the people of one nation collectively want to kill the people of another nation. IMDb is not the place to discuss such issues at length, so let's assume for now that wars are fought for any of a million reasons: defense, propagation of freedom, power, resources, territory, maybe the utter lack of something better to do.<br/><br/>Now here is my gripe with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which otherwise is a masterpiece. If the war department is focusing all of its energy and machinery on the above mentioned war objectives, is it plausible for them to really care about one kid or his mother? I am curious how the parents of American soldiers killed in Iraq feel when they watch this movie. I just cannot for one second believe that the American defense department would go to such lengths for any single individual.<br/><br/>Rather than swallow this implausible premise hook line and sinker, I would more enjoy a film that exposes the real modus operandi behind bloodthirsty war machinery. Platoon or Apocalypse Now are considered classics, and rightly so given the grimy mood each depicts. But despite is technologically phenomenal production, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is too heavy with the flag-waving patriotic Dreamworks score and tells a story you'd only find off the shelves of Disney Corporation -- one that is sugar-coated at the core and just plain fantasy.<br/><br/>JY<br/><br/>jimboduck-dot-com"
"led_zeppelin_zoso","9","3","5","3 May 2005"," greatest war film ever made
","As i started watching this movie i was grabbed by the battle on Omaha beach because of Speilbergs vision of the scenario. As always Spielberg will get you excited with his movie and not let go, he will add in wonderful visuals and just simply amaze you with his realistic perspective.<br/><br/>Within the first scene i thought i wouldn't see another gun battle that great in my whole life, but likely enough there was an even better one at the end of the movie when they find Privat Ryan(Damon) and he says he wont leave his men behind. After Ryan tells them he is not going Hanks has to prepare for another battle, probably the most exciting and intense one ever.<br/><br/>One thing you have to take into perspective is that John Williams(composer of film) was one of the people who made this movie intense with his wonderful score to keep you intrigued throughout. I was happy for Spielberg when he one Best Director for the second time(previous for Schindlers List) but i thought this should have won Best Picture and Best Actor for Hanks.

"TheNorthernMonkee","9","3","5","29 July 2004"," Powerful film, but not quite perfect
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>When that legendary British statesman, Winston Churchill, stated ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few"", he was of course referring to the Battle Of Britain. Skipping forward through the war and eventually the allies would succeed in that momentous occasion of D-Day. Landing on the beaches of Normandy, the British, American and other Allied forces would eventually free Europe from the tyranny of the fascists. War has never been simple however, and once in a while, a form of publicity mission might take place. An incident where, during all the blood loss, soldiers would take risks to save one man, just so his mother doesn't loose all of her children. It's always been a strange American military policy in the eyes of many, but as ""Saving Private Ryan"" shows, there are times it happens.<br/><br/>In Spielberg's epic war film, Tom Hanks plays Captain John Miller. Former school teacher and now war veteran, Miller survives the D-Day Landings, only to be ordered to go and retrieve a Private John. F. Ryan (Matt Damon). Ryan's three elder brothers have all died in the last week and the army, aware of this wants the remaining brother to return home. Against Miller's better judgement he travels with about nine men, to find Ryan and return him safely to his mother.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" rightly earned Steven Spielberg his second directing Oscar and arguably should have won more. This film is a powerful piece which is at times moving, at times strenuous and always going to keep you glued to the screen. With an enormous cast of well known actors (some which you'll know the names of and some you'll recognise the faces), the film is never short of someone who can deliver a line. It's not these lines which really hit home as much though as the most crucial and most powerful scene in this entire movie is the opening thirty minutes during the Landings themselves. There's no way someone who was born forty years after the end of the war is going to be able to tell you how realistic this film was, but if the events were anything like the film depicted, then the younger generations should be immensely grateful to have never had to taken part in anything similar.<br/><br/>Perhaps the one problem with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an element of bias. There's always someone around Britain who claims the rest of the Allies could have won the war without America, just like there's Americans who claim they did the majority of the victory and are owed everyone else's eternal gratitude. The truth of the matter is that neither person is right. If America had never got involved then it is likely that just like the rest of Europe, Britain would have fallen to Germany. Ultimately however, with American help, the British still played a massive part in the War and earned praise as much as any country. The problem is that this film seems to ignore this fact. If Tom Hank's soldiers had travelled around the French countryside and met mostly Americans but also a few British, there would have been less problems. The flaw is that this film appears at times to imply that the entire second world war involved purely the Americans, the French and the Germans. There is not a single British person in sight in this entire film. Churchill would not have approved and countless other Brits don't either.<br/><br/>This lack of British involvement has perhaps slightly hampered ""Saving Private Ryan"" at times, but this is a mistake. Whether this film is extremely over patriotic or not (beginning and ending with the American flag for example), that does not take away from it as a beautiful piece of cinema. With amazing cinematography, excellent acting and sturdy directing, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is understandably in the top ten war films of all time. If perhaps a child is ever to act ungrateful about the age in which we now live in, his or her parents should show them ""Saving Private Ryan"" to shut them up. Life was hell for so many people during the War, and it feels that perhaps sometimes we forget that. This film will be talked about for decades to come."
"Lugosi2002","Null","3","5","28 February 2004"," Hands down the best war movie ever
","Not only the best war movie but probably the most realistic movie where man confronts death. I have seen every movie on the subject of violence, gore, war etc. and though this is not a gore fest just for the sake of showing blood, the blood and gut aspect rates up with any for realism. Such as it is war is bloody and this shows it.<br/><br/>Let me make one thing clear. This does not mean the movie isn't top notch every where else. In fact that's the reason the bloody fighting is so real because the acting and directing brings it to life. Spielberg has to be totally commended as I can't think of one director aside of maybe Ron Howard who could have brought the realism to film that this winner does.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is absolutely outstanding. It is in his 3 top best and may be his finest. That's up for others to decide. Never the less he is superb. But he is not the only one. Tom Sizemore who I think never gets enough credit is fantastic as well as is Ed Burns. In fact I have to rate this as the best supporting cast in any movie I have ever seen. They are that good. They just feed off each other and it shows in every scene.<br/><br/>Speaking of scenes there are literally dozens of outstanding ones in this but the one that really got me was when Jeremy Davies who plays CPL Upham (He played his character so good I wanted to strangle him for his cowardice) can't muster the courage to go up the stairs and help Adam Goldberg who played Pvt. Mellish (another outstanding acting job) in his fight with the German Soldier. I actually was holding my breath when the German was slowly plunging the knife into Mellish's chest and whispering to him to ""shh shh shh"" thus killing him.<br/><br/>Without doubt a movie for all time. As far as realism and just plain great acting, direction production sets etc, etc, etc, this is as good as any there has ever been made. I rate it 5 out of 5...no make that 6 out of 5. Awesome is the only way I can describe it. I have watched it at least 5 times and never get bored."

A group of soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to Northern Europe to find him, if he is still alive, and send him home.  The film follows there long, hard trek to find this man, and then get him out.<br/><br/>This is a great film, like many of Spielberg's are, but I have to say, it is a bit overrated.  There are many great war films, and I wouldn't quite but this one in the top five.  Definetly the top ten, better than most war films, but not quite the top five.<br/><br/>The action scenes are groundbreaking; this was a first in what was considered acceptable in cinema.  Spielberg only focuses on this, though. We see what the troops go through physically, but not mentally; every now and then, we get some strained expressions on their faces, but Spielberg never uses his proven film making skills to put you in these guys shoes, to let you know what they're thinking.<br/><br/>Consequently, we only get half the story.  How can I put this in the top ten, then?  Because the other half is just done so well.  There are also good performances here - this is the only time I liked Vin Diesel. Remember, i'm not knocking this film - I put it in the top ten best war films ever made.  Definetly a classic.  I just think it's stretching it when people rave that this is the best war film ever.

"gdownton","Null","3","5","14 January 2003"," Great battle scenes in an otherwise average movie
","Maybe my summary line was a bit harsh. Saving Private Ryan is not an average movie, but I don't think it's as great as the rest of the world seems to think. Yes the various battle scenes are gut-wrenching, but the movie overall was slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is completely US-centric. I think one non-American character (a German soldier who is begging for his life at the time) gets a speaking role in the film. There is no indication that soldiers from other countries took part in the D-day landings. The American soldiers die horribly, tragically, heroically, dramatically. The German soldiers just die. Bang, grunt, thud: another dead German.<br/><br/>We see all of the tension and fear experienced by the Americans, yet none of that which must have been felt by the opposing Germans. They were, after all, one and the same, merely servants of opposing political masters. Yet the movie completely misses the chance to humanise the enemy, to show that they too are just ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is, in short, a Hollywood blockbuster, with gory battle bits. The American soldiers are the human good guys, the German soldiers are the inhuman bad guys, war is Hell, but we're better at it than you.<br/><br/>
I didn't *hate* this movie, I just didn't think it was worth all of the plaudits which it has received. Tom Hanks is, of course, always watchable, the story rolls along nicely, the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat (or possibly under it), and the anti-war grittiness does outweigh the pro-American good vs. bad slant. For the record, I thought the spin-off TV series Band of Brothers was marginally better."

","This is almost on par with a Uwe Boll movie for its sheer lack of intelligence! Saving Private Ryan was, and to a degree; still is, shown as one of the finest films of the 20th Century, on a par with the Godfather, or Apocalypse Now. I'm sorry, but this is exactly what this film isn't.<br/><br/>Here is my list on why this film was such a disgrace...<br/><br/>Actors: Who the hell bit Vin Desiel in this movie? The man has no talent of any kind whatsoever! Tom Hanks wasn't the lovable Forest Gump, he wasn't doing well as the average guy and officer trying to do his best for the greater good. The other actors did little to push the roles they where given and as a result where really forgettable.<br/><br/>Story: Who the hell told Mr Spealburg this was a good story?!? I'm a Writer myself, and if i had written this I'd have taken myself outside and shot myself straight afterword. Not only was the basic story utter bullocks (Why would the U.S. Army care about this bloke Ryan anyway? in WW2 millions of people died, entire armies where wiped out, not just entire families) but the film is littered with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. It's Stephen Spelburg at his most Romantic (and that means bad for your I.Q. level.) The first sense, yes, it's very good, yes its gory, yes, it's shocking, but it is no where near what real war is like. No where near what combat in the Second World War was like, purely 'cos Stephen Spelburg was NOT there. No one, sides the people who fought there, knows what it was like. No one had scaled the cliff face until a full 6 hours after the invasion began... also, Utah beach was only considered bloody 'cos the defences on the other parts of the 'Mightly' Adlantic wall was an old French Farmer with three teeth and a Spade.<br/><br/>That's just the beginning of my list of terrible story points, if I wrote them all, the very Internet it's self would crash.<br/><br/>Characters: Who are they? Who cares? Not me, they where all idiots. Stephen Spealburg does not have an emotional bone in his entire body... are we really supposed to care for these poorly crafted, 2 dimensional people? The humour between them was so bad i've seen new Simpson episodes that are better, definitely better written and I for one hate new simpsons.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Stephen Speburg is a slave to CGI. Yeh, it is impressive, but it's also pretty poorly constructed and carried out, due to it being filmed in digital time. Stephen Spelburg's #1 student must be a German moron called Uwe Boll, he uses the same camera techniques of shaking to create the illusion of danger and tension, it does work in this film... for 5 seconds, then just gives you sickness in the pit of you're stomach that isn't good for the audiences health (Much like the story).<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but i think I'll stop here. It's so damn bad i think I've said everything that needs to be said.<br/><br/>One to avoid."
"cougarsarewild","10","4","8","18 December 2016"," Amazing Movie
","I had to watch this movie for a WW2 class in 12th grade. It may not be a true story, but it was still a well-made movie. The soldiers still maintained a sense of humor, even when their situation looked bleak. At the beginning of the movie, one of the soldiers said, ""I thought you were my mother."" I thought that was a great comeback, and that it showed said humor. Also, there wasn't as much gore in it as I originally thought. Yes, there was a lot of blood, but it was just the right amount for me to not get grossed out. I understand that there is a lot of gore during a war, but I'm glad Spielburg limited it. I'm not one who gets scared or grossed out easily, but it's not impossible for me."
"baberchik","5","4","8","12 April 2016"," Cheezy feel-good nonsense
","I some times wonder if Spielberg is one of those contributors to modern anti-semitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy, so old-school outdated cinema style with all that long, soggy melodrama, those tell-tale ""musical effects"" or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie... this is funny because one can GUESS without looking at who's the director by just listening carefully 10-20 minutes into the movie that Spielberg is the director... it's literally that obvious. I am not sure if ""Uncle Zoid"" from that one Futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at Spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is, but that one episode summed it up perfectly. Anyhoo..... Unlike the Shoah cash-cow ""Shindler's List"" which was made with such severe historic digressions that even Shindler's actual real life family complained about it - in this movie Spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire US-viewer oriented genres of movies: feelgood American war heroes. Not just that, but in the finest way possible; as in a handful of guys take on half of Wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight... and the main aim of their heroic K/D ratio of 100:1 in the movie is... *US patriotism intensifies*... to save a private who's already advanced very far in the war, because Uncle Sam said enough of his family members died. Ugh... And while U-Boot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard, Spielberg took no notes what so ever. The same way how USA today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do, the same way does Spielberg make movies.<br/><br/>So all that being said, if one is not as critical then the movie is ""okay"". Good enough entertainment if one closes an eye and does not think too hard. But it's eons away from other war movies that do not depict war the same way Die Hard depicts hostage situations."
"cliffyboy43","5","4","8","2 November 2009"," Oscar for best picture, you must be joking!
","Yes, the opening beach scenes are very dramatic and mighty, quite moving, but the actual story is sentimental and corny. The worst thing for me, though, by far, was the final scene in the cemetery - this isn't a spoiler because the film has been out for so long now anyway. Ryan's final salute and words of gibberish don't go anywhere near, in my opinion, expressing the depth and profoundity of the experience. It's so sloppy it actually makes you want to vomit and I question here why Spielberg, at the final moment, allows the superficiality of nationalism to take precedence over humanity. It's as if Spielberg is saying Ryan is first and foremost an American before he is a human being."

","The best and most powerful war movie ever.<br/><br/>Its been hailed as the best and most realistic war movie ever and it is.<br/><br/>Thinking that war was this horrifying is unbelievable but it was like this and Saving Private Ryan shows it in every detail. This is one movie i would recommend for parents to show their kids. Kids need to know what war was really like. Instead of watching war movies where they portray it as bullet dodging - jumping through explosions fun. Overlooking the gore i think kids should watch it to understand and appreciate the war veterans more. It sure made me appreciate them more.<br/><br/>The opening scene is one you will never forget. I am referring to the Ohama beach scene of course,which is the most powerful scene in the movie although it is the most graphic it still is a strong scene.<br/><br/>After a mother loses all her sons except one. Eight men go behind enemy lines to save him and bring him back home to his mother. Guided by Captain John Miller the men journey into the heart of war and make it their mission to bring private Ryan home to his mother.<br/><br/>Every actor did a great job. I was greatly surprised by Vin Diesal he did a nice performance. Tom Hanks was excellent and Matt Damon was good as private Ryan.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone and i mean everyone if you don't have this movie i would run out and borrow it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","We saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" as a family. My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly to the extent that I walk by teasing him that I'll let him know the end - ""The Germans lose!"", thought it was a fresh spin on traditional war movies by showing the doubts of the soldiers. <br/><br/>I thought it was just a color WWII movie as young 'uns refuse to see black and white movies these days. I could match that this actor was playing the William Bendix role, this one John Garfield's, this one Robert Ryan's, this one Montgomery Clift, etc.<br/><br/>Those movies were restricted by the Hays Code and the need to spur war time spirit that they couldn't show doubts, though I remember some revisionist movies made after about the impact on Berlin, another with Robert Taylor vs. the Japanese on some island.

","I was unaware of the furore this film caused because it got passed over for best picture by the Academy. Having watched both I have to say I think that for once they got it pretty much right. Sure, the landing scenes are awesome - they really are. They are the most graphic and horrific depiction one could imagine being translated onto screen. And, as a Brit who has also been to the beaches in question, I felt extremely humbled and thankful for the incredible sacrifices made. But this is a film, not a vote on the actual perfomance of the heoric men who fought to rid Europe of evil. And I'm afraid the second half of the film gets progressively worse until we are left with a silly tale about Tom Hanks saving the world. This is a real shame. The gravitas of the first part of the film deserved better treatment."
"Sally_Kirkland","4","4","8","2 July 2002"," Naïve vision of war
","This film displays Spielbergs childish wiev of the world. A wiev that has done him good in so many films but is fatal for a war epic. He simply is naïve in displaying the friendship, the combats not to mention the actual plot which is near to being silly. That combined with the lame overall acting makes this a grand disappointment. 4/10 because of the cinematography."

","I can't believe that this film currently rates on IMDB higher than both Paths of Glory and Platoon. The latter is one of the best anti-war films ever made - by a man WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE.<br/><br/>Speilberg's technical mastery may be great but his characters are cardboard and his understanding of men's motivation's is fatally flawed. As Oliver Stone recognises in Platoon, soldiers fight for one another not a great cause. As the Platoon Sergeant says in Hamburger Hill regarding the death of one of the men: 'He died taking out that automatic weapon for you and third squad - and don't you give him anything less.'"
"onepotato2","3","6","14","20 October 2007"," A pile of corn
","I successfully avoided this until seeing Band of Brothers, which raised my previously low interest in Spielberg productions; having seen one too many of his mawkish, sentimental pieces of malarkey. Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.<br/><br/>A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone & lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!<br/><br/>Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought. <br/><br/>S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts & having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, ""CRY NOW!"" and ""WAVE THE FLAG!"" I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows & Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons. Structurally this feels like a grab-bag of scenes made for an even longer movie. They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.<br/><br/>And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi... I can't imagine any of these guys are WW2 figures because they're all so overexposed in the current timeframe.<br/><br/>I didn't need this giant pile of malarkey and all it's cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the Allies in WW2. I have reality to do that."

And then the American flag flutters over the screen and the dewy-eyed veteran remembers.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is 'realism'. but so what. we choose what we want to watch and what should be put in movies.

I feel that this poor attempt at a film, disparages the importance of the world war 2 and all the people who died. I think the director could have made more of a visual impact if he had used one of his old camcorders. In fact, I've seen student films that have crisper and more defined images. It is obvious, that for the subject nature of this film, the filmmaking was totally incompetent. I expected so much more from such a good director as Steven Spielberg.

","With all the hype about this movie, I expected to see a realistic portrayal of war. I also expected to see a true story, which all the trailers claim this movie is. This movie has as much basis in fact as that cheesy soap ""The X-Files"". Spielberg is trying to mess with everyone's head again, and thanks to this movie, there will be a whole generation of people who think ""Saving Private Ryan"" really happened. Luckily they teach students better in school. If you want a hard-hitting, realistic portrayal of war, try Arliss Howard in ""Full Metal Jacket"", Charlie Sheen in ""Platoon"", Adrien Brody in ""The Thin Red Line"", Meg Ryan in ""Courage Under Fire"", or, heck, anything else. This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. The scenes on the beaches are not only gruesomely real, they're breathtakingly brutal, as well as soul-stopping. If the rest of the movie had one tenth the shock-quality or realism the first few minutes had, this movie would have been one of the best war movies ever made.<br/><br/>Hollywood glamour has ruined this movie. Thankfully people are too smart to be sucked in by what this movie claims ""truly happened"", but there are already some schools that are discussing using this movie as a way to teach students about war. Why not use ""Starship Troopers""? It's just as realistic, and unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"", can actually educate. If you walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied and cheated, check out some of the other war movies I mentioned. They are all far better depictions of what war truly is, and unlike SPR, they don't claim to be the truth. For a truly realistic war movie that deserves every award it's been rumored for, check out the 1998 remake of ""The Thin Red Line""."

"Leofwine_draca","9","5","11","10 December 2016"," Everything you've heard is true
","I've long been a fan of war films but for some reason it took me eight years to finally get around to watch this, the often undisputed classic war film of all time. Why? Not sure really – I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible – widescreen DVD, 52"" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.<br/><br/>At the heart, the film recalls dozens of other war films from THE DIRTY DOZEN to THE LONGEST DAY. A squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission, facing almost certain depth. Where the movie excels, however, is in the extra depth and layers that Spielberg adds. The characterisation is strong, the dialogue harsh and heartfelt. Technically, the film is perfect. The colours are faded and washed out and the hand-held camera-work is ten times better than that seen in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Sound effects are excellent, the best I've heard, especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the film's climax. All these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic I've seen. The opening twenty minutes on Omaha Beach, which show the infamous D-Day landings, are everything you've heard: exhilarating, utterly depressing, disturbing, exciting, and gruesome. This is certainly the goriest war film out there and it's all portrayed in a matter-of-fact way; blink and you really will miss it. People explode, lose limbs, and bleed copiously from wounds; only strong stomachs need apply.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly great, as you'd expect from the calibre of cast on view. Tom Hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero, with unforgettable mannerisms – the shaking hand still haunts me. Tom Sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant, and his larger-than-life persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here. Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg put in solid performances but it's Jeremy Davies who the film focuses on throughout – a rookie, green-faced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare. The viewer understandably sees the film through Davies' eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be. Additionally, the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles – especially Barry Pepper as the sniper and Vin Diesel at his best. Lots of familiar faces pad out other roles, some in cameos: Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, the list goes on.<br/><br/>Despite the near-three hour running time, the film never slows up or stops for a minute. Every second is crucial and beautifully crafted. Things culminate in a set-piece climax, a fierce ambush in a bombed-out French town. Our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of Nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns. It's sprawling, explosive, upsetting and, by the last frame of the film, incredibly moving. So, in retrospect, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is everything everybody says it is. Spielberg's best film by far and one of the best war films of all time."
"ChemBrad","3","5","11","5 July 2005"," Where did they get this script?
","If you have read any of my posts then you might have detected a slight pro-military bent. Then you probably think that I liked ""Saving Private Ryan"". Think again! It stank. I muted the first 20 minutes of the movie where they depict with gruesome relish the effects of concentrated machine gun fire and artillery explosions on the human body. I preferred spending my time reading a book to watching that. Once that carnage was over I was treated to typical foul language, but nothing I haven't heard in my tour of duty. That I could have forgiven. But what they did with the story-line was absolutely dreadful.<br/><br/>Clearly the people who wrote this script have no sense when it comes to military behavior or military tactics. For instance, the troops were going to mutiny to the command decision by their captain to attack a machine gun nest. Well I would too with an IDI*T like Tom Hanks' character leading a charge in broad daylight directly into the line of fire of said machine gun. Even an English teacher turned captain would have more sense than that. Then they captured a German soldier. So what do they do with him? They blindfold him and tell him to walk 1000 paces before taking off the blindfold... Well what a surprise when he turns up later to fight against this squad and tortuously slowly impale one of squad soldiers with a bayonet. All while one of the squad cowers in fear while his fellow soldiers are getting massacred around him. What a nice way to depict the soldiers. Oh and then the same cowardly soldier somehow finds his courage in time to capture some German soldiers (including the previous released prisoner) This time however he ""cold-bloodedly"" shoots him (revenge?)... I won't even bore you with the stupid decision for a light infantry squad to hold a bridge (instead of blowing it) against several tanks & armor with infantry support. It was a stupid movie and I am only feeling better now that I am able to give vent to my frustration at having watched it. I'm only glad that I didn't pay any money to watch this crud. I hate movies that blank me off when I watch them. THERE! 3 out of 10"

","The audio engineering and sound effects are the best of any war picture ever.  This is among many valid reasons why SAVING PVT RYAN is a must-see movie.  However, do not expect perfection.  Do not expect this film will live up to all of the hype.<br/><br/>Briefly stated, members of the WWII generation spoke with a formality not captured in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Unlike Hanks et al, Rock Hudson, Jimmy Stewart, Earnest Borgnine, and many old-time actors served in WWII.  Even more future writers, directors and Hollywood producers served as well. Their later film efforts accurately captured the feel of the times.  The difference is rather striking.  Please view any movie or even a TV production created by members of the Greatest Generation and see for yourself how it compares to RYAN.    <br/><br/>As unlikely as it may seem, one can even hold out ""Hogan's Heroes"" -- a light TV comedy set during WWII created in the early 60's by men who had experienced WWII -- as a Hollywood production better capturing the essence of WWII era interpersonal communication.  The characters in HOGAN naturally and automatically interacted with each other with the yes sir's and no sir's, personal respect and greater formality common in the 1940's.  Looking further, any Hollywood film produced in the 40's and 50's captured the essence of the day even better.<br/><br/>Where a lightweight TV comedy succeeds, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shockingly fails.  Characters in RYAN interact with the casual ease of 1998, and NOT with the formality common in the 1940's.  Rather than appearing to be part of the Greatest Generation, the actors in PRIVATE RYAN seem to be following the motivations of modern Hollywood producers who know only today's post Viet-Nam contempt, scorn and cynicism.  Speaking of cynicism, the subplot of the General's high class transport plane was completely made up in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN -- made up by a post Viet-Nam Hollywood."

The use of sound in this movie truly puts the viewer into the action. The sounds of bullets and explosions combined with the graphic, but true to life, reactions of soldiers being hit makes the horror of war seem very real to those of us who have never served in combat. Screams of soldiers for their mothers, soldiers in shock picking up their own limbs, and soldiers being vaporized by explosions are all too real. No film before, or since, has had the same affect on a viewer.

"zaremskya-23761","10","2","3","18 April 2018"," THE War Film
","This, in a long list of big films, is probably Spielberg's greatest accomplishment. It has so much heart, humanity, and raw drama that it will most likely be in the top tier of films for all time. It's just spectacular in every way. It throws you into the biggest armed conflict of our time while deftly and carefully drawing you into a very intimate story that puts many aspects of the war into perspective.<br/><br/>Reviewing a war film is difficult for someone who has never been in one. I don't think any serious critic would pretend to know what it's like to be in such a horrifying event. I think the best you can do is speculate, and even then, you risk treading on some serious ground by giving such films a review.<br/><br/>That being said, the film looks, feels, sounds, and moves perfectly from start to finish. Technically, it's a masterpiece. The lesser-known stars give as good of a performance as the big-name actors, which is a sign of terrific directing. The personal story-line weaves effortlessly within the big drama of the war, and the whole thing is written beautifully.<br/><br/>As I'm writing this, I can think of no flaws. Some people give Spielberg a hard time by being overly sentimental, but I just don't see it in SPR. The emotions all seem appropriate for the environment. The action is riveting and often brutal. Characters fall of the radar quickly. The war is overwhelming. It all makes sense in context.<br/><br/>The best films are like statues; solid, powerful, and eternal. This one will stand for a long time. Even if lot's of Spielberg's films get taken down a notch for sentimentality and overblown spectacle-making, this one won't, and never will."

","Saving Private Ryan , a film related to World War II, directed by Spielberg, received critical acclaim upon screening. The upsurge of Saving Private Ryan is not only because it is realistic visual impact, what is more important, this film led to an argument about lives.
During World War II, the U.S. and U.K. army landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. To insure the victory, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), and his troops --101st Airborne Division, are airdropped behind the German front-lines. Unfortunately, all his three brothers were killed in action at the same time. In order to prevent the unfortunate mother from losing all her four sons, the U.S. command decided to send a special squad to look for James Ryan and take him back safely.
John Miller (Tom Hanks) was chosen as the caption of the rescue squad. He hurried to pick several excellent soldiers and a staff officer who could speak German and French as the squad members. When other soldiers were resting, Miller's eight-member squad began to look for Ryan, who was in the unknown area controlled by Germans.
When facing all kinds of dangers and death of teammates one by one, the squad members gradually began to doubt the rationality of this task. Is it worthy of saving one soldier at the risk of losing eight soldiers' lives? The journey of salvation tested every member's value of human nature."
"shinkim-61939","10","2","3","14 March 2018"," powerful and emotional film
","The first 25 minutes or so is something extraordinary and I don't know how Steven Speilberg pulled it off. The first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it, the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle. When Wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful. The plot of the movie is to bring Ryan back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him. Tom Hanks gives a incredable performance and I found him once again extremely likable. Tom Sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is Giovanni Ribisi. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Berry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are also good and hold their own. This movie is also good at representing it's soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country. I am not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this movie when Cpt. Miller dies and that is because I grew attached to his character. The character of John Miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in. This movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war. Many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but I personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them. Great war movie and this is one of Steven Speilbergs best."

","In every time period and almost every part of the globe, there has been war. Many bloody wars have occurred in our world's history, but none of them can match the magnitude of World War II. There were eighty million casualties as a result of the war, which includes deaths from war-related disease and famine. One of the war's biggest turning points occurred on June 6, 1944 when over 160,000 Allied forces invaded France, which was heavily occupied by Germany at the time. The movie called Saving Private Ryan accurately depicts this massive invasion. This movie is a must-watch because of how realistic, intense, and moving it is from beginning to end. Even though this movie was spectacular, there were some critics that wrongly criticized the film.<br/><br/>Watching Saving Private Ryan is a once in a lifetime experience. This movie is considered to be not only the best war movie ever, but it is one of the best movies, period. In the 71st Academy Awards, they won five of the eleven awards they were nominated for. The five awards were: best director, best cinematography, best sound mixing, best film editing, and best sound effects editing. Saving Private Ryan is a World War II movie that re-creates the infamous D-Day invasion and the following push into France in the summer of 1944. The movie revolves around a squadron from the 2nd Ranger Battalion led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), and their mission is to find Private First Class James Ryan (Matt Damon) to have him sent back home since all three of his brothers had died in the massive invasion. This kind of rescue mission was common in World War II. A soldier who lost all of their siblings in combat was forced to go back home by the military for the sake of the soldier and his family. The squadron encounters heavy resistance throughout the movie before they finally find Private First Class Ryan toward the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a must-watch because of how realistic and thrilling it is in both the action and non-action scenes. Everything that happens in this movie is based on true events from World War II, and they are very accurately presented in the movie. The action scenes in the movie are very intense and have the audience on the edge of their seats. In fact, this movie was so real and intense that it made war veterans walk out of the theater due to having posttraumatic stress disorder. The D-Day scene in the very beginning of the movie is the most notable of them all since it is considered by many to be one of the greatest movie scenes ever. German machine guns were blazing, explosions were everywhere, and casualties were occurring left and right. This intense, fast-paced, realistic scene was one of many in the movie. The second component of this movie that makes it a must-watch is the non-action scenes. War movies that have great non-action scenes are a cut above other war movies, and this is the case in Saving Private Ryan. Two of the best scenes in this movie were the scenes in the very beginning and end of the movie. In the beginning, Private Ryan visits a beautiful cemetery that holds thousands of soldiers who passed away fighting to protect their country, one of which was Captain Miller. And in the end, he makes a moving speech and salute to Captain Miller that leaves every viewer in tears. These two scenes are just two of the many good non-action scenes in the movie. There has been no other movie that I have seen that is more real and moving than Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Critics have made the claim that the action scenes in Saving Private Ryan make the German soldier seem inferior and praise the American soldier, and examples from the movie have been provided to back up that claim. However, this is simply not true. The Germans were not acting stupid without any strategy during the ambush scene some critics described. The critics made it seem like the Germans were stupid for pushing their vehicles and troops through the streets of the town, but this was a proper tactic. The best way to clear a town is to send as many reinforcements as possible straight through to overwhelm any possible resistance. The movie's critics were also outspoken on how the movie depicted the German tank crew to be inept. In all fairness, this was an ambush against them and not a planned attack during a battle. The element of surprise is huge in combat, and unfortunately for the Germans, this element was not in their favor. Saving Private Ryan's critics made a claim that was irrational and not supported with logical reasoning."
"anselmdaniel","8","2","3","3 March 2018"," Defining War Film
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays a ranger captain that leads a squad into enemy territory to rescue a paratrooper whose brothers were killed in action. Saving Private Ryan opens with an aged Ryan that visits a memorial. The story then transitions to the D-Day landings that sets up the arc of the story. Ryan's brothers had all died in the various U.S. Army campaigns in World War 2. The higher ups in the United States army assign a squad to rescue the last sibling, Ryan. The squad embarks into France and behind enemy lines, encountering French civilians, paratroopers, and enemy patrols. Finally the squad reaches Ryan's location and does a last stand.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a visceral look at World War 2 from the perspective of the United States Army. From the beginning of the movie, the images and sounds pull no punches at portraying the grittiness of war. Saving Private Ryan earns its R rating with the level of gore in the film. Events in the movie are also written well with everything flowing organically. The directing is good at portraying the action scenes, but the drama scenes being great elevate this movie. What separates this movie from others in its genre is its more personal look and portrayal of war. I saw the main theme of sacrifice being used by the movie with the characters commenting and even lamenting their fallen comrades. Is the mission or your country worth sacrificing yourself for?<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan does have some inadequacies. History fans will notice a lot of inaccuracies which will annoy them. Some scenes seem superfluous and not entirely necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, Saving Private Ryan is a solid movie and helped define a generation of war movies set in World War 2. I would recommend Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Alyssa-the-Critic","10","2","3","15 February 2018"," Most important film in this genre!
","Book-ended so deftly with genuine and heart felt honesty, this film is one of Spielberg's most important. And is definitely, in my view, the most important and impacting War genre film ever put to celluloid. From the gritty, in your face representation of what the Normandy landing was like -to which veterans in theaters often had to clear out for that harrowing opening, such that the depiction struck too real- to trudging into the unknown throughout war-torn France that Hank's character and his band of brothers face; this movie hits a combination of humanity and the brutality of War that everyone should see in their lifetime. Not for the violence of it but to honour the men who laid so costly a sacrifice.<br/><br/>A technical feat of filmmaking, as well as respecting the lives and the bravery of young men in battle against a threatening foe (Hitler's Germany), this tributes their legacy in a truly human way. Without cliche, without glorification, nor a hint of faux emotion. John Williams score drives this humanity throughout every scene, especially in the transitions to the next sequence of events. And Spielberg guides these performances with precision to deliver unforgettable, and harrowing moments throughout.<br/><br/>Thoroughly deserved Sound Design, Editing, and Director Oscars for Saving Private Ryan! A masterpiece. Enthralling. Engaging. Relentless in bursts, but will give you a handful of breathers and close on a tragic, if not reflective ending that shows the cost of War."

","The movie starts off with an epic opening scene. In this scene Captain Miller and his squad have to take over the beach. During this 'invasion' two brothers are killed. Their third brother is also also killed of, but in New Guinea. After they have taken over the beach, Captain Miller and his crew get another task. They have to find private Ryan. The fourth brother. He is the only remaining brother, so Miller has to get him and bring him back to his mother. It turns out to be harder than they taught. <br/><br/>""Saving Ptivate Ryan"" is directed by Steven Spielberg. He did an amazing job at directing this movie. He did something special, he made it seem like the main characters stood out. It looked like they took a black and white movie and colored it in, it gave a pretty effect. The cinematography was also perfectly handled. Janusz Kaminski has worked a couple of times with Spielberg, I get why Spielberg had chosen him as the cinematographer. The opening scene (with this I mean the opening fight scene) was just shot amazing. Every shot was just stunningly beautiful. The set design look realistic, The effects in this scene were flawless. You were tense, even though you didn't got the chance to know the characters yet. Everything was fantastic. The realism of the movie was also good. When the camera goes under water in the beginning scene, the sound mutes. This really makes you feel like you are there, with the soldiers. Also, still when the camera is under water, when the bullets hit the water, they slow down and you can see the path that they make through the water. When someone takes a grenade, and they explode, they literally blow up into peaces, you can see body parts fly everywhere. What is also good about this movie are the effects and Make-Up . In the movie there is a lot of gore. And when someone loses a leg or a piece of their skin and there intestines are shown, it is in the movie, it looks so real. And after the first battle sequence the camera flies by the battlefield, and you can see all the dead body's and the water, that has become red of the blood of the soldiers, this was a very touching scene. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was also very good, everybody did their best. Lets star of with the main character. The main character is Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks. Miller is the Captain of his squad, a little bit further on in the review i am going to talk about the squad. He is a broken man due to the war, but there is one thing that keeps him going, completing the mission and to keep his squad alive. Someone else from his squad is Caparzo. He is played by, believe me or not, Vin Diesel. I really didn't recognize him. I was surprised that it was him, he was so good in this movie, I just couldn't believe it. There is also Jeremy Davies he plays Upham. He was also very good. You can really see how afraid that he is of war. Wade, the medic of the crew, is played by Giovanni Ribisi. He was good too. And when he dies, there follows a painful silences and that was hard to watch. Not because it was a bad scene or something, no, it was just such a sad moment. There is also Mellish, played by Adam Goldberg, he was good, nothing special about him. And Horvath is played by Tom Sizemore. When he died at the end I didn""t feel sad, and I don't know why. In the squad there is also Jackson. He is played by Barry Pepper. He was a very skilled sniper, and it was shocking to see him die, when he got blown up. And last but not least, Matt Damon. He played Private Ryan, the soldier that Miller has to get back home. I liked his character a lot he is a loyal friend, who is not willing to leave his crew behind. This covers most of the characters, I am sorry if I have missed one, there are a lot of characters in this movie. <br/><br/>The writing of the movie was handled perfectly. There were funny bits. But that doesn't change the mood of the movie, it keeps it's darker tone. You could really feel the friendship of the crew and this was due to the good writing. What I also liked about the writing, even though this does not relate much to th writing, is when Miller goes away to cry. This was a powerful scene, and gave the character a more relatable person, it made him feel more real.<br/><br/>The part that i loved a bit more than the beginning fight scene is the final fight scene. I loved watching how they prepared themselves and the bridge for an upcoming attack. The whole 'Bridge' scene is just so tense full. And when they finally attack, you just start screaming at your screen, because Upham, doesn't dare to do something. Becaude of him some characters died, that he could have saved. But when the battle is over, and he has his gun pointed at some German soldiers. He recognizes a soldier. It is the soldier that killed Wade. When Wade was killed they let that soldier go, but first they are planning to kill him. Then at a certain point Upham says 'what is happening' when they want to shoot the unarmed German soldier. And I think that he means with this what happened to us, how war has changed them, this is a positive thing. But when he holds the gun pointed at the German soldiers, he pulls the trigger and kills the man, out of revenge. Also a powerful scene.<br/><br/>The ending is beautiful. I would recommend watching this movie."
"EzioMonty117","10","2","3","10 October 2015"," Realistic, brutal and superbly acted, this film is a masterpiece
","Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece and one of Spielberg's finest Movies, the Battle scenes, performances and the film keeping true to World War 2 makes this a brilliant but tough watch. Here's why.<br/><br/>The story is good but could've been better, it follows a bunch of soldiers who lands on Normandy, France and successfully defeating the Germans on their first encounter, they must track Down a Survivor of the Normandy incident that happened earlier before they arrived by the chief of the army, so Captain Miller and his soldiers must get Private James Ryan, the Survivor back home and end the war in Normandy and World War 2 itself.<br/><br/>The film's ending is something i have to mention, it's so emotional and one of the most best bad endings of all time, where Captain Miller does Deus Ex Machina on an upcoming tank and somehow saves his teammates but he himself dies, and in present time, James Francis Ryan goes to his funeral and also tells his wife to say he is a good man, for all his work during World War 2, it's sad but impressive overall.<br/><br/>The Battle scenes are impressive, With some of the most realistic depictions of war ever put into film, each Battle scene is at least 10 minutes which adds to the overall excitement of the film's slow pacing. The film's performances are stunning especially Tom Hanks, all has their own emotion which makes each character interesting and refreshing.<br/><br/>The film's direction is as great as previous Spielberg films, here it's all done in a serious matter, where World War 2 is pretty accurate in this Movie than it is in real life. The orchestral is impressive, John Williams is always the king of orchestral Music. The Deaths are pretty emotional, and even myself feel sorry for all of the teammates dying despite the characters being fictional and i still had a hard time seeing these likable characters die.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a benchmark for film Entertainment and it is one of my favourites to this day. Direction, characters, performances, Music, realism, World War 2 accuracy, ending and the overall emotion to the Death scenes makes this a must-watch for anyone willing to watch a great War flick. The only weakness of this Movie is the plot, it's simple and has to have more focus on some of it's locations like Ohama Beach and that it is kinda flat in the middle part of the Movie, other than this minor nitpick, check this Movie out.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Film Review<br/><br/>Do you want to watch an excellent dramatic action movie? Then you need to watch Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is magnificent as it provides such realism and such a serious tone throughout the entire film. The movie starts with a reenactment of D-Day, the horrific WWII invasion of Omaha Beach, Normandy in which our country came out victorious in, and shows how truly brutal it really was. As the soldiers progress further onto the beach that they soon take over, a group who is led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), assembles as they receive another mission. This new mission is to search and rescue Private James Ryan who is apart of a paratrooper platoon that landed in an enemy zone just out of contact. As they are proceeding on this search and rescue mission, they come across numerous issues and initiate a few fire fights along the way. As always, a few of the fellow soldiers die as they come closer to reaching their target and things begin to get more and more out of hand. As they come upon their target, they once again face incredible forces and have to defend themselves until backup arrives. As it comes to an end, they become victorious and control the area they fought for but are faced with a very dramatic outcome. This film really gives you the idea of how intense war really is and just how accurate the outcomes would be like.<br/><br/>What's so wonderful about the accuracy of this movie is that it is based on the true events of the Normandy invasion of WWII and shows how gruesome it really was. The landscaping of the beach along with the architectural structures it has prepared was almost ideal to the actual beaches layout. When they go through the movie, scenes where they come across enemy platoons, the way they go about surrendering or killing is very accurate. Whereas some films break out into some huge fake fire fight and start all over. The movie is precise on keeping you intrigued and keeping the tone serious so you will keep watching.<br/><br/>Keeping the tone serious keeps the movie going. All the characters in the movie are extremely serious and the language they use show it. It is a war movie so you expect the language and actions to be aggressive and serious and that's exactly what you get. The actions are flawless and the way they go about things, such as the death of fellow soldiers is great. They don't break out and make it a big deal, they put dirt in a can with the name of the dead soldier on it and go about the mission. They went about death very well and stuck together as a unit and kept it very realistic.<br/><br/>The realism is what keeps this movie alive. The action is so intense, the gun battles are incredible, and the sound effects are just phenomenal and bass dropping. The sounds of the different weaponry are so realistic tying into the accuracy and acting of the film. The gore and blood of some battles may be disturbing to certain viewers because it's so brutal and gruesome.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend the movie Private Ryan, for all movie lovers. The accuracy of the actual events that transpired on Omaha Beach were historical. The seriousness of the actors portraying the soldiers in my opinion, is done with respect and honor. Honor to all the soldiers who lost their lives that day defending our country. As you are watching the battle scenes the realism in the acting, sound effects, and special effects, makes you feel like you could be right there on the battlefield with the soldiers. Again, if you're in the mood for a good war movie based on actual events, this is the movie for you."

While the rest of the movie is not quite as intense, it quickly involves you in the characters and you sympathize with them because of what they have endured. You truly care for them and are interested in their well being. The realization that what they have experienced is only the beginning of the story is a grim one indeed. The war is not over, and thus it is not finished shaping the men in focus. They will be molded and formed in innumerable ways as the war takes a hold of their psyche and their lives. In conclusion, I believe this is the best war movie of all time and one of if not Steven Spielberg's best films."

The great cinematography and equally great special effects emerge you in the story. The cast is great, and works great as an ensemble. Typical for a Spielberg movie, John Williams made the music, and didn't disappoint.

Later we find out that 3 of the 4 members of his family died and Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of 7 soldiers are sent to bring the remaining brother back to his family before he dies as well. With an unforgettable story, the plot is quite moving even just thinking about it. The movie was also expertly shot and acted. Every action scene is realistic as it is bloody. After soldiers are killed off, it makes the soldiers question if the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them. The final battle has a big buildup and carries on for just the right length.The ending is tragic and it gets me every time but its emotional resonance sticks with the viewer after watching it.

The movie follows the last days of the European war, as the American forces push into France against a Nazi army that is not yet ready to give up. To say much more would be giving away major plot developments, but the plot features several major surprises and gripping battle scenes.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" also features an incredible cast, including Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and many cameo appearances from Nathan Fillion, Ted Danson and others."
"alindsay-al","9","2","3","15 October 2014"," a disturbingly real film that can be hard to watch for some people
","This film is lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and I do believe this film is fantastic, but I believe that it is not a ten out of ten film for a few reasons that I will explain. This film is based in ww2 and the start of the film is the invasion of Normandy better known as d-day. After the battle a group of 8 soldiers are sent on an important mission to rescue a private who's other brothers have been killed recently. Now tom thanks is now established as one of the best actors ever and it is films like this that is why. His performance as the commander felt real it felt like he knew his duty but he was relatable to us because of the way he acted in certain situations. This man is a superstar and he truly encapsulates everything that this commander has to go through. The supporting cast all also do a really good job, this film is not a character study film but everything the characters go through make you feel for them and empathise with the characters. Now the story is where I actually think this film slightly misses, I do believe it plays up the war part of the story well and also the social issues that are explored should be applauded and are very good. However, towards the middle of this film it just felt like 30-40 mins could have been cut out because nothing relevant to the story happens and it could have been done in a better way. The script is really good with the dialogue feeling natural among war buddies and it also makes you feel like you are in battle with them. The style is great I applaud Spielberg for making this film more realistic with the brutality because that was how war really was. A lot of directors try to pc it but not a top director and it adds to the realistic gritty feeling that this film possesses. This is a heavy film and it can be hard to watch sometimes but it is a fantastic film that truly delivers on its message and does indeed deserve a lot of praise."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","2","3","15 September 2014"," Still-Powerful Effects and Performances Leave Us Knee-Deep in the Great War
","Gripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War II, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best."

"charlessmith702210","10","2","3","18 August 2014"," It is more than just the Omaha Beach invasion, it is a mission to save a lone soldier in German-held France
","Well, the movie starts with what was a part of Omaha Beach, called the Normandy memorial now, filled with the graves of Allied soldiers who fought and died in the Normandy invasion. He finds the gravestone, along with his family, of soldier John Miller, and then recalls the fateful day of the invasion in his mind. <br/><br/>There are reminders of the cheesy movie known as ""The Longest Day"", as the Omaha Beach invasion scene in ""Private Ryan"" takes full swing. Over 15 minutes of terror, fright, and blood-letting as heavy German resistance with mortars and endless sprays of machine-gun fire rained death on the Allied soldiers who landed on the beach with their landing craft. <br/><br/>The Allies get stopped by the heavy and deadly resistance but finds their way to get through the enemy in the beachhead with Bangalore torpedoes, flamethrowers, and sniper rifles. <br/><br/>When all was over, we see that Daniel Ryan fell dead on the beach, and we get the first words on three Ryans who fell in World War II, but not James Francis. We get word on the parachute mis-drops that were part of the Normandy invasion which meant James Francis Ryan did not know that all of his 3 relatives died in combat, so a rescue mission deep in the German-held front lines of France is in store. <br/><br/>We then get the first scenes of John Miller, who is picked to find a small platoon for the mission. He finds soldiers, and then the mission is on, right into the French countryside. <br/><br/>First skirmish against the Germans is in a small French town in a heavy rainstorm where one of the platoon soldiers, Mr. Caparza, finds a French baby whom a French family wants to liberate. Caparza takes the baby, but because he was mistaken as a Nazi soldier (he was really an American soldier, but he was bald-headed), a French resistance soldier-sniper takes Caparza down with one shot in the chest. The platoon realize this and decided to find the sniper but have to leave Caparza alone and tell him not to move or he would get shot again. Fortunately, the sniper was taken out but Caparza eventually dies on the ground.<br/><br/>More small skirmishes against the Germans were in store upon finding James Francis Ryan. In one lull in the fighting, they almost got the soldier they wanted who was James Ryan but with a different middle name (which was, regrettably, Patrick), so the search continues. <br/><br/>Then, after a German prowler (a half-track) was destroyed in another French open field as the search continued, the platoon finds another platoon that destroyed the tank - it was the platoon with James Francis Ryan. The platoon got their man. <br/><br/>The final thing was for his survivors - the platoon itself and the surviving Ryan, to fight against a small German army that almost outnumbered them, in the town of Ramelle. The firefight had to be creative because they used ammo that was just left - not too much. James Ryan does survive and the firefight ends when the P-51 Mustangs finished off the Germans, but John Miller gets shot and dies in the combat.<br/><br/>James Ryan survives, still looking at his fallen soldier on the Normandy beach memorial, thinking about his duty for country that he had done on this major turning point in World War II."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>I can not really say anything about ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) that was not said before countless of times. I'm just going to praise it one more time. <br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a masterpiece of movie-making, it's true. Almost no other war film can't take you to the place like this picture does. ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are the best war movies ever. Very different, yet very similar on the note of anti-war ideas. Now back to ""Saving Private Ryan"". The opening scene is ... well, you all know, it's a jaw dropping experience, and i mean, experience - for a 20 min you can partly feel what is war and how it was to a soldiers on that day. This scene alone is a excruciating masterpiece. The film settles then in to a journey through hell picture, it still remains unforgettable. No matter how many times you are watching ""Saving Private Ryan"", it grabs you from the opening scene and does not let go this the very last image. As i don't think there are people who never saw this film, i can just say, watch it again. It'a a film to remember, and to learn. It'a a masterpiece on all levels."

","This is my favorite war movie. I like it except the final battle. Our troops totally got ripped to shreds. Cpl Upham, he is a coward. I know he isn't used to this combat, but he is essential to all the other troops. He is carrying the extra ammo. He was too scared to help that private fight that enemy troop and was to scared to give the troops more ammo to the MG. If I was him, I would've been scared too, but I would've done it anyway for my brothers. Also, in the beginning, when they opened the door to get off the landing craft, you are already dead. I think that's crazy. Plus, when they confronted the real Private Ryan, he refused to go home. Isn't that a rule in which if all your brothers die, you are supposed to go home?"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","3","27 June 2014"," 'Saving Private Ryan' is the most realistic and powerful war film ever made!
","Sacrifice is often challenging for men in dangerous positions. No eight film characters besides the eight soldiers in Steven Spielberg's war masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan' have dedicated more sacrifice in the history of film. WW II was a harsh war that caused many fatalities and tragedies. Entire families like the Ryan boys were sent out to war. In 'Saving Private Ryan' we see four brothers loose 75% of their legacy, leaving only Private James Ryan to live. When Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out with seven other soldiers to rescue Private Ryan so that the Ryan family would have one last child to hang on two. As the eight men try and rescue Private Ryan somewhere in the battlefields of Germany, they encounter extreme war situations causing fatalities and conflict between the eight men. Many argue with each other, loose hope, show strong emotions, and complain about how the eight of them have to risk their lives for one man. However, some positivism is derived from their mission. Many friendships are formed between soldiers as they connect with each other and help each other through battle. Steven Spielberg's directing is extremely superb and magnificence. He takes you into the line of war liken no filmmaker, and has extremely intense and realistic battle sequences to show how much sacrifice the brave men of WW II gave in order to promote peace and liberty. The battle sequences are perfectly made with amazing editing, sound, and effects that are entertaining for the powerful soul purpose and to make the story strong. Bravo to the actors Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davis, and Tom Sizemore for giving powerful performances as soldiers throughout the entire film, and never getting off guard in the film. The main theme of 'Saving Private Ryan' is not only to give the first hand experience of WW II battle brought to life, but to show a story of sacrifice. The mission to save Private Ryan is a metaphor for how soldiers throughout history give of themselves for others, and how their sacrifice can never be thanked enough. This is the best war film ever made!"

","This movie was an immense gathering of suspenseful, action-based, dramatized scenes. I saw this film when it came out but I was just a kid. I saw it again and again for years to come only to like it more every time. The rawness and originality in the art of the battle scenes is just amazing; the gore, the sadness, the cinematography, it's all there. I'm not even a big fan of Spielberg's work and aside from Schindler's List, this is the only other film that I love by Spielberg. I give it a 9 for its long driven awesome plot with WELL developed characters(main, supportive, etc.) and gruesome battle scenes. The use of foreign languages when needed was also there. An overall well written work of art."
"lukesauser","9","2","3","26 January 2014"," Seems as close to real as film can get
","I've never been in the military, let alone been in any type of real combat situation. Despite this, I feel like I have a semi-realistic idea of what it would be like; and that is absolutely horrible. I can't see any good that a soldier can take away from combat and this film does a remarkable job of depicting the ugly truths of this, in a way that almost anyone over the age of 12 can appreciate. If you are attempting to shield your child from the ugly truths of life on this earth and specifically American history and war, then don't show them this film. When watching this film, I can actually feel the pain of the protagonist as he fights his way towards his objective. Obviously, this pain is nowhere near the level of what the soldier whom this film was based off of and all others directly involved actually felt, but I feel it is as close as you can get without being involved. This film incorporates fantastic writing, CGI, cinematography, set-building, acting and basically every other level of production to create the most realistic World War II Normandy depiction I have ever seen. The only reason I would not rate this movie any higher is because that would make it a 10 and I believe perfection is impossible in the art of film production, but it's about as close as it gets without 3D or any other realism enhancing technologies. Watch this film and gain a better understanding of what many of America's young men were experiencing at the time of the second world war and also how they were mentally and physically effected from the horrific events which ensued."

"LovetheBombFilms","8","2","3","18 December 2013"," Great
","Steven Spielberg's 1998 war film, Saving Private Ryan, is a monumental picture. It portrays the rawest, most real-feeling, vision of war that I have ever seen. Though the grave portrayals and subject matter exclude Saving Private Ryan from being a traditionally entertaining film, it is still very engaging. It falls prey to some issues characteristic of war films and some issues characteristic of Spielberg films, but those do not take away Saving Private Ryan's claim to greatness that it rightfully deserves.<br/><br/>There is not an ounce of blood nor spray of bullets from beginning to end that doesn't feel real. Many highly violent films lose their impact entirely when the special effects are less than convincing and when character deaths feels too complicit to the story. Thankfully Saving Private Ryan has incredible, mainly practical, special effects, and the film is not afraid to kill even its most sympathetic characters in addition to literally boat loads of extras. The opening flashback to Omaha Beach is an incredible feat in cinema and likely the best subjective view of warfare caught on film. When the doors of the boats open and German machine guns mow down the U.S. soldiers without a moment's hesitation, it is truly shocking. For one shot the camera is in the position of a soldier near the back of a boat, his comrades in front of him. The doors open and all the soldiers in frame are ripped of their lives by an unstoppable hail of bullets. The fact that I would be dead if were there is effectively disturbing. Some other shots take place underwater. Down there the screams of the dying, pounding of artillery, and incessant chatter of machine guns are muffled. For a second I felt calm and safe, before a couple bullets penetrated the water and the soldiers beneath it, calming their struggle and causing plumes of blood to rise to the surface. The scene continues in this fashion for an extended time as it follows a group of soldiers fighting their way up the beach, eventually to victory for that specific skirmish. The Omaha Beach scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, and the final battle of the bridge matches it, providing a nice bookend for the rest of the story to play out between. Some death scenes are truly disturbing. They force you to look at your own mortality right in the face. I should mention that the direction is superb. The audience is able to achieve a new perspective on war from Spielberg's outstanding ability to link action and build a sense of omniscience coupled with harsh subjectivity. I didn't detect a false move in the entire film. While the film is a true achievement, its reliance on shock causes its impact to decrease with subsequent viewings (I've seen it thrice), but I still recognize it as a great film. One thing that detracted from Saving Private Ryan, conflicting with the realism, was its sentimentality, driven by John Williams' seemingly ubiquitous score. The sentimentality felt out of place and left a bad taste in my mouth. I could almost call the film cloying at times. Thankfully, during the parts that really matter there is no music and no forced emotion, only what happens right before your eyes which is enough to change you by itself.<br/><br/>War films tend to be very pure. Many times they are almost exclusively about survival, an objective, and the non-romantic relationships between the soldiers. Saving Private Ryan fits into this category. For me this excludes a certain aspect of cinema that I crave. It excludes a sense of culture, artistry, and beauty. The film is too raw for my liking. Whenever the characters come to a new town they find it in a state of wreckage. The once beautiful architecture is reduced to rubble and potential strategic positions. Of course Saving Private Ryan relies a great deal on realism and the decision to maintain its purity as a war film certainly contributes to its realism. Nevertheless my complaint stands.<br/><br/>For what is essentially an existential film, Saving Private Ryan manages to the fill its running time with engaging scenes, one after another. There are many incidental, almost arbitrary, occurrences. The taking of the French girl, the knocking down of a wall to reveal a platoon of enemy soldiers. The list goes on. Yes these scenes are sufficiently engaging even if each one does not contribute to a central story thrust. More than that they add to the sense of mayhem and disarray that surely accompanies soldiers embroiled in such a conflict. Whereas I might be tempted to label this style as fluff or meaningless in other films, the existential mode fits Saving Private Ryan very well.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a great film. It is an achievement in cinema and also fascinating to watch. While a few issues prevent me from calling it a masterpiece I can confidently say that I will watch it again someday.<br/><br/>33/40"
"laurakhansen","8","2","3","3 December 2013"," An interesting war trailer
","*Note: this review is a mash-up several reviews written by students in an English class at Lycée Henri Cornat in France.<br/><br/>During the Second World War, the Ryan family loses three sons and one is missing. Three of them died in the fighting. One of them is missing in the Cotentin: his name is James Ryan. Their mother receives a telegram telling her about the death of her sons. Captain Miller's mission is to find Private Ryan. This absence of action gives me a patriotic impression, which may be a little bit ridiculous, especially when the camera is focused on Tom Hank 's eyes (an excellent actor to me because of his great career). The trailer depicts the soldiers as courageous and brave heroes: it remind of famous French saying « un pour tous et tous pour un » that is to say soldiers are very united.<br/><br/>One of points I appreciate is that the trailer doesn't show any frames of the film at the beginning but only archived to the WW2. I think it's a good thing because the trailer doesn't spoil the film. But at the same time after seeing the trailer I don't really know if it was focused on the action or on the military brotherhood. <br/><br/>Here, the soldiers are shown as brave, courageous and self-sacrificing. They are depicted as heroes. We find brotherhood, loyalty, and friendship. They are portrayed as heroes because, we can see and suppose that they 'fight' with the suffering. In the end of the trailer, we see a dark landscape with a hill and only a man who is a soldier because he has a gun. There are clouds, and the sky is dark. In the closing image, we can see clouds: it may be to show all the soldiers who had lost their lives, and it reminds us that death is all around.<br/><br/>This amazing representation of WW2 stresses the emotional dimension of war. If you want to see a movie about war only, don't watch this film because the most important in the story is the mission of some soldiers and not the fight against Nazi Germany. Overall, we can say that this trailer makes people want to see this original film about the war. It's not a shocking trailer, and mainly the touching side is shown. A war film for girls?!"
"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","1 December 2013"," One of the Greatest War Films of Its or Any Other Time
","Within the opening 30 minutes into Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking, destroyed many Hollywood clichés in the process, completely redefined the combat genre & permanently cemented this film's place amongst the greatest examples of war cinema.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of Normandy by Allied powers during the Second World War & the main plot surfaces after that. It concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in action.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's direction this time challenges & breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience' psyche & takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood, bullets & limbs flying around. Add to that, the camera-work with its desaturated colour & point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism too.<br/><br/>Just like any other Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing, visual effects, sound & everything is top-notch although John Williams' score doesn't have much to contribute to the whole film. The performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with Hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performance.<br/><br/>Yet, in spite of all the praise & it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on- screen, it isn't a flawless work & comes with its share of disappointments. The biggest drawback about Saving Private Ryan is that after its unforgettable opening sequence, the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime & even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the end.<br/><br/>Another major problem I have with it is the film's relentless emphasis on glorifying America since some real-life events depicted here completely ignore the aid US received from other allies during the D-Day landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the German soldiers is absolutely insulting. It's specifically made for American audience & doesn't have a universal appeal like many other films of its genre.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Saving Private Ryan presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense, powerfully moving, brutally realistic & truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense. And for that alone, it will forever be remembered as one of its genre's finest works."

If Spielberg was out to eradicate romantic notions anyone might hold about war he succeeded<br/><br/>The decision to rescue Ryan is, in my mind, a poor one but something similar actually did happen and Ryan looking for the grave of his beloved captain who saved his soul could have been mawkish but while a little too sentimental it did work for me.<br/><br/>The entire movie was a corroboration of Sherman's comment that ""War is Hell"". Just to make sure his point is driven home one of the ironies Spielberg embedded in the movie is every act of mercy would have lethal consequences for the soldier who showed compassion."
"raphaklopper","10","2","3","7 November 2013"," The Second best war movie ever made is a timeless experience!
","Spielberg during his career has always shown a certain interest for the World War II, in movies like ""1941"", ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Schindler's List"" and of course ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Last Crusade"" that was perfect clear. He affirmed that in a interview that he considers the WWII one of the most significant events of the last hundred years, and always sought to portray it somehow. It took the screenwriter Robert Rodat and Tom Hanks to show to Spielberg a story almost like ""Apocalypse Now"", inspired by an event of the civil war, taking place during the Second World War, to the master retract the war in the best way (possibly) ever made.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is takes place soon after the invasion of the Normandy at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. With Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) getting a mission, coming from the General George C. Marshall itself, to rescue a paratrooper private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who lost three brothers in combat, two on D-Day and one in New Guinea. Now the Captain along with 7 of his best men have to travel in the middle of the war in France and cross enemy lines to save the life of a man who doesn't even know. But the dangers and sacrifices will bring challenges and moral dilemmas to the soldiers and their mission.<br/><br/>When I said that Spielberg retracted the WWII in the best way ever made I wasn't bluffing. Of course he showed the consequences of the Holocaust in a terrifying and brilliantly in his masterpiece ""Schindler's List"". But here, Spielberg completely redefines the genre of war films forever. What was always shown (except for ""Apocalypse Now"") always with a romantic and patriotic story, Spielberg manages to show its brutality.<br/><br/>Many today consider this film the best war movie ever made, and others think ""Apocalypse Now"" already occupies this place. Both films follow different paths and tones, but tell a story very similar with almost the same dilemma: ""The sacrifice of many lives by one live"". But Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" went much further than that, exploring the psychological and disturbing side of the Vietnam War including its origins without ever taking a patriotic side as Spielberg does here momentarily. So ""Apocalypse"" is by a far superior film.<br/><br/>What Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat do is follow a simpler path but still excellent. Showing for several moments in the film dilemmas about saving a man in the middle of hell. And that leads to relationship of the soldiers, that early in the film was a brotherhood of partnership, begins to fade with the sacrifices being made by a soldier who they never saw or met and it is probably dead. But there is where one of the few of the problems in the film appear, some of the characters deserved a better development but anything ruins our feelings at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Well, so far I've only been talking about moral dilemmas and comparisons. Now let's cut to the part where Spielberg revolutionizes everything, in his direction. Coppola gave in ""Apocalypse"" the classic ""nalpam"" bombing of the village, followed with marines stealing surfboards and surfing. Spielberg gave the best battles and shootings ever made and put in a war movie. Literally putting us in the middle of the flying bullets and explosions hurting our ears. And for the people that still criticize Spielberg for making children's and cheesy films, get ready to see bodies being mutilated and blood splash on your face. Showing the terrible reality and brutality of war, the real hell.<br/><br/>In the performances level, the film doesn't disappoint at all. Each of the 8 (9 if you count Ryan at the end of the movie, oh, spoiler). Since Barry Pepper as the best sniper in a movie since Robert De Niro; Tom Sizemone as the best partner to have in a battlefield, and Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks is, simply brilliant.<br/><br/>While not be the best war movie ever made (thanks to Coppola), ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a essential viewing film. Spielberg through another magnificent direction shows the cruel reality and brutality of war, coated with bright dilemmas thanks to Rodat's script, presented with yet another brilliant performance by Tom Hanks. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is not perfect or the best war movie ever made, but it is sure a timeless war and movie classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"avik-kumar-si","8","2","3","14 October 2013"," War/ Anti-war Classic
","Steven Spielberg's World War II drama, Saving Private Ryan is more of a drama than a war film. The war in Saving Private Ryan is the stage, setting up a playground for a number of individuals caught in a singular situation, forced to make singular choices. As a character quotes in the film, ""War educates the senses, calls into the action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man."" Saving Private Ryan is about all that. It explodes into life with an assault on the senses, will (or the lack of it) drives characters and the story along with them and collisions are aplenty. The strength of Saving Private Ryan lies in its characters, who are more than mere foot soldiers in this theatre of war. The film starts off with the landing of an US battalion at Normandy . Soon, the storyline swings to an unpredictable path and the viewer is engaged in the thoughts and actions of a group of men whose paths, both literally and figuratively, are laden with uncertainty.<br/><br/>However, the reason that Saving Private Ryan is a remarkable chapter in cinema history is not just its storyline, characters and their acts, but the theatre of their play itself. Spielberg brings out the ferocity of war to tremendous effect. The viewer is bombarded with gruesome sights and shell-shocking sounds. The violence is captured with immense skill, but true to what is perhaps one of the themes of the film as well as its maker, is never glorified or even rendered aesthetic.<br/><br/>As for the performances, nearly the entire cast is terrific, rendering the movie's exceptional circumstances a credibility which wraps the viewer in its web.<br/><br/>The setting of WW II has deeply influenced cinema and directors from lands far and wide. In the gallery of those films, there are quite a few masterpieces, most of which are united by the fact that they are more than mere war films or war stories, binding in tales of the human spirit. Saving Private Ryan, effortlessly, belongs to that top drawer."
"AaronCapenBanner","8","2","3","18 September 2013"," Powerful War Story.
","Steven Spielberg once again won a best directing Academy Award for this powerful film(based on fact) that opens with the D-Day invasion on Normandy France, and the battle to secure the beaches as the first step toward liberating France. The battle itself is the most realistic portrayal of actual battle conditions ever put to film, so authentic is the chaos, violence, and impact bullets and explosions would really have on limbs and bodies(no sugar-coating or censoring here!) that it is both fascinating yet disturbing as well. Tom Hanks plays Capt. Miller, who is in charge of the platoon, and once the beaches are secured, he is ordered to locate and return home a Private Ryan(Matt Damon) because he has just lost three brothers in battle, and the Army doesn't want the bad publicity of a grieving mother mourning all four sons. Though he and his platoon are astonished by the order, they obey it, and the rest of the film is their journey to find Ryan, and still fight the war.<br/><br/>The first section of the film on the beaches is so powerful and realistic, that the search for Ryan almost feels anti-climatic, yet this film still works because of the realism and superb storytelling involved, though the prologue and epilogue lack the dramatic fireworks they were aiming for, they are still moving enough."

","Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war film set during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat. The film is notable for its graphic and realistic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which depict the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. The film follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen."
"silva-w-pius","8","2","3","4 September 2013"," a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years.
","To everyone else, Saving Private Ryan would be a career defining film, both a critical success and a box office smash, but for Steven, it's nothing more than another stone in the pillar of greatness that is Spielberg, - just when you thought he had laid out all his cards on the table, he finds a way of surprising us again and again, as with each passing of a decade, he is constantly reinventing himself. With the like of; E.T, Schindler's list, Jaws and close encounters of the third kind, he has successfully cemented himself as the greatest living directors in the world. And Saving Private Ryan is testimony to that, a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years. Blending breathtakingly stunning cinematography, skilled and controlled camera movements and sublime storytelling that is now regarded as a staple of all Spielberg films. But not too forget the help he received from an almighty performance by Tom Hanks, star of such films as; Toy story (1,2 and 3), Forrest Gump and most recently Cloud Atlas. <br/><br/>From the gecko, we see instantly know why Spielberg won an Oscar for best director, as near the beginning of the film when the troops land on Omaha Beach on D-day in the midst of a horrific and bloody tug of war with the Germans - In a scene lasting for a staggering 24 minutes, but I would have gladly sat for another 20 on top, due to the share epic that it was. From the start of the scene, the camera work is somewhat very unstable, Spielberg's use of hand-held camera movement during the scene, helps add the effect of confusion and a rush adrenalin, so from the very start we are almost swept into the scene and immersed into the carnage. The instability of the camera movements perfectly reflects the total and utter chaos that the soldiers experienced. And I love this, because it showing us rather than telling us through 10 minutes of the soldiers talking about how bad the war is, making it far more captivating – a smart move from Steven. It is also interesting to note that the opening sequence is filmed in de- saturated colours, emphasising the negativity of the situation, making it seem more morose. This visual pathetic fallacy continues with the dark, stormy weather, making the death seem all the more cold and devoid of emotion. I could easily just review the opening sequence, because it was just that good! It should be taught at film school as a manual on great cinematography. <br/><br/>Eventually amongst all the anarchy we discover the dead body of soldier with Ryan written on his backpack. Then fast forward a few days later, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) reveals to Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), that all three Ryan brothers from the same family have been killed, and he tells John to find the fourth Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), so his mother can have at least one son alive, so she doesn't have to go through that pain of knowing all her sons are dead. John Miller then brings together a troop of trusty soldiers to aid him in this quest. Consisting of; Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper). What follow is a heart wrenching journey for both us and the men, as Spielberg cleverly draws out of us all, the colours of the emotional wheel as we've; Laughed with them, felt regret as some of them die on their journey, we have been scared as the ever looming Germans approach, we felt anger, frustration and the occasional breathtaking triumph. <br/><br/>But what the performance I love the most out of that list of talented actors a superb performance is was performance of Tom hanks, outside the storytelling and the cinematography, it truly stood out for me, from the first time he pops up in screen, during the being on Omaha Beach, When we move on to one landing craft in particular, through a series of close ups we see the share terror in the eyes of some of the soldiers, then we shift to a close up of Tom Hank's hands shaking, and from that moment you could tell this was going to be a stellar performance from Tom, and he certainly didn't disappoint. Because he was just playing the character, he was living the character. As he's attention to detail throughout the rest of the film, helps us believe that is a hero who plays a good front for his soldiers, but is as sacred, and consumed with a feeling of trepidation and fear, just like the rest of them. <br/><br/>To conclude, cinematography, Spielberg's geniuses and Tom hanks performance, are the most vital areas that needs to be covered when reviewing a spectacular film such as Saving Private Ryan, but most Spielberg, because without his brilliance and nonchalant camera angles, Saving Private Ryan may not have ever won 5 academy awards, or never would have become a modern classic, as it unfortunately came after the superb likes of; The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Full metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, so the academy could have thought there wasn't another worthy story to come out of a War film due to the amazing stated, but Steven breaths ingenuity and intelligent filmmaking, to add new life to the war epic, standing up tall next to the greats of the war genre."

Everything from the sound effects of the machine guns, to the camera shaking around like you're actually there with them. All the performances are superb, but tom hanks really stands out. His speech convincing Reiben to stay is phenomenal. Barry Pepper is incredible as The sniper Private Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Uppahm is good, even though i hated Cpl. Uppahm.

You feel the pain of John Miller and his men. Spielberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else.

"StoryCharts","9","2","3","19 July 2013"," Brotherhood is worth dying for
","Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.<br/><br/>Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.<br/><br/>My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are ""good"" from beginning to end and their relationships are ""good"" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plot lines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"

","Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.<br/><br/>The good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.<br/><br/>The actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue whether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.<br/><br/>The bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war."

"Hellmant","10","2","3","11 April 2013"," One of the biggest upsets in Oscar history!
","'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's epic World War II film (from 1998) earned him his second Academy Award for Best Director although it failed to win best picture (being robbed by 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE') in one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history and certainly my lifetime (next to maybe 'CRASH' beating out 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' in 2006). It's still considered one of the greatest and most realistic war films ever made though, being praised most of all for it's opening 27 minute 'Normandy Landings' scene (which was named ""best battle scene of all time"" by Empire magazine). It's one of my favorite war and Spielberg movies ever and probably my favorite film of 1998!<br/><br/>The film was written by Robert Rodat and inspired by a monument, memorializing soldiers killed in battle from the Civil War to Vietnam, which lists eight siblings killed in the American Civil War. 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' revolves around a soldier, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's three brothers are all killed in World War II. In order to relieve distress to his mother Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), orders eight soldiers to find Ryan and bring him home to safety. They're lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who just survived the Normandy Landings. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Vin Diesel play the other seven soldiers. <br/><br/>The film was criticized by some, including filmmaker Oliver Stone, who felt movies like it helped influence the Iraq War (due to World War II being portrayed as 'the good war'). I don't really agree with that assessment but I can see their point. The movie is a masterpiece in my opinion and I think everyone should see it as a tribute to all the soldiers who've died in war. The first time I saw it in the theater was one of the most memorable film going experiences of my life. Who could ever forget those opening 27 minutes (it portrays one of the most nightmarish images ever caught on film)! I think this movie is Spielberg at his very best (in my opinion it's a greater achievement than 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' even). To say I like it more than his more fun movies like 'JAWS', 'E.T.' or the 'INDIANA JONES' series would probably be a lie but it is a more important film and one of the very best of 1998 (definitely better than 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE').<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A"
"shecklermusic","10","2","3","4 March 2013"," The best film period!
","This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Knowing that I have seen Schindlers List and Citizen Kane, that is a bold statement. But, this movie is filled with complex statements about men at war. It goes beyond an antiwar film. War isn't just hell in this movie. It isn't just brutality and violence. It is about the toll on the soul, the burying of identity and the hope that it will be for a reason. It is about the bartering of war. One man you knew for twenty people you will never see. More over, at its core, this isn't even an antiwar film because the film is searching for something that will justify the bloodshed, justify the absurdity of these soldiers situation. War is hell unless something good comes from it. The acting is on point and many of the characters serve a distinct purpose in the screenplay, which is extremely well written. There are symbols that register without thought and the speeches delivered serve to add to the absurdity surrounding the soldiers. I doubt any filmmaker will come close to the achievement that this film is. Watch this today!"
"illbebackreviews","7","2","3","11 February 2013"," 'Saving Private Ryan' is a beautifully told, emotional and gripping war tale
","Considered by many as the best war movie ever made and considered by most as one of Spielberg's many unforgettable classics, 'Saving Private Ryan' in its 150 minute run time tells the story of a group of soldiers who have been sent by the American government to find and recover a lone soldier after his brothers were wiped out in war.<br/><br/>Being released in the year of 1998, when movies like American History X and Shakespeare in Love came out, it is an absolute ""spit on the grave"" insult that this movie did NOT win the Best Picture award, instead being handed to movies of lesser kind such as 'Shakespeare in Love' However, that being said, there is so much I simply love about the movie. The acting is great with Tom Hanks pulling off another blinder of a performance! The rest of the cast all do a great job. The writing is great, often being witty and clever and Spielberg's direction is almost perfect! What do I mean ""almost"" perfect? <br/><br/>This scene is everyone's favorite scene when dealing with the movie and is regarded<br/><br/>as a great scene but this is one scene that I do NOT hate but do NOT enjoy much either. That is the Omaha Beach scene that drags on for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of depicting what war feels like. I can understand it being 10 minutes, that would be a blast of a start but the scene really pulled me out of the movie early on but thankfully recovered after the quest had begun with such amazing scenery, brilliant cinematography and superb special effects along with some great action scenes and very emotional scenes as the movie progressed. Another thing that adds to the greatness of the movie is definitely the characters as all soldiers who were focused on in the movie were very interesting, especially Capt. Miller. Another part I enjoyed was the ending scene, though it may feel a bit cheesy and corny, I found it reasonably emotional and the scene does make you feel its worth sitting through a 170 minute movie.<br/><br/>I can say in conclusion that this is a movie that I would easily recommend to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a classic and that it will live forever. The reason I had to drop one point off my rating is simply the 20 minute beach scene at the start of the movie which dragged on and threw me out of the movie, but I can easily tell that everyone else will love that scene. So, go ahead...Watch the movie! Great film, a classic and perhaps the best war movie ever."

The movie is Amerocentric, to be sure, but it's not about America. Personally, I would also like to see Spielberg's treatment of the RAF in the Battle of Britain as well. HOPEFULLY, a quality British director will take up that cause if Spielberg doesn't. It's not that we don't know that Europeans and especially Russians weren't essential in winning the war, it's that THIS movie is following a group of Americans. Don't like that? Make your own.

","This is my second favorite World War II movie after Schindler's List, which was also made by Steven Spielberg. Saving Private Ryan is captivating and also shows the whole events that war carries, the movie is well acclaimed for its graphic realistic depiction of World War II; since I wasn't there during it, if this is what war looks like, I pray to God that there is no World War III.<br/><br/>The movie is about a United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other soldiers under him as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen and has been ordered by the President to be brought home as his family fears losing all five sons to the war.<br/><br/>There is just one thing about this movie that cut my attention, after Hanks character Captain John H. Miller, drags he crew through the war losing many on their way in crude ways all in the name of finding Private Ryan, they finally found him and Ryan refuses to go back with them, claiming he doesn't need saving. Miller and the remaining of his crew then joins Ryan's course. If I was Miller I would have knocked him (Ryan) up the head and drag him home.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a War Epic film, done by Steven Spielberg, who has been involved in some World War II films before this, like Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List. To prep the guys for the film the cast except from Matt Damon were sent to a ten days ""boot camp"" for training and work on the film set to prepare them for their roles. The reason Damon was excluded was for the other cast to develop a form of resentment towards him, which will help in their reaction to him during filming.<br/><br/>Critically noted for its portrayal of World War II, this film was released to a high positive acceptance and earned a whooping 11 nominations in the Academy Awards, going home with just 5, including winning Spielberg his second Academy Award as a director. The movies cinematography too has to be praised the movie shots during the world War II fight on Omaha beach is a classic to see, that scene has been noted as one of the greatest TV scenes of all time.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was also a commercial success, making more than 6 times its 70 million production cost and its home video sale was massive.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I can bet my name on that you will enjoy, the depiction of the war sequence the sad end to lives during the war, the repercussion of cowardly behavior all added to the drama and the fun you will get while watching this war classic.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","This is simply the best war movie, bar none, so far anyway. This movie set a new standard for the film industry when it comes to recreating combat scenerios. The D-Day scene is the most brutal, realistic depiction of war ever produced. When you go to a movie (war movie or any movie) the filmmakers try to give you the sense of watching that scene play out in real time in front of your eyes, In this one though, Spielberg grabs you by the shirt, pulls you in, and makes you be a witness to the scene as it plays out.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was outstanding. The Cast was perfect and gave performances of a lifetime. The Effects were second to none. The photograph was mind bending. There was not a detail left unattended to. Simply perfect.

","Before there are any misconceptions, I do like this movie. I find it one of Spielberg's best, one of the unforgettable period films of the 90s. With the likes of Tom Hanks, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and a surprisingly good performance from Vin Diesel (can't believe I said that), the acting is pretty damn good. It's recreation of D-Day is probably its strongest scene by far, setting the tone perfectly: sacrifice. The many battle scenes are done without a hitch and there are great strides in the history of war film effects. John William's music is encompassing and well done, not one of his best but still very good.<br/><br/>I have but a few problems with the movie. One, its moral quandary is supposedly the sacrifice of many for one. However, the question honestly seems self-defeating. Why, you probably ask. Because the movie seems to seal this moral lesson in quite frankly one of the most obnoxious characters ever: Upham, played by Jeremy Davies . I'm not sure what the point of his character was. For some time he's a morality tale lifeboat who boast about the indecency of killing soldiers who surrender, fine and dandy, living up to the codes of conduct and what not. However, during the big finale, this character proves to be little more than a coward who's failure to act cost the lives of many. And I know, I know, it in a way simply portrays tragic irony and the confusion battle brings. But the end result, with Upham finally doing what he should've done in the first place seems, dare I say, pointless. After the whole movie seemingly supporting mercy, what was with the sudden redundancy of the message? It seemed the majority of the characters died for reason not even our film makers understood or mixed up.<br/><br/>I've been told this is what you call a 'pro-war' movie, and to an extent it is. All in all, despite its mixed up morality, the film is still one I enjoy though."

In that review, I mention how it was released around the time of Saving Private Ryan, the ""best war film known to man"". So, I stand by that.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is the story of a group of soldiers, led by a captain played by Tom Hanks, one of his best performances, who are sent on a mission during WWII to bring home Captain James Ryan(Matt Damon), a soldier who is unaware that his three brothers have died in combat.<br/><br/>The film has such a great story, and it really brings us into the action and into the character's states of mind. Yet, it is three hours long. But for me that three hours just flew by. Steven Spielberg went home with an Oscar for this film, but the film lost the best picture award to Shakespeare in Love, a wonderful film that isn't as good, to be honest.<br/><br/>The cinematography is marvelous, and the action sequences are riveting. The acting is something that I cannot leave out either. Saving Private Ryan is a captivating and sad film experience that really makes you feel for the characters, and makes you feel a longing to be home.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film is spectacular, remarkable, and definitively unforgettable.

The opening battle scene is my favourite movie scene, completely capturing the horrors of not just World War 2, but every other war as well. Furthermore, Spielberg accurately captures the soldier's emotions in the war, an aspect some war movies lack. The audience is able to put themselves in the soldier's shoes very easily, particularly in the scenes comprising of American deaths.

Miller,together with Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg,Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon as Private First Class James Francis Ryan,a paratrooper who is the last surviving brother of four servicemen.<br/><br/>The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name ""Ryan"" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall, learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan, be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham, skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath, plus privates Mellish, Medic Wade, cynical Reiben from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo, and religious Southerner Jackson, an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan develops into a powerful and potent portrayal of men at war.It sets a new benchmark for realism in World War II films, and defined war movies for a generation. A film of scope and vision rarely experienced, its award-winning cinematography and sound editing helped convey the blood-chilling images that presents war as violent,harrowing, and horrific.Aside from that,it also presents a soul especially with the characters involved.The cast provided brilliant and excellent performances especially from its lead star,Tom Hanks.And definitely,Spielberg was masterful in his direction of the film as he sends an anti-war message but not to the point of condemning patriotism and love for one's country and countrymen.Truly a masterpiece."

Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.<br/><br/>SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.<br/><br/>A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' cliché.<br/><br/>Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.<br/><br/>You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!<br/><br/>The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clichés, but don't judge SPR for it.<br/><br/>The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten."
"zetes","8","2","3","6 December 2010"," Technically amazing, but the story is just okay
","Haven't seen this one since it played in theaters. I didn't think all that much of it then. It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question ""Is it worth it?"", but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding ""DUH!"" Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs. I'd guess that Saving Private Ryan has done more to recruit new soldiers than any Army of One commercial ever has.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it misses several of its main aims. However, while you can castigate Steven Spielberg for misunderstanding his context, you can't say a thing bad about his technical work on the film. Sure, the hand-held aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years (try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of Gladiator), but it was pretty brilliant at the time, and it really puts you right there. War might be fun, but it's also damn scary, and I found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film (I try to forget the Arlington sequences exist) finally comes to an end. The slower, more personal moments aren't the best (partly due to the variable cast, which ranges from fantastic (Jeremy Davies) to acceptable (Tom Hanks) to terribly annoying (Edward Burns and Paul Giamatti)), but they're mostly fine, and always beautifully shot. I love some of the smaller moments of the movie, especially the slap that the little French girl gives her father when the G.I.s are able to hand her back to him, after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence. All in all, while the film is kind of a mixed bag, I do think that the impressive moments far outweigh the overall ponderous nature of the movie."
"Tom-But","10","2","3","9 September 2010"," Shaving Ryan's Privates... no, wait!
","Realistically, if Saving Private Ryan, a masterstroke even by Spielberg's standards, is renowned for anything to the unfortunate global margin who have not yet witnessed its awesome might, it is the opening battle scene at Omaha Beach. In a graphic, unflinching and intelligently crafted 24 minutes of intense combat, Hanks' Captain Miller attempts to lead a scattered battalion up the Normandy dunes where the German's have strategically set up a prime and virtually impenetrable defense, made up of turrets and other artillery which they fire unceasingly at the landing soldiers. This sequence has been lauded, justifiably, as possibly the most realistic, not to mention enthralling, WWII battle scene ever made. <br/><br/>A nonstop, action-packed spectacle of epic proportions, this opening absorbs the viewer to the extent that the experience becomes a predominantly visceral one, where everything on screen is felt rather than seen or heard. When the soldiers begin to yell military jargon to each other amidst their chaotic surroundings, much of which is either inaudible or incomprehensible, the instinctive understanding between the characters and the viewer is mutual: ""We're getting shot at, so shoot back harder!"" During these times when the characters take time to stop and confer with one another, it is refreshing to see Spielberg defy war- movie convention by not also causing the turmoil around them to cease: many a soldier is cut off mid-sentence by an unfortunately aimed bullet/mortar shell. And, as if positioning the camera in amongst this pandemonium would not suffice, Spielberg goes to great lengths to ensure that the audience feels not only like a spectator to this event but a borderline participant; techniques such as allowing a free-fall of water and blood onto the camera and the incorporation of a smouldering grainy effect on the lens that seems to elongate and redefine every stroke of light and colour on screen add to the experience.<br/><br/>Spielberg's meticulous attention-to-detail is a distinctive aspect of his directing style that informs much of the Omaha Beach landing as there's a strong notion while watching that every one of the hundreds of extras on screen is briefed on the scene as fully as possible, being instructed on precisely when and where to shoot, scream, fall, die etc. This, amongst other Spielberg traits, is the mark of a brilliant director and a quality that no doubt won him his second Best Director statue, along with his uncharacteristic choosing of such mature subject matter as in his previous win for Schindler's List five years earlier.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is, at its foundation, a thrilling and rewarding film that succeeds in exhilarating the audience and fulfilling the needs of any adrenaline junkies who happen to be watching. What sets the film apart from a vast category of movies that also achieve this merit is that when the action stops the viewers interest doesn't. This is attributed to the snappily flowing and probable dialogue that never degrades itself enough to be necessary; if any quality of a film is ever more appropriately ordained necessary as opposed to entertaining, rest assured it definitely could've been better. Granted, everyone could have gone without Hanks' speech about the horrors of war and his longing for home, the only truly disingenuous moment of the entire film, manufactured solely for usage at awards ceremonies as a short to accompany Hanks' nominations. But this single scene, try as it might, thankfully does not derail the rest of the film's engaging, at times funny and insightful script; in fact, in being surrounded by such brilliance, Hanks' monologue even becomes somewhat endearing with repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan, a gem in its own right, is heightened to further planes of excellence by a cast of great variety and, at the time, predominant obscurity, with the exceptions of Hanks, Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Nevertheless, each and every one of the mainly young and inexperienced actors that make up Miller's unit are given a chance to prove themselves worthy of their time on screen: modern day action hero Vin Diesel's dying Caparzo pleading for one of his friends to shelter a letter for his father; the eerily captivating Ribsi's Wade speaking of his long-tempered guilt at having deceived his mother; Davies' Upham silently crumbling into a self-loathing, hysterical mess, unable to summon the courage to shoot an enemy soldier; virtually anytime that Goldberg's Mellish and Pepper's Jackson speak, with their casual humour, stoic sorrow and startling arrogance that is as involving as any other character. <br/><br/>Ed Burns as Reiben, the largest supporting role, initiates the first of what has resulted in a typecast career and a slew of hardened, defiant, almost ""bad-boy"" roles. He shatters this façade only once to speak of a beautiful and, most pertinently, curvaceous woman he knows back home whom he thinks of whenever he finds the war around him too much to bear. Sizemore is walking familiar ground as the toughened and ripened authoritarian support, but at least there is a dimension to his character, unseen in the ill-fated Pearl Harbour. Matt Damon in the brief role of Private Ryan is outstanding in his ability to connect with the audience, especially the anecdote he tells involving his three brothers, persuading surprisingly comfortable laughter and a touching sense of loss. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks' fine portrayal of Captain Miller is a truly original character in which there is no hint of the tender Forrest Gump or the jaded but honest Charlie Wilson; Miller is a testament to Hanks' wide and impressive spectrum, which is made abundantly clear anyway by virtually every film he appears in.<br/><br/>An audience-pleasing endeavour that offers as much excitement as it does quaint and unexpected intimacy, Saving Private Ryan is a war film that never seeks to glorify itself, but rather acknowledge that great things can sprout from even the sh*ttiest situations."
"misterlinder","9","2","3","28 February 2010"," Saving Private Ryan is really one of the most realistic and moving war movies that I've ever seen!
","I've seen this film 2 weeks ago and I've never forgotten this dramatic film. It's not only a normal World War II film movie but a movie with a very moving story and many impressive scenes. It's a mus seen film because you really can imagine that you were accompanying the search troop which was looking for James Ryan. Some parts are filmed with hand cameras which have the effect that you're much more on the edge of your seat and thus it takes the character of a realistic documentary film. But also the typical war music makes you feel some shivers. With the actor Tom Hanks as captain John Miller you see a convincing major who plays his role as if he had never been doing something else. Personally I think that this is the best and most dramatic war movie I've ever seen. It really pushes you to think about the situations in war and about the army and all this stuff. I recommend Saving private Ryan"" to everyone who likes war movies with partly true and impressive stories and who isn't scared if he sees sometimes some blood."
"the-gossip-king","8","2","3","20 December 2009"," Admirable work
","I admire this film on many levels. The acting is absolutely superb especially the performances given by Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon and all the supporting actors as well as the other leads, I don't have preferences but I only mention these off the top of my head. The direction by Spielberg is confidant and calm when it needs to be but also ferociously intense when there is a need for it. For every explosion and gun-fight there is a quiet moment between the characters which is just as worthwhile if not more and Robert Rodat's screenplay is pitch-perfect. Janusz Kaminski is one of the finest cinematographers alive and he brings the story alive in exquisite detail. The first twenty-minutes which show the famed D-Day landings is one of the most spectacular and haunting pieces of footage ever caught on film. There are many reasons I love the film but what brought the film down for me was essentially the story. There was no lack of it or too much of it and it was interesting but when Spielberg is fighting for believability in these shots I did not believe it with the story as a back-drop. The story goes that after Damon's brothers are killed around the globe on the same day the army wants to send him home to his mother and sends a group led by Hanks to find him and send him home. While something that is decent. I'm sorry but the government is not that decent and I didn't believe it for a second which constantly brought the film down."
"Stampsfightclub","9","2","3","6 December 2009"," Spielberg shines in brutal and emotional war picture
","A group of U.S soldiers cross enemy territory to take James Ryan (Damon) home to his mother, who has already lost 3 sons.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's brutally honest war drama tells the story of a brave and emotionally uplifting idea of family that exploits the nature of the Second World War in a highly realistic and flinching manor that has won over fans all over the world.<br/><br/>The Jaws director instantly sets off by cementing the main characters at the heart of the battle of Normandy. This opening battle is a mark of true leadership from Spielberg. You simply have to look and see the vast collection of people, main actors, extras, stunt doubles all crowded together to see the work and effort put in by the man and it all works in perfect synchronization to create a devastating feel of realism. The silence of no music and the cries from soldiers and shouts of orders and heavy breathe give this opening a very eerie feel, a necessity to make the feel of the film, which continues uninterrupted throughout the entire duration.<br/><br/>The action sequences of this 1998 release are the key element to its realism. The use of various weapons, the direction of tanks and boats all comes together to create a hardship for the script and emotional feel of battle.<br/><br/>The script adds a great sense of drama that coincides with the film's ambitious outlay. The inclusion of emotional soldier sub stories adds an extra dimension to the already dramatic element of the Second World War. Matt Damon's ad lib for his brother's spying game is a fine example of the emotional core at the heart of the situation. Other elements including friendship and family are well included and portrayed.<br/><br/>The story itself a story within a bigger story is great. This rescue attempt to save Private Ryan included numerous twists, shocking action montages and a battle of personalities withstanding emotion that gives this film a true sense of realism in context, justifying what it would truly be like going to war and dealing with unthinkable consequences.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks leads strongly from the front and though not his strongest role gives a fine leading performance, inspiring the likes of other soldiers in his group to follow suit. Matt Damon as ever is perfect whilst the religious side story to Barry Pepper's protagonist is perfectly emotional and balanced with other sub stories.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction extends to more than just big battle montages. Such as the shot of a hand through dying eyes, the emotional core of doing the duty, the high shots from towers, the character recognition, the director has created something utterly remarkable.<br/><br/>At times the film can slow down a little too much and is quite long but then the relevance is significant of the true battle, as with the filming. The shaking camera and unsteady feel with the colour ratio changing adds spice and a uniqueness to make a groundbreaking and deserved Oscar winner."
"kdavidbushnell","10","2","3","25 August 2009"," Best War movie Ever!
","Easily the best war movie ever, not including Apocalypse Now as a war movie. Saving Private Ryan has a great yet simple plot, a very powerful and interesting story. The characters are all Very believable and some relatable. It is an Epic film, not only the best war movie ever but one of my favorite films. Tom Hanks is very likable, Tommy S is a bad ass. Paul Giamatti is great, even Vin Deisel is good, his most suiting and best role. Speilburg can really do a war film! The cinematography is great. It is the most accurate and raw depiction of Omaha beach on film period. Great film, great war movie. If you haven't seen it where have you been? Make sure you see it"
"spocktom","10","2","3","24 August 2009"," A necessary lesson.
","I won't summarise the film or talk about its technical and artistic brilliance. It is a brilliant film which depicts WW2 as it was, not the sanitised versions we were used to seeing from the 50s onwards. But, to me, there is a more important lesson to be gained from this film...<br/><br/>I went to see this film in a suburban cineplex here in Australia. On the night there was a huge audience and a large group of teenagers who'd wandered in because the film they wanted to see had a full house (I overheard them saying this...). They were boisterous and noisy and sometimes obnoxious as kids can sometimes be at cinemas. But after the first five minutes of the film they were dead silent and they remained so for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I looked at their faces as they exited the theatre at the end of the film. All were ashen-faced, drained...some clearly close to tears. I was happy about this because a film had hammered home to a bunch of modern kids the reality of war without them having to experience it first hand, thank God. All at once they learned that war is horrible, sometimes necessary and best avoided. I'm sure they learned to look at the elderly survivors of this time in human history with a new-found respect. In short, they grew up considerably and without any physical pain as a result of watching this masterful film. And for that, I thank Spielberg profusely. Bravo, Sir."
"inkspotus","10","2","3","24 July 2009"," Exceptional!
","Absolutely a top notch movie. I personally think it is a top 20 film of all time. The acting was exceptional, the special effects where exceptional and the plot was not bad at all. Very realistic! I liked how Tom Hanks portrayed a common man ( before the war) and came to be a very uncommon man during combat. If we look back at the Greatest Generation valor was common to many American sailors, airman, marines and soldiers. The intensity of combat ...or better yet the intensity and urgency of the mission to bring the last son out of France (Combat) kept a tension built up. All around classic and rare film. This film ""hit on all cylinders""."
"djdawkins36","10","2","3","7 July 2009"," Saving Private Ryan is the best movie, period.
","First off, I have heard some reviewers say the Germans are treated like they were born to die. That is definitely not true. In the beginning, they show multiple scenes in which the Americans shoot surrendering Germans out of cruelty. They show the sniper in the tower, show forgiveness as he was about to shoot Caparzo (Vin Diesel) in the head. German also at the end of the movie, showed forgiveness to Upham and walked past him even though Upham was actually armed. OK, now to the movie. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is very disturbing and graphic but it isn't bloody to be bloody. It has a purpose behind it, and that is to show what soldiers had to go through at one point. The scenes in the beginning with the beach was disturbing. The hand to hand combat knife scene at the end of the movie was revolting, yet it demonstrating what hand to hand combat is in war. You will do anything to live, even if you have to kill someone like they do in the movie. OK, just simply put, this is the best movie ever."
"tburke85","10","2","3","19 May 2009"," Saving Prive Ryan One Of The Best War Movies Ever Made
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made period. From the intense harrowing opening battle sequence to it's explosive yet touching climax, Saving Private Ryan grabs hold of you and never lets go. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg brings this movie to the big screen and he continues to prove that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood today. With a great cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Vin Disiel a relatively unknown at the time (in a small role) all turn in terrific performances. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the film. It's one of those movies you should see without knowing too much about it because that only enhances the experience. The battle sequences are jaw dropping, hard to watch at times, and realistic giving audiences a look at what these courageous men went through back then. The running time of 170 minutes did make the movie feel a little slow at times but thats a minor flaw and the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of Spielberg, the cast, or war movies than you'll love Saving Private Ryan. It's one of those films that can be missed."
"KillerLord","10","2","3","9 May 2009"," War As It Is!
","When you see certain movies like Rambo, Commando or Predator, you see a warrior going out in the jungles and taking the whole enemy army down single handed! The truth is that while such movies are good in their own right because they allow you to escape into a world of fantasy, the movies are misleading because war is nothing like what is shown in them. You do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex. You do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other. Those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords. But modern warfare is all about luck. You survive only if you are lucky that of all the thousands of bullets and debris flying around, not one strikes you or even if it does, it strikes you in a way that it does not kill you. Nobody goes into a war without fear. Nobody remembers a country when fighting a war. All that matters is survival - survival at all costs. And that is the true picture of war that Saving Private Ryan manages to show so beautifully.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the Ohama beach war. It is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence. It is so realistic and will forever dispel the notions of any exuberant youth who thinks that war is glamorous. There is nothing glamorous about war and there never ever will be. I have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie. And so I must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore, pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequence.<br/><br/>Spielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man - Private Ryan who has already lost three of his brothers to the World War operations. An order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers. How does the team assigned feel about it? Needless to say, they are grumbling about it but as we should know, a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in reality.<br/><br/>For any person, this movie is a must-watch. It is a must-watch for many reasons. You must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in World War II. It will remind you that war should indeed be the last solution that a nation must resort to. It will remind you that there is no honor and glory in war. There is only one thing - miserable death. This movie will prove to be a life-changing experience for most people. It might even leave you with some sleepless nights. Yet, it remains a movie that I believe one must watch in his lifetime."
"eriktherandom","10","2","3","13 February 2009"," Possibly The Best WWII Movie Ever Made!
","From the word ""go"", I felt immersed in the scene of the D-Day landings. These scenes were indeed frightening, but terrific all at the same time. The camera work was just excellent, and the acting was superb.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed from people leaving comments, many people hold a hostility towards this film because it makes American's look like heroes. This is totally understandable, as we do often gratify ourselves too much. But, this movie was based on the lives of American's in the war, and the writer and Spielberg tried to make it as unbiased as they can, but the fact is more people look at the American fronts more than any other. This is a sad fact as nearly all countries suffered from this great (but yet horrible) war. It is clearly seen in the movie that surrenders of the German side were horrible because our American troops executed some of them, that stirred me in the wrong direction but yet it is true.<br/><br/>And as for previous comments, the English and Canadians did help clear the beaches, but didn't play a huge role.<br/><br/>Setting the issues before aside, this was possibly one of the best movies ever made. I know spots can get dry sometimes as will all movies, but other than that it kept me interested, and entertained."
"GoUSN","7","2","3","4 January 2009"," Brilliant movie even if too violent
","I've just seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time and, as occurs when I first see a film, I quickly check IMDb to see what the Haters and Lovers of the movie say in their reviews. <br/><br/>First, the Haters.<br/><br/>Any time any movie portrays America as savior of Europe in World War II, the result gets panned by these groups (and if they're not yet organized, they should be as they deserve each other): (1) America haters from any country, notably (a) Germany (""we weren't ALL bad"") or (b) the UK (""we carried the burden until the tardy self-interested Yanks decided to enter war, which by the way was almost won when the US came in""), and (2) hard leftists everywhere (how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me). <br/><br/>Hey Germany! You WERE bad! Hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the German electorate, only too happy to see the Jew (and the occasional Bolshevik) blamed for everything afflicting Weimar Germany. <br/><br/>Hey UK! We love you, but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach. Pssst! You, our British cousins, had LOST the war by 1941. It was over, ended, caput, stick-a-fork-in-em done. Winston well knew how critical it was that America enter the war - which it did, and which it won. <br/><br/>We are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the English-speaking world, but it was the English-speaking world's largest country that led the way, turned the tide and won the war. Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't. Britain was sunk and defeated, with precious little industrial capacity left - industrial might had to come from the US and Canada, but mostly the US. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan isn't ""propaganda"" - it contains critical truths, and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda."
"nowright","10","2","3","9 December 2008"," Timeless
","The brilliantly directed, Spielberg World War Two epic, Saving Private Ryan(1998) completely redefines combat action films up until this point. Whether you are one for extreme realism, or just like to watch things blow up, this movie is the epitome of all things good and pure in war movies. There is no compromise in this film, it seamlessly joins drama and action to form a movie that mom and dad would like. It follows a rag tag but elite squad of Army rangers through their historical landing on Omaha beach in Normandy France, to their journey to find and bring home Private Ryan ( Matt Damon) of the 101st airborne. Their mission was to find and retrieve Damon, and send him back to the United States after the tragic news of his three brothers dying in combat. The army thought the loss too great for his mother to bear. However, this was a reoccurring point in the movie, is the life of one worth the lives of many? The squad leader (Tom Hanks) delivers an Oscar- nominated performance that is unforgettable while acting side by side with Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath and Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben.<br/><br/>The movie left me wanting more war movies of the same quality, immediately recognizing the world class directing, cinematography and editing. The emotion and intensity is captured by the shaky camera shots, to the low and high angle pans of the battle scenes and really brought home with the close up of the character's grief and pain. The directing really made this film; it not only enthralled the viewer during the movie, but powerful scenes left the viewer thinking long after the film was over. No matter how I describe the intricacies that make this picture great, none do more justice and give more description than just one word, Spielberg; the credibility is in the name. Sure enough, as credit is given where it is due the movie received five Oscars three of them being Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and Best Editing (Michael Kahn). It also won Oscars for Best Effects and Sound Effects, as well as Best Sound.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you're the ardent movie critic or just an average Joe, there is something that we can all appreciate about this film and leave with the same expression, ""Wow."" This piece of art is nothing less than the silver screen at its best; I give this film two thumbs up (more if I was humanly capable) and my full approval."

","After seeing this movie for the first time last night, The only word that can be used to describe this movie is ""spectacular"".<br/><br/>I chose to rent this movie simply because of the outstanding reviews. Everyone who saw it said that it was a masterpiece, so i knew that i had to see it. I've seen plenty of war movies, some bad, some excellent. Before I move on, I have to say that this is the closest thing there is to Band of Brothers. After watching Band of Brothers countless times, my expectations for Saving Private Ryan were extremely high, but it met them in the end. The only major problem I had with this film was the fact that I had tons of trouble renting it due to me being 15 years of age.<br/><br/>The first scene of the movie shows Ryan as an elderly man visiting an American WWII cemetery in France, and i think that the movie could have done without that scene. That scene tells you right of the bat that Private Ryan lives through the movie, and that someone close to him in the movie dies. Putting that scene aside, the first combat scene takes place on the shores of Omaha Beach, the most gruesome battle of all the beach heads. When it shows the 101st airborne preparing to hit the beaches in the boats, you almost feel as nervous as they are, and as soon as the boat hatch opens, you feel helpless, almost as if you were on the beach, left to die. The entire scene is absolutely jaw dropping, and it drags you through the beach, showing you all the hell and carnage that took place that day.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is very straight forward. A small group of men set out to rescue a ""Private Ryan"". They barely have any idea who he is or where he's located, All they know is his name, and why they need to find him. The acting is really great, and Tom Hanks was as great as I expected.<br/><br/>But, there were a few to many conflicts between the soldiers that really shouldn't of happened, and the soldiers in the film don't realize that the Germans are people to, and they are killing Americans for the same reason they're killing Germans. But I guess soldiers back then didn't realize that either, so it doesn't matter, but it will get to you while you watch the film. Overall, this move was of course ""spectacular"", and it definitely deserves a purchase."

","Mr. Spielberg used all of his directing skill and research into the picture to perfect true war experience. A real feat for a man who had never tasted the terror and insanity of war before, even fire live rounds into hunks of meat to create the best sound of getting shot. Now thats devotion. The story line is a heroic one, a day for all American citizens to stand up proud on veterans day 60 years on, Yet Saving Private Ryan lacks that story line that delivers on all aspects. Maybe I'm being untrue comparing a movie to a TV series, but Band Of Brothers also by Spielberg is a better fulfilling, satisfying storyline, A company of soldiers travelling from Curahee in Georgia USA to Berlin. The ones who made it, the ones who didn't. You remembered. So Saving Private Ryan has changed war films forever. Thank you"

","Saving Private Ryan<br/><br/>By Daniel Rosado <br/><br/>Directed: Steven Spielberg <br/><br/>Cast: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel,Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is movie about a captain and his men going on an unusual mission to retrieve a soldier and send him home. This movie takes place during World War II, and is quite different from other war movies you might have seen in the past.<br/><br/>When you first see Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), he's trying to invade a beach with other soldiers dying all around him. Everywhere you look there's a soldier either being shot through his helmet or someone blowing up. Medics, such as Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), desperately try to save the soldiers, but many of them also get killed. When the first battle is finally over, you see dead men of all ages, some missing limbs, you also see the water near the beach has turned blood red.<br/><br/>Miller and the survivors (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies) of his crew are later on given a mission to find a Private Jason Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and send him back home to his mother. His three brothers have recently died and he was the last of the Ryan boys.<br/><br/>Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), along with the other men, feels that risking their lives, to save one man is very unreasonable. But no matter how much they complain about the mission, Miller tells them that it's their job to complete it.<br/><br/>When they do find Ryan, (the real one) he refuses to leave. He said that his comrades were his new family and he wasn't going to abandon them. But Miller wasn't taking ""no"" for an answer, he decided to have his crew help Ryan complete his final assignment. All of the actors put on good performances for the movie. They really did seem like the type of people you would see go to war. And when one of them would die, you wouldn't feel like ""There goes another character dying"", you would really feel what the soldiers felt when they would lose a comrade.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is movie unlike any other you might have seen in the past. You really do see what the real soldiers had to endure during WWII, and why you honor them for what they did.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars"
"emperor_bender","10","2","3","10 March 2008"," Quite possibly my favorite WWII movie
","This movie was an instant classic. <br/><br/>Everything about this movie was perfect. I could not find a single flaw in the acting, storyline, effects, etc.<br/><br/>First, there's a perfect cast. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice to play Capt. John Miller. Tom Sizemore filled the part as Miller's ""side-kick"", Sgt. Mike Horvath very nicely. Edward Burns was very good as the antagonizing Pvt. Richard Reiben. Barry Pepper was great as the sniper, Pvt. Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg was good as the emotional Pvt. Stanley Mellish. Giovanni Ribisi was excellent as the shy medic, Pvt. Irwin Wade. Jeremy Davies was actually funny and good at the same time playing the clutzy, peace-loving, nervous Pvt. Timothy Upham. Even Vin Diesel gave an excellent performance as the tough Pvt. Adrian Caparzo. Matt Damon was great for the limited time he was in the movie as Pvt. James Francis Ryan.<br/><br/>The gore and special FX were first class. Everything looked so real. It was as if they were in the actual battles. D-Day landing at Dog One was particularly gory and well made. This movie must have had one hell of a huge budget, and it payed off big time. <br/><br/>The sound score went excellent with every scene. It really made you feel for the events that were occurring.<br/><br/>The story was also great. Usually war movies have a pointless storyline but Saving Private Ryan proves them wrong with a story of its own. <br/><br/>This movie was perfect, Spielberg at his best. It deserves its place on the top 250. <br/><br/>I recommend this to war/action movie fans of all kinds. 10/10."
"general-melchett","10","2","3","13 January 2007"," A brilliant war film - the best ever!
","Bullets slash through the air. Everything explodes around you. Your men are getting shelled to death everywhere you look. Blood goes in your face. You lose your sanity in war. You don't know what to do, or where to go. This is SPR's depiction of Omaha Beach on D-Day 1944, and an absolutely brilliant one at that. Not since SPR has any filmmaker with any budget churned out an action scene as horrifyingly real as this film's brutal depiction of the Normandy landings. Even if for nothing else other than the first half-hour, you should still watch this film. From the moment you see nervous recruits chuck up inside the Higgins boats, you can tell you are in for a stunning action scene. Though after that the film won't ever be as intense or shocking in its action, it is still something truly special. The desaturated colours, abundance of shouting, swearing and explosions tell you one thing - this is war. Though Black Hawk Down is easily as intense as this, it just doesn't have the gritty feel of SPR and you can't exactly care about the characters. But on this, you can - they're all real people leading real lives back home - no horrible sacrifices or acts of heroism - just ordinary guys like us, thrust into a world that they didn't like and in which they knew death awaited them at any corner. I doubt anybody will ever make a war movie that will recapture SPR's dizzy heights. Flags of our Fathers didn't do the job and Letters From Iwo Jima, though it is looking promising, just isn't intended to be a box-office smash. Though SPR is full of war-movie clichés, it is far better than most movies and besides, it is hard to like a movie without an emotional or sentimental side - every film needs a heart. And the war memorial scenes at the beginning and end of the film show us what SPR wanted to be all along - a respectful homage to the soldiers of WWII. To be honest, with all the intense and bloody action scenes in this film putting us in the thick of battle, it is good to have a bit of emotional contemplation once in a while. War is brutal and unforgiving, but war is also saddening and tear-jerking - Saving Private Ryan uses both those sides to its advantage. Forget major plot twists or superbly intelligent and brilliant scripts, clever plots that lose you and amazing hero characters - realism is the place to be in war cinema. That may explain why Saving Private Ryan did so well for itself. 10/10"
"jordman10","9","2","3","9 November 2006"," Brilliant but can't watch again.
","Okay, first things first. This movie is violent. Realistically violent. That is not good for a movie. There are violent films. Then there are violent films that are unpleasant to watch. Don't get me wrong. This is a great film. But, lets face facts, you can't watch this movie more than once. It got to the point where I stood up in tears yelling at the screen ""STOP IT, STOP IT!"" Much glorified violence in the film which I hate. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg in my opinion is a very sick man. His films always feature innocent people being slaughtered in some realistic manner. Whether it be being eaten, being vaporized, or being inadvertedly blown up by a bomb. Also it messes with your head big time. You watch the death scenes and you watch the Americans getting slaughtered and your like ""Yeah get those sons of b%$*&*!"" But then they capture the Nazi and he's only following orders. Then they kill him and you ask yourself ""Well, who's the bad guy here?"" Adam Goldbergs death was chilling and incredibly painful to endure. At which point I realized. He just wanted to make a violent film. After witnessing that over the top, violent, and completely unnecessary death I wondered why I was watching it.<br/><br/>This film emphasizes the horrors of war though. This film is useful. It is a wake up call to all those conservatives who are trying to shove American customs down Iraqs throat. Our soldiers have been suffering this horrific ordeal for years and why? WWII was for a better cause. This film is a one time thing. It is a wake up call mostly. but, other than that it was graphic, realistic, and over all very painful to watch. Unless your the violent creep who gets off with violent movies. In that case go crazy."

"ozoneboy122000","8","2","3","14 October 2006"," Saving Private Ryan easily stands as a film that is one of the most realistic interpretations of WW2
","Saving Private Ryan a film that has been hailed by many as one of the most realistic WW2 drama's to date, both in its context of battle and of its initial atmosphere, few WW2 drama's are unable to capture the harrowing battle that was of WW2, but Saving Private Ryan incorporates the power that churns your stomach as minute after minute you will see soldier's being instantly blown to pieces.<br/><br/>As you most probably know Saving Private Ryan is a Steven Spielberg film and Spielberg himself admitted that he has a self-obsession with the WW2 context, as many of his earlier films such as the Oscar scooping film Schindler's List and Empire of the Sun are typical examples of films that are to do with WW2 and by in large they have very similar elements in common with each other.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan has quite an unusual storyline for a WW2 picture but it does stand out, basically after the historic D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach, a Captain who goes by the name of John Miller must go along with seven other men to search for a missing soldier known as Private James Ryan who's three brothers had been killed in combat and for most of the film you will be seeing sequences of how the men proceed to find him and what they must risk to get to him. The storyline is successful in leaving a huge impact on the viewer(s) but for the most part the storyline is not that attractive, for one thing viewers just prefer to see Saving Private Ryan for its action and realism rather than for the fictional story that has been laid out in it.<br/><br/>But even though this film possesses a disputable story there are actually a host of notable actors in this film that do a good job of backing up the film's rather sensitive storyline, Tom Hanks gives a riveting performance as Cpt. John Miller, well as the film's main supporting actors Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and of course Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan give some very excellent portrayals of their characters in the film's premise.<br/><br/>All throughout Saving Private Ryan is an excellent film, it includes some very realistic physics in terms of its action and the characters themselves really stand out, but unfortunately the film's storyline can be quite slow and offhanded and appears to be a little too innovative and overrated, but if you're seeing Private Ryan for the first time then the storyline might be the source that will entice you to watch it to the bitter end."

","After the D-Day invasion, Captain Miller (Hanks) an his squad of seven other soldiers go through Normandy to find James Francis Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in action. As the squad searches to find Private Ryan, they asked the inevitable question, why are they risking their lives to save one soldier.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is the best film to react the D-Day landing. It is both horrific and gruesome. It really shows how the landing took place. Unfortunately, the film never gets better than the first 20-25 minutes.<br/><br/>The plot is good and is something I have never seen before in a war film. The characters are also very good, though it seems like Speildberg just threw in every military job there is in this film. The Motley Crue includes a sniper, a medic, a linguist, and many more.<br/><br/>The directing and dialouge is very well done. It just seems like it takes itself a little too seriously at times. It also seems like some scenes drag on a bit to long.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Hanks does a fantastic job, as does everyone else. The only one I thought didn't act as good was Matt Damon as Private Ryan. He has a fairly short role and didn't live up to it.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a great war film with good directing, a good cast and a good premise. Its just too bad that it dragged on a bit to long and took itself too seriously. Other than that, it is a great movie to watch if you need a war fix, just don't expect anything revolutionary in the genre.<br/><br/>8/10"
"moonotter1951","10","2","3","2 September 2006"," War never produces ""winners""...
","The opening scene alone should remind us that war never results in ""winners,"" only the living and the dead and the traumatized and the maimed. And the Powers That Be that send them out to fulfill their agenda. Will we ever learn? This movie is a must-see for all who not only want to end war, but want to honor those who have been sacrificed and bravely died hoping to end all wars for all of us. We are reminded that while war is not honorable, human beings (both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"") are, and every soldier has a home, a family, a history that is remembered by someone, somewhere. Saving Private Ryan reminds us that they should be remembered by all of us. With hope that the ""war to end all wars"" won't be the end of us all. Tom Hanks is his stellar self, Tom Sizemore is perfectly cast and Giovanni Ribissi (sp?) proves to be a perennially underrated gem of an actor. Thank you, Steven, for this incredibly realistic and important film."
"carmenyfred","10","2","3","31 August 2006"," Rank on helmets
","Great movie from the standpoint of emotional trials and tribulations of war and especially WWII but no soldier or officer, in that war ever wore his rank in to battle on his uniform, helmet, flag, overcoat, automobile, never ever. The first person shot by the enemy is the one wearing rank. If you want to die quickly, wear your rank into battle. This is an old lesson learned in the War between the States. The ""Pickets"" snipers of that war learned quickly to shoot the highest ranks first. This rule is a very logical assumption and for the life of me I cannot figure out why a detail man such as Stephen Spielberg, of all persons, would ignore such an important detail. For me, this detail takes away much of the realism intended and I had to deal with it another way."
"sgtbaxter-1","10","2","3","30 August 2006"," I still shake after watching this film
","I just recently watched this film again for what must be the nearly 30th time, and I still find myself numb and shaking like I did leaving the theater in 1998. I remember that night every time I watch this movie, nobody spoke leaving the theater, a lot of people were crying, and I believe everyone had the sick sensation in their stomach and shaking hands I did.<br/><br/>Personally I don't believe there has been a war movie that has ever captured even closely what it's truly like to be engaged in actual close fighting, and then came along this film. Yes, the characters are fictional but the events their story takes place in are real and portrayed as accurately as could be humanly possible to recreate on film. The action is intense, and completely realistic and sickening to imagine anyone could have endured such events and survived.<br/><br/>I find myself crying during the D-Day invasion, and various other points during the film. Most notably when Capt. Miller sits down on the rock after they take the German nest and can't control his hands and starts sobbing. Anyone who remains dry-eyed after Ryan asks his wife to tell him he's lived a good life at the end must not have really comprehended the film.<br/><br/>I consider this technically the greatest war film ever, the set decorations are unbelievable, the modified tanks are more than convincing, the weapons 100% the real item, and little details abound throughout the film (such as the shot surrendering soldiers during the initial invasion actually being Czech soldiers who would have been forced into the German army).<br/><br/>Most importantly, I think this film is important to show in educational settings. Yes, it's violent. Yes, it's full of language and even shows U.S. soldiers in questionable moral situations (like shooting the surrendering soldiers aforementioned). However, if it can educate upcoming generations to what horrors war really presents to those participating, then perhaps there will be hope for mankind after all. When my daughter inevitably comes home from school one day and asks me what war is about, I plan to sit her down and show her this film, and make her watch the entire movie no matter how uncomfortable she gets.<br/><br/>My favorite Spielberg movie, and one of in not my favorite movies of all time. I'd give it eleven stars if I could. This is one I'll watch regularly until my grave."

"shorteze","10","2","3","20 July 2006"," Living History
","Saving Private Ryan may not be a completely accurate portrayal of the western front in WW2, but it does have something in common with its equally great descendant ""Band of Brothers"". What this film does is make it feel like you are there: from Omaha Beach to Ramelle.. No other film does that. Its almost as if they went back in time and filmed this; its almost 'genuine'.One of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that.<br/><br/>Now,there are a few historical inaccuracies people have noticed (such as the Church tower in Ramelle which,according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy) but I don't think it will detract from the film. The question this film poses is if it is truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person. I think with the current situation in Israel with the kidnapped soldiers, this question has never been so apparent.<br/><br/>So,although its not a great way to learn WW2 history,its a great way to experience it.Like many others this film got me interested in the period."

Even though I didn't see it in theaters I was blown away with the realism of it all. What makes this film so intense is that Speilburg filmed it himself with small one-hand cameras to give you a first person glance at the battle at hand.

"nodoubtgurl13","10","2","3","27 May 2006"," Amazing! One of the best war movies I've ever seen
","I first saw SPR back in April of this year in my 11th grade History class, and it stunned me. Even now I still get chills thinking of some of the scenes. The opening landing on Omaha Beach and the scene where Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) gets stabbed were enough to give me nightmares for weeks afterward.<br/><br/>The sounds of battle were so real during the initial landing scene that I covered my ears and put my head on my desk. It was as if me and my classmates were storming the beach with the soldiers, getting shot at and shooting back.<br/><br/>Even so, I wanted to see it again, not for the blood and gore, but for the characters. Wade was the one that I identified with the most; the kindly medic would do anything to save a soldier, even when he was already gone. The two parts that really have stuck with me are the scenes where Medic Wade and Private Mellish die, mainly because those are my favorite characters (yay for Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg!!).<br/><br/>Wade's scene had me in tears; it was so touching how they were trying to save him. Even as he was going into shock and hallucinating, they kept up a steady flow of chatter to distract him as they put pressure on the wounds; it made me cry even more as I heard what Jackson was whispering to him as Wade was fading out of consciousness: ""shhhhhh, you'll be alright, Wade shhhhhh"". It was beautifully tragic how Jackson comforted him in his last moments, whispering to him and rubbing his forehead.<br/><br/>And the other scene (Mellish's death) was an absolute knockout. He's fighting this German SS soldier guy, and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor. As the soldier starts to kill him, Mellish pleads for his life, and do you know what that soldier does next? HE SOOTHES HIM AS HE STABS HIM TO DEATH! ""Give in . . . you have no other choice ... make it easier for both of us...the war is over for you. Shhh. Rest now... shhhhhhhh, it's easier for you this way"" That one scene made me so sad and angry at Upham for being a coward and not helping Mellish that I wanted to break something.<br/><br/>Everyone in my class thought Corporal Upham was a cowardly bastard who should have been shot when they got a chance, and I agreed with them. But I could also identify with him. He was relatively new to combat and inexperienced, scared of what he had to do. If I were him I'd be scared too.<br/><br/>This movie has shown me what war is really like; it's hell on Earth. The glossed over Hollywood fluff of war movies of the past is dead to me. I've always been a very empathetic person, and I was warned before watching this that it would be very VERY gory, and if I needed to, I could step out and get a drink of water. I didn't leave. I watched through clasped hands, biting my lip to keep from crying; I didn't close my eyes to the horror.<br/><br/>I would have to say that EVERY high school student in the United States should see this movie; if not all of it, they should at least watch the opening beach landing scene. Teens these days are so desensitized to violence that they don't know what real violence is. This movie will change their minds. I know it changed mine."

","The story raises hard moral questions relating to the relative value of human lives and the overwhelming debt that may be felt by those who benefit when others sacrifice.

Having researched the German WW2 army specifically and WW2 in general I found the uniforms flawless, and the tactics in which the Germans fought to be relatively correct! Most if not all of Saving Private Ryan is great acting in which leads most into believing it is what most military men would due in world war two. I personally think that this movie would be a perfect thing for people to believe is correct. This movie shows that war is a lot more gruesome than most think. Parents if u have a child that thinks a life in the military would be nice, or loves collecting war militaria or anything related I believe no matter what the rating parents should show there child this and tell war is even worse than this film a lot worse."

","flawless. That's the one word i would use to describe this film. I've never seen anything like it, it was definitely written by someone in the war and with respect for those who served in World War II. The acting is perfect and every bit of it is exactly how my grandparents describe war. If your seeing this not for the storyline, but for the violence, then shame on you. I am rarely touched by movies, but this touched me, especially the ending. Every battle scene is brilliantly played out and every actor does a brilliant job. If you haven't seen this movie, then you better get off your computer and run out and go see it. It is by far the best war movie ever made and a classic."

","Currently the best movie made about any war. Since its release it has been inevitably used as the standard by which other war movies are judged, including (unfairly) movies that were made decades before it.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are horrifyingly realistic and the performances are exceptional. It is unbelievable that this film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost to Shakespeare In Love.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have about this film is how quickly and easily CPT Miller's unit made it across the beach and up the bluff at Omaha Beach. The carnage and amount of casualties were pretty realistic, but in reality Company C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion took over an hour to reach the crest. After reaching the top they still had hours of hard fighting before any significant area was secure."

","When you think of bloody, horrible wars you think of Vietnam, maybe Korea. When you think of World War II, you picture Bob Hope entertaining the troops, or people back in the states dancing to Glenn Miller. Saving Private Ryan shows what World War II, the most defining war in human history, was really like. The D-Day invasion of World War II, was to decide the future of the world; fascist, or democratic. Would the world be free, or enslaved by Nazis? D DAY, NORMANDY France 1944- an American squadron is looking for a missing comrade. The movie opens with a 20- minute war sequence with Captain John Miller's unit landing on Omaha Beach, and trying to push the Germans further east to liberate Western Europe. Even though the allies win this battle, body parts and blood is everywhere. This film is full of graphic violence and gore.<br/><br/>Then the film shifts back to a government clerical office where secretaries are typing condolence letters to the mothers who lost sons in battle. It is noticed that Mrs. Ryan of Iowa has lost three of four sons in the D Day invasion. Brought to the attention of army brass, they decide that the US army must rescue James Francis Ryan, Mrs. Ryan's only remaining son.<br/><br/>Finding Private Ryan is like looking for a needle in a haystack for Captain Miller's squadron. At times morale is very low. You see the difference in personalities of Privates Jackson and Reiben. Jackson is a fighter, a war- monger, who doesn't care why he's there. He just wants to please his commander, and kill the Germans. Reiben on the other hand is wary, cautious, and even somewhat belligerent. About two-thirds of the way though the story, Reiben is at odds with Miller on the release of a German POW, and even threatens to go AWOL, but he along with Jackson fights with honor and bravery in the final battle.<br/><br/>After days of searching for Private Ryan, Captain Miller's unit finally finds him guarding a strategically important bridge with a lost squadron. Private Ryan does not want to leave his troupe, considering them the only brothers he has left. This leads to a suspenseful climax.<br/><br/>When a large German battalion spots the two American units guarding the bridge, fighting breaks out. Who will survive this horrible war? The Americans appear outnumbered. Will they be able to save Private Ryan from dying like his three brothers? Will Mrs. Ryan lose her last son in this war? Saving Private Ryan, another spectacular film by Steven Spielberg, is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It was nominated for Best Picture. Best Director Oscar went to Steven Spielberg. Art Direction and Cinematography in the film is top notch, as are the beautifully choreographed fight scenes, which are dramatic, suspenseful, and ultra-realistic."

","I posted my original comments on this film the day it first hit the American screens. I will never forget the experience of seeing this film. It was 11 a.m. on a beautiful sunny day. Me(at the time a 35 yr woman) and about 25 old men ( I am assuming many WWII vets) sat in that darkened theatre and watched this incredible film. When the lights came back on we all sat stunned and then filed out into the daylight, all of us wiping the tears from our faces, some of the men very emotionally moved and crying in their seats.<br/><br/>My dad was a WWII radioman in the Navy, his brother was a ship commander, the other in the National Guard. When pressed, my dad would tell me some stories of his time in service. Seeing this film and the faces of those old guys in the theatre helps me understand why dad never talked too much about it. It was that devastating a film, that devastating a time.<br/><br/>I was in another room last night, when I heard the familiar sounds of the landing at Omaha Beach coming from the living room t.v. For about the 30th time I was drawn to watch those intense opening scenes, once again drawn into the action. Just watching that first intense half hour, the bodies washing up in the blood red waves, the look in Tom Hanks eyes, the echoey silence surrounding Barry Pepper as he makes to shoot the first sniper to open Dog 1, well I was again knocked back with emotion. I again was so very impressed at how Spileberg did so much, so well in this film; from the distinctive camera work, to the small details like the drops of blood on the camera lens, to assembling the fine team of actors that brought such life to this film and such feeling for their deaths, to the incredible, adrenalized battle sequences at beginning and end, to the very simple moments throughout and the stories of the men.<br/><br/>I just had to write again, so many years later, to say I really admire this film. It is important, not only from the perspective of film appreciation, but also for the genuine and heartfelt way it tells of one of the most important times in American history and the very brave men who sacrificed so much."

","Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is clearly one of the most praised war movies so far. It is an account of World War Two from the perspective of Captain John H. Miller and his squad on their mission to save one man, Private James Francis Ryan, who is the surviving brother of three. Each soldier questions the initiative and reasoning behind saving one man. Is it worth it to save man and risk the lives of many soldiers? The answer is obvious by the end of the movie. The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view with a focus on Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson, Private Mellish, Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and T-4 medic Irwin Wade. The most breathtaking scene opens with the soldiers moving on Normandy beach on 6 June 1944. The gate on the boat drops down and releases a surge of chaos. As the viewer sees three or four soldiers drown they begin to realize that this movie is taking them for an emotional ride. This scene is not drawn from pure Hollywood imagination; it is a highly accurate account of any soldier's experience during D-Day. Captain Miller and his squad are assigned to find Private James Ryan so he can go back home. Miller's squad is forced to put away all of their morals and philosophies in order to do their job. It is apparent that Miller has a different initiative at first when he's given the mission. He was promised a chance to go home and see his wife; a chance most any man would not give up, but when he actually found Private Ryan it seems that he was glad to have saved him. This is the perfect example of self-sacrifice during world war two. Not only were men and woman forced to give of themselves to save the land, but they were also forced to save each other."

","This was an excellent movie, rich in character development, well performed roles and topped off with a compelling theme. I LOVED the irony of eight men sent to save one.<br/><br/>Some say the Omaha landing portrayal was unrealistic, but I'd like to see someone pull off the miracle of a better Omaha scene than SPR's. It was as accurate as film can capture that violent moment. You can either deal with that, or complain as if action is all that matters.<br/><br/>This story is essentially about the characters (normal people in extraordinary circumstances). The war, believe it or not IS BACKGROUND. This story belongs to the nine main characters; not the entire war effort. This is why only American's are portrayed. If you're looking for ""The Longest Day"" setup, why don't you check out 'Cliches R' Us'? Anyhow, this is why we don't see the other allied nations in this movie. Spielburg wasn't saying ""American's did all the work."" The story is about soldiers who happened to be Americans. Case closed.<br/><br/>Some argue the story is too one sided, portraying all Germans as ""Dirty Animals"". However, there are many segments that suggest this isn't the case. The Americans act cruel in some scenes, and Germans do the same in others. It was fair to both sides. There was nothing enthusiastic in the scene where the two German prisoners are executed. Ultimately we must remember this movie is in the American POV. When Wade and Kaparzo died, we lost two of the films main characters. Of course their death scenes were to be more emotional than that of some 'extra' playing a German.<br/><br/>As far as flaws go, there are only two worthy of mention.<br/><br/>In the scene where Tom Hanks takes out three men with his Thompson (a minute before he meets Ryan), the very last German dies long after the tommy gun's sound effect expires.<br/><br/>In the scene where Jackson is in the church tower (making his final kills before he dies), he fires seven to eight shots with the Springfield WITHOUT RELOADING. The Springfield 1903 never held more than five bullets in any of its many modified models."

","Saving Private Ryan is probably the best war movie ever made! Everything about this film is awesome, including the acting, the special effects, and the music. What make's this film different from other war movies? It has no music when they're fighting, of course! This only makes it more realistic, and it seems like Steven Spielberg will never run out of ideas!<br/><br/>The beginning is quite disturbing and graphic, but the special effects were amazing when they filmed it! This movie is also really sad, probably one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, but that doesn't make it bad, at all. I haven't seen many war movies, but I bet Saving Pvt. Ryan and Schindler's List are his best. I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg films, and this is my favorite of his movies. <br/><br/>What really makes this film good are probably it's acting and special effects. Tom Hanks did an excellent job acting out John Miller in the movie, like always acting as if it was really happening. Everyone else in the film is nearly as good as Tom Hanks, and they all act like real soldiers. The special effects are what bring this movie to the top. The special effects make this movie brutal and realistic, and I've never seen a film that's more graphic.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see.

","The above, ^, is a quote by the famous Union general William T. Sherman. Saving Private Ryan shows the hell, fog, and confusion of war. What else can I say? How about Based on a true story? It was. In the brief scene with General Marshall, where he reads a letter to a Mrs. Nieland in Boston, one signed by Abraham Lincoln, it's not General Marshall, played by Dale Dye, a former Marine captain, who's reading it. It's John de Lancie, Star Trek's Q, who's the uncredited letter reader. It opens with an older Ryan and his family at the American cemetery in Normandy. He's at the grave of Captain John H. Miller, the man who saved his life, in Normandy in 1944. So what's the message of Saving Private Ryan? Since I opened this review with a quote from General Sherman, why don't I close it with one from the Book of John? ""Greater love hath no man than this: That he lay down his life for his friends."" Maybe I should paraphrase the epitaph on an unknown Marine who died on Guadalcanal. ""When he gets to heaven, to St. Peter he will tell: 'Another soldier reporting, sir. I've served my time in hell."""
"Percivalx","10","2","3","12 November 2005"," Spielberg puts us in the midst of war!
","You know why this is one of the best war films of all time? Because Spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war! We experience the unvarnished, direct, and all the nitty-gritty details that went on in battle. I can't think of any other film of the same genre which has done this. He does this by using shaky POV camera shots, showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot, brutal sound effects, etc. We also get a solid storyline with an actual plot. Our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete (besides winning the war). After a grueling 20-minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on D-Day, Capt. Miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private Ryan, a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines. His three brothers have just been killed in action and the Army wants to send him home. This leads Capt. Miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcome.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and company are excellent. They all give convincing and rather low-key performances. Giovanni Ribisi and Matt Damon are particular standouts. Another thing I loved about the film was the pacing. The balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect. You hardly notice that it's a 2 hr and 50 min film. The photography by Janusz Kaminski is incredibly distinctive. It has this ""washed-out"" look which makes it look like an old war newsreel. John Williams' musical score is also appropriately effective. It's not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for Schindler's List but good enough to appreciate. Without a doubt, all this wouldn't have been achieved if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg's expertise. Once again, he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it. I can live with the fact that the film didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadn't won for Best Director. A great war film and one of the best of the 90's!"

"qdude440","10","2","3","20 August 2005"," A captivating, yet flawed, masterpiece
","Steven Spielberg's war time drama Saving Private Ryan, often get's recognition as the greatest war film ever. I think that opinion is wrong, but it certainly may be the most realistically shot, hard edged war film of all time. It is a masterpiece, not without its strong points, yet certainly not without a number of flaws that prevent this from being a true classic, any which way you bend it.<br/><br/>The story starts out with an elderly man visiting the Arlington National Cemetery, visiting his fallen comrades of 60+ years. The movie takes place around the events of D-Day, June 6, 1944, starting with a captivating and harrowing battle sequence showing us young ones, such as myself, just what it may have been like in WWII combat. The gore, violence, and cries are all very real, and little is left to the audience's imagination, we can even get a taste of what the characters are thinking and/or seeing.<br/><br/>After the 20 minute battle sequence, we find that a boy, Pvt. James Ryan, has lost all 3 of his brothers, and by government orders, he is forced to leave combat and return home. Most of the film focuses around the troop of American soldiers who go through hell to find him.<br/><br/>After the Normandy scene, the plot rarely really thickens, and arguably is no longer as convincing or as interesting. The script is painfully cliché and average, and there really isn't much in the way of character development. Spielberg makes the most out of what he's given, occasionally going for the visual eye candy, and occasionally slowing the pace down and attempting to give the film some serious emotional momentum.<br/><br/>Spielberg attempts to show both sides of the war, but too often falls back on his own personal bias, attempting to cause the audience to emotionally stir and get their juices flowing, often when there's not much juice to flow and not many emotions to be stirred. Sometimes he tries to tackle the challenge of making a mountain from a mole hill. These scenes occasionally work, yet they too often feel forced and empty, such as the over done, unequivocal Allie death scenes, which try too hard to force a response from the audience's mouthes.<br/><br/>The story takes a few jolts, and is never really predictable, despite the often clichéd telling of the going-ons, but after awhile it seems a bit two dimensional.<br/><br/>One thing I did like was the use of the character of Ryan {until the end} as a metaphor. Spielberg uses his name as a metaphor at times for the freedom these men might never again see, freedom they might never find again. Ryan represents peace, and they just can't find it, not even amongst themselves. As I said, the film is at times visually stunning, and the acting performances really help in some cases to bring life to otherwise dead characters. Tom Hanks is riveting as usual, refusing to be held back by the dulled script.<br/><br/>The very ending actually left me bitterly disappointed. Its not that I was appalled by the patriotic message, Spielberg is perfectly entitled to make a film that celebrates the American dream of Freedom, but I was mad that the film once again decided to tell/show us everything. That's the problem. Far too often Saving Private Ryan shows us too much, not leaving anything up to our imaginations. As a war film, it should show us a lot, but the overall messages in the film are whetted down by further scenes that could have worked better if they had remained out of the film. The ending could have worked on several different levels, but instead Spielberg almost tarnishes the would be message of the film, by showing an emotional 5 minute end scene with elderly Ryan and his family. I was a bit disappointed with what Spielberg left, or rather didn't leave, up to us, the audience to decide for ourselves. <br/><br/>The film is at times guilty of shoving attained beliefs down our throat. But Saving Private Ryan still has plenty of good, heartfelt moments that interlude over the bad, and for that it still works as a movie, but certainly suffers from several near fatal flaws.<br/><br/>7/10"
"cynical_plasticman","7","2","3","28 January 2005"," Well-executed, but essentially flawed
","A visceral and engaging film, with powerful battle scenes, that presents a factually- and emotionally-biased view of the war. It's a polished endeavour, worth watching, but it loses marks because Spielberg just *has* to patronise the audience by showing Ryan as an old man. Had he not done so, I think that the movie would have been far more effective as both a creative endeavour and a moral message.<br/><br/>The film is clearly designed with the American public in mind - there are no British or other Allied forces at all in the movie, and the French civilians and German soldiers are essentially stereotypes. The film itself is both well-scripted and -cast, but I can't help but feel that its protagonists are essentially precisely deployed character-types designed to elicit set emotional responses in the audience. The lack of emotional ambivalence in its story and characters lends a sense of superficiality to the whole affair that makes the picture, in my mind, remarkably forgettable.<br/><br/>I would say that the movie is a fine example of Hollywood product. It has all the necessary elements of a classic film. However, scratch the glossy surface and I think one will find a disappointing lack of depth and a disappointingly familiar lack of respect, on Spielberg's part, for the audience's ability to think for itself."

","I have mixed feelings about this movie. While it is clearly one of the better WW2-movies to come out the last decades it must still be one of the most overrated films ever.<br/><br/>A small group of soldiers set out to find a paratrooper, private Ryan, who has landed behind enemy lines in Normandy. The reason is that Ryans brothers have all died in the war and now the army will try to bring Ryan home so that at least one son in the family can be brought home to his mother alive.<br/><br/>I said in the beginning of this review that this movie is overrated. And i stand by that comment. This movie has received a rating of over 8 here on IMDb which i think is preposterous. What this movie has that makes it very good (although not great) is the battle scenes. They are simply the best i have ever seen. The adrenaline rush, the shaky close-ups, the gore. Seldom has the complete terror of battle been captured this well. Those scenes are worth a rating of 10. But the rest of the movie? That is where the problems begin. Because the story is rather dull and unbelievable. And the pace is at times very slow. But more than anything the characters disturb me. They act like idiots. I don't know if the soldiers in World War 2 acted this stupid, or if this is some strange addition by director Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>My point in the end is that this movie contain great elements, but they alone do not make this a great movie. When all is said and done i give this movie a rating of 6, that could have been 8 if the story had been stronger and the characters more believable."

","This is, of course, a popular film. I happen to own this DVD, but at the same time there are only a few scenes that stick out as spectacular in the genre of war films. The few well done battle scenes were the reason I bought this, but some of the glaring faults are what would lead me to give this film a 7 out of 10, rather than 10 out of 10 as productions like Black Hawk Down and even Band of Brothers deserve.<br/><br/>First, one of the most obvious problems with the film starts right in the opening scene. We see all these dirty faced, rugged looking men on their way into what is certainly the scariest moment of their lives. Then suddenly we see baby-face Tom Hanks with his smooth skin clean shaven and groomed like the son of a politician. It creates a contrast right there in the opening scene that is disruptive to the mood and becomes disruptive later on in the film as well. Don't get me wrong. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but he looked 100 times more rugged in Castaway as he did in this film.<br/><br/>Secondly, was Vin Diesel. OK, so people like him. Don't get me wrong here either. I'm not going to claim that he lacks intelligence outside of his films, although I know he did drop out of college but that's not relevant. However, in his films it seems like he always plays characters who don't display an IQ higher than 70. I'm not so sure this is how the characters were written as much as it is how he plays the roles. His acting is unnatural, stiff, forced, and lacks realism. He just comes off idiotic in all of his movies. He became known in the film world for a film he wrote and directed, I believe. Maybe he should try his hand at that instead of trying to be the next Arnold Swartzenegger, because he's not buff enough and he's too awkward as an actor to play that role.<br/><br/>Third, as I said before, the film has some great battle scenes, which is why I bought the DVD, but we have these moments that would best be described as superficial moments in the film. For example, these moments that seem like they are in place only to demonstrate Tom Hanks witticism, or moments that make the Nazi soldiers like idiots. Those scenes seemed unrealistic and annoying. Contrast this with Band of Brothers and you'll see what I mean. It's a serious film. Not a film that requires moments of dry humor. Spielberg dropped the ball on those aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Good film, but as a war film, not nearly as good as Band of Brothers, Platoon, or Black Hawk Down."

","I'm trying to respond to the German/foreign criticism some of which I share some of which I don't.<br/><br/>Prior to world war 2 the American army was the 35th largest in the world - the same size as the Portuguese army. So the American soldiers were civilians in uniform, a kind of partially trained militia. American foreign policy was based on an improvised garbled theory of collective security with the British empire (!?) and the Soviets (!?)<br/><br/>The German army was a professional force indoctrinated from a young age to become part of a military caste and to conform to a totalititarian ideology of revenge and conquest.<br/><br/>It is frankly easier to understand the psychological condition of the German soldier- he had been thoroughly trained to obey. <br/><br/>I don't think that the American soldiers died for the sake of France, I don't think that they died for sake of collective security, or capitalism (or keynesianism) or ""the flag."" I think they died the same way a firefighter will die evacuating an occupied building. No one has the right to attach an cock-eyed ideological significance to that."

","The film ""Saving Private Ryan"" almost immediately finds our main character-- not Private Ryan--but Captain John Miller, along with hundreds of soldiers, storming Omaha Beach in France on June 6, 1944. In the chaos of invading France, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned the task of locating paratrooper John Francis Ryan (Matt Daman) to return him home. We follow Captain Miller and his seven chosen comrades (Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, among others) through an impossible, and sometimes deadly, mission amidst constant battles, as they ask themselves: 'How many men should die to save one?' <br/><br/>Every soldier quickly learns when given an order, it is not yours to ask why. This film challenges that military decree from its early scenes of horrified boys facing the unknown in the storming of Omaha Beach to the late scenes of men facing death during this questionable mission. The film serves as a jolt, giving a visual to put with the loss of lives read about in history books. Saving Private Ryan also compares the loss of one mother to the sacrifice of eight others.<br/><br/>Occasional slow and lengthy dialogue, although used to introduce our characters personally, is the only downfall of this film. The effects in this movie are most notable. We are participants in the battles, as the camera jerks nervously, and bullets scream by our ears. Just as powerful is the painful mute silence coupled with the slow motion as we witness particularly excruciating scenes, as if we are falling unconscious. The symbol of a trembling hand stilled only by death, and the close up of a characters eyes as he ages or even changes into another character, give personality to lives lost, and lives saved. The repeated use of the 'death letter' we see removed from many dead soldiers' breast pockets are accompanied by a stories of who are to receive the letters and their significance to the soldier. All to remind us of the real casualties of war."

The violence is quite shocking, and it's not often you can say that given the exceptionally high level to which our depiction of and tolerance of violence has been pushed in recent years.<br/><br/>One thing that bothered me though was that the film-makers appeared to be unaware that quite a few non-Americans were involved in the D-Day push too.

There's been very little attention focused on the opening and ending sequences, where we see Ryan as an elder, complete with his family. <minor spoilers> We know from the opening that his coming back to Normandy is incredibly significant; it's in his walk and in his eyes... As he kneels down on the battlefield cemetery his mind is far, far away...After the tale is told, the ending is as touching as anything I've ever seen in the movies...We get the feeling his journey (here and in life) is now complete; he's paid homage to those who fought and died for him (and for all of us).  Very Simple.  You can talk all you want about the historical specifics and/or inaccuracies this film might or might not contain; to me they are irrelevant:  The bigger picture is not in dispute - WWII, the war in Europe, the fight against Hitler, the allied invasion of France, and D-Day were all defining moments of the 20th Century that brought out the worst (and best) mankind has ever had to offer. <br/><br/>
The main body of the film is incredible.  Difficult to watch and just as hard to look away from, the opening and ending battlefield sequences set new standards for action-cinematography.  To those who have criticized other portions of the film as boring, or over-the-top sentimentality, I think Spielberg's attempts to humanize his main characters are a great success; unlike BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story takes the time to let us get to know each soldier - I WANTED to know who they were and as each <spoiler> begins to get ""picked off"" as the story evolves, you feel yourself mourning the thousands of soldiers each represents.  <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is wonderful as the Captain in charge of saving Private Ryan...his performance is understated to perfection.  Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are all believable and finely cast in their respective roles...This film takes the time to flush out its characters.  In the end, when all decide that saving Private Ryan is the right thing to do and  <<spoiler>> most end up paying with their lives, I was struck with what a great sense of appreciation I felt for their accomplishment; with what it meant for Private Ryan, and again, what it meant for all of us.  <br/><br/>My father died in 1966 as a direct result of an injury he sustained in WWII (B-24 pilot who was shot down in 1943 over Germany, sustained severe head injury, lost 10 of his crew, was held as POW for almost a year before escaping, Silver Star recipient, died of brain hemorrhage 23 years later). I know this film would have made him proud."

"davesmooth","10","2","3","26 April 2004"," War Is Hell!!
","This movie is the best movie ever made depicting the World War II era. It is the most realistic, violent, true to life depiction of what WWII was really about. Most of the previous movies, romanticized the experience. This movie gives you gritty, no nonsense look at exactly what the troops faced, from their food, down to the vocabulary. You come to understand why most veterans from this war, never mentioned what they experienced. It's about as close as you can get to war without actually being in it. This movie does for WWII, what Platoon did for Vietnam. I still can't see why this movie didn't get Best Picture over ""Shakesphere In Love"". Spielberg did get Best Director, but the movie should have won as well. <br/><br/>This is a must see movie."
"compsecure","Null","2","3","23 April 2004"," An true epic in very sense.
","The opening & closing scenes were for me the hardest to sit through as they both convey such a powerful message that really the film is somewhat of an anticlimax. I had only stood overlooking Omaha beach where the opening scene was shot about 9 months before they commenced filming. When one looks over onto Omaha beach itself today there is really nothing to indicate the bloodshed that is so graphically portrayed in the film. It is the most peaceful & surreal place one can imagine & a fit resting place for the rows upon row of pure white headstones that adorn this immaculate cemetery. There are several other cemeteries in the area but this one is something special & the opening scene of the movie captures the solemnity & majesty of this monument perfectly. I just stood there among the graves in awe & admiration of the sacrifice made by these young soldiers who died in a foreign country among the depravity of war to ensure that we could live in relative peace. I can understand why so many veterans could not sit through the opening scene & never saw the movie so overcome were they. They would have had just as hard a job with the final scene had they stayed.I feel the film itself will stand as something of a monument to those who fought against the forces of evil & were prepared to die in the process.The sheer scale & logistics of the movie are mindboggling to say the least. Hanks was his brilliant self although I consider Sizemore nearly stole the show with a supporting performance par excellence. Not exactly Spielbergs masterpiece as I believe we will see more of this type of film from him but it will do for the moment thank you."
"inspt71-1","Null","2","3","17 April 2004"," Great War Scenes, Dull Story!
","*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>      Saving Private Ryan is a good war movie only to watch it's battle scenes. The story itself is rather dull the cast was great but one character wasn't to my liking. I didn't like the man that was carrying the ammo for the battle in the German town. He sat around crying and scared which is understandable for a<br/><br/>war because there are no men who will just stand up and shoot a bunch of guys and not be afraid of everything. I know in a war you're scared all the time or most of the time but this character just didn't seem to fit. His comerades were being slaughtered around him and he didn't do anything and that made me hate him. If you want a good story for D-Day, settle for 1962's ""The Longest Day."""

","I've seen many war movies after that of Saving Private Ryan. It has been 6 years since the movie has been released and I still have not found a movie that meets it's caliber.<br/><br/>The movie has a combination of good story, and a exceptional fighting scenes! Although some errors according to WWII might have been made, it is still far more accurate than any half-ass movies we've seen after it i.e. Windtalkers<br/><br/>Basically an amazing war movie which should be on everyone's Top 10 war movies list. I'm not exactly Spielberg's greatest fan, but after seeing this movie my respect for him has been increased greatly."
"DerBarenJude","10","2","3","14 April 2004"," Fraught with irony, tragedy, and Hanks
","Possible spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a movie about World War II.  In this it is not original.  Hundreds or perhaps thousands of films have been made about this subject.  What makes this film stand out besides the magnificent acting of Tom Hanks (possibly his best role, and that's saying a lot) is the film's plot.  A dozen men risk their life and put service to their country on hold in order to retreive a single officer.  Not one that is crucial to the war effort, indeed, not one that is even in enemy hands.  Just one that is the last surviving son of a mother that has lost all her children in the war. The irony and contradictions of a dozen men risking their lives to locate and retreive a single officer is almost paralyzing, and surely secures Speilberg's masterpiece a place, in my opinion, among the finest movies ever made.  Everything about this movie is spectacular, from the acting to the effects, to the dramatic qualities.  Possibly the finest of all the World War II films ever made."
"Fabrizio03","10","2","3","3 April 2004"," Extraordinary
","Saving Private Ryan is one of those films that keeps you speechless throughout the whole thing. By far, one of Steven Spieldberg's best films he has ever made. The realism of this film was superb and had exceptional acting. Tom Hanks gives, yet again, an exceptional performance. His nomination for Best Actor showed how good an actor he really is. The plot of the movie is perfect. The mission is to save a man. You are able to do so much with this kind of plot. The relationships between the soldiers becomes a key factor in this film. The triumph, the heartbreak, the relationships and the heroism is the glue that keeps the film interesting and moving. This is one of my favorite films of all time."
"MichaelOates","Null","2","3","14 March 2004"," Awesome film from start to finish
","Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" one of the best war films ever made. <br/><br/>Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers: Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James, who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once.<br/><br/>The opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience. I have seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" many times and I always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me. It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.<br/><br/>Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.<br/><br/>The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. He continues to produce box office hits along with Tom Hanks and the legendary director Steven Spielberg. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one film to watch over and over."
"agmoldham","7","2","3","14 March 2004"," Great opening
","This movie has a truly amazing opening 30 minutes. We follow Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his men during the d-day landing. A lot of the techniques used during this opening sequence have inspired many other directors since.<br/><br/>
The only trouble is the movie has a lot to live upto after the opening sequence. We get down to the main story which is Miller's orders to find Private Ryan and return him home to his mother who has lost all his brothers in the war. Whilst the remainder of the movie is ok and Spielberg shows us why he is a great director the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the opening. 8/10. (10/10 for first 30 minutes then 7/10 for the remainder)"
"jenmac_85","Null","2","3","7 March 2004"," Superb
","I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there.  Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma.  'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it  gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I dont think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.<br/><br/>An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done."

"rgp7777","Null","2","3","30 December 2003"," The actual ""opening scene"" and it's impact on me
","I am not really sure why I feel compelled to post my experience when watching this movie but after reading many of the previous comments it is apparent that the impact for me is quite different than most other people.<br/><br/>I went to our local theater to see Saving Private Ryan with my teenage son and one of his friends.  I was fully prepared for the realistic beach landing sequence that had already gained so much attention prior to the film's release so what happened next is a personal experience I will never forget. The actual ""opening scene"" is NOT the battle sequence but the images of the elderly Ryan and his family visiting the American cemetery at Normandy, France.  In the span of a few seconds,  I was transported back in time and place to a raw spring day in 1982 at the beaches of Normandy, France. It was there, with my late Father and Mother, that we walked the same path along the cliffs as shown in the film. My wife and children were with me (as in the film) when my Dad turned and walked out among the sea of crosses and was overcome with emotion (as in the film). The horrors of war were never more apparent to me in a personal way than at that moment.<br/><br/>It was as if Spielberg had been there 30 years ago and somehow filmed our family and then edited it onto the beginning of this movie.  I was so shaken that I barely remembered the rest of the movie and it was quite a while before I could get up and leave the theater. I am normally not prone to emotional outbursts and was embarrassed that I could not stop crying even as we left the lobby.  My reaction scared my son half out of his wits since he had no idea what had hit me so hard (he was only 2 years old in 1982).<br/><br/>I have only watch the film once since then and the impact was just as powerful. I have often wondered if anyone else relates to this scene as I do since every other reference to the opening scene is actually the beach landing.<br/><br/>For me, the cinematic faults or virtues of this movie are irrelevant in relation to the pain and sacrifice that this war inflicted on the world and I believe there is value in the way this film helps to assure that the pain will never be forgotten."

","Saving Private Ryan is a graphic and intense war movie that portrays some of the realities of war. I'm no WW2 veteran but I do know that this film is probably as close to war as we can really get without actually being there.

I know that some of you may not agree with me on this but for those who are on my side about this all know that this movie should be remembered by everyone that watches it. I highly suggest this movie to everyone who wants to know what it was really like for those men in WW2. In fact, I think that everybody should watch it. Whether they want to or not. It should be mandatory for people to watch this movie at least once in their lives just to remind them that freedom is not for free.

","I saw this movie is included in the Top 250 and to be quite honest, I just don't understand why. The most realistic warmovie ever made? Perhaps because of the special effects (those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying) but the sole reason why that is like that is just because ""Saving private Ryan"" is the kind of warmovie they don't make any longer, but believe me, if ""The longest day"" or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this Spielbergmovie. Surely not a bad movie at all, even worth your time (and even more than that) but Spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known, but then again every war is a tragedy (I see no difference in a soldier dying in France or somewhere in Palestina). Spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once. Good movie, even a bit more than that but just don't overrate it as well."
"jasonz42","9","2","3","31 October 2003"," The most realistic view of war yet
","Firstly, this film is not 'entertaining' in the way war films like Pearl Harbour tried to be. This film attempts to re-create war as realistically as possible, and, although I've never been in one myself, from what I hear it is the best representation yet. By definition this means you cannot 'enjoy' it like you would most films. The opening scene at the beach during D-day was harrowing rather than enjoyable to watch. You don't find yourself on the edge of your seat as bullets fly, you find yourself cringing and wondering why on Earth people get driven to this. After this scene the film becomes less miserable and slightly more watchable as an entertainment mechanism, but it never loses its realistic touch. Hanks delivers a memorable if not slightly flawed performance, whilst the script is interesting to listen to. In general, this is the first film I have come across that truly played on my emotions and affected me, which is what it's meant to do. It is a fantastic achievement in the sense that it finally begins to show people just how real the horrors of war are. If you're looking for a nice night in with an action film, don't watch this. If you want to see closer to the truth, and appreciate truly great filmwork, watch it."

Its message is so powerful all young folk should see it to understand how 'lucky' we the 'Allies' were to finally beat the Germans - we, the citizen soldiers so well shown, up against the terrifying enemy, who literally fought to the bitter end. The 'cost' is seen in the cemeteries in Europe & Asia; for me the US 8th AF near Cambridge, England; Normandy, France; and Rangoon, Burma are like this film, important and necessary reminders of how much I owe to so many to enjoy life here in the United States."

"Jeremy Bristol","7","2","3","19 June 2001"," Pretty good, but has some definite flaws. Spoilers.
","First of all, the framing device for the movie is not just sappy but downright manipulative and quite frankly impossible.  Anytime you frame a flashback like that, you have to stay (mostly) within that characters frame of reference (I can't think of a single example that stays 100% in first person--it's just not possible or practical).  How can Ryan look back in time on someone else's life, while he's somewhere else?  I certainly doubt that Hanks could have told him his life story so quickly.  Spielberg's no idiot, so he knows that this isn't possible, which brings us back to the manipulation factor and the chance to have a ""surprise ending"" in the worst possible sense.  I'd like to think Spielberg was trying to emulate the experience of war (and not knowing who's going to live or who's going to die) by making the old cliches of war movies (that the hero will live) work for him.  Because Spielberg makes us believe that Hanks' character isn't going to die (we think he's the old man), then supposedly we'll be more shocked and have more emotions when he is killed, as if we were experiencing war in real-time. For me this didn't work, because by Bull-S*** alarm started blaring.  It has a high intolerance for lies, and that is pretty much what the framing device does.  It promises one thing, but gives just the opposite.<br/><br/>If Spielberg had not included the framing device, I would have given the movie a 9/10 instead of 7/10.  Why he felt he needed one, I don't know, since, even beyond my other complaints, the framing device doesn't add anything to the movie that couldn't have been done (and better) while we were still in 1945.<br/><br/>By the way, did they bury all of our dead in France in that graveyard?  I thought that one was for those who died on the beach that first day (but I'm not sure).  Hanks was pretty far in by the time he died.<br/><br/>One final point: the ""evil"", backstabbing German captive thing worked all right as propaganda (and even better as a lesson in mob violence) back when Hitchcock directed his extraordinary Lifeboat in 1944(?), but when stolen and put in Private Ryan, it just seemed like a plot device--he would just as likely have been grateful for being spared.  Or, as a hypothetical situation in which Germany invaded America, it is just as likely that an American would do exactly the same thing as the German.  At least in Lifeboat, the issue is thoroughly explored, while Private Ryan uses it merely to show how the weak-willed, peace-loving, prototype-hippie linguist learns that killing people in war is necessary.  Whatever happened to the less pro-active attitude from Catch-22?"

"davidmvining","10","1","1","17 January 2020"," Much more than its opening sequence
","Steven Spielberg is the most effortlessly inventive technical director alive. He's placed shots in this film that move effortlessly from one subject to another, all the while each moment provides a new piece to the story. His inventiveness isn't showy or extraneous, but subtle and key to moving the story forward. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg uses his extreme technical proficiency to tell a very engaging story about the nature of war.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of D-Day is the obvious standout in the film. As a dramatization of the landing in Normandy, it's terrifying in effect as it gives us perspective from the beginning of the action to its relative conclusion through Captain Miller. The physical reality of the movement from the landing craft to hiding behind the metal barriers to the beachhead up to the towers. Men get blown apart, and yet the mission has to continue. By the time a soldier deflects one bullet off his helmet miraculously and shot gets shot in the same spot again, but without his helmet, there's a certain desensitizing influence happening to the audience, and that is reflected in how Captain Miller just shrugs off that, and other, moments of extreme violence. There's no time to mourn the dead. There's a mission to accomplish and a beach to take.<br/><br/>That effect is at the heart of the film, especially when Miller is given PR mission of marching dozens of miles into the fighting of France to find a single soldier who's lost all three of his brothers to the fighting. He doesn't understand why he should risk his own life and the lives of his men to save one. Their thoughts have turned inward, towards their own self-preservation, having lost sight of the war at large and the other men in uniform around them. This comes to its ironic height when Miller and his men find a downed plane and root through the dog tags of dead soldiers. It's a game to them, and it takes the outsider of their group, Upham, to reorient them real quick with a bit of shaming.<br/><br/>Losing two of their number does not help Miller's troops in believing in the mission. Why should they have lost two guys to help the one? Ryan, though, hasn't lost sight of why he's there, and he refuses to go back home. He doesn't talk about the overall war, though. He talks about his fellow men and the bridge they've held for days. Even Miller has talked about how his primary goal in this war was to find a way to go home, and suddenly this kid he's supposed to escort away from danger and to his mother in Iowa is refusing to take even the first step back. He knows his place, and he's going to stay.<br/><br/>That dedication reinvigorates Miller and his men, refocusing them. Gone is the antagonism towards Ryan. He couldn't help that his three brothers all died and that the military leadership wanted to help his mother over theirs by getting him home, but they can respect his insistence on staying and fighting.<br/><br/>On top of all that, what sets this movie apart from most men on a mission stories is two things. The first is the small character moments. In a movie that has two fantastically large action sequences (D-Day and the Battle at Ramelle), its best moments are very small. The scene in the church at night, as the men talk to each other, each dealing with the loss of one of their men in different ways, is a marvelous look into the minds of men caught in the middle of Hell (my favorite being Wade's story about how he tried to stay awake for his mother), but there's also Ryan's story of home. He talks about how he can't remember the faces of his deceased brothers and moves to talking about the last time all four were together. It's happily nostalgic of what he's lost that ends on a melancholy note. It's a very nice way to really let us get to know this almost MacGuffin that we've heard about for nearly the whole movie.<br/><br/>The second thing that sets it apart is the aforementioned technical acumen of Steven Spielberg. There's a shot late in the film that has stuck with me. It's not a dramatic shot in any way shape or form, but the way it evolves transfixed me from the moment I noticed it. We start with the shot of an M1-Garand clip that gets locked into the rifle. The camera pulls back slightly to look at the stern face of the soldier performing the action, and then it focuses out of the building to Upham who's running across the bridge out in front to hide in a crater. It's a shot that lasts about 5 seconds, but it's complex in a subtle way. It's all about showing different parts of the preparation for the upcoming fight, showing us tiny details that add up to a whole. It's also an almost throwaway moment that shows so much forethought and pitch perfect execution.<br/><br/>The movie is a technical marvel matched with great performances and an interesting story about the numbing effects of war. It's a men on a mission story that rises above its genre to become truly affecting for the lost men. It is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest films."

The script is good, full of action scenes and will surely delight the lovers of war movies and WWII movies. Personally, I highlight the opening scenes, in which ""D-Day"" was recreated in all its raw glory, and the final part, where it all comes together in an almost perfect climax of action.<br/><br/>The director's chair was taken by iconic Steven Spielberg, who is spotless once again. He is one of those directors who no longer has to prove anything. More than established, he was already one of the best directors of our time when he directed this movie. Even so, he did not cease to strive and to provide us with careful, attentive and thoughtful direction. At his side, in the starring role, Tom Hanks in one of the films that marked his career. Hanks is a renowned actor. Attentive to detail and emotional when it has to be, she shone once more, earning another Oscar nomination for Best Actor (though attributed to the equally remarkable Roberto Benigni, in one of the most hilarious and emotional moments the Academy ceremony has ever seen. in many decades). The supporting cast is equally good, containing names like Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, etc. Actors who, as we can see, are established and generally have solid careers today.<br/><br/>The film shone equally on the technical details. It's a Spielberg movie, and we couldn't expect anything else. Let's look at the careful way in which the historical details were mostly recreated. The uniforms, military equipment, combat tactics were all carefully studied, and despite some flaws (such as the predominance of the Americans and the absence of other allies in the theater of war), all went well. I especially liked that they used the German language for the German soldiers. I also highlight the excellent photography, with breathtaking scenes and original camera angles (one moment we are looking through a sniper sight, and the next moment a bullet crosses that same sight towards us, to name but a few). an example), as well as the sound effects, with all those absolutely realistic bullet sounds and shots. The characterization, the special effects, the soundtrack ... all meticulously well done.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked this movie a lot. It's one of those movies that I like to see again after a few years, but which has disappeared without a trace of the television circuit, perhaps because of its length and the fact that it is no longer a new movie. It also has some minor flaws, such as some concessions to sentimental lamechas and scenes of strong emotional appeal, but I confess that I handled it very well. The scene that seemed to me the most out of context was, in fact, a passage involving a French family with their young children. Another problem with this movie is that, with the exception of the character of Hanks, most of the characters have been underdeveloped and the actors have little to work with, just playing wars.<br/><br/>This movie has garnered several awards. Of all, I highlight his good performance at this year's Oscars, with five statuettes collected in the technical categories (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Edition, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects). He also won the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Film."

","Saving private ryan.
We have looked into the lesson saving private ryan here is our review.
Direction: the direction was well done because, some scenes were also running and you also saw the action that occurs sometimes they had also filmed it underwater to really show the action that happened<br/><br/>Script: the script was very realistic because some characters spoke different languages, for example when Germans wanted to surrender, they didn't speak German but a different language.
The people who were in the war themselves had said in advance how it had gone and afterwards also looked and approved.<br/><br/>Editing: the editing was very aggressive, they started filming death by scene, making it appear that it is very aggressive and the organs from the body and medical help also came to help and the body parts were also taken off and that very quickly<br/><br/>Suit design: the suit design was very clear they were wearing a helmet to protect their head and you saw a scene when a person took off his helmet and was immediately shot at his head. you saw that it clearly looked real army clothing and not bad.<br/><br/>Set design: the start was very realistic they sail to a beach where the Germans were with a base and they had blockages for the boats so that the opponent had to swim to the other side, everything looked very realistic.<br/><br/>background music: sometimes no music so it still seemed serious.
and when it was music, it was the right music, for example the horns in the background it was emotional."

","Saving Private Ryan is an impressive war movie that does a great job at portraying the bitter sweet line of events in WorldWar2. Not just because of the story itself but also on behave of the director. They did a great job at using the music, colour, camera angels and motions to portray the complex emotions and chaos. In this story it comes forward that war isn't a heroic thing to enjoy and laugh about. It effects everyone in another way. You can see that in the characters they brought forward in this story, you see that there's no such thing as evil and good, it's only chaos. The story focuses on how people react and act in war without leaving important details about the it. The movie keeps it personal. They did an absolutely great job at showing ( and not telling ) the story in realistically feeling way. Despite the durance of the movie it didn't feel like to much information or time. It keeps you interested and intrigued. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who can handle the emotional extremes of the story."
"abelmondeel","8","1","1","26 November 2019"," review for school
","I watched a movie at school called: ''saving private Ryan''. I really liked the direction of the film because of the way it is filmed, it really looks like you're there. By constantly changing the perspective during the fight and at the beginning it looks like it really happens. The way they filmed shows how life was at the time when it took place. The use of background music in certain scenes made it more exciting and attractive to watch. For example, in the scene where they walk through a field and a tank is coming, the music makes it more exciting.
The editing of the film was very good, the light and the images were very good. Because everything was well exposed and you could see everything well. So the images also got better and you could therefore enjoy the film more. Occasionally it suddenly went to a completely different scene. That was sometimes very confusing.
The costumes she used were copied very well. Because you immediately saw that they were militant. You also saw that there was a difference between the Americans and the Germans, for example the Germans had less weight and their clothing was a different color. The weapons also looked very real.
I liked the way they made the corpses very well, because they really seemed just real or for example there was a shot where a man lay with his guts out. And the shots where there were people with gunshot wounds or parts were out of arm.<br/><br/>I will definitely recommend this film because it is worth watching, if you like war movies. You must be able to withstand blood."

","This week, I've seen Saving Private Ryan in class. This film amazes me, like, a lot. Everything I've seen in this film, matches my own image about the Second World War. Everything that had happened in the movie, could have happened during the Second World War itself. When I currently think about the Second World War, after seeing the film, I just think about the beach-rush scene. Everything was filmed in a way like somebody was there, filming it all. Every sound you hear, every word that the soldiers say, could have been said in 1944 as well. Corporal Upham is my favourite character of the film, just because he's different than the other soldiers. He shows that he doesn't like the war, doesn't want to fight, and wants to forget it all. All of the deeds and actions shown in the film represent what could have happened in the war. I really felt like taking actions during the film, just because most of the things that happen in the movie, don't really happen anymore. This film is absolutely stunning."

"mitsubishizero","10","1","1","16 May 2019"," One of the greatest war movies ever made
","Considering i'm interested in ww2 I really liked this movie. It's pretty accurate as war movies go. The actors do really well playing the soldiers ordered to bring back Private James Ryan after learning that his brothers were killed in action. Leading them is the experienced Captain Miller(Tom Hanks). What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said? Many of the actors are now A-list stars. Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Matt Damon(who already was well known from Good Will Hunting).<br/><br/>The usage of handheld cameras and desaturated colors give the movie this rough feel and the silent moments help convey the unstable atmosphere that the main characters have to endure. Slowly and slowly they get picked off by the Germans one by one and even though you may not know them you still feel for them and all the hell they go through. It even gets to a point where they begin to question their mission and one even thinks about deserting his squad. I like how it shows war for what it really is rather than glorifies it like most war movies.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well done. It feels like you're really there alongside the soldiers. It's fast but never to the point where it gets confusing. I don't have much else to say other than this's a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone(unless they have PTSD). Really it was so intense that WW2 veterans left the theater during the depiction of the Omaha invasion and visits to PTSD counselors increased as well as a hotline was set up leading to 170 calls after the movie was released.<br/><br/>There has been criticism of it's accuracy and depiction of Americans fighting in the war but honestly I think it was well done. Spielberg and his team did their research on the matter and it really shows. The uniforms and equipment are fairly accurate. There's not much to say about this movie other than it's really great. If you get the chance check it out."

","I've seen this movie, probably, a half dozen times or so. I'm a fan of the HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" which Tom Hanks and Spielberg were both Producers on, so, already knowing the story and setting fairly well, I figured I would put this on and get some emails done, balance my accounts, and maybe do some drawing.<br/><br/>That did not happen. Even the opening sequence which takes place in modern day as an old man walks through fields of graves, marked with white crosses and stars of David, drew me in, and before I knew it we were halfway up the beach, the French countryside, and eventually defending the bridge.<br/><br/>Try as I did to get other things done, there is something about the way Spielberg directs that captures the attention and eye of the viewer.<br/><br/>I love a good WW2 movie, but when Spielberg makes one, it makes every other one I've seen feel like a staged reenactment or kids playing war in the back lot of the neighborhood."
"t-27254-13701","Null","1","1","18 January 2019"," Saving Private Ryan: A sheer, hard truth about war
","War is nothing of glory, prominence, or resolve. War is that of complete bloodshed and a reason that drives the motive to kill fellow man. War does not tell lies, nor do the bodies, wounds, and scars of the living and dead in a conflict between nations can hide from the truth. These same truths are what lead me to watch Saving Private Ryan, and how incredibly accurate the film depicts the monstrous and horrific nature of warfare. In the film, Saving Private Ryan, I will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that built up a character's development during this conflict in this amazingly heroic, action-packed, heartbreaking masterpiece of a film.<br/><br/>War is man's worst nightmare, bringing horrible and disastrous acts of violence and mishap. However, one man, Steven Spielberg, delivers us one of the most convincing and realistic depictions ever in this insanely powerful and depressing film; ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>This courageous World War II film dives down deep and explores the struggle to keep the common soldier's sanity and humanity in the dead center of utmost hell. Showing the audience that Spielberg was very much on top of his game, as it truly conveys the sickening and heart-destroying emotions and feelings towards the audience, leaving them crying, shaking in their seats, or in an upward fetal position. And if this doesn't make you want to watch this film, I don't know what will. ""Sure."" You might say. ""But we've got really good films like Black Hawk Down and American Sniper."" But let me ask you this; ""did any of those movies cover the small details? Did they use specific scenes to visualize a character's development and emotions? And did they actually show gore and the true brutality that occurs in an actual war, in the film?"" To me, most other films seem to try to glorify and sugar coat over the truth, which is why I consider Steven Spielberg's work of art to be ""advanced"" for its time. A ""true"" war story never lies and it never should, which is why I recommend this film to you, even if it's genre isn't up your alley, you will find this movie to be absolutely groundbreaking and extraordinary. That I promise.<br/><br/>Shortly after a brief scene with an elderly man at a WWII memorial site, we fade out into the perspective of Tom Hanks (Cpt. Miller) as it throws the audience right in the midst of the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach. Joining Miller on this slaughterhouse of a mission is a squad of loyal but mixed characters. There's Miller's shadow, Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cocky but confidential commoner from Brooklyn, New York, Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns), the upstanding Italian, Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel), the tough, role model, Jewish kid, Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the worrisome and sympathetic medic, T/4 medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), the Bible-quoting marksman, Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and the scared-as-hell interpreter, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis). As the ramp goes down, the crew is met with a hellstorm of gunfire. Different angle and panning shots shows U.S. soldiers getting cut down as bullets rip and tear through flesh and uniform, not even those who jumped over the side were safe, as it seen showing people drowning from the overhaul of gear that they were carrying. Even as the cast makes it to the coast, the camera continues to focus on the surroundings and the other grunts screaming, guts, blown off arms and legs, and even a caved-in face. Even though it takes up a good portion of the film, the scene does a phenomenal job at grasping the situation through Hank's perspective, as it doesn't try to hide anything from what the landings at Omaha were actually like, presenting us with realism like no other.<br/><br/>On top of that, Steven Spielberg did an amazing job driving deep into character development, as I found that the most interesting parts of how the film and cast were presented and orchestrated, was the surreal fear and sadness that main cast acted out, including Cpt. Miller with his shaking hand, indicating towards the audience that he was just as human as the rest of his squad. Lighting also had a impact with depicting the character's fears, as one shot only shows Tom Hanks' face as the rest of his head and body is consumed by darkness, possibly to convey the theme of loss, as seen all throughout the rest of the movie. Other scenes include breaking down from the loss of characters, and the more human scenes and interactions of characters during the film makes it very irresistible to not want to smile.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film very much considering that I had never really seen such a vast difference in how war stories are told or how they play out, much like from video games and books. In my mind, I believe that this film takes the cake for its realism and atmosphere, amassing the audience towards a traumatizing but fateful story of heroes, not only laying down their lives for the sake of their country and its people, but revealing and teaching a lesson in it as well; that war does not lie, not until we as people find common ground, will the scars and wounds ever heal from our actions. In the film, Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg, I will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that relayed a character's development and emotions during this haunting conflict in this amazingly heroic, action-packed, heartbreaking masterpiece of a film."

"carolynvargas","9","1","1","6 December 2018"," The master creates magic- One of the greatest WW2 films ever.
","Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics but Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. The action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening Omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking. This film is simply unmissable."

"rkempf-15550","10","1","1","18 September 2018"," One of the most beautifully crafted and scripted war movies to date
","One of the hardest tasks in life is dealing with the death of someone close. For some, even losing just one loved one could be impossible to handle. Unfortunately, WWII propelled very young men directly into the heart of stressful and gruesome violence, defining the survivors as some of the most emotionally hardened people to walk this earth. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan delves directly into the story of a young man, Private Ryan, who because of the rules regarding death of family members in war, needs to be found and taken out of combat. Opening with an older Ryan, as he grieves the loss of a fellow soldier, instantly defining strong emotion and foreshadowing the tone of the movie. The scene quickly changes, however, throwing the viewer directly into heart-pounding action as an extremely historic and defining battle takes place, D-Day. Stress, anxiety and extreme suspense come over the viewer as bullets, explosions, and life-threatening events overcome Ryan. The movie is no stranger to strong emotion, as it quickly shows death, destruction, and gripping violence that is familiar with the soldiers on the field. The main character, Ryan, is not portrayed to be some valiant war hero either, but rather more vulnerable, and life-like. Ryan is a character people can relate to, feel for, and become much more connected to, making it much easier for the emotions to be shared between him and the viewer.<br/><br/>Throughout Saving Private Ryan, an overall sense of urgency and looming danger is felt. Whether it be directly in the middle of heart-pounding action and excitement, defined by loud explosions, blood-curdling screams, and sounds of bullets whizzing by. Or where suspense is heavy, in the most quiet of times, where silence seems all too bliss. Visual demonstrations of intense action and perfect recreations of life-like scenes help the viewer become immersed in what is happening, almost smelling the fires burning and the gasoline filling the air. <br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job at creating realistic and accurate scenes. Since the movie is based on a historic event, it's crucial that everything that happens needs to replicate the time that it was set in perfectly, or massive reductions in the immersive nature of the movie would be felt, and many parts would feel dull and unrealistic. However, the attention to detail is shown, as everything from the vehicles, to the technology, even down to the way people talk, using slang terms and real conversations that people in the 1940's might have, is spot on. Saving Private Ryan is an amazing, immersive and jaw-dropping movie that easily has the potential to be regarded as one of the greats for years to come."

","Just reading the public comments on Saving Private Ryan on this sight made tears come to my eyes. This movie captured my respect as a history lover in that it gave you just what is to be expected during an amphibious landing in WWII. Saving Private Ryan held no punches on war being ugly, sicking and horrific. The only thing that was missing was the smell of battle. The audio visual aspect was, it seems to me, beyond perfect that I was really there on D-Day extremely scared while trying to get off the beach. I recommend this movie to be seen by every U.S. president, senator, representative before taking office. I was told that this war epic was so influential it made potential cadets who viewed it, turn down their West Point appointments. Even thinking about this production will cause emotions to get the best of me."
"Cutter-2","Null","1","1","17 November 2003"," Think What You May But Please Don't Miss THE Message
","It really does not matter what one thinks of this film as long as they catch the underlying message. Anyone who has been involved in combat or survived a catastrophe can relate to it. Having no psychological training, I refer to it as the 'Why Me' syndrome. The first and last 5 minutes along with one line towards the end of the movie depict the message's fullest impact on a person relate to it. Having been in NYC when the World Trade Center was hit, I do not doubt many who survived that catastrophe have similar feelings. What is it? It is the guilt, the sense of embarrassment, the confusion, the internal turmoil and the many unanswered questions associated with surviving such an event when so many you consider better or more deserving than you did not. Private Ryan in his later years experiences this in its fullest during the first and last five minutes of the movie. Tom Hanks dying words 'Earn this.' were said for those who never experienced such events. Those who have do not have to be reminded. There are a great many other messages that the uninitiated could pick up.<br/><br/>If you ever wondered why your father, grandfather husband or more recently wife are the way they are or 'changed' after such an experience this is most likely why. When the World War II vets came home they were heroes. When the Korean War vets came home they came home. When the Vietnam vets came homeÂ… However, although how they were treated after they came home had an impact on their psyche, what they experienced while they were 'there' left an indelible mark they will never be able to erase. These experiences come to mind while daydreaming, they hit you like a punch when they pop into your mind when concentrating on something totally unrelated and regardless of how long ago it happened one can not control their dreams. All I ask is that regardless of what you think of our involvement in Iraq, those who were there did not make our foreign policy. Believe me, if they had their choice virtually all of them would have rather been somewhere else. Just try to remember what they have been through and that they will relive those experiences for the rest of their lives."

","Take a blockbuster and quality movies director such as Steven Spielberg, a good leading actor like Tom Hanks and a decent cast (Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns are my choices) and you'll get the best movie ever. Or you should at least. Steve got this one wrong in my opinion. Starting and ending the movie with a US flag isn't the way of making a movie hat will be shown throughout the world. <br/><br/>The allied assault on Normandy was amazing and close to reality (I believe), making it the most remembered scene in the movie (and best).<br/><br/>But then the plot sinks in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Yes, sending 8 soldiers to rescue 1 just because his brothers are dead does seem unlikely and I wouldn't risk the lives of a capable platoon for only one soul.<br/><br/>
And making that chickenheart corporal Upham's mind change fast enough to make him shoot an unarmed man at point blank does nothing good to this movie.<br/><br/>Overrated; The Thin Red Line and Black Hawk Down are much better.

","It seems that those that are critical of SPR, they are all hypercritical for their own personal reasons.  Let's back up and look at this movie as a film- because that's all that it is, a film.  For those of you that see a representation of the Americans as the good ol' boys and the Germans as the bad guys, let's remember the scenes where the Germans were brutally shot at point blank range with their hands in the air to surrender.  Anyone who misses the point that the Germans were just as human as the Americans were, misses the point all together as I see it.<br/><br/>I don't see where Spielberg makes them look any better or worse than we or any other soldier was in the war.<br/><br/>As far as steering from the truth, anyone that has followed ANY historical movie knows that there are certain artistic licenses taken to embellish the depiction.  If historic films were depicted one hundred percent as they actually happened they would ALL fall under the documentary category.  This is NOT a documentary and shouldn't be judged as such.<br/><br/>I purposely don't/haven't watched war films because I abhor violence and the use of violence as an ends to ANY means.  However I saw this film because I had heard that it is one of the best representations of what happened on Omaha Beach and the tragedies of war.  Never had I been so moved and truly felt how horrible it must have been to be there  or in any war.<br/><br/>It is a film, and just that, a film.  An interpretation by Spielberg of what happened.  Be critical of what the film meant to you and how you feel, not of what was in the film."
"PureCinema","8","1","1","26 December 1998"," One of the best films of the year
","The opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are some of the most brutal images put on screen. I don't care what you've seen before, this is absolutely shocking. There were times when it was difficult to watch these events flash in front of my eyes. War is not pretty, and Speilberg shows you this in a way that will grab you, a man holding his intestines is crying for his mother, another man who loses an arm confusingly tries to pick it up with his other hand. You know that this is not gonna be a pretty ride.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is Speilberg's follow up to last year's highly underrated film, Amistad. Tom Hanks is Captain Miller, who gets word of Private Ryan (Matt Damon), who lost all of his brothers in the war (he still doesn't know it yet), Private Ryan is therefore granted a safe trip back home, and it's up to Captain Miller and seven others to make sure that he makes his return home as soon as possible. The only problem is that they don't know exactly where he is, just somewhere behind enemy lines. The eight begin their journey and on their way each of their characters are revealed, we find out that Captain Miller, as tough as he is, wants nothing more than to get out of the violence and tragedy that he has to deal with everyday. He just wants to return home, as does almost everybody else.<br/><br/>Speilberg is in top form again, and although it's not as perfect as his masterpiece, Schindler's List, it does rank as the best film of 1998 (so far). The performances are top-notch and incredibly real, especially Tom Hanks' character.<br/><br/>So what can you say? Speilberg has done it again. Never before has war been shown so realistically before. If there is one film that can show the atrocities that soldiers had to go through every day, SPR is the one. Is it the best war film ever made?... I don't think so. But is it a damn good one?... definitely"
"Pieces","Null","1","1","14 September 1998"," Think about the meaning of the second scene
","I went into Saving Private Ryan with high hopes.  As someone who has followed Spielberg's career since Jaws, I knew I would be put through the gamut of emotional responses during the movie.<br/><br/>What I wasn't prepared for was the second scene.  I sat quietly through the recreation of the landing at Normandy, through the endless body parts being pitched into the air.  I was horrified at the sight of the armless soldier searching for his severed limb, the men trying to get out of the water before they drowned only to be cut down by bullets before they could.  I felt the tears well up in my eyes at the sights of these brave men, some of whom could have been my older uncles (my family fought there), giving their lives so that all of us could be free.<br/><br/>Watching the screen fade from the shot of the dead soldier, sorrounded by dead fish in a red-hued sea change to the office of the war department.  Dozens of women typing letters to the families of those lost on the battlefield.  The tears didn't stop, they came on full force.  Luckily, my family was spared the horror of one of those letters, the visits by high -ranking men in uniforms coming to tell mothers and wives that their men wouldn't be coming back.  But, I felt for them.  All the battles, all the training, all the pride of having a family member fighting to keep the world free of evil meant nothing more than a letter home typed by a faceless secretary and passed along for signing.  Not that I'm putting down what these women did for the war effort.  They had their jobs to do as well.  It just touched me to no end to see this.  One minute a soldier is a brave man, fighting for his country and freedom, the next he is nothing more than a letter and a folded flag.<br/><br/>I hope everybody, who sees this film, doubles their efforts in  making sure we as a species NEVER have to do that again.  Show this to future generations, along with Schindler's List, make them aware that the war did happen, that this kind of evil is possible.  We have had too many Rambos.  It's time we looked at the war the way it was; brutal, cruel and took the lives of too many men before they had the chance to live their lives.<br/><br/>My hat is off to Mr. Spielberg once again.  Don't let us forget."

","I don't like war films. Definitely. But I definitely think ""Saving Private Ryan"" cannot be considered only like a war movie. I mean, films like ""Rambo"", ""Commando"" and that kind of productions have one point in common: the main character is a hero, ""the strongest man on Earth"", ""the renegade who's escaped from the bad fellas"" and ""the only one who can achieve this mission"".<br/><br/>In ""Saving Private Ryan"", the war vision goes one step... Not one, a bunch of steps far from the typical war film. It's not about the typical story of a ""how-strong-and-brave-I-am"" mercenary. The plot introduces us in the feelings, the experiences that a soldier has in a battle field: fear, agony & pain. And this message reached deeply in the audience, because you feel somehow uncomfortable when watching the film. And there's the power of the film, the way with which focuses the sensations and fearings of the character is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has done a masterpiece, demonstrating that he can do any kind of genre in the film industry.

"hptmbedra","1","6","15","1 February 2014"," One of the worst war movies ever
","Nobody who has studied WW2 just for a while and knows some basic facts about it can not like this film. The plot doesn't make any sense. Sacrifice the whole ""rescue"" unit for sake of one's paratrooper's life? Seriously? Stop pretending to be noble here and answer a simple question: ""Is a search for one man (not rescue exactly) worth risking lives of a whole squad?"" Furthermore, how can someone expect of a small unit, which consists of bunch of infantrymen, to find one man in such a vast area? There was a big mess after attack of allied paras. They were spread all over the place with heavy loses. Some reviewer wrote here the idea to call 101st on radio to pull Ryan back. I think that would be the best thing to do.<br/><br/>This movie is unbelievably insulting. The Germans are portrayed way too cartoonish like blood-thirsty animals (Americans are the good guys of course) and completely inept enemy at the same time, which of course wasn't true in most cases. The Germans were a tough enemy in spite of the fact that most of their soldiers were not equipped and trained well as in the earlier years. What all of you people who think the portrayal of Germans in this movie is realistic is the reason the war lasted so long?! Just bad luck and weather? No way. Some reviewers wrote that there is nothing stupid about Germans here because they made mistakes like slow reaction to the D-day or wrong estimation of the invasion's spot. That is true but it has nothing to do with quality of individual soldiers. That is not a justification for showing elite units including SS panzer gruppen as complete idiots!<br/><br/>The American saviors were just refusing to die each time a shootout emerged. Yes, they were killed finally but should be dead much earlier. You are supposed to sympathize with our bunch of American action characters but I just hated everyone of them. Spielberg wants us to think that they are battle hardened soldiers, but I had the feeling they are just kids playing some war game (except for the interpreter, who was totally unnecessary character btw., acting annoyingly cowardly for no reason in the whole movie). I was bored for most of the time after the first sequence. The way the unit moves behind enemy lines looks like a walk in Central Park. One German with machine gun in the right position could easily wipe out at least half of the unit because they didn't keep any type of formation which should have prevent this.<br/><br/>The final scene is so incredibly stupid that I doubt about common sense of those who spoke well about this one. You see German attackers running back and forth without covering fire or support in front of American barrels! Germans even don't try to find any kind of cover!! They even hardly return any fire!!! It's like shooting range for American soldiers or some kind of PC game. Looks like every dead American takes at least 100 Germans to hell with him. Kids, if you like this sequence, I have bad news for you. The war doesn't look like this. You hardly see anything more than enemy soldier's head and his gun when combat occurs and of course the kills are not so easy to get. On the other hand the Americans also run uncovered many times but with some ability to dodge bullets or something like that. That is the only explanation of my own for their immortality. In reality they would have been killed instantly if they would behave in such way as shown in this sequence, for example running in front of PzKpfw tiger which has manually operated machine gun at the front. The rules which apply to Germans somehow don't apply to Americans. <br/><br/>The tactics performed by both allies and axis here is laughable. Germans wouldn't enter a town with tanks ahead and infantry behind them because the tanks are vulnerable in urban areas. Their strength is placed in the open. The attack on the radar station is weird as well. The defenders were surely part of a bigger group. It is obvious that after killing the defenders the Americans should retire using ""Hit and run"" tactics because other Germans could enter a fight. Instead of it, they argue on the very spot they've just captured about a sense of their mission like there is nothing to worry about (it would have been clear to an orangutan from a very beginning that this mission sucks). Just stupid. <br/><br/>I could go on like this and mention for example shooting 7 shots from 5 round rifle without reloading and so on but I will skip it. You cannot let this so called war movie treat with history like this. Call it action B movie and I'm gonna take it. Never watch this crap if you like history and portrayal of it in the way it actually happened."

How could the Germans invade almost half of Europe if they are so lousy fighters? Visually the movie is great but the story is unbelievable and the whole movie is way too patriotic.

","Although unintentionally, this movie is creating a new envelope for violent movies to push.  The next movie that is made along the lines of Starship Troopers, which was only a notch behind in my view, will certainly rival Saving Private Ryan. In fact, I didn't find much difference between the two movies, save for how utterly pretentious Saving Private Ryan was.  An all star cast that went completely unused throughout the entire movie. People often say that this is a movie with a message, a message of the utter horror of war.  However, I personally prefer the delivery in such movies as All's Quiet on the Western Front, which relies on acting rather than a multi million dollar budget (was it that low?) used to create a gore fest. Frankly, I believe that most people won't get the message, and a lot of people will treat it as an action movie, say, ""Hey cool, that guy's got no arm!"", instead of being sick to their stomach, like they should be. I faced the same thing with Starship Troopers; the violence in the movie made me sick, but for most people, it was a joyride. Well, y'all had better get used to it, because thanks to this movie, there will be plenty more along those lines."

"Michael-70","2","4","9","27 November 2005"," Don't be afraid to criticize this film! You can still be patriotic and not like it.
","Spielberg has claimed in interviews that one of his purposes in making Saving Private Ryan was to specifically honor the soldiers who fought that war; a noble sentiment. But being a film buff, you'd think Spielberg would be familiar with the constant stream of films from the 40's through the 50's into the 60's and beyond including TV shows that did just that. It makes me wonder if he had another purpose in making Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>He does. In the excellent series of interview DVD's put out by the American Film Institute titled The Directors, in the episode devoted to Spielberg he claims that he wanted to make Saving Private Ryan with a documentary style eschewing the Chapman Cranes and Steadicam approach to big budget film-making. He wanted the film to look exactly like a war photographer would have shot it had he been at Omaha Beach.<br/><br/>Clearly, one look at the opening beach sequence shows he succeeded in that desire. But if Chapman cranes and Steadicams are not realistic, is artificially slowing down the film OK? How about de-saturating the color out of the film to make it almost seem black and white? What about heavily manipulating the soundtrack? Does war really exist in Dolby 5.1 Sound? I mean, what are we REALLY watching here? What has Spielberg done with Saving Private Ryan other than simply add an element of ""Chainsaw Massacre Movie"" gore to the war film, a genre that is surprisingly non-gory. But the thing that annoys me most about Saving Private Ryan is something that is no real fault of the film. It's the way so many people fatuously praise the film as being ""realistic"". A bunch of different critics even stated that this film ""avoids all the clichés"" usually associated with WWII films.<br/><br/>Avoids clichés? Have any of you seen it? Well, lets just start with the squad who goes after Private Ryan in the film, do we have the tough, but decent guy from the Midwest? Check, Tom Hanks! Do we have a vaguely ethnic type? Check, Vin Diesel as Caparzo. How about the young coward who later on shows courage? Check with Jeremy Davies character. What about the wise guy from New York? Check with Ed Burns. Did we forget the country boy sharpshooter? No, we have Barry Pepper as a cross kissing sniper. You may just as well have cast Anthony Quinn, Wally Cassel, William Bendix, Lloyd Nolan and Richard Jaeckel. Certainly, John Wayne would have been perfect for the Tom Hanks role.<br/><br/>Staying with realism, does Spielberg even get the facts of Omaha Beach right? The real plan was for the men to secure the beach and then have bulldozers knock down the sea wall. Tanks would then blast through German fortifications and then the men would follow the tanks. What really happened was that the water and tides were unexpectedly strong and the men were washed completely off course. That's why they landed directly in front of German machine gun nests; they certainly weren't heading there on purpose. After suffering terrible human losses and with the water being too deep for the tanks, (only 2 of the 29 tanks ever made it), the surviving men waited at the sea wall for five or six hours until German fire had died down and then they climbed up the sides of the bluffs, double-backed and attacked the Germans from behind, eventually over running them. That's what really happened. I found that out by simply looking this battle up in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Apparently, that is something no one at Paramount Pictures did because that is not what happens in the ""realistic"" Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Spielberg presents the Omaha Beach slaughter as if this is what happened all over on D-Day. Again, not true, in fact, troop casualties were much less than expected. Yes, more than 2000 soldiers died at Omaha Beach, which saw the fiercest fighting and was a terrible slaughter, but a fifteen miles down the coastline at Utah Beach, they suffered less than 200 casualties and even less to the north at Juno and Gold beaches. I'm not trying to be disingenuous here. I know Saving Private Ryan was about this specific group going into this particular battle, but overall, what was presented in Saving Private Ryan is not what most soldiers faced that day.<br/><br/>But what is really unforgivable to me, if you watch Saving Private Ryan, is you will get no sense that anybody other than Americans were involved in this action. Remember, it was called The Allied Invasion, not The American Invasion, which might explain why Saving Private Ryan is hailed as being accurate over here, but in other countries, notably Britain and Canada, who also lost soldiers that day, they find this film laughable.<br/><br/>Nobody minds that Spielberg fudged things historical in order to make a dramatic movie. But pretending you didn't is wrong. And yes, just because Paramount Pictures says this is the way it happened, don't make it so. Saving Private Ryan is clearly a well-intentioned film and was made with skill and care. But, ultimately it is nothing more than a feel good picture, full of flag waving banalities and video game style violence. It is World War II: The Ride. Steven Spielberg has made a gripping and entertaining film with Saving Private Ryan. But that's all. Let's save our Medals of Honor for those who show bravery in an actual war."
"gooeyman","2","4","9","12 November 2005"," Disappointing.
","I'm no expert on the Normandy landings, but I know enough to know that the opening scenes of the movie, so highly lauded as realism, were pure hokum. Though there may have been some landing craft whose occupants were slaughtered as the doors opened, and whose few survivors were then further decimated on the beach, less than 10% of those who landed on Omaha Beach were injured or killed. So what was the point of showing the fountains of blood? We know war is hell. Showing it realistically is gruesome enough, without stretching the truth.<br/><br/>The movie went downhill from there. The next three hours were spent tediously watching a single squad of a men walking all around 400 square miles of France asking whether anyone has seen Private Ryan. How ridiculously absurd. Again I must ask, what was the point? It stretched credulity beyond the limit.<br/><br/>I think the biggest reason I was so disappointed in this movie is that it was so highly acclaimed by critics when it was released. I can't imagine why."
"bryon2311aw","Null","4","9","16 June 2005"," A moving film, although from the usual US-saves-the-world perspective.
","As an addendum to the very fair report on SPR by Bob the Moo, I'd only point out that the basis for the story is not an American one, but a British one from WWI. That's the only nod to the usual US view of themselves as the world's favourite saviours. That said, it's a great film. The deaths, especially as a result of close-quarter combat, are rightly harrowing. You do get the sense that war is not about glory and that heroic actions often go unrecorded, often resulting in tragic endings. The attempt at combat realism is commendable; the sound of machine gun bullets zipping through air and flesh will remain with me. In an action film there is often limited scope for developing depth to the characters, and this is also true of SPR. To blame any of the actors for this is a tad unfair. It simply soars way over the heads of such films as Full Metal Jacket and the closest comparison I could make is to the Band Of Brothers series, which is closely based on real events, and possibly The Wind Whisperers. Oh, and regarding the comment about Michael Caine removing his kids from a US school over it teaching that WWII began in 1941: It is sad but true that US kids might be taught this; however, are Brit kids taught that WWII began on 3rd Sept 1939? To a Pole, the war began 2 days prior to that. To a Czech, maybe a year, to a Chinese person maybe 3 years... it's all a matter of perspective."

Next the platoon is asked to find 1 particular solider. At this point the boys seem to leave all their brains behind. They decide to fight to the death over some meaningless bridge, commit one act of  stupidity after another.

The movie ends with a powerful message that is sure to dampen even the toughest of hearts.<br/><br/>Overall, a well scripted movie backed up by an incredible cast and an exceptionally talented director.<br/><br/>This movie gives a perspective that other War movies rarely depict. <br/><br/>Would surely recommend."

","I think this is a magnificent film. It has everything and everything good. It is not an effects movie, but it has them, entertaining, with history and that even taking almost three hours, they fly by.<br/><br/>How can you have so many actors and that everyone is so good. I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks, but I think even he's fine. Being a bomb movie, it turns out that all actors have depth, you all know their lives and their thoughts.<br/><br/>It is normal that being Spielberg, with his budgets, make-up art, hairdressing are fine, but you have to.<br/><br/>From the photograph, nothing needs to be said, magnificent, as always Janusz Kaminski is formidable. Constant coldness and depth of field for Steven's plans Talking to people everyone loves the beginning. Nobody talks about the ending. I even heard that the film has the climax at first. I think if you like the cinema you will enjoy much more of the whole ending than the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Spoiler: <br/><br/>The film has an early hour that everyone hallucinates, not for less, that amount of effects, extremely well made, with a lot of rhythm and very well planned. But this is only the beginning because we reached the end of the film, the whole area of ​​the bridge. From here, he talks about values, fellowship, friendship, but most of all, Steven Spielberg gets to direct as he knows. Plane to plane is a true marvel, narrating based on planes, the camera is always placed where it should be, at the pace it should carry. Having effects, of course, but only with the staging and its direction is not to blink. No close-ups at all pace, no, plans studied to tell a story. It gets you so far in the movie that you do not realize that you've been almost three hours.<br/><br/>There is a moment in the movie, when the military arrive to tell a mother that her son is dead. She is in the kitchen. Through the window you can see a car. Without losing the woman we see the car, as she opens the door, they pass and it does not take much that she knows what there is. What a way to tell and tell. No cheap but brutal sensibilities."
"nicalonge","10","3","6","4 October 2016"," Unique film
","Saving Private Ryan caused WWII vets to leave the theatre during the film. Sounds like a bad movie? Well that's incorrect, they left due to the emotions it made them feel and how real the movie seemed. This comes as no surprise since it is a Steven Spielberg movie. He is a much decorated film maker who is good with serious genres. He certainly did not let down in this instant classic.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job at showing the terrifying reality of war. The opening battle scene might just make you cringe as it starts off in the blood bath of Omaha Beach. This lasts about 24 minutes but leaves a much longer lasting impression. While the blood and gore of the movie might turn you off, it does show a personal humanistic side. Tom hanks as the leading actor does a good job at making you feel what it was like to be in that situation. Tom Hanks who is also known to be a much decorated actor, had experience of acting out war scenes from the hit film Forest Gump. <br/><br/>The graphics and design of this movie were magnificent. The designers studied many things about WWII and the way it looked in order to put together such realistic scenes. It's as close to war as you can get in a film. Everything down to the stitches on the uniform is done as historically accurate as possible. Also the animated portions were beyond its time. There is a scene where a soldier is trying to put his guts back into his body that is so detailed it kind of makes me sick. This movie broke many graphic barriers for the time is what made and really began a new era of historic war movies.<br/><br/>The plot consists of a young Private Ryan whose three brothers were killed in action. Since he is the last of his brothers left, the marines feel the need to bring him back home to his mother. This mission is given to a small group of men led by Tom Hanks. This plot is based on historical truths so the concept of it cannot be argued by critics. That doesn't mean the idea of this real life issue can't be questioned however. The problem of this plot was seen throughout the movie in the soldiers' eyes. As the group started to lose men over one private, they began to question what they were doing. A scene in which the soldiers start arguing about it and one pulls a gun on the other really makes you feel this moral struggle. Audience members who became attached to these characters also started to question the idea of saving one man for the price of many. Tom Hanks settled down these doubts, however, in a heartfelt speech during the scene of argument and kept his soldiers focused.<br/><br/>Being emotionally connected to the characters was a strong suit the movie showed. It made it better than just a bloody war film. It made you feel as if you were there and part of it. You grow to care for each member of the group as the film goes on. Which makes it that much harder when they start to die off. A scene in which they gave background stories of where they're from helped strengthen the connection. <br/><br/>This movie is intense and is definitely not okay for kids. It receives an R rating for blood, gore, and language. Veterans of our military will be much more appreciated after a film like this. What makes this movie special is that it doesn't only show the horrible non-humane aspects of war, it also shows the morality and heroics these brave soldiers showed in order to protect a good cause. Saving Private Ryan is a unique film because of that."
"joeyrecker","9","3","6","2 October 2016"," Saving Private Ryan review
","Steven Spielberg Lived up to his legacy once again when creating this Powerfully moving film. By combining amazing actors, eye opening details, and an absolute genius plot, he creates one of the most iconic films ever. Try sitting through the opening scene of D-Day. Spielberg ingenuity when recreating this event is absolutely perfect. He puts you in the boots of brave soldiers who threw their bodies at the wall of German Nazis gunfire. This draws you into the movie and makes you excited, but nervous to find out what's next for this group of men. This type of plot creates a sense of attachment to Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his 2nd Ranger Battalion as they go on what seems like a pointless mission to find missing Private Ryan (Matt Damon). As the film goes on you yourself might even question, is it really worth sending eight experienced men to find this one missing soldier? Spielberg hit the jack pot with his cast. Many of which were in their primes of acting or just starting to be known for their amazing talents. Such as Tom Sizemore (Sergeant Horvath), Vin Diesel (Private Caparzo), Edward Burns (Private Reiben), Matt Damon (Private Ryan), and of course the great Tom Hanks (Captain Miller). Tom Hanks (Captain Miller) is in short, a genius. His ability to be a ""utility man"" and play almost any role in a movie makes him one of the greatest actors ever, and he doesn't let us down with his astonishing role. Every line he gives draws you into his character, as a weary old Captain who has seen too much for any person to handle, and is ready to go home to his wife. The actors and plot aren't the only things that made this movie amazing. This film also put so much detail into locations, props, and people, and make it a life like war zone. With crumbling structures from constant attack, and overgrown vegetation, creating a sense of abandonment and eeriness. This detail is the most important factor when making such an emotional film. It allows the audience to get that much deeper into the scene and making it that much more believable. <br/><br/>With such a great movie you must be thinking are there any setbacks to why I shouldn't see this amazing film? Sadly, there is one thing you should be ready for. If you can get past constant gore, and a bit of cuss words. I hope you have a lot of time on your hands. This film is 2 hours and 50 minutes. So I hope you're okay with giving up a large chunk of your day, but don't worry! It is beyond worth it. Despite this small complication, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing creation, full of action, drama, and tons of explosions. You will be involved with every second this film has to offer, and with no doubt will want to see it again."
"gpoposki","10","3","6","11 September 2016"," Simply the best
","This movie truly deserves a spot on the top 10 best war movies. No words can express the feelings you get while watching this movie.<br/><br/>Right at the start you're being thrown right into the heat of the battle, the starting 27 minutes are absolutely amazing, in the way that Steven Spielberg (the director) did tremendously good job at making his vision come true. The scenes were ""extraordinary"" sort to say, in the way that he tried to recreate that WW2 ""Battlefield Cameraman"" aesthetic. If you watch any footage from WW2 you can see the hand- held camera is shaky and when an explosion or something else happens nearby, the camera goes everywhere and the footage gets interrupted. Steven used this and made the movie feel chaotic. The scenes looked so real and felt so chaotic up to the point that REAL D-Day veterans who watched this movie had relived the horror of Omaha beach because of their PTSD, and when this movie was released they setup a hotlink for anyone who had received these horrible ""flash backs"". That is such a terrible thing, and my heart goes out to the veterans who had to relive this chaos all over again. Then again... as terrible as this sounds, this is quite the achievement for Spielberg in the way that he made it look so real, that it was too real.<br/><br/>Never the less, the rest of the movie had you on edge, i'm not telling you how. You should know, if you don't. Then go watch it."

","Saving private Ryan is for me the best war movie ever!!!!It is an important movie reflecting morals and values of how 8 men risk their lives for one. Simply brilliant, really tense and realistically portrayed, this movie held my attention throughout. There are some scenes which are really strong. They can make you smile, cry and look away.Thats how powerful SPR is. <br/><br/>On the whole i give it 10/10 as there was absolutely nothing in the movie that i didn't like. Steven Spielberg = Awesomeness!!!! SPR is a standard, a force to reckon with, a dark horse among war movies whose simplicity and strength cannot be matched."
"rickhavoc1","7","3","6","25 September 2007"," Great battle scenes, but somewhat spoiled by many flaws.
","The best thing about SPR is the Omaha Beach sequence. That was very realistic, as well as being factual. The rest of the story is fictional, only somewhat realistic, and rather unlikely. First of all, the WWII US Army would never have wasted a Ranger Captain who was a company commander to lead a SQUAD of soldiers. They would have assigned a platoon sergeant, or at most a 2nd Lieutenant. I can believe they might send a squad of regular infantry to find a single soldier, but using Rangers is a stretch. Rangers are more highly trained, and would be used for an important military objective, not a ""P.R. mission"". There were some touches that I liked. I liked the way Tom Hanks portrayed Captain Miller as a normal guy who's approaching burnout, and is starting to get the ""shakes"". Also the way he kept a certain amount of distance from his men until they were down to a small group. The part about the company having a ""pool"" on his prewar occupation, and it turning out to be a teacher. The way the sniper, Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), quotes Scripture to calm himself and steady his aim. The running ""FUBAR"" joke. However, the end really bothers me. Having Captain Miller laying a heavy guilt trip on Private Ryan (Matt Damon), as he dies is unrealistic melodrama. Finally, much has been said about various 'tactical errors' made by both the German and American forces in the movie's climactic battle. Steven Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics for dramatic effect. Shame on you, Steven! Neither Robert Rodat (writer) nor Steven Spielberg (director) have ever served in the military. In fact, Spielberg attended California State University, Long Beach, to avoid the draft for the Vietnam War. So this is the kind of UNREALISTIC war movie made by someone who went to college to avoid military service. I don't think it helped that Robert Roden had to rewrite the screenplay 11 times before it was accepted.<br/><br/>In the words of Sam Fuller, ""The only way to make a truly realistic war movie is to fill the theater with smoke and flame, the sound of explosions, and to have someone shoot the person sitting next to you."" Amen!"
"DashTheGreat","10","3","6","10 September 2007"," Greatest Tribute to the Greatest Generation
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It's an unbelievably emotionally powerful film that inspires a horror seldom seen in the usual Hollywood movie. This has to be not only one of the greatest war movies ever made, but possibly THE greatest movie ever ever made. I would easily put it on the level of the Godfather movies. Why? SPR has infinite character depth. There are no GI Joes or murderous killers that every single war movie needs to have. Every soldier is just that - a soldier. I may also be one of the few who felt sorry for Upham. Keep in mind that he wasn't a soldier per se. He was an interpreter. Also, keep in mind that he hadn't really established a bond with the unit yet, which was something that they all shared.<br/><br/>SPR has a realistic portrayal of WWII. They even portrayed the Germans and SS better than any movie I have ever seen. It also forces you to feel sorry for soldiers of both sides, like when the two American soldiers shot the two Czechs (I believe, as mentioned on the forum) who surrendered, and then taunted them. This was a subtlety that I only recently found out about. I always assumed that they were German.<br/><br/>Tom Hank's character was truly great. He wasn't a stock character at all, and seemed like he could be a real person. This was actually true for all of the characters. I also, guiltily, felt a little sorry for Steam Boat Willie, who was probably going to be executed in a ditch for being the sole survivor of, you know. You know what happens in the final scene, and I couldn't feel sorry for him anymore, and was happy, as we all were, when the event after that happened. This was just one of the many amazing themes and subtleties that were involved with this movie. I have seen it over 15 times, and still notice new things every time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is gruesome but beautiful. What greater present for Veterans Day is there than to watch this movie? They truly were the greatest Generation, and their gift of freedom to us keeps on giving."

","I've watched many war movies since I was young but none have impressed me as much as Saving Private Ryan. The realism was top notch. I have served the army infantry for a number of years and I know the sound and shock of artilleries and bullets. Furthermore, the emotions of the soldiers were presented so well throughout the show.<br/><br/>As I was watching the show, it kept prompting me to realize the hardship of war and the suffering of losing human lives. Never before has a war movie conveyed to me so deeply that we should never go to war - for whatever reason. Strange to hear myself commenting like this when I was trained so hard in the army to lead men to fight so aggressively in a possible battlefield."

OK, Saving Private Ryan gave me the feeling that I was watching WWII from someone's perspective. I was especially amazed by the way this movie was captured with the camera angles, the outstanding acting, and the amazing special effects. What was unfortunate was that the best actor got a very short part. He was the medic on Omaha beach that yells ""We did it, we stopped the bleeding,"" then the man they saved gets shoot in the head. The medic flips out. That medic should have gotten a longer part. But anyways, I found this movie to be awesome.<br/><br/>Total: 10/10 A+"
"latina_moviebuff","10","3","6","3 April 2007"," Personal Summary of The Movie - Saving Private Ryan
","This movie is about a mother that is about to be notified that three of her four sons have been killed in a war. The fourth son is not known to alive nor dead. Eight men begin a journey to find and bring the fourth son home to his mother. Throughout this journey you are taken to the war at that specific time. This movie shows what the war was truly like and helps people who have never suffered through a war really look and reflect on their life. This movie shows the extent to which a government will go to, to simply ease a mother's pain.<br/><br/>Another wonderful aspect of this movie is that when the fourth son is finally found and is informed of his brothers death he wants to continue with his mission that was set before him. He feels his brothers deaths would have been in vain if he does not complete his mission. Therefore the eight soldiers aid in in attempting his mission before returning home. This is another important aspect of the movie as it shows that most soldiers are there for a reason and believe in the cause they are fighting for."
"freaky_dave","9","3","6","26 February 2007"," An Incredible film
","Saving Private Ryan is one one of Spielberg's best movies, and that's saying a lot. It was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense, graphic, and completely realistic. It is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever. It was a great beginning to an incredible movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Captain John H. Miller. After surviving the attack at Omaha Beach (known now as D-Day) he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private Ryan and bring him back home. You see, all of Ryan's brothers have been killed in combat, and since he is the last survivor, the higher ups in the U.S. military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boys.<br/><br/>Miller of course takes the job. He doesn't much like it, but he is just following the orders of his superiors. When he tells his platoon about it, they are all against it. After all, why should they risk all their lives for one person. They gripe about it, but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines where Ryan's squadron was parachuted in.<br/><br/>Along the way we learn about the characters, yet the pace never was drawn out. As the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters. Vin Diesel had and early roll with this movie, and other actors include Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish, and Henry Thomas. All were good in their roles.<br/><br/>This movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound. It was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these, and I also believe that Spielberg's Oscar for Best Director was the right choice. Tom Hanks was the main star, but Spielberg's directing made all the characters seem just as important, and kept the pace of the moving going without any real slow up.<br/><br/>My only question would be about the story which is told form a soldier's view. I have know problem with the story being told from that view, but what I do have a problem with is believing that our leaders would create a mission that would risk eight of their men to save one. I know that the grieving mother lost three of her boys, but would our military really go through all this for one man? I don't think so. But then it is just a movie. Overall I enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it to anybody."
"zena8","7","3","6","14 May 2005"," Well-executed movie but the point is unclear
","Saving Private Ryan is well-filmed and well-acted. But it is thematically a mess, and on that count is wildly overrated.<br/><br/>The complaints about this movie on these IMDb comments are two: one that it is properly speaking an anti-war film, and the other that it indulges in crude nationalism. Both complaints are on the mark, but it should be noticed that they are not quite consistent with one another. Saving Private Ryan, in the tradition of Vietnam movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, focuses on the human cost of war. But its moral, that we must earn the sacrifice those bold men made for us so long ago, sits rather uncomfortably with the focus on the cost. After all, how could we earn the loss of these men and the grief of their mothers? By living well? By being good people? It doesn't make sense. How could you make your life worth the sacrifice of so many others?<br/><br/>Perhaps the point is that we ought to be grateful to the men who fought and died for saving our lives. But this doesn't make sense either. The war in Europe did not properly speaking save our lives. Wars are rarely if ever fought to save lives. They are fought to conquer and to defend against being conquered. But being conquered does not amount to being killed, and it might well save lives to surrender. Spielberg does obliquely refer to the Holocaust in the film. But he must know as everyone does that the war was not fought to end the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Perhaps Spielberg is tacitly assuming some flag-waving boilerplate about how they fought 'for freedom', and we ought to be grateful for that. I don't deny that 'saving Europe for liberal democracy'however we understand that--was a noble cause. But it would be impossible to tell from this movie that this was the point of the war, and it might well be impossible to believe that such a cause was worth dying for once you had properly taken in its message: that war is the senseless destruction of mothers' sons.<br/><br/>War movies traditionally fall into two types. One type focuses on the heroic cause the soldiers fought for, in which case you will want to glorify war. You will want to make your soldiers look strong, noble, and make our hearts melt with admiration for them. Otherwise how can we encourage others to fight for such (often abstract) causes? Most classic WWII movies fit this mold. And given that most of us think WWII was fought for a good cause, this makes sense. The other alternative is to focus on the human cost of war, as Vietnam movies and WWI movies typically do. But it isn't a coincidence that Vietnam and WWI are thought to be pointless wars. The idea of such movies is that nationalism and social habits can lead us to sacrifice our children for nothing. By shocking us with the horror of war, we are encouraged to mistrust martial impulses. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan tries to take from both traditions, and ends up with a garbled mess. WWII was a noble cause that could not have been worth the sacrifice. <br/><br/>It might be argued that each type of movie neglects some important truth that the other type captures. Perhaps some great filmmaker will successfully ennoble the causes of war and at the same time capture its horror. Perhaps someone already has. All I know is that Spielberg has not."

It's as if I was actually running up the beach, with bullets going all around me, slicing people to bits and bombs blowing off everywhere, tearing everyone to shreds. There was a feeling of total hopelessness of the existing and forthcoming carnage around me.<br/><br/>I remember when I first saw the film, there was somebody left of me who was so traumatized by the Omaha invasion sequence, she covered her eyes and went out of the theater. There was a seemingly hardened old man right of me who said he has never have seen such horrifying experience in his life.<br/><br/>Yes, this film has many flaws. I found the script to be very conventional and there were many corny cliches. The characters are not very well developed. Even the tank battle at the end, an amazing scene than matched the Omaha scene in tension, is pretty much Hollywoodized; it showed many military inaccuracies.  I had participated in message boards that many military analysts rightfully criticized the ending as being very unrealistic.<br/><br/>However, it's still hard to not say this is a groundbreaking powerhouse of a war film that will (and had probably already) changed Hollywood war cinema forever.

","Seems like the Spielberg who gave us Sugarland Express, Duel, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. has departed our company and has been replaced by a clone who is intent on exploiting human suffering in the name of art and the Oscar. Schindler's List was perhaps the worst example of this trend... followed closely by Saving Private Ryan. Both films were undoubtedly critical and commercial successes. But somewhere, something called a soul may be MIA amidst all the hoopla. Personally, I'd rather watch A Bridge Too Far (again), The Longest Day (again), Apocalypse Now (again), Full Metal Jacket (again), The Deer Hunter (again), and Paths of Glory (again) if I have to remember how horrible war is."

While thousands of Americans, Brits, Aussies, Canadians, Free French and others are dying fighting Hitler's army and Luftwaffe, Spielberg is leading a campaign of mighty forces to pull a lone American out of the combat zone no matter what the cost. To use the world's greatest invasion from the sea as the mere backdrop to a story is, to me, perverse, and trivializes the extraordinary efforts both of the men who fought during the Normandy invasions and the earlier generation of filmmakers who sought to portray that effort on a grand, much nobler canvas."

I personally have no doubt in my mind that had this movie been based on a French, British or even Canadian squad, that not to many people would have been calling it patriotic.  For some reason the site of an american flag at the beginning and at the end of the film seems to make people think much less of the movie. I am not american myself but I sure as hell am glad they got into the war and all though there were many other countries in the war, this movie happened to be about an american squad.

At the end of the movie an *heroic* punch of Americans are defending a bridge by killing 2 hundred SS and by destroying 2 Tiger tanks with sticky bombs (!) and hand-thrown mortar ammunitions (!!).<br/><br/>In both cases Germans are dumb and on the wrong side, either as killers or as victims!<br/><br/>It is my opinion that soldiers of both armies were equally forced to fight by orders from above and inspired by boastful belief. There is nothing really heroic in war.<br/><br/>If you want to find a more believable perspective of operation Overlord try Max Hasting's book ""Overlord"" (1984).

"Horst_In_Translation","4","6","16","16 July 2017"," I cannot see the appeal at all (probably due to personal bias)
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is an American movie from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The director is Steven Spielberg and this one is from the years that many probably consider his very best years in filmmaking. It came out half a decade roughly after his probably career-defining Schindler's List. But while I really love the latter, this one here did not make a lasting impression on me at all. I already stated in the title of my review that this may be due to personal bias as war movies are just not exactly my preferred choice. Knowing how it is considered such a classic, however, I thought why not give it a go nonetheless. But I had more than just a few problems with it. Let me mention some. The very long introduction of Hanks' character early on could have been left out completely if you ask me and the movie could have started with the scene where we find out that Mother Ryan lost all her sons during the very same day, which is admittedly not very realistic, even during the days of World War II. And still, it was one of the better scenes nonetheless I believe, probably also because of my aforementioned bias and I was grateful for every distraction that offered more than gun shootings, soldiers' uniforms and people crawling through the mud. I am also not a fan of ""Band of Brothers"", another Spielberg/Hanks collaboration. Hanks was probably the biggest film star on the planet at that time after having won two Oscars recently, so yeah given Spielberg was maybe also at the peak of his popularity, this certainly could have become something tremendous. And I like Hanks. A lot actually, which makes me even more sad this one here did not turn out to my liking at all.<br/><br/>One reason may be the runtime. It actually comes pretty close to the 3-hour mark and I felt that it dragged a lot and that there were many lengths. And also that they kept introducing new characters all the time instead of elaborating on the old ones in a memorable manner. Honestly, I felt like I knew almost nothing about all the soldiers in here. It is somewhat interesting because they are played by famous names like Diesel, Ribisi, Damon, Giamatti or Farina at early/earlier stages of their careers, so the cast is not the problem at all. And Hanks also does a solid job with what he was given. The Oscar nomination may have been a bit too much, but well, that's bearable looking at everything the film won. Spielberg Best Direction? Nah. Then again, the technical categories are something that is tough for me to judge, so perhaps these were somewhat deserving. But the nomination for the script sure was a joke and I am not surprised at all that writer Robert Rodat never came close to writing a great screenplay again as obviously he hadn't done here either. I am not mad that the Oscars eventually went for the lighter ""Shakespeare in Love"" over this one and I am baffled by how many people still say SPR should have won Best Picture that year. Anyway, I am on the ""La vita è bella"" bandwagon 100%.<br/><br/>Now back to this movie here. I think I have elaborated enough on all the many reasons why I did not end up liking this film at all. The story may be its biggest weakness. The references here are actually truly simple, like the group of soldiers finding accidentally the wrong soldier James Ryan at one point. This was also a weak scene and still it was far more memorable than the at least 90 minutes of battlefield action. It gets a bit less towards the end when they find Ryan. Still a long time before the film ends. The frame with the funeral also only works if you enjoyed everything in-between. To me, honestly it felt a bit on the melodramatic side to be honest. But again, I was somewhat grateful for it because it was not just boring random war action. As a whole, I give ""Saving Private Ryan"" a thumbs-down and I am baffled how people, also IMDb voters, consider this one of the greatest 50 films of all time. I strongly disagree. Watch something else instead and I'd only recommend this one to the very biggest war film fans. Oh well, I guess they have seen it already anyway."

","Most idiotic portrayal of the Normandy invasion ever! The main characters acted like modern spoiled brats! The characters were not convincing at all! If actual soldiers acted that way, They would have never even made it past basic training. Also the US military back then would never have risked the lives of a whole squad to find and bring back one single solider. The main objective to any soldier is win the war, And that used to take precedence over anything. Also the moment Private Mellish disrespected a superior officer and then refused to carry on, He would have been shot! There was no time for pampering cry babies during a world war! And this movie basically portrays WWII era soldiers as modern day cry babies. It was not only a disgusting insult to our vets, But it was a insult to our military and our country! The only thing going for this movie is the special effects. But it takes much more than pretty filming to make a movie. I have no idea how the hell this movie was so well praised! This movie was as stupid and cliché as Inglorious Bastards."
"GaryIndianna","6","4","10","7 February 2007"," What Shall We Do With Steven Spielberg?
","No one can doubt the power of this film's opening sequence. When Miller (Tom Hanks), slimed in blood and filth, stares blank eyed at the carnal slaughter around him , you cannot help but think 'That was what is was really like'. And you cannot help but reflect on the importance of this moment in modern history, and on the undiluted bravery of the men who were there. And yet....when the initial battle is over, Horvath (Tom Sizemore) scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it in to a tin marked 'France'. It's a moment of forced quirkiness, quite out of keeping with the frank reportage of what's gone before. It's a bit of business, used by the director as a punctuation mark, and it's the first sign that this is a film with fatal flaws.<br/><br/>Having survived Omaha Beach, Miller and his men are assigned to locate Ryan, whose whereabouts are unknown. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and the US military brass cannot allow Ryan to be lost too. There's a historical precedent for this, although 'Saving Private Ryan' is a wholly fictionalised account. Given their mission, the soldiers debate it's worth - are they to throw their lives away in order to arbitrarily save someone else? Conflicts arise, there are uneasy stand offs, and reluctant truces. They find Ryan, and save him. Ryan lives to be a humble old man, but most of the soldiers who saved him do not live to be old men of any sort.<br/><br/>Spielberg's technique is frequently brilliant, but it's unvaried, so that the final battle is no different in tone from the first one, three hours of screen time previous. But the real flaws are in the script. Miller is an ordinary decent man, who will make difficult decisions when pushed. Horvath is the tough sergeant, Wade is the medic disgusted by the slaughter, Reiben is the insubordinate, Mellish is the comedian who doesn't know when to shut up, Upham is the tenderfoot who's never fired a weapon on his life, Jackson is an illiterate from the deep south who's also crack shot, Carparzo is a giant of a man. Miller could be played by Gregory Peck, Horvath by Ernest Borgnine. Reiben might be a young William Holden and so on.<br/><br/>The worst crime is the character of the German soldier who the men want to execute in revenge for the death of Wade. The German begs pitifully for his life, says in broken English that he loves America and hates Germany. Upham is a humanitarian, he can't stand to see a man killed in cold blood and he persuades Miller to let the German go free. Upham has never fired a weapon in his life, remember, and Miller is full of human decency. So at the end, what happens? The German returns, having thrown in his lot with another platoon of German soldiers. In what is portrayed as a supreme irony, the German kills Miller, and in turn, is killed by Upham, who finally finds his courage, or at least, his capacity to kill. The problem is that as soon as you set eyes on Upham, he's so weak and pathetic that it's a certainty his character will undergo a dramatic reversal. It doesn't matter that Tom Hanks as Miller, Jeremy Davies as Upham, and Barry Pepper as Jackson are superb. It doesn't matter that as vignettes, the deaths of Wade and Mellish are exceptional. Behind the throat clearing and the reverence, the clichés stretch from the flinty military hawk who gives the order that Ryan must be saved, to the final soft focus image of the older Ryan himself. In the end, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a more callow, less worldly film than 'Attack' or 'A Walk In The Sun' and the savagery of it's opening only serves to emphasise the fact."
"MovieAddict2016","8","4","10","23 November 2005"," Not the best war film ever made, but perhaps the most realistic.
","What Steven Spielberg has done with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of World War II, and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing -- a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death. The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.<br/><br/>The movie, based on the actual events surrounding the Nilan brothers during World War II, is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a young man who loses three brothers in the war, and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find, and return, Private Ryan to safety.<br/><br/>The men who fight alongside Miller have to question their own actions. What makes Private Ryan more important than any of them? They all have mothers, too. But they follow orders, venturing into the battlefields of WWII France in search of Private Ryan. The most reluctant of the soldiers is Private Reiben (Edward Burns), a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another man.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are ultimately what made ""Saving Private Ryan"" one of the highest-grossing films of the decade, and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters. Many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences, the landing at Omaha Beach, which probably lasts about fifteen minutes -- at least.<br/><br/>However, the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture. This is a fascinating account of war, packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film, but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations. ""Earn this,"" Captain Miller tells Private Ryan at one point in the film.<br/><br/>Spielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of film-making to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life. Spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project, as much as he felt it was necessary to direct ""Schindler's List."" Both films work as a sort of documentary-style motion picture, but also contain fundamental emotional truths, which elevate them to higher ground.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, as Captain Miller, is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture, but Hanks' position in the film works (to great effect) primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier. As we too often forget, the men who fight wars are not always the Schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition. The soldiers in World War II were fathers, husbands, brothers, sons. Hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay alive.<br/><br/>Is ""Saving Private Ryan"" a better movie than ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" or other great war pictures in the genre? Not necessarily. But it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure film-making, and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against Hitler's armies. If you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have."

There were some nice little touches such as Miller having Parkinsons that added some colour to the characterisation.<br/><br/>Now the bad news:<br/><br/>There were far too many formulaic elements in this film - I would like to think this was enforced by the studios but I doubt it.<br/><br/>The German they let go and what happens afterward with him - extremely predictable.<br/><br/>The Rookie that goes to pieces at completely the worst time - equally so<br/><br/>The sequence where Miller is firing at the Tank with his sidearm - we're in Cliche country.<br/><br/>The ending (From after above scene onward) - Far too jingoistic for my taste - the Film tries to show how repulsive war is, then tries to glorify it?? This particularly cheapens the entire movie.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is great to look at, and will hopefully open a lot of people's eyes as to what being shot or blown up actually looks like in ""Reality"", but with a sharper script and a less cynical template, it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Dan"

"JamesHitchcock","6","3","7","16 November 2016"," Being a great director is not just about shooting great scenes
","On the same day in July 1916 my great-grandparents received three telegrams from the War Office, informing them that their three eldest sons were all missing in action, presumed dead. (Two were soldiers taking part in the Battle of the Somme, the third a sailor on the convoys to Russia). In fact only one of the boys turned out to have been killed, but my great-grandmother never recovered from the shock. (Her husband seems to have borne the loss of his eldest son more stoically). <br/><br/>I well remember my grandfather, the youngest of four sons and whose name was James like my own, telling me this piece of family history, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" always reminds me of it because it deals with a very similar story. Except that here all three boys really are dead. One day in June 1944 a Mrs Ryan receives news that her three eldest sons have all been killed in battle, two in the D-Day landings and the third in the Pacific. My grandfather was too young to fight in the war, but Mrs Ryan's fourth and youngest son, also named James, is also serving with the US Army.<br/><br/>At the U.S. War Department, General Marshall orders that James Ryan must be sent home immediately to spare his family the pain of losing all four sons. The problem is that he is a paratrooper who has parachuted into Normandy and nobody knows exactly where he is. Captain John Miller and a squad under his command are ordered to find him and bring him back. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone accused the film and its director Steven Spielberg and scriptwriter Robert Rodat of promoting ""the worship of World War II as the good war"". I am not sure that that should really be a criticism; the great majority of American or British films about World War II have portrayed it as a just war against the aggression and brutality of the Axis powers. It would be a brave director who set an anti- war drama against the background of this particular conflict- ""Catch-22"" is perhaps one of the few exceptions- and I note that not even Stone has dared do so. It is much safer for those who wish to make anti-war films to stick to World War I or Vietnam. <br/><br/>Moreover, Spielberg can hardly be accused of ignoring the human cost of war. The film has been praised for its graphic battle scenes, particularly its harrowing opening sequence, lasting nearly half an hour, showing the American landing on Omaha Beach. Spielberg does not flinch from presenting war as cruel and bloody or from realistic depictions of men being killed or maimed. At first the assault appears to be completely chaotic, yet as it progresses we begin to realise that this is not so, that the Americans do indeed have a strategy and that they will succeed in taking the beach, albeit at a heavy cost in casualties. <br/><br/>The film may have its critics, but it also has its admirers, and there are many who believe that it should have won the 1998 ""Best Picture"" Oscar ahead of ""Shakespeare in Love"". (Spielberg did indeed win ""Best Director""). It is one of those films which, when it gets something right, gets it very right indeed. The above-mentioned battle scene is the best example of this, but I should also mention John Williams' Oscar-nominated musical score, especially the deeply moving Hymn for the Fallen which plays over the closing titles. I also liked Spielberg's use of hand-held cameras and desaturated colour. He was aiming to reproduce the look of American wartime colour newsreels (British ones during this period were all in black-and-white), and I found his pale, bleached colours much more appropriate to the mood of the film than brilliant Technicolor would have been. <br/><br/>And yet I cannot share the widely-held view that this film is a masterpiece. The visceral intensity of that opening sequence is allowed to dissipate as, for the next hour-and-a-half, the film proceeds slowly as we follow Miller and his unit across Normandy. Only when they finally find Ryan towards the end, followed by a second battle scene, does Spielberg recapture anything like the brilliance with which the film opened. During this lengthy interim the action is too slow-moving and attempts to focus on the conflicting personalities of Miller and his men never arouse much interest; it is as though individual human beings are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the conflict raging around them. <br/><br/>My vote for ""Best Picture"" of 1998 would have gone to ""The Truman Show"" and, despite Spielberg's undoubted technical mastery, for ""Best Director"" to Peter Weir. Being a great director is not just about shooting great scenes, it is also about making a great film, and here I think he does not succeed. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a technically accomplished film, but not a great one. 6/10"

","Not a bad film, but not at all memorable. Of course the beginning and end are mawkish and irritating. The Omaha beach sequence it has to be said is exciting. Now i'll openly admit i'm a bit of an anorak....but some of the scenes during the final battle sequence were laughable. Firstly, considering they were likely part of an experienced Panzer division the Germans were ridiculously naive tactically. In reality they would have made life a lot harder for the Americans until air support arrived. (in the unlikely form of P51s, British Typhoons would have been most likely) <br/><br/>The second point i'd like cleared up is the matter of the sniper in the bell tower and his demise. He ls dispatched by what looks to me like a tank destroyer with a long barrel 75mm!? IF the piece could have been elevated that far it would have been firing an AP round which would most likely have passed straight through the tower doing little or NO damage. In reality the Germans would have kept their Panzers and tank destroyers largely static and used them for ambush only???"

He also fails in the field because he was cowardice..Though he finally shot someone, it proved useless..it only said he was willing to kill, but kill an unarmed person at point blank.(which ironically makes him more of a coward.) Other than that all characters are cool. The mysterious Miller, the tough guy Carparzo, the jolly Harvath, the defiant Reiban, the great medic Wade, the great yet unfortunate Mellish, and my personal favorite, the cool religious sniper, Daniel Jackson.

They were in the Marines, Army, Navy and one in the 101 airborne.

However, I believe it reality it was worse, yes worse than movie could make it. Remember, this was a 3 hour movie showing one incident, the reality is far worse, as the survivors of each incident did not go home, they got to fight again the next day/week/month/year, and so on, until the war was won of you were killed or wounded.

","I still remember seeing this film almost five years ago, and I was never so sickened by any film in my life! Why? Because Spielberg gave us a hell of a view of war!!! This film is not that of history, save for the opening, gore fest battle that contained more than blood and missing limbs like previous war films like Platoon or Glory. I can easily understand that war is hell, which I'm glad Spielberg revelaed to the world for a change. I'm not a gore lover, but this really caught me off guard since I'm used to such violence from films as of Braveheart and The Full Metal Jacket. However, I have to confess that all I got from this film was blood and guts.<br/><br/>So, after an agonizing thirty minutes of constant brutality, the film picks up with a story of about a band of four brothers, three of them are already dead, and only one remsins. So, a small force of eight men, including portrayals of popular stars such as Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore, who didn't do much except shoot Germans with machine guns. They are to find this man, retrieve him before he is killed, which would result in the devastation of a his family. A very selfless task it is, but as the man Ryan is found, after another hour and a half of no character development with these eight men, no feeling for them, or tears and grief...at least from me, and Ryan says he refuses to leave.<br/><br/>I laugh and the only reason why this is so is because Spielberg wants another bloody mess, feeling he hasn't shown enough killing! So, another battle happens, with more deaths of both Germans and Americans, leaving this whole film into a usless flashback. So, that's the whole film in a way.<br/><br/>I may sound to hate this film, but I don't, but I'm tired of people claiming this is the best war film ever! Heck, other films I've listed above are better than this for goodness sake! However, the realism was well depicted, the music was haunting, and sad, but I had no feeling, except for wanting to lose my lunch in the pit of my stomach, and the usage of sound mixing, editing, and cinematography was truly Oscar worthy. So, since Spielberg put effort into this film, I give a generous ***1/2 out of *****.<br/><br/>Seriously, I got nothing accept horrible images, and yearning for a bucket in this two hour and fifty minute film."

And I must say that Spielberg copied the ""Hollywood"" war-movie style of Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"".<br/><br/>Technical issues or even realism aside, the underlying message of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is so strong, so well-put, and so human, that in my view it defies objection. I have wandered too many war cemeteries to think otherwise. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is also a good war movie but it makes the case for pacifism. The basic message of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is not pacifist at all. It's something else altogether. But I suggest you see it and draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Lastly, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is so well-made that it bears repeated viewings. But if you dislike war movies, then you should still watch this movie once, if only for the message."

","The first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is probably the most realistic depiction of war and the invasion of Normandy ever made. That being said, the plot is far fetched and the story drags out for while without anything really happening. There is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very well.<br/><br/>
The last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first. It was very disappointing to me personally. In reality the German military was highly trained and professional. In this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min. It seems to me there was two different directors on this movie - one for the first half and one for the second half."

","Saving Private Ryan is awash with wildly exaggerated scenes of carnage.

Looks like Omaha Beach lost every other guy. Nope. One in ten.<br/><br/>We have pictures of the Normandy Landing. Look at them. Does the beach look anything like Spielberg's beach? Spielberg's beach looks like a video game. Bullets streaking through the water and killing the soldiers as they swim up from the bottom of sea. This is how history gets rewritten.<br/><br/>Suppose there was one landing boat that landed right in front of a pill box (good thinking) and got hell shot out of it. Why is Spielberg showing that one unfortunate boat? Feel manipulated? Get used to it. This whole soap opera is chock full of Bridges-of-Madison-County drawn- out boring melodramatic scenes designed to pluck at your heart strings.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone complains that Spielberg is playing into the ""Good War"" mantra that is currently being used to finance the War on Terror. I saw no signs of that. I saw US soldiers shooting down unarmed POWs and beating prisoners. A touch of Vietnam to thrill our taste for revenge? Or is it just part of the arms race between chicken-hawk war directors trying to stimulate our jaded tastes?<br/><br/>The acting is atrocious. It's hard to blame the actors, really, since we don't get to know them at all. They are simply red-shirts waiting their turn to get shot down or get into hissy fits. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks (as always). There's no tension. We know what's going to happen, we're just waiting for it. And it all unfolds so slowly. It's boring. The scenes that could contain some excitement are spent in a quick and confused blur. It's a mess. There's no more artistry in this movie than is contained in your typical music video. Halftracks and Rangers pop up out of nowhere as our heroes cross an open field. Endless streams of machine gun fire pour out from nowhere in particular. It's just ludicrous.<br/><br/>There are few scenes in Saving Private Ryan that aren't replete with unnaturally sentimental dialog, unrealistic dissension in the ranks, haunted stares, tears, and Hollywood's rendition of jaunty, chummy talk.

The rest of the movie is maudlin, bloated, badly plotted and with some of the least compelling dialogue it has been my misfortune to hear. A movie that starts and ends with the US flag is likely to put non-American viewers off side. It would appear that the only people involved in World War II were the Americans, a few cowed and unimportant French peasants and pantomime German villains. A psychiatrist friend of mine assures me that this movie is a classic illustration of the isolation caused by post traumatic stress disorder, but her husband agrees with me that the movie is just rubbish.

","It is very clear to me that Mr. Spielburg has never fought in a war situation. The film did not depict D Day as it was at that time. It is clearly relating to the turn of the century, and would be seen as such.<br/><br/>Many will think that its success is because it is purely a US affair. I thought there were about 16 countries involved, including the defense team. The battle scenes are over dramatized, and no one seems to keep their heads down to avoid being shot, especially the Germans. Also, as usual, the Germans are depicted as being cowardly, stupid and ""not obeying the rules"". <br/><br/>The whole film is an exercise in American patriotism, as told in American schools. If you must see an American war movie that is realistic, watch Task Force, which is a much more accurate depiction of war. Also, it depicts the Americans getting the worst deal on D Day. Not true.

","It is quite rare that a movie comes along that has the ability to connect to its audiences on such a human level. For even the most ""advanced"" film fanatics, the movie-watching experience is usually tethered to the moment: You watch the movie, either like it or don't, and then it slowly fades away as life intercedes. In the case of ""Saving Private Ryan"", though, Steven Spielberg changed an entire's nations attitudes and actions towards a single historical event (WW2).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film drops viewers (quite literally) into D-Day, with a prolonged battle scene that depicts the assault on Normandy. After the company led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) comes out on the other side, they are given a special mission from ""upper management"": A mother back in the U.S. has just been informed that three of her sons were killed in action. A fourth, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is still active in the fight. Miller's goal? Get Ryan out of the war and back to his mother. Is all this effort worth it for one man? Will anyone make it out of the war alive? Those are the questions that Ryan and his men grapple with on the road to find Ryan.<br/><br/>When ""Saving Private Ryan"" premiered in the summer of 1998, many veterans were so moved by the opening D-Day sequence that they had to leave the theater and compose themselves. It was that much of an emotional experience for them, yet Spielberg treats it with such respect that it never seems like ""emotional sabotage"" or anything like that. It was just the first time that audiences had ever been treated to such a graphic, true-to-form visage of battle. No disrespect to any of the war flicks that preceded it, but ""Ryan"" didn't pull any punches.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is a movie that changed perceptions. After viewing this visceral film, many children and grand-children of WW2 vets began asking their parents/grandparents about the war experience. While an uncomfortable topic, to be sure, it was a dialogue that needed to be opened in order to better understand the members of the ""Greatest Generation"". For so many years, WW2 vets had lived ""in silence"", so to speak, about their war experiences, only relating to their war companions (as they were the only people who could relate). What Spielberg did, though, was bring the topic to the forefront of conscious, allowing WW2 vets an avenue for relating their experiences to the current culture.<br/><br/>If I were to start a list of the most important movies ever made from a cultural standpoint, ""Saving Private Ryan"" would perhaps top that list. Not only does it have great action/plot/characters from a film-making standpoint, but it is an experience that can stick with a person forever and change lives."

Spielberg has done it again. I would recommend anyone to go and watch this film at least once. The film doesn't drag along, the whole journey to find Ryan is littered with danger and heartache.

The thing I appreciated most about this movie is that there was not sugar coating anything. The people in this movie are mirroring true events, meaning that people do die and people suffer. You go back and forth on the reasoning behind the plot, which is sending a group of men to save just one life. It really plays with your mind. A group of men are worth more than just one, right? But what about that one man's mother who already lost three of her four sons? There is no right answer in a situation like that. Someone has to suffer. And that's what happened in the war to so many real people. This movie is a great reminder to appreciate where we are now. There are people out there to this day who are still suffering because of this war, while we live our everyday lives. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone (maybe not the younger ones out there considering the gore) because it is a great portrayal of history."

","I have always enjoyed most of Spielbergs movies like E.T, goonies, the mind blowing Jurassic park and of course saving private Ryan. Never has a movie stirred such emotions in me of sadness and awe. From the moment the movie begins, so does the true horror of war itself. I've never been to war but this movie, I believe had given me a good idea of what a soldier in action goes through. The first 45 minutes left me feeling horrified and sick and so did the scene where the runner gets shot down then finished off in a barrage of bullets. It is a bloodthirsty flick but war is hell and this movie captures that. Tom Hanks performance is by far his best as an officer who suffers from a form of shell shock and as his job requires, has to hide his emotions from his troops even though the loss of his men to save 1 whose brothers have all fallen in the heat of battle cannot be justified. The finally also is horrific and Spielberg did an amazing job capturing the horror of war. 1 of the best films and cinematic experiences I have ever seen. 10 out of 10 for me. Spielberg is the greatest director of all time. A must see to teach us why we must be reluctant to go to war. War horse also is the best depiction of the great war I've seen too.

"russok044","10","2","4","12 February 2013"," Mystified by the bad reviews
","All the bad reviews on here have led me to the conclusion that people feel smarter by trashing critically-acclaimed and Oscar winning films like this one. This is one of, if not the, greatest war movies ever made. The opening 20 minutes is one of the most harrowing battle scenes ever filmed, and in itself debunks the theory that this is a pro-war movie. Anyone who wants to go to war after seeing the opening scene of this film is crazy. This film is poignant and heartbreaking, particularly Vin Diesel and Private Mellish's deaths, and the idea that this film is pro-war in any way is ridiculous. A bunch of reviewers on here criticize the film for only showing the American perspective on D-Day: hate to break it to you guys, but this is a film about a squad of American soldiers who go on a mission to find an American paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in combat. Putting another country's perspective in this film would have been ridiculous and wouldn't have fit in with the rest of the film. As for the other arguments against the film, which are basically a bunch of nit picky details like the type of rifle they are carrying or an insignia on someone's uniform or some other ridiculous historical detail that really has no effect on the film at all, this movie never pretends to be a documentary, and shouldn't be taken as one. Some of these people cite The Paths of Glory or The Longest Day as examples of great war films, and don't get me wrong, I loved both movies, but I could write a whole list on their historical inaccuracies. Films like this one should not be analyzed as documentaries, but should be taken for what they are-excellent, well-filmed, well-acted, harrowing, and heartbreaking films that bring the brutality and horror of war into our lives."

Every mission, every detail, the thought process of each character, their personalities, makes this movie about as true to life as a movie can get. It is an epic piece of work and kudos to all the actors in this picture that bring this film to life.

"classicsoncall","10","2","4","27 August 2011"," ""Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. Our world has taken a turn for the surreal"".
","I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? <br/><br/>Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.<br/><br/>This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.<br/><br/>So for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time."

","To call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement. What Spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making. This is emotional, unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there. <br/><br/>Now is this the most original story ever told? No. The storm of Normandy has been shown before. The story has been told before. (This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)<br/><br/>However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most realistic battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!<br/><br/>Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there. (Some could not finish watching the scene) So if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie. See this! It centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world. To be clear though, this movie is not just about that war. The story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a man.<br/><br/>OK, how about the rest of the movie? The searching and hopefully the rescue of Private Ryan? Excellent! You will be interested and want to know what happens. A great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end. Oh and Mr. Spielberg does a fantastic job in bookending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all together.<br/><br/>I original saw this with my dad on it's original release in theaters. After the movie I asked him what he thought. He literally could not speak for like twenty minutes. Watched it again just recently with my girlfriend. Reaction was pretty much the same. Nothing to say for a bit. This movie leaves an impression and does what many a movie does not. You walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie.

"johnnyboyz","10","2","4","1 February 2010"," Terrifying and emotionally draining piece which places the viewer at the forefront of chaos, angst and deliberation in 1944 France.
","Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's anti-thesis to the action movie, indeed the blockbuster ideology. From the man who made his name, indeed inspired a entire movement if you'd like to label the blockbuster so, in making 1975's Jaws; a film that skipped along the boundaries of comedy, horror and sheer action driven spectacle, comes a film that combines the latter two of those three and approaches them from a completely different angle. Whilst Spielberg-helmed; starring functional, friendly, relaxed and 'accessable' lead Tom Hanks; released in the summer month of July in America, but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film, Saving Private Ryan is anything but the usual summertime-Spielberg-Hanks led flick, instead turning a entire 'promise' into a thing of pure terror. In a summer that saw Deep Impact, Armeggeddon and Godzilla released in close proximity, Saving Private Ryan must have been quite the jolt.<br/><br/>People have written in the past about the degrees of sentimentality and the nuisance to do with the unreliable narrator. I think it's impossible to look, or even think, back to the times of The Second World War without a sense of sentimentality. The notes that accompany the DVD state that Spielberg attempted to get across that orally guided sense of the father telling the child, ie; his father informing him of the horrors of the war. Such an approach, to some, might sound a little convention, indeed like a cliché, or something that contains a degree of sentimentality. Essentially, this is exactly what Spielberg does in Saving Private Ryan; he doesn't trivialise in rendering it TV movie of the week built around some harsh battle scenes, he delivers on a true-to-life narrative as told through the perspective of someone who wasn't there but is aware of the horrors, much in the way anybody born post WWII might attempt to re-imagine what it must have been like to fight under certain conditions.<br/><br/>The film is, in fact, delivered by way of a flashback – a delving into the past a specific soldier does in order so that we may relive what occurred over the space of half a dozen or so days, echoing Spielberg's own relation to the war stories of old by way of his father. The film is about unity; teamwork and the risk of sacrifice those undertake for individuals they are yet to meet, for the platoon in Saving Private Ryan it is an individual they know is out there but in the grander scale of things, it is for people spanning a number of generations across a number of nations they will certainly never encounter.<br/><br/>Following the flashback, Spielberg provides us with a few seconds of calm before the storm in the form of waves lapping up on a beach. The place is northern France, the event is D-Day in 1944. Much has been written about the landings, going into them would only repeat what has been said but it's worth noting that the first lines anybody ever says once all the vomiting and praying in the landing crafts has stopped arrives in the form of a load of military directions and ramblings which the viewer might not properly hear, enhancing confusion and a sense of disorientation just prior to the drawn out sequence of carnage. With this, and as pointed out in a review in a publication, the casting of Hanks as Captain John Miller gives the audience something to map onto amidst the chaos, as actors that do not carry similar weight to Hanks are either blown apart around him or placed in this Hellish cauldron. However, years later the likes of Pepper; Burns and Diesel have since established themselves as names and face thus threatening to dampen the intended purpose of anonymity Spielberg meant. Viewing it recently, I do not feel any of the impact is particularly lost.<br/><br/>Their eventual mission to seek out the Private Ryan of the title, a certain Matt Damon, who's located somewhere pretty deep within northern France; deep enough so that the march there will last half a dozen or so days march for the troops. Miller's platoon is made up of the guys that survived with him on the beaches of D-Day plus a certain Private by name of Upham, a trilingual troop played by Jeremy Davies who does his usual scrawny; softly spoken; seemingly untrustworthy and somewhat ill-at-ease-with-everyone-else act which was fresher back then than it is now. Miller's professionalism is only enforced by talk of a highly dangerous, off screen mission he undertook; one that saw him and his crew knock out a number of German anti-air craft guns. Dennis Farina's somewhat impressed and therefore transfixed gaze locks onto a talking Miller, as the emphasis in his character's superiority in military activity is encored. He and his platoon's journey is punctuated by interactions with French families; German snipers; machine gun nests and conflicts with each other as they go in search.<br/><br/>To say the film concludes with an almighty shoot-out between two sides in a bombed out and long since deserted French town, would be grossly misleading. In a sense, an action film might very well 'build' to an explosive and dramatic set piece but while Saving Private Ryan might conform to a series of heroic actions, followed by a twist in fate just as a fatal blow is about to be struck to whom we think is the 'lead', the lingering feeling is on the sense of loss more-so spectacle. One might argue the sequence comes across as more stark and more frightening than the opening beach landings simply because of the presence of the reason the platoon are even there; the fear of loss of life comes across as more prominent in a film that has thus far displayed a massive amount of loss. The film is a towering achievement, and one of the better films out of the decade that-was the 1990s."

","Saving Private Ryan rekindled an interest in the media about the Second World War, with the TV Series Band of Brothers, films ranging from the Great Raid to Enemy at the Gate to Pearl Harbor and computer games like the Medal of Honour and Call of Duty series. Saving Private Ryan is also noted for its use of realistic of violence and war combat, which has continued into further films and television programmes.<br/><br/>Set during the early days of the invasion of Europe by the Allied troops, a platoon of American soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned to find Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), an soldier who 3 brothers are killed in action. He has a ticket home. The mission sounds simple enough, but Ryan was in the 101th Airborne and dropped behind enemy lines before D-Day. Miller's Platoon has to go through enemy territory to find one man. The platoon who are assigned with Miller start to question the mission, especially when their men start dying.<br/><br/>The war scene, especially the D-Day scene are some of the best committed to film. It shows that war was very brutal, very bloody, confusing and the need for good tactics and good men. The film makes an effort to show a mixed picture, that the Germans were a soldiers, not monsters or all Nazis, whilst some Americans can be arrogant and even committed war crimes, like killing surrendering soldiers. It is so much better compared to a one-dimensional film like Braveheart. Spielberg is a great director, and avoids shooting the film in a ordinary way. He uses a hand-held style, and his cinematographer Janusz Kamiński films in a washed out look, giving the film a documentary, gritty feel. He knows how to make a film visually wonderful. They is an excellent cast, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon in leading roles, whilst even small roles were filled by established actors like Ted Danson and Paul Giamatti. Tom Hanks is the most well developed character, making you care about what happens to him and what drives him throughout the film. Many of the characters have backstorys like Private Ryan or character traits like the arrogant Jew or the sniper who was a committed Catholic.<br/><br/>There are however problems with this film. The script and story are weak. They are character clichés like the wimp, the ultra good officer who is committed to the mission, the brave soldier, etc.... On the other side of the coin some characters simply disappeared off the screen because you couldn't care about them. The story is also ridiculous; could you really picture the American military risking a whole platoon to save one man, a private, a farm boy from Iowa? Especially with him being in the middle of enemy territory and not knowing where he was, not fighting on the frontline. It's hard to suspend your disbelief. The film is also a normal piece of American Patriotism, showing how great their were. I know it's an American story, but it ignores some of the darker elements which other writers and directors would have focused on, mainly non-American filmmakers. They was no mention of the British or Canadian forces fighting, and even Robert Rodat writes a line which pretty much an attack on Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, a British war hero. Rodat must have some issues with the British because he also wrote the really awful The Patriot. Saving Private Ryan also has the same problem that Gladiator has, that it's opening is so good that nothing else in the film can compare to it.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a example of a director improving on the script he is given. Worth watching, a good Oscar win for Spielberg, but The Thin Red Line should have won Best Picture in 1998, over Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love."

","This film grips you from the very beginning and holds you spellbound through the entire movie--it has all the elements of an endearing classic that both informs and entertains. In reading the other reviews it is absolutely amazing that anyone would rate this movie below 7 or 8 stars. It seems the detractors fall generally into two camps--those that do not like the fact that the German soldiers were not shown in the same sympathetic manner as the Americans and those with such virulent anti-American or anti-war sentiments that they are simply incapable of forming an objective, rational, and honest opinion. In other words, their negative reviews of the movie are an expression of their political/ideological views, not their honest assessment of the quality of this movie, which does a disservice to this movie and to those they may dissuade from seeing this film. So don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this movie--it is truly one of the best movies ever made of any genre. If you are a fan of great film making, you will love this movie--if you are virulently anti-war or anti-American, this film is not for you."

","Now I cannot speak from any sort of personal experience,not militarily nor age-wise(my late maternal grandfather actually was in the European theater of command during WWII,and missed being involved in D-day by not that much,if I'm to understand correctly),so I would and could not dispense with any of the critiques that I've read here regarding how true or authentic the military/war element of the film was(and there were about equal parts of both those who thought this show was the best/very accurate and those who thought this wasn't even close/completely inaccurate,from what I was able to divine off the long rolls of comments). So I can only review this the way someone in my position can:namely,from how it directly affected me.<br/><br/>And for that,this film is completely and totally spot-on.<br/><br/>The possibly fictionalized account of an Army expeditionary unit's dispatch to find the lone surviving brother of five servicemen who were killed in action because of an obscure rule in the military that pertains to surviving siblings during war. The unit is led by quiet,dignified schoolteacher Captain John Miller(Tom Hanks,who really is a study in steady perseverance here)and the troops are predominantly young(i.e. 19 to 27 year old men)and prone to the usual emotional swings that occur amongst young men who are both brave but bewildered,uncertain of the mission and colored by their own personas.<br/><br/>To say that this movie is manipulative would be an understatement,but then,how else does director Steven Spielberg roll? From the highly personal camera-work,simple yet emotive dialog and--last but not least--the grinding,crunching,raw,explosive sound,visual and special effects(and the editing that went with it!),this movie will most certainly draw a reaction out of you the viewer,whether positive(largely what I felt)or negative. To me,if a movie cannot be able to elicit a reaction,physical,emotional or both,then it really cannot be considered a potent film. Conversely,if it can create ANY reaction,then kudos to the makers. This film had me feeling a whole range of emotions through its run(much of it anger and low,grinding fear).<br/><br/>I'm sure there are equal arguments as to the legitimacy of a military,historical or cultural film that Saving Private Ryan either is or isn't. Either way,this movie creates a powerful,raw and memorable feel that does not abate with watchings. Not a favorite,I suppose,but an excellent work of cinema. 9.5 out of 10"

","I am only 12 years old and yet I think i felt the true meaning of this film-making masterpiece. First of all, the opening 24 minutes is the most gruesome, bloody, and most realistic war-scene I have ever seen. It makes me feel as if I was in one of those boats getting ready to fight for my life. The movie just gets better as it moves on. I grow attached to every single one of the characters and as i see them dropping one by one i can't help but to shed a tear. You might think just because I'm 12 that i like just the bloody battle scenes. But I always ponder the question ""Is it right to save one man's life if it costs' you 5?"" I simply do not know. Overall I believe that this is the by far the greatest war-movie of all time. The greatest overall movie might be pushing it a little but it is definitely one of my favorites. I've seen the movie about 6 times and after each and every time i see it about 5-6 weeks later I'm still thinking about it(especially the opening scene). This movie is simply incredible and if you have never seen it then what are you waiting for? This is definitely one of the greatest experiences you'll ever have after watching a movie."

The first 25-minutes are so edge-of-your-seat material, that it's no wonder the majority of networks air this with little, if any, commercial interruption. This is one insane and intense film.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is great, as well as Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Spielberg's direction is so astounding, it's what makes this what is is: amazing. There's a t-o-n of gore and blood. The first 25-minutes as aforementioned are so gruesome, I'm surprised I didn't puke. Yet, Spielberg knows when we've seen enough, and when all goes quiet, it's almost like it just happened... in your very own living room.<br/><br/>The music by John Williams is beautiful and haunting. From the hymn for the fallen to some of the battle cues, it's a very good score.<br/><br/>The story is inspiring and terrifying, making it all the more real.<br/><br/>Overall, Saving Private Ryan will absolutely shake you to the core in terms of seeing the war and feeling like you're in the thick of it. I highly recommend this to anyone with strong stomachs, because of it's epic story and ""surreal"" realism, it makes for a one-of-a-kind experience seldom seen in the majority of films today."

Hanks hasn't portrayed anyone quite as captivating since his 1994 Oscar winning success in Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>The visual concept is staggering and undeniably excels anything in the war genre. Praise to Spielburg though for giving audiences a tragic look inside to the horrors of war and its various other hellish topics.<br/><br/>Cudoes to Saving Private Ryan's raw beauty and magnificence in re-creating the bloodiness and nightmarish abyss that was war.

"a05102267","9","2","4","24 July 2008"," Steven Spielberg has brought us another masterpiece
","Everything that you could have heard about ""Saving Private Ryan"" is true.<br/><br/>You may have heard about the opening battle footage. It's a little over twenty minutes long, and it's some of the most violent footage ever put to film. To be honest with you, I expected worse, but it's not so much the violence as much as the horror of it all. It's just sickening.(And I say that as a compliment)<br/><br/>When the actual search for ""Private Ryan"" happens, you're introduced to the characters and their personalities. They're all very distinct. Some think that casting Tom Hanks as the captain was a bad choice, but I disagree. He's perfect. The rest of the cast is just as good. It features great actors that include Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi (I related to his character the most), Matt Damon, and a surprisingly good performance by actor/filmmaker, Ed Burns. The only actor I had a problem with was Jeremy Davies as the interpreter. I've seen Davies in several other movies (""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Going All the Way"") and he always plays the same annoying wuss character (picture Henry Thomas, but much skinnier and more geeky-looking). I dunno, maybe I'm just nit-picking. It WAS kinda necessary for the character. By the way, there's an interesting bit part played by a major TV celebrity. I don't know why he's in this movie, but it was an unexpected surprise.<br/><br/>The script was written by Robert Rodat (who also wrote ""Fly Away Home"" and ""Tall Tale"") and had uncredited rewrites from Scott Frank (wrote ""Dead Again"" and adapted ""Get Shorty"" and the great ""Out of Sight"") and Frank Darabont (wrote the 1994 version of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street III,"" and ""The Fly II,"" but he's known best for writing and directing ""The Shawshank Redemption""), and though it's not a perfect script, it's a damn good one. My biggest problem was the bookend parts set in the present. Unnecessary, I thought.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is strange in that he'll make mindless movie blockbusters that are well-directed, but lack any substance, and then he'll turn around and make ""The Color Purple,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" It almost seems as though he makes some movies just to fill his pockets, and then once his pockets are filled enough, he'll do something from the heart. Steven Spielberg truly is a genius filmmaker, and with as much acclaim as he gets now, he still seems underrated. I just can't believe that ""Shakespeare In Love"" got the Academy Award of best movie when this one was clearly a better film in every aspect. What a shame."
"widescreenguy","10","2","4","9 July 2008"," realism quotient right off the scale
","thats right.<br/><br/>many nitpickers claim the film is not realistic; clearly they have no experience with the countless detours, ad hoc actions, revised plans, FUBAR situations and the like that is part and parcel in the ebb and flow of combat.<br/><br/>the business about Capt Miller's comment about 'the Germans having to change the barrel of their machine gun and this is the chance to attack' in the radar station scene is nitpicked by some based on their knowledge of German weaponry.<br/><br/>well big fcukin deal, like no soldier ever made a mistake assessing the enemy's armaments? the scene simply ADDS to the realism, not subtracts from it.<br/><br/>This is a benchmark war film which I have seen probably more than a dozen times. I have the D-Day commemorative version. Steven Spielberg really scooped the attention when it was released. And the opening scenes, good god, to have run through an unending hail of bullets and mortar shells, pinned down on a narrow strip of beach, nowhere to turn, death everywhere, what to do? feel free to view the documentary 'World at War' where they discuss the invasion in the episode 'Morning'. what happened, when the situation came to light with the commanders on board the battleships off shore that had escorted the troop carriers, after viewing with binoculars and hearing the radio reports, these commanders TOTALLY AGAINST STANDING ORDERS took it upon themselves to move in closer within range of the German batteries, and start dishing out some ordnance to the same German defenders in order to relieve the situation of the troops pinned down.<br/><br/>you got that? THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO HELP OUT THEIR COMRADES ON THE BEACH.<br/><br/>this is the whole story line of the film; self sacrifice towards a common goal. the details of which are merely that: 'filling in the canvas'.<br/><br/>I'm just glad these men did such a good job 60+ years ago that my generation didn't have to repeat it somewhere else.<br/><br/>as far as this being American 'propaganda', well feel free to write a script and produce your own work on the same topic. The fact is Omaha Beach, the 101st, bitching about Monty's hesitancy and numerous miscalculations are all part of the widely known history.<br/><br/>therefore the realism, which I look for, of this film (as opposed to actual specific historical events) is right off the scale. I don't care if its a sci-fi, comedy, western, or drama, I have to see continuous PLAUSIBILITY in what I'm spending my time and money on.<br/><br/>this film, SPR, has that in abundance."
"supermonkey12","10","2","4","4 July 2008"," A different kind of movie.
","I got into this movie expecting a high budget, unreal, action adventure. Boy was I wrong. As I watched the soldiers storm Omaha beach, I was amazed at how good the action was. But, as I continued to watch the action, I started to realize that there was much more to it. Amidst all the chaos, plain as day, were the dying soldier's cries for their mothers, the explosions full of severed limbs and torsos, and the general chaos caused by the death and destruction. And then it hit me, this must be what the war was really like. And it wasn't good.<br/><br/>Asides from the message of the movie, the characters were AMAZING. Tom Hanks, Adam Goldberg, Matt Damon- I have to say that I think these are the best performances of their careers. They were just so real... I really felt for these guys.<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for a movie full of the ra ta tas of machine guns, high budget explosions, and plenty of action, this movie is for you. But if you are not ready to experience war like it really is, then maybe you should pick a different DVD at the rental store. But, if your minds and your stomachs are ready for this film, then brace yourself for the best movie of all time."

Also, when you watch the battle scenes, it makes any other war movie battle look completely lame. I know that veterans say that if you haven't seen real combat, then you just haven't, and I do respect that. It is true. However, when you talk about combat in the movies, Saving Private Ryan is as close as you can come.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, once again displaying his talent, plays the roll of Captain John H.

"HelloTexas11","9","2","4","22 February 2008"," a fresh perspective
","'Saving Private Ryan' is Steven Spielberg's brave attempt to redefine the conventional war film, and specifically World War II films. More than that even, it's an attempt to explain the conflict itself to a generation that never knew it firsthand. Spielberg proceeds from the assumption that baby boomers are hardwired to doubt their country's motives in any war and 'Saving Private Ryan' seems to be his way of saying there was at least one war the U.S. fought where it was clearly and completely in the right. Whether he succeeded is something that's difficult to gauge. In many ways, 'Saving Private Ryan' is your standard-issue combat flick, albeit a very well-made one. Some scenes would be almost interchangeable with those from any number of movies where G.I.'s trudge across Europe and engage the Germans at various points in heated battles. But there's something else at work here that none of those earlier films put across in quite the same manner. At times, it's almost intangible. There is a feeling of the here and now about the film, that we are really living and experiencing what the soldiers did. Nothing puts this across more vividly than the opening scene. After a brief prologue in a present-day French cemetery, the scene shifts to the bloodiest day of the war, when the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches. I think it is fair to say that there has never been a more realistic depiction of what the first few army units faced in those first awful hours, the chaos, the death, the wholesale slaughter really of thousands of young men trying to gain a foothold on the beaches there. I remember reading about an early screening of 'Ryan' for WW2 veterans; one was asked about this scene, and the old man replied grimly and succinctly, ""That's pretty much how it was."" Though nothing in the rest of the film is quite as brutally graphic, the scene sets the stage for what is to follow. We are reminded that the vast majority of Americans were not professional soldiers; they were ordinary people lifted from ordinary jobs to fight in the most consequential armed conflict in their country's history, which makes their sacrifices and their courage that much more profound and poignant. The story, which can easily be seen as an allegory, has to do with a group of four brothers, all soldiers serving in the war. And all have been killed in action, except one, the Private Ryan of the title. It is decided that this family has sacrificed more than its share, and so a special army squad is dispatched to find Ryan and send him home. Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the everyman, generically-named Capt. Miller, the schoolteacher turned combat soldier. His dying words to Private Ryan, ""Earn this. Earn it!"" are the message he (and Spielberg) hoped the following generation would take to heart. Again, it's hard to know whether or not that generation has."

","September 18, 1998 (The day i saw this movie) <br/><br/>Throughout the years,there have been war movies that brought back horrendous memories to veterans who fought in war; to movie buffs it showed how war can tear up an individual or showed why it was worth fighting for. In Steven Spielberg's war drama, it is not a division between what's good and bad, but to show homage to those who fought in the biggest war of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of the prologue is one of the most gruesome battle scenes I've ever watched on screen. We see the boats boarding up soldiers as they are heading to the murky beaches of Normandy June 6, 1942, which will be remember to most people as the worst battle in history. Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, who leads his squad in the terror battle and tries to find his team into the breach as hundreds of soldiers die. As realistic as it is, we see the carnage of soldiers getting ripped in pieces, crying for their mothers, and in one scene we see a man looking for his amputated arm.<br/><br/>After the grizzly attack on the beach, Miller has been ordered another mission; a manhunt for the lost of one soldier after losing three of his brothers at Normandy, and throughout the film we get to see some of the most realistic battles since ""Platoon,"" where the violence and gore plays an important part of the realism; but also get a chance to see to recognize the characters during the non-violent parts which reminded audiences members of how these soldiers were like a family.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best war flicks I have ever seen on the screen.

"bk-87668","7","2","4","2 December 2007"," Technically awesome, the rest... almost there
","An interesting feature of Steven Spielberg, probably the most reliable hit maker outside the Michael Bay realm of idiocy, is that he often seems very clumsy with things that are the furthest away from the technical aspect of his films. There's often a quality of naiveté that simply would make the film more interesting and adult if it just was cut.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan has one such annoyance. And that is a rather common one; claiming a war as one side's story. In Private Ryan, this would be the bookend scenes which serve no purpose to the story, but to cram the supposed message down the viewer's throat. Every country has had its wars, it is insulting to millions to claim the story of human suffering in war is exclusive to one person, one side or one war. Also, Schindler's List has similar scenes that begin and end the film, although they are not as bad.<br/><br/>While everything in Private Ryan is technically as good as it will ever get, the story and the characters seem out of place. The only properly fleshed out characters are Hank's mysterious captain and Davies' inexperienced clerk that obviously serves as the characters most people can relate to. The rest of the characters aren't that memorable if you think of them as personalities, not ranks. And, Tom Sizemore plays a sergeant here, the believability coming from the fact he's played the same role about a zillion times. There are a few interesting cameos with Ted Danson and Dennis Farina.<br/><br/>The story, while a typical ""road movie with soldiers"" at least is not as standard as a retelling of a battle, is nowhere near Apocalypse Now or other movies treating soldiers as passers by. It's near to a typical Hollywood version of a war mission and something you could imagine John Wayne doing. This obviously was the purpose, making an old fashioned war movie, but it clashes with the realistic battle scenes.<br/><br/>The battle scenes. They simultaneously make battle look like something horrible, something you want to be a part of and actually instantly create a bunch of clichés. Details such as the exaggerated sound of a M1 carbine running out of ammo (a very common detail if you watch a WW2 movie made after this OR even better - play a WW2 video game), the scene in which someone is talking and suddenly is hit to the head, the scene in which the viewer (situated in the middle of the fighting) can't hear anything because of shell shock. Whoa.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this movie proves the quote: you can't make an anti-war movie and not make war look even more sexy in the end.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Saving Private Ryan is a bad movie. I'm just saying a lot of its flaws are glossed over thanks to the execution and respect to war veterans (who I of course respect as well, not depending of the side). Essentially, a similar film with better characters, similar technical awesomeness and fact instead of fairytale is the miniseries Band of Brothers, another project from Hanks and Spielberg."

Really amazing and so simple that you can't understand how nobody else has got that before, but I guess that is what makes Spielberg such a great director.<br/><br/>The reality in this film is amazing, you can feel the blood and the sweat and the screams. You feel like fighting yourself. But the realism isn't perfect. The camera movements etc. makes for a wonderfully looking and realistic film but the fighting scenes in the end.. come on. The Tiger tank was it's time most deadly killing machine ever invented, it was impenetrable. How on earth you destroy that with a sticky bomb. And how can you run freely around it, it had MGs at almost every side.<br/><br/>Anyway that is a minor flaw because these little unrealistic things just build up the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Spielberg, one of our time's greatest director, shows once again his only weakness.. sentimentality. American banners everywhere, no signs of UK, Canadian or any other county's soldiers. That overly sentimental bs popped up to my eyes only a couple of times though so it's not a real problem.<br/><br/>Overall the film is superb and keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end, the almost complete reality, the characters... nice movie.<br/><br/>The last thing Hankses character says left me thinking: ""earn this"".

It is one of the best movie of the 90's and it's possibly Hank's best performance of his career.<br/><br/>To not watch this and enjoy would be a tragedy and I'd have to question that person as to why they didn't enjoy it. It's simply too great to not entertain you. Recommended."

","This movie is renowned for its realistic portrayal of the D-Day assault on German occupied France. This film is unlike any other war movie you will ever see.<br/><br/>Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) survives the landings on Omaha beach but then has an even greater challenge thrust upon him. Three of the four Ryan brothers are killed within days of each other and the U.S. army chief of staff, General George C. Marshall decides that every effort must be made to return the fourth brother (Matt Damon) home to the broken hearted mother. Unfortunately he was parachuted behind enemy lines and no one knows where he is. Captain Miller is ordered to lead a team to rescue him. He faces all the challenges of a 'behind enemy lines' mission along with the inevitable question of why his men must risk all their lives for just one private. Sit back, turn off the mobile and allow yourself to be taken on a stunning visual spectacle. You are thrust face first into the horrifying drama of the D-Day landings and witness dramatic close quarter conflict. But this is more than a war story. The human characteristics of leadership, bravery, fear, grief, decency and much more are all skillfully examined. The set is completely convincing even thought many of the scenes were shot outside France.<br/><br/>The film won five Oscars including the Directing and Cinematography categories but very unjustly lost to 'Shakespeare in Love' for best picture.<br/><br/>This movie is a true masterpiece of terror, chaos, blood, and courage.<br/><br/>It's safe to say Saving Private Ryan popularized a lot of the ""war techniques"" you've seen lately, and that the consequences of Saving Private Ryan's brutal portrayal of war will be felt for a long time coming.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan may not be as beautiful, lyrical, or complex as (for example) Malick's Thin Red Line, but it will certainly influence a lot of films that will come after it (more so than Malick's masterpiece) for the better. 9/10"

","Being a history genius, I have seen many war movies in my day, but none have really put it all out there as this movie did. Steven Speidberg didn't hold anything back in this movie, especially in the beginning scenes into the breach. This movie was made as a testament to the greatest generation that ever lived, and to the greatest army unit that ever lived, the 1st army rangers, to believe these men climbed up 100ft cliffs, with MG-42 machine gun fire pouring down on them, and all the time, all the Germans had to do was roll boulders down on theme, and cut their lines, but they still made it up the cliffs to destroy the MG Nests. No other movie shows so many bullets flying around and so much constant action going all around you in all angles, from people trying to find there very own body parts from the many that are lying around from other men, just the beginning 40 minutes of this movie will give you all you can really handle, because your thinking how many GI's can possibly survive just the invasion of the beaches. Not only that, but you feel so helpless for the GI's because if they don't take the beach, they are in a world of s*** because there is no where to retreat to, in this moment in history, the world came to suspenseful pause to watch which superpower was going to be the big boy on the block, wethere it was Germany's Fascism, or Americas Democracy. I am just tallking about the first 40 minutes, now its your job to see the whole movie, trust me, you will not be disappointed, I personally see this movie minimally, once every 3-4 weeks, and yes that bayonet seen with Pvt. Mellish is heart-breaking, the drama is classic, as you see Mellish breath slower, and slower, as that bayonet slides further and further into his heart and then he twitches less and less, and all the while his scared bastard comrade upham is hiding shi**** his pants off, man what a thrill ride this movie is, it is said to make grown men slightly break a tear, and for all you real WW2 fans go and invest in Medal of Honor: Airborne, it looks like the next generation in WW2 Combat, the realism and the graphics are unmatched."

In depth description of John Miller, the attitude and mannerisms of Melish, the emotions of loss and despair, and all of these other elements compiled and created the perfect opportunity for someone to witness those events, to be in that place at that time, and gave the chance for veterans or those affiliated with the war a chance to reflect.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was, is, and always will be one of the greatest movies ever made. Naysayers may site a shaky 'documentary' filming style as a bad reason, but this adds to the 'window' into these soldiers adventure. They may say that it contains a very cliché plot line, which may be true to some degree, but the film makers, actors, and writers alike gave it an unforgettable element that made it captivating. These are a few things among many negative accusations made but let me assure you that they are dead wrong. DEAD wrong. This movie is not deserving of the title of 'one of the best war movies'.

","The American army are about to land at the Omaha beach in France. The moment they land its a blood soaked fight to take the beach. In this fight is Captain Miller and his troop of men. After the Omaha assault, Miller is given a mission to find a man and take him out from behind enemy lines. The man is Private James Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and to bereave his mother the American Army want him home. Ryan's location is unknown as his paratroop were miss dropped. Miller and his troop now have to go behind enemy lines to find Ryan, that is if he's still alive.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding war drama from master director Steven Spielberg. The opening beach scene is so brutally violent and harshly real, yet it honestly conveys the horror of the war. This was the first movie I saw that violent, but accurately, portrayed the violent nature of war and the emotions of the soldiers. You are placed right into the battle; with people being dismembered and shot apart. The final fight at the bridge crossing is the most intense battle of the film. It doesn't have the sheer unrelenting violence of the opening battle, but it is so emotionally charged.<br/><br/>Though the violence is confronting, but there is so much drama and character depth behind the violence. All the people of Millers troop are three dimensional, you can emotionally attach to them. They all are bonded too, you can see their comradeship between them. There is also that naivety to them; they will follow their captain not just on orders but they trust him without question. Captain Miller has so much depth to him. You don't find a lot about him, yet you can tell there is much anguish and longing to leave in his face.<br/><br/>Spielberg has taken a more head first look into the second world war. Shinder's List was about the men behind the scenes and the politics, while in Saving Private Ryan we are taken to the view of the soldier. Spielberg's direction is flawless, getting you right into the battle and evoking so much emotion from all the actors. The acting is also flawless. Tom Hanks gives one the his best performances ever, he was brilliant. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies all bring great performances as the mix matched group of people, their friendship for all of them was so believable. Matt Damon though only appearing towards the end as Private Ryan does a great job also.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, it is a masterpiece of cinema."

","What Steven Spielberg has done with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of World War II and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing -- a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death. The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb."

Nor would they send squadrons out to retrieve men whose blood has been slaughtered.<br/><br/>But It is not the plot that drives a person to see a movie of deeply realistic and harrowing violence. A person watches this movie to go back in time. Many people (thankfully) will never have to fight in wars, and therefore would never know the true meaning of terror.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is said to have been the most accurate war picture ever to be created.

","Saving Private Ryan is a great WWII movie. It was one of the first movies in an ever-growing ultra-realistic WWII accounts. Being an avid WWII history buff, SPR gives me an insight into what it was like to be on the beach at Normandy. Hanks and Spielberg really show their concern for detail in SPR and their later work, Band of Brothers. I would have given the movie a 10 if is wasn't for the poor performance of Matt Damon. Damon comes off as a whiny little snot nose. The director should have caught this and worked it out as it is very distracting. Some people, especially of late, have said this film is too graphic to show on TV. However, I really feel this is a film that does not make gratuitous (sorry for the spelling) use of graphic images. That is what it looked like and it should be shown like that. Every network shows the warning before they air the movie and so we should all be smart enough that if it's too much, FLIP THE CHANNEL! Don't complain that it was too graphic when you were warned. A movie as realistic as this is going to be graphic which adds to the impact it makes. Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it."
"BigBadaBruce","8","2","4","10 April 2005"," ""Except this time the mission is a man.""
","That and ""FUBAR: Fucked Up Beyond All Repair"" are two great lines from this movie. The writing is both believable and nowhere near approaching any worry of clichés polluting the movie. The direction is superb, probably what started out the usage of hand-held cameras which have now been way overused in movies since then. Steven Spielberg really brought his A-Game to this one. Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham was good in this movie as he was able to portray cowardice in a war movie, which people rarely do and did it very well. Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Wade almost stole the show when he talks about how his mother would come home early just to see him and he would pretend to be asleep. This ties in to something later on. Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo seemed very much like a weak-link, only there to get killed. OK performance, but nothing really to write home about. Adam Goldberg as Private Mellish who i've only really seen otherwise in ""Friends"" as Chandler's roommate Eddie. Didn't really expect he would be all that good but he put in a great performance as the Jewish soldier and when he gets stabbed later on in the movie, heartstrings are pulled. Barry Pepper as Private Jackson has worked with Tom Hanks in both Saving Private Ryan and the magnificent ""The Green Mile"" and in both of those movies he has held his own against the star Tom Hanks and that is good work. Best when he goes to shoot someone with a rifle and says a couple of prayers. Edward Burns as Private Reiben isn't that bad, he does well and was touted as the Next Big Thing but hasn't fulfilled it yet. Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath is extremely good, definitely became a fan after this movie, both thumbs up. Matt Damon as Private Ryan is the macguffin of the movie and actually has a small part in the movie, less than an hour and becomes just as much a part of this movie as the others. And the star of the movie,Tom Hanks as Captain Miller does a magnificent job leading his men as they attempt to rescue a guy that they know nothing about that is thought of as just another number until Ryan tells Miller about the last night he and his brothers were together and Ryan became another human. That should explain the ending."
"alainenglish","7","2","4","30 March 2005"," Realistic depiction of wartime battle (Major spoilers ahead)
","Steven Spielberg made his second historical visit to the time of World War II (following up from his acclaimed Schindler's List) with this tale of a group of American soldiers, assigned to find Private Ryan, the sole survivor of a family of brothers killed in the war.<br/><br/>The group assigned to find him are world-weary Captain Miller (Tom Hanks); his right-hand man Sergeant Hovarth (Tom Sizemore); sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper); wise-guy Jew Mellish (Adam Goldberg) and translater Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), a bookish sort who's never been in battle...<br/><br/>This ensemble is played by a gallery of seasoned natural actors. Tom Hanks gives probably his most subtle performance as the besieged Miller, capturing the dizzy tiredness of a man who's sick of fighting. Sizemore is fine as Horvarth and Pepper, Goldberg and Davies are good in their various roles, giving their stock characters a distinctiveness and humanity. Matt Damon is given the pivotal role of Private Ryan, and plays him in much the same way as he played Will Hunting: a petulant, obnoxious moron who does not engender much sympathy.<br/><br/>The story, especially with reference to recent world events, feels like a US propaganda tool. Watching it, especially if you're uninformed of history, you'd think the Americans were the only ones fighting the Nazis. Other Allied Groups (the British, the French and the Russians) are never seen or referred to any way.<br/><br/>Where the film really succeeds is in its portrayal of wartime battle, surely the most realistic depiction committed to film. The film is shot in harsh realistic tones, with a lot of grey and brown. The grime, blood and gore of combat is far from overlooked.<br/><br/>The opening attack on Omaha Beach is excellent, and you can feel the frantic, fearful adrenaline of the soldiers as they rush into the line of fire and are randomly picked off one-by-one. The Germans who surrender in eventual defeat are randomly shot dead. The concluding battle to defend the bridge is even better as the characters we've come to know over two hours are decimated or worse than that changed by their ordeals. However it is not the guns and bomb battles that really convey the wasteful nature of war. It is the hand-to-hand combat scene Mellish has with a German soldier while Upham cowers on stairs. The German gets the upper hand and slowly forces Mellish's knife into his stomach, gently rocking him to sleep as he does so. This is what it ultimately boils down to: the savage nature of fighting, and possessing (or losing) the will to remain on your feet and stay alive. It is this reality, encapsulated in that scene, that the film captures so very well.<br/><br/>It will not stand up as a historical document (few war movies do) but in bringing the realities of wartime battle home to a mass audience, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a must-see."

","Before I begin my praise, let me just say that my grandfather served during WW2 (82nd airborne), my father served during Vietnam and I myself was in basic when the crap hit the fan in Iraq the first time around. To be honest, when I first saw the trailer for this film I had thought it was just some average Hollywood vehicle for Matt Damon and did not bother to see it in the movies. boy was I wrong. Like the Godfather, Goodfellas and JFK I can't help but watch this film each and every time it comes on cable. I never get sick of it. Just the invasion of Normandy Beach scene is worth the $3 rental charge. Bataan was good, Patton excellent but this has to be the best WW2 picture to date. Probably as close to realism as a movie can get - meaning when troops get shot they just don't fall down ala ""windtalkers"" - heads are blown off, body parts are everywhere and blood pours down like rain. It is always good to see a film of this quality come around every once in awhile to remind us not to forget those who have given their lives so that we could live ours. Now I know why my parents always taught me to respect my elders.....I also recommend ""Band of Brothers"" which was inspired by this film and also brilliantly done."

I hope there will be a tenth anniversary showing of this in theaters everywhere.

"adalmin","10","2","4","12 December 2004"," Best buddy movie ever (please, don't flame me).
","It's a buddy movie. I'd love to get on my soapbox and quote 'Henry V' at you all day long, but the bottom line is, this movie is all about buddies. I am not interested in molecularly accurate historical fact, so I wasn't bombed out by some small insignificant detail. Instead, I chose to feel how these men, these ordinary men, felt, and how they treated each other. I griped a bit about the lack of back-stories about some of the men (like Reiben or Jackson), but then I realized that they were just like you and me. We all know the story of you and me, and the story moves confidently because of that, without being bogged down by too many flashbacks to an earlier life that would have hurt the pacing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is really good because you get close-ups on their faces a lot of the time, and other close-ups on important things like hands and bleeding corpses and so on (unlike We Were Soldiers, which suffered from too many wide shots). As a result, you get to see every little crook in their expressions and every facial tic, so you feel for them much more. Focusing on Tom Hanks' hands was one of the most well-chosen shots ever, because it showed the vulnerability of the man without too much exposition or violence.<br/><br/>Additionally, let me say that all the actors put in their best performances for this movie. While Matt Damon was a little stiff, the rest were Oscar gold as they grimaced and swore through the movie, and there was never the 'politically correct' feeling that crippled other war movies. I'd like to highlight three awesome actors who deserve to be paid in nothing but solid Academy gold. Medic Wade, played by Giovanni 'Vonnie' Ribisi, Corporal Upham, played by Jeremy Davies, and of course the lead actor himself, Tom Hanks in the role of John Miller. All three delivered powerful (in Upham's case, powerfully pathetic) performances, and the final scene, you truly get to see the groundbreaking ability of Tom Hanks. Ribisi is notable because of one particular conversation that, if handled by a lesser actor, would be merely melodramatic.<br/><br/>One minor quibble is the beginning and ending scenes, which were completely out of step with the 'buddy buddy' feeling that permeated this movie. While the resolution does tie up all the loose ends, it just makes it so...flat. But it's a minor quibble nonetheless.<br/><br/>The plot itself is paced well, the actors are brilliant, the script is sharp and honest, the gore is substantiated and not overdone, so what's stopping you from watching this movie?"

Mothers cry, villains are smoten, good guys manage to fit in a final, heartfelt sentence or two before they croak and Tom Hanks manages to keep the same deadpan, ""this-is-the-demure-face-I-get-paid-$20million-a-movie-for"" expression on his face throughout the whole film. And as if to rub salt in the wound, there is the final, disgracefully jingoistic image of the film (you know the one I'm talking about).<br/><br/>I wouldn't be so outraged at this pro- American big-budget moneymaker if it didn't pretend to be an anti-war masterpiece."

You see, it can't be too difficult to generate emotions when the subject is war. And so does this movie, but not in any particularly original way. The most serious problem of this movie is its storyline, which you know from start to end if you read the following sentence: ""A soldier has lost his 3 brothers in the war, and so we must find him and save him to soothe his poor mother"".

","Poor old mister Speilberg. He was so upset when he did not win the Oscar for this movie. Well if he stop shoving the American way down everybodys neck then maybe he would have done better. Those flag waving scenes at the start and end were some of the worst bits of judgment when it came to directing that I have seen for many years. Next time he should watch ""The Thin Red Line"" to see how not to be all happy about the cruelty of war. He seems to think that just he stuck a graffic scene in near the start then it was a true and honest account of war. Get real . If he had just let go of the emotional cord it could have been so good."

","I don't think i want to ever watch this ""movie"" again. I wept and wept and wept when i saw it in theatre. I don't think i can take it all in again. Too emotional. Too real. Giovanni Ribisi and Barry Pepper are the best little-known actors around because i really thought they were their characters as i watched them on screen. Mr. Spielberg is a master of his domain (pardon the cheese). And Tom is simply amazing. I know it's very manipulative, but i didn't mind. It touched me in ways that very few other films did (Schindler's list was another). It's quite difficult to rate this film simply because it was as much a documentary as it was a film. Excellent work, regardless."

","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1999) **** Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, Paul Giamatti, Harve Parsnell, Bryan Cranston, David Wohl, Joerg Standler, Leland Orser, Harrison Young. Steven Spielberg's epic scopic vision set in WWII emerses you from its grueling opening 25 minutes of you-are-there depiction of the battle of Omaha Beach, Normandy during D-Day grippingly depicts hell on earth with all its graphic carnage that is relentless in its harrowing approach only underscores the unfolding plot of saving one man's life: a true metaphor never ringing hollow. Hanks gives another patented beautiful performance as Capt. John Miller, the dispatched leader of an Army Rangers squad to find Pvt. James Ryan (Damon), the sole living son after his three active duty siblings are killed during battle. Leading what would only be called a Hollywood stereotypical troop of outspoken, griping Brooklynite Mick (Burns); built-to-kill Italian grunt who's writing a letter home (Diesel); gospel-spouting Southern sharpshooter (Pepper, a nice stand-out to root for); the token walking-conscience Jew (Goldberg); the medic with a heart of gold (Ribisi also excellent); and the never-seen-combat interpreter/journalist (Davies, ditto). The script by Robert Rodat, who incorporates the true life accounts of The Fighting Sullivans, who all perished at war, makes compelling characters come to life and one gets the sense of really pulling for these men on a literal look for a 'needle in a stack of needles'. Like 'Schindler's List' the film stands on its own; only this case instead of saving hundreds of lives, the precious gift of one only permeates the universal message: all life is precious, even if it seems fruitless for 8 men to sacrifice for it. Hanks clearly gives the film its soul with an incredibly nuanced turn as a school teacher on the frontline clearly feeling the end may be near given his ever exapanding right hand tic and his only hope of seeing his beloved wife stateside again on a mission as desperate as the bigger picture ('winning the war'). Spielberg outdoes himself by making arguably the most realistic and least sensationalistic war film ever made and that's saying something with the polemics of 'Platoon' and surreal imagery of 'Apocalypse Now' still reverberating the echoes of The War Film. Brilliantly filmed by Spielberg collaborator/cinematographer wunderkind Janusz Kaminksi, the camera suitably goes terror-laden trenches with its documentarian air about it and slightly grainy, yet gorgeous photography. The violence may be the hardest element to stomach but in light of its subject matter it certainly is not inappropriate; one will never actually feel what living in a war is like unless having fought one. Spielberg and company should be proud for its authenticity. Also of note: Dale Dye, a longtime military film adviser/actor (he has a cameo during the planned rescue debriefing), prepped the actors with rigorous boot camp training that clearly pays off. Arguably one of the best films ever made and ultimately cheated of Best Picture (losing out to - oh PLEASE! - 'Shakespeare in Love') but scored 5 Academy Awards including the deserved Best Director for Spielberg, Kaminski for Best Cinematography, Editing, Sound Effects and Sound Effects Editing."
"lindes","2","2","4","26 November 1999"," Hated it.
","I gave it a vote as high as 3 merely because I believe that on technical merits alone, it was quite good.  However, as far as its entertainment value, it had none whatsoever for me.  I found that I could not see past the violence and gore...  It therefore, as far as I was concerned, had no plot, no character development, no nothing.  Many will disagree with those statements, but note that it's not that the script was without those things, or even that the actors necessarily did a bad job, but simply that the violence was just too strongly present.<br/><br/>I remember hearing that the director wanted this to be a movie that would ""show how war really was"".  Well, I've never been in a war, nor do I have any desire to fight.  If this movie gave me the feeling of being in a war, than if I am ever in one, I will become a mindless drone.  I will be almost completely without emotion, my biggest feeling will be one of disgust. I do not feel, though, that this movie has made me feel any differently about war...  I still think it's a horrible thing. The movies that have made me feel more strongly in that direction are those that have drawn me in to the characters lives, and then ripped those lives apart.  Just a few such examples are Platoon and Schindler's List on the serious side, and just as potently Good Morning Vietnam and Life is Beautiful on the comedy side."
"Jay-230","Null","2","4","4 November 1999"," The most gut-wrenching war movie I've ever seen.
","I've seen lot's of war movies in my 32 years of life, but this one is by far the only one that really, really affected me emotionally.  Watching this movie in the theatre, I had knots in my stomach.  The emotional impact of the film is something I had never experienced in such intensity.  The visuals were absolutely the best, music (while sometimes too melodramatic) was first rate, and the acting was mostly excellent.  I will admit that the movie did drag somewhat in the middle stages, but I'm glad it did because I needed the break!<br/><br/>Many people here have said that this movie was not an anti-war movie.  Far from the truth.  Spielberg has shown what war REALLY IS form a soldiers point of view (witrh some creative liberties thrown in to be sure).  He shows us war for what it is...bloody, ugly, violent in the extreme, and most of the time has us wondering ""why?""  If anyone wants to rush off to war after seeing this film, you have some issues to deal with.  And is there something wrong with Spielberg showing soldiers as ""heroes?""  I didn't see that very much anyway, especially at the beginning...I saw ""good-guy"" soldiers shooting surrendered Germans..not very heroic, but most likely true.  In my opinion, EVERY single person of that generation that went ""over there"" was a hero, ugly consequences aside.<br/><br/>And to the European crowd who cry about how ther were other nationalities that sacrificed and bled just as much as the ""noble Americans"" did...we know that.  Thats why they called it WORLD war 2.  This movie, however, focused on Omaha beach...the most heavily defended beach of D-Day.  Americans were there and they were slaughtered by the hundreds.  The Brits were over on another beach (Gold) with very little resistance, not the kind that the Americans experienced at Omaha in comparison.  This is not to take away the valiant sacrifices of your boys, but to put this mud-slinging in context here.  If you want a movie made about your sacrifices specifically, then make one.  But don't take away the fact that it was predominatly AMERICANS who bled and bled hard at Omaha.  The U.S. flag waving at the beginning and end?  Whats the big deal?  Ryan was an American soldier in the 101st airborne...what the heck ELSE was Spielgberg supposed to show??  The Union Jack??<br/><br/>At any rate, this movie should be ranked as one of the greatest war movies of this century.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  World War 2 is not all old black-and-white combat footage you see in documentaries.  It's sacrifice, death, struggling, and heroics and rolled into one and chances are there is someone in your family who was over there."
"glaucon","4","2","4","18 September 1999"," Shocking violence with a heavy dose of Speilberg oversentimentality.
","Oh, Hollywood!  Wherefore art thy head, Hollywood?  Could it be up thy ass?<br/><br/>The American public are suckers for movies with cool special effects and bitchin surround sound.  We love Saving Private Ryan for the same reason we love the Fourth of July.  When I first saw the movie, however, it was blasting from my larger than life 19 inch Sanyo Television set.  It was less than spectacular.<br/><br/>I have to admit the first few minutes were disturbingly real-looking and the buzz is that they are as close a depiction of the events of D-Day as we may ever realize on film.  For that, I give the film the weight of my praise. Without it, I would have voted 2 instead of a 4.  However, once the nightmarish slaughter was over and the film attempted to transform itself from megabudgeted explosion rally into something resembling a watchable war epic it flounders and flails, pathetically begging to be recognized.<br/><br/>""Look, we've got Tom Hanks and Matt Damon!"" it pouts. <br/><br/>
As if we didn't already know this, the film tries to tell us war is terrible.  As the story progresses, it seems to whine about it.<br/><br/>[Editors note: possible spoilers ahead]<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan attempts at points to explore the eccentricities of war. Some examples: The guy at the beginning of the movie who is nailed in the head and saved by his helmet takes off the helmet in wonderment and is immediately killed by another shot to the head.  The virgin-to-combat interpreter intellectual who begs for the life of the German prisoner citing the ""rules of war"" is the one who is ultimately responsible for most of their deaths.  As a recurring theme, the characters wonder why they sould risk the lives of their squadron to search for a man who is probably dead. To these I say, ""Please contrive your metaphors and heavy-handed imagery a little more Mr. Spielberg.  Maybe then I wont have to think at ALL during your movies.  Maybe you'll attain a level of patronizing that will remove the need for audiences to realize their own feelings.  Perhaps have someone stand at the front of the theatre with cue cards displaying the emotion you want the audience to experience in each scene. <br/><br/>The problem with taking Speilberg seriously about anything is of course his sticky-sweeet sentimentality.  Think E.T.  Think Cocoon.  Think the old folks home skit in Twilight Zone: The Movie.  The only place it has worked well is Schindler's List when, taking a moment outside himself, Spielberg created a powerful and moving drama.  I think this is largely due to Liam Neeson's solid performance. <br/><br/>I guarantee anyone with a developed sense of irony and individuality will after seeing this movie on the small screen take their accolades down a notch and stop praising Speilberg for being someone he isn't:  Frank Capra."

While Tom Hanks and the other actors do a reasonable job, there really isn't much meat for them to chew on, acting-wise.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater, my initial impression was ""wow, what a great movie."" But 20 minutes later, I realized that I was basing my opinion on the spectacular opening act, which really presented a realistic view of a large scale offensive.<br/><br/>But that's about all the movie has going for it. The first act leaves the audience stunned, and Spielberg uses the diversion to traipse through the rest of the movie with nary a thought of actually doing anything remotely original or interesting. At the end, I really didn't care if Ryan was saved or not."

","I was physically sickened when I witnessed the outcome of the Oscars this evening. When Steven Spielberg won Best Director honors, I was immensely pleased. I thought that Saving Private Ryan, the best film of 1998, and the best war film ever would surely take Best Picture honors. However, when Harrison Ford announced that Shakespeare in Love was Best Picture, I was on the verge of vomiting. While Shakespeare in Love may have been a decent film, it was resoundingly light, fluffy fare that didn't deserve to win Best Actress (that should have gone to Cate Blanchett), nor Best Picture.<br/><br/>Now that I've put Shakespeare in Love down enough (not entirely enough, but as much as possible right now), I want to write about the virtues of Saving Private Ryan. When I first saw this movie, I was amazed at every single element. Nothing was flawed in this film. The sound was amazing, as was the cinematography, the editing, the screenplay, the incredibly subdued performance of Tom Hanks, and the tremendous supporting cast. With the bookends of the two extraordinary battles, and the framing sequences that mean say so very much about the meaning and loss in war with so few words, Saving Private Ryan was obviously both the best film of 1998, and the best film about war ever filmed. Because of this, it will be remembered long after Shakespeare in Love goes the way of Tom Jones, The Life of Emile Zola, and all of those other forgettable Best Pictures that have come before. Steven Spielberg did a great service to WWII veterans, and the movie-going public with this film, and I hope that it's remembered for much longer than the light, meaningless Shakespeare in Love."

Because I think that this movie is the most psychologically disturbing and shocking movie I have ever seen in my life on this planet. I read the revues about the realism of the war scenes and thought what the hell it can't be any worse than ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", I'll give it a try... bad lapse of judgement.<br/><br/>The movie is three hours long, and after maybe the first ten minutes I wanted to leave... but the thought was that sooner or later this assault on the senses must let-up... you wait and you wait and you wait, and it doesn't! The realism, the emotions, the atmosphere of war, are all there for the three full hours. Even in the quiet, I can't use the word peaceful, moments of the movie there are still the oppressive feelings of the expectation that this certainly can not last... and it doesn't. These moments are played to the best effects of the greatest suspense movies.<br/><br/>My friend and I left the cinema after the final credits, we couldn't say anything....<br/><br/>I don't know whether to think of Mr. Spielberg as the greatest movie maker on the face of this planet... or the most irresponsible manufacturer of shock horror movies ever... but this is really not the correct way to put it because, shocking it was without a shadow of a doubt, but, horror it most definitely was not... If you watched all of the news, or documentaries, that were ever made about the scenes and effects of war it would not be one percent of the preparation required to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who sees this movie can not fail to be affected by it... consequently I tend to ere on the side of Mr Spielberg being a little irresponsible. War is a fact of human life, we can never escape some peoples urge to kill each other... but why show it so graphically on the large screen? At some point in the future, although I hope it never happens, some of our offspring will have to go-out and fight a war for us... why do we have to be shown what they will face?<br/><br/>As you can see... I was just a tad affected by this film. But what can I say, Mr Spielberg has outdone Mr Cameron yet again... although my feeling is that this movie will not get the recognition of ""Titanic"" for three reasons: there is no love story, there is no Di-caprio or Winslet... and America does not come out of this movie with the flag of rationality and reason flying high... more like at half mast with no breeze..."

After they took the beach he produced just another one of those average ""let 10 Americans beat the German army"" movies.<br/><br/>Why did it have to be a set-up like that: It was not just 200 infantrists + 10 tanks vs 20 GI's (of course none was black!), but the WaffenSS, the German elite troops, which had quite some fighting experience from Russia. It was the same plot than hundreds before. Let the idiots take the main road, we attack from the sides.<br/><br/>What would have happened: - the church tower would have been blown up before any Germans would have entered the town, as snipers are not that new - a small group of German soldiers would have checked the town - ...<br/><br/>So, I probably saw 2 movies on the same day, the best and the worst war movie of the year.

Too many movies today appear to demonstrate violence and carnage for its sake, but they invariably never made me feel for it the way that SPR did.<br/><br/>Some comments indicate that SPR is nationalistic. For me, it wasn't, and I'm an Asian. After watching the show, I felt saddened for the sheer numbers of lives wasted, and the hundreds of thousands of young soldiers- of ALL nationalities, not just Americans- for their tremendous sacrifice in the carnage.

It is not ! Soldiers are usually 18-20 year old boys, that get ripped apart by metal objects that kill, maim and cause terrible pain and anguish to their families. Even though this movie had it's Hollywood side, it succeeded in conveying the true nature of warfare - killing in every conceivable way. The ghastly scenes of spilled guts, and blown off limbs are accurate to a point that brings back vivid memories to those that treat wounded soldiers. I sincerely hope that this very explicit movie will cause people to understand the true horrors of war. As Marlon Brando uttered in Apocalypse now: ""The horror, the horror""."

","One of the best war films ever made, Saving Private Ryan is raw and shocking. Not only because of the gore scenes, but also because of the camera-work. Using a steadycam, combined with the absence of music soundtrack during the breathtaking battle scenes, gives a realistic and natural feel to the film. War films are hardly an opportunity for actors to showcase their talent, as more focus is set on the viewer's visual pleasure, but in this film time is taken to describe many of the characters.<br/><br/>Generally Saving Private Ryan is almost excellent and highly recommended.<br/><br/>My only objections are as regards the choice of Hanks for the main role (a role more suitable to Clooney or Crowe, if you ask me), and Damon's teeth; it's remarkable that a soldier that's been through hell for a long period of time could easily be the protagonist in a toothpaste ad. :o)<br/><br/>9"

"saugoof","2","2","4","22 December 2001"," No No No
","This movie starts and ends with shots of the American flag which points to one of its biggest problems. It purports to be an anti war film but this rubbish. While it may show the horrors of war in graphic detail, it ultimately is a celebration of militarism and heroism. Sure, heroism doesn't mean it's a pro-war movie but this movie goes beyond that. It's little surprise that the military are among the biggest fans of this movie. It may not celebrate war as a something good, but then, I can't think of any film that does outside of propaganda movies. If you want an anti war movie that shows heroism and mateship without celebrating the military, watch ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".<br/><br/>It does follow the standard American war movie characterisation rather faithfully. The Germans are universally evil, other nations are either non-existent, villains or locals who get saved by the Americans. Well in this case it is not that far from the truth, without the Americans the war would have gone on much longer than it did and the Germans were villains. But all these facts are distorted and stereotyped in a bad way here. For example, the only German with a sizeable speaking role turns out to be a total coward and backstabber who repays the Americans who saved his life by shooting them. <br/><br/>There are a couple of good points to the movie though. It does deviate somewhat from the standard US heroic movies in that it shows that Americans committed war crimes too, like shooting soldiers who had already surrendered. There are also some quite powerful scenes that are as good as any Spielberg has done. Best among them is the scene where a father in a French village tries to pass his daughter to one of the soldiers to save her. This single scene can probably verify this movie's claim to show the horrors of war somewhat. The landing in the Normandy is good, although somewhat overrated. I wasn't there so I can't comment on the realism but it felt like this was close to what it was really like. <br/><br/>Many people were upset that the movie only shows Americans fighting the Germans, but for once, this is not really a valid argument since the various armies fought in different areas and would have had very little contact amongst each other. <br/><br/>The movie really goes downhill towards the end though when the troop actually find Ryan. Instead of being glad to be out of this hell, he wants to stay there to help out his comrades. Very anti war indeed. This is where the movie turns totally Hollywood and looses all claim it may have had to a somewhat realistic portrayal. A number of people had died already in trying to find Ryan and his decision to stay there costs another couple of people their lifes yet the movie makes him a total hero for it. Steven Spielberg is capable of making great movies, this isn't one of them.<br/><br/>The acting is not particularly good and leaves out no cliches. Tom Hanks was actually nominated for an Academy Award for a role that Pee Wee Herman could have played better.<br/><br/>Finally, the salutation scene in the end is totally stomach churning."

","**Not known to many viewers: this is based on events that occured during WWII.  Try to find ""Into the Breach"" for more info.**<br/><br/>To say that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best war films ever made is an understatement.  It might possibly be THE best war film ever made; right up there with other films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""  (Yes, I noticed that I used only Nam films, but hey, they're some of the best around!)  And for today's Top 250 poll, it's at #27.  Even that is an understatement.  I believe that SPR should be in the Top 10, maybe even Top 5 best movies of all time.  That's all my opinion.  But here's a plot summary for this masterpiece.<br/><br/>James Ryan (Matt Damon) has lost his brothers in combat.  All three of them. So, the government sends Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) with a team of an additional seven to find him and ""get him the hell outta there.""  These people are as diversified as the New Yorker Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) to the Southern sniper Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper;) the timid translator, Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies) to the hardened veteran Sargent Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore.)  Along the way they encounter various goose chases and German troops, and suffer losses that affect thoughts of how important one Private is.<br/><br/>Every actor in this film is up to his element.  I say ""his"" because, well, to be honest, there are no women in this film, except for random typists and Mrs. Ryan, who don't have speaking parts.  Also starring Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Ted Danson.<br/><br/>You have not truly lived until you have seen Saving Private Ryan."

","This movie had it all.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the most outstanding feature was the sound and the camera work. We have often seen battle scenes that would depict the bravery, the madness, the brutality of war. But never before were we so much ""included"" in the experience, and I attribute it to the amazing way the sounds were worked in, and the ever moving camera work: nothing stands still in such fierce battles. It was so gripping and so effective that I felt sort of trapped, like the soldiers would, like I was in an amusement park's ride that made me dizzy, but I could not get out of. And yeah, the whole opening Omaha beach scene made me a little dizzy.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I wish Spielberg (or the story editors) would have taken out the returning German soldier (Steamboat Willie). This is the weakest (IMO) point of the movie. It taints an otherwise very credible story, and I'm disapointed that such a Hollywoodish turn found its way in the script.<br/><br/>All in all, a very very good movie, albeit of a very very sad and disturbing subject."

","Spielberg isn't good at art, he's a showman who makes must see movies that put things on the screen we haven't seen before. He has terrible taste sometimes, such as Hanks shooting at the tank on the bridge which reminds us of 'Jaws' which wakes us up to the fact that it's only a movie.<br/><br/>I watch it for the middle and end which are thrilling, although that may not have been the emotion intended, but that's Barnum for you. The middle section is more traditional and recalls the morality scene in 'Guns Of Navarone' where they have to execute the informer. It works there but is incongruous here, because of the verite style of the war sequences."

","I know, I know: RYAN is supposed to be Spielberg's second SCHINDLER. But seriously: If you think about it, it's obviously not! Alright: The Omaha Beach scenes are really some of the most astonishing action sequences ever staged. However, the following story unfolds as a clichÃ©-ed plot like any war story. It reminded me even of the pilot to TOUR OF DUTY. Tom Hanks leads a small platoon through enemy lines to save the last of four brothers, three were already killed in action. On this mission, some of the G.I.s get killed. The rest start pondering if this trip - if the war - is worthwhile. So far so good. To show that this movie is a deep one, Spielberg pulls the joker of showing the enemy in a humane way: ""Steamboat Willy"", a German officer doomed to get shot, who turns out to be just another nice guy, but from the wrong side. They let him get away. But when they encounter him the second time, the G.I. translator - who never before has killed anybody - has of course to shoot him, just to show that all Germans were demons after all. Hypocrisy! And all the discussions whether the effort was worth it are silenced, when Ryan turns out to be the bestest American boy ever! It could've been a far better film if Ryan was a) dead already, b) a cowardish and unlikable character, c) black, or d) just not to be found. THEN all the thoughts about the reason of war would have led somewhere. Now they are just a fig leaf to cover up a standard B-wartime flick."

Instead of showing us the absurdities of war, something the plot could well have brought across, Spielberg laborously evolves the movie around trusted values like male comradeship, loyalty and heroic patriotism, blasting the genre of the american war movie 30 years into the past. Combined with the effort of Hollywood's most pretentious actor, Tom Hanks, and a criminally tacky score makes this one of the most pathetic war movies ever made.<br/><br/>Terrence Malik's ""Thin Red Line"", which it incidently sunk at the box offices, shows what this movie could - should have been."

","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a terrible Steven Spielberg film! Usually Spielberg's films are very intelligent and demanding masterpieces but SAVING PRIVATE RYAN wasn't more than a gory bloody massacre! The Germans were again the pieces of scum, not worth to live. Films like STALINGRAD, DAS BOOT or PLATOON show us, that there are ALWAYS innocents and unscrupulous killers on BOTH sides! In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN the german soldiers are just the meat stock of the WW2. American soldiers are dying always a gruesome painful death, so the audience can really start to hate the Germans and hope for more scenes in which more Nazis get killed. The german soldiers were usual soldiers too, and especially in the last months of the war they didn't want to carry on fighting, but there was not a single sign that the Germans were humans too in the movie, they were just cannon fodder. For example: There was the standoff between the Americans and the Germans in the destroyed city. Every German got killed the Americans survived without any problems. It's painful enough that such senseless movies are still so popular in this time but the fact that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a Steven Spielberg film (hey, the man made movies like E.T. Schindler's List and Jurassic Park) is truly shocking! I think the movie was so much glorified because it was a Spielberg!

"Bungle-9","10","2","4","3 February 2000"," Great tense stuff
","I love this film to bits. Spielberg, Williams and Kaminski strike again with this great WWII front line drama. All actors were excellent in their roles, and I think Hanks was stiffed at the Oscars. I especially liked the beginning of the D-Day landing scene, with Hanks and co. in the transporter. At that point you can really feel the tension building up, mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach. The suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter, and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets. The point is, Spielberg makes the audience feel like they're one of the soldiers on the transporter, and I was no exception. I got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there. The length of the landing scene was quite long, getting you into the feel of the time scale. The blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was. The thing is, that's what it was really like.<br/><br/>Granted, it does get a bit slow when they start looking for Ryan, but not to the point where you're bored enough to want out of the cinema. The bonding between the soldiers in the squad is also highlighted in the film, Corporal Upham for example, being excluded by the others at the start, and by the end is joining in with the lingo (i.e., 'foobar'). The ending tugged on the heart strings plenty, and it shows that Hanks' character was no hero, but a normal human being, hesitating to put his life on the line for another (cf. 'earn this'). The overall effect of this film is pure anti-war.<br/><br/>John Williams' score was excellent as usual, and the fact that there was no music in the battle scenes was a good move, so that the audience can concentrate on the action. Kaminski's shots were just genius, his freehand style instantly recognisable, giving a real feeling of terrifying action and movement at the start and end of the film. This film was stiffed at the Oscars. Mark my words."

There is not a single time my face is not washed with tears 😭, my nose not run over with sniffles 😢, my voice not jammed with chokes, and my heart not filled with sadness, just to name a few. And tonight is no exception, only for it to get worse. I guess part of the reason is that the scene starts at the American Cemetery at Omaha Beach 🏖 in Normandy where I visited around this time last year. Obviously 🙄 your physical proximity to a place makes you more susceptible to things happening there. It is such a soul searching, heart wrenching, mind blowing and thought 💭 provoking movie 🎥. The brutality of war, the cruelty of human nature and the fragility of life cannot be painted more vividly.
As some people think 🤔 war movies 🎥 are very distressing and depressing, I find myself immensely in love 😍 with such type of movies 🎥. I seem to inadvertently be a fan of Cold Mountains 🏔, Band of Brothers, Pearl Harbour, and Australia 🇦🇺, just to make a few. For one thing I think 🤔 it's very real. I'm just as relentlessly as brutally a realist. For another it is highly visual and graphic. You don't need to over-analyze to understand it. And if I go one step further it is largely set on some historic scene which comes with certain element of documentary. I understand people like happy 😃 moments which of course is a positive thing. But life is not clearcut. It is mixed. Life is not simple. It is complicated. Life is not singular. It is plural. Life is not single-dimensional. It is multifaceted. It is not always about happy 😃 memories. We all have our sad 😔moments. To me such thought 💭 provoking movies 🎥 fill this vacuum. As much as I am an emotional 😭 person I am also a deeply intellectual being. Not only do I enjoy 😉 the fancy and beauty of dining and wining but also I like exploring and reflecting deeper meaning of life on a quiet night. I'm more of a spiritual person than a material one I would say.
What war movies 🎥 attract me from another perspective is that it shows how bond is formed between brothers, how love is strengthened through hardship and how friends in need become friends indeed. It is care, love, generosity and above all humanity that see us through and bring us together.
Thank you 🙏 Saving Private Ryan crew for making yet another unforgettable milestone in motion picture history. You undoubtedly deserve to have 5 Oscar winners and 6 Oscar nominations under your belt.
And one last thing please. The benefit of traveling around the world 🌎 is that when you watch different movies 🎥 shot at different locations you recognize those places and will probably say ""Yes great. I've been there too,"" which will bring you emotionally closer to the show."

During World War ll, the U.S. and U.K.army landed in Normandy on June 6,1944. To insure the victory, Private JamesRyan (Matt Damon), and his troops -101st Airborne Division, are airdropped behind the German front -lines. Unfortunately, all his three brothers werekilled in action at the same time. In order to prevent the unfortunate mother fromlosing all her four sons, the U.S. commanddecided to send a special squad to lookfor James Ryan and take him back safely.

","Sure you've got Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and all those other war flicks, but this film is much deeper and explores the war more seriously, not only is this the greatest war movie ever made but it's also my second favourite film of the 90's (#1 being Schindler's List) the fact that this also feels like it could be a documentary on the actual WW2 because of how realistically it is made and how terribly horrific the world war really was. Tom Hanks' role feels so realistic and so believable and he's such a lovable guy.<br/><br/>We start off with the Omaha Beach scene which is shot so realistically (which you will hear me say around 50 times) and the amount of deaths and blood in this scene truly is scary and is truly the reason why Spielberg is such a great filmmaker and why he is absolutely my favourite filmmaker of all time! The score gives me goosebumps and is one of John Williams' best, unlike other war films, it doesn't dumb down in the second and third act, instead, I believe, this film has the greatest second and third act I've ever seen! Spielberg does not shy away from the results of war and the impact is has on society and human beings as a hole. If I literally had a tear jar for how many times I cried during this movie it would be full and overflowing, this film has one of the greatest ensemble casts ever and I'd be lying if I said Hanks' performance outshines everything else in the movie, because the greatest performance in this film is the war and how it is portrayed.<br/><br/>It is based on a true story of four brothers, 3/4 of the brothers had been killed on battlefield and one of them is still alive, however, the mission is not as easy as it seems, first of all, imagine the grief of the mother and the misery she would be going through if she found out all of her sons had been killed, which means she has to have at least one to survive. There are some subtle moments of comedy which could be used to brighten the mood, but it still never shies away from the fact of how bad war was.<br/><br/>The film gets more depressing and terrifyingly believable as it goes along, they come across another Ryan, James Frederick Ryan from Minnesota, but they're looking for James Francis Ryan from Iowa, then Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) have a conversation in a Church about some kid back where they used to live and talk about him, I guess, to try and brighten the mood, they tell stories and go to sleep for a while before going for another trip to find James Francis Ryan.<br/><br/>Another one of his guys had just been killed off by a German, Captain Miller decides not to kill him, ""Because every man I kill makes me feel further from home."" They eventually find Private Ryan and tell him about the tragic deaths of his three other brothers, they say he can go home, although displaying an emotional response at first, Ryan still wants to fight the war, saying he doesn't wish to abandon the team. The third and final act is sad to say the least, all the characters we loved earlier on in the film end up getting killed in battle, we are now back to Omaha Beach style war.<br/><br/>Great movie"

Saving Private Ryan revolutionized how war movies are done and it pays tribute to the fallen warriors of World War II. Highly recommended."

","Feeling slightly disappointed having heard so many good things about this movie. It seems alot of people get confused so realise it is not a true story. After watching a documentary with account of veterans who were actually at omaha beach i feel the landing scene doesnt do justice to the horrors at least comparing to accounts of those veterans. The whole idea of sending 10 soldiers to rescue 1 with no clue where he could be is a little far fetched, why put at risk 10 soldiers who have literally just crawled out of the beach landings alive, with so many troops lost they woildnt want to risk more losses at that moment. Overall well directed, the battle protecting the bridge scene about the best part action wise. Watch the movie, as a movie its good but remember its not a true story and there are historical floors."

","World War II was a pivotal event of the 20th century and a defining moment for America and the world. It shifted the borders of the globe. It forever changed those who lived through it, and shaped generations to come. It has been called ""the last great war.""
Nothing could have prepared the soldiers at Omaha Beach for the battle they are about to wage. Filled with hope and resolve, none of them knows if they will survive the small strip of beach ahead of them. As his eyes scan the Normandy coast, Captain John Miller (TOM HANKS) believes that getting himself and his men past the gauntlet is the greatest challenge he has faced in the war. But his most difficult task still lies ahead.
Even as the Allied forces begin to get a foothold at Omaha, Miller is ordered to take his squad behind enemy lines on a dangerous mission to find and retrieve one man: Private James Ryan (MATT DAMON). The youngest of four brothers, Ryan is the last survivor, the other three having all been killed in action within days of one another.
As the squad pushes deeper into enemy territory, Captain Miller's men find themselves questioning their orders. Why is one man worth risking eight... why is the life of this private worth more than their own?
Amid the chaos and terror of those days in early June 1944, this remarkable story searches to find decency in the sheer madness of war."
"zeekwunlau","8","0","0","20 April 2020"," War does not talk about human nature
","When watching the last battle of bridge and defense, I kept silent in my heart from time to time, when did it end. This film looks very crying. In fact, it is not. Desperate to the point where it can't be dispersed in the circle of heart, but it can't cry. When it is hit, it is like a loss of appetite.<br/><br/>From big to small, from whole to individual. This drama is the kind of history book I want to read. After reading it, I think if the history teacher showed me the film at that time, maybe my history score would be 50 more points. World War II is a war of faith. Faith is not good or bad. It may result in eight stories that save one humanity first; it may also become a plot that vents people to death. The issue of human nature should not be within the scope of the war film, because human nature gives birth to the enemy and the enemy, and at most ends with different positions. But I still want to ask-fight for freedom. So what is freedom? I think even if they survived the war, the people who deeply participated in the war have no freedom. They are the beasts locked in the death of the war. Once the flood gate of the inner beast is released, they can only give themselves to other people. Man (God) may be able to be redeemed. That must be for the freedom of most people. These freedoms are symbolized by the American flag after the film, but for decades, has freedom really existed as they expected? I do n't know, death is with regret and hope, maybe alive, is despair?<br/><br/>Recalling the sentence in the film-perhaps in this damn war, saving Ryan is the only good thing we have done.<br/><br/>Speaking of individuals. It can be seen from the captain's state that he is a very good soldier. I think he is a portrayal of the excellent characteristics of soldiers. The military deployment is unclear and the most powerful is his calm calmness and the gentleness deep in his eyes. Dynamics are soldiers, and statics are teachers. Noisy and hyperactive in a cruel environment is the most needed and the easiest, shouting for freedom to rush up to encourage morale around, but this 8-person team is stunned, like sleeping in the grass The beast, if it doesn't move, is killed, and when it's out, it's killed. This is inseparable from the personal character of the captain, besides life and death he has his hopes and beliefs. There is a person who can advance the hope for the future. He sees not only the present, so he saw the glorious human glory of the national leader from the act of saving Ryan, over the red sea and the broken body, look Hope after the war.<br/><br/>Earn this, earn it<br/><br/>Also impressed is the sniper who believes in God, hi, this guy is really too cool and can fall asleep with the bed. I think he has absolute warrior traits. It is fearless for the people in the war to give himself all to God. But if in the peaceful years, I have little way to imagine how he might be, maybe the same as the father in Educated? Until the moment when the muzzle is facing him, I want to know what he was thinking at that moment, for whom to fight, for whom to die?<br/><br/>The last details that particularly touched me<br/><br/>Blood stained half of the coast, but that was only the tip of the vast sea. Just as the war passed with time, who was responsible for the grief? I think it may be the sand on the coast, because blood water has penetrated into the sand, and finally became the nutrients of the sand.<br/><br/>Don't shoot, let him be burned to death. What does an angel and a devil look like?<br/><br/>There is actually a department dedicated to making death notices. Looking at the girls' typing, there was no expression on their faces. I was really scared. I couldn't type the wrong words. I was found out and I didn't work.<br/><br/>Saved the old man for a long time, a bullet passed through his head and disappeared.<br/><br/>In the last battle, the Germans in the tank were burned, and the soldiers upstairs gave him a shot to end him. War does not talk about human nature, but the human nature that shines out is enough to illuminate the whole earth."

","War movies are not always bloody and brutal.Before Spielberg's blockbuster Saving Private Ryan, many war films had reserved their revelations about the brutality of war.When we watch the best war movies, we really don't just use our eyes.
1. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930): A film about World War I that was very popular at the time and is still very powerful: the battle scenes are spectacular and the characters are impressive.It is an excellent film that both critics and audiences are unanimously optimistic about.
2. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957): The film begins in a POW camp and follows the story of the building and bombing of a bridge.However, the theme of the whole work is vague and ambiguous, which makes people unable to judge right and wrong immediately, and reveals the pluralism and conflict of cultures very profoundly.So people are drawn to watch it again and again, and every time there is a new harvest.
3. Lawrence of Arabia (1962): The story of a British soldier's rise from maverick to hero during World War I.
4. ""Qiaiboshi"" (1964): If you want to see a fight scene, you're going to be so disappointed that you can't even see the enemy.But this is a far-reaching war film, the significance of the film is to let people see about the dangers of the Cold War mentality.A mistake, or the selfish thoughts of individual people, can destroy our beautiful home and warm life.
5. Army Field Hospital (1970)
6. Apocalypse Now (1979)
7. Platoon (1986)
8.Glory (1989)
9. Braveheart (1995)
10. Saving Private Ryan (1998): The bloodiest and most successful film of World War II follows soldiers behind enemy lines in search of an only son.Just as the cruelty of the film deeply touched the audience, the perfection of the plot and performance of the film also convinced people."

"adeckofcards","10","0","0","7 April 2020"," Portrait of a war
","The film opens with the Normandy landings massacre, a crude and violent sequence that serves as an introduction to what will come later on the film.
The story tells us how a group of soldiers must save Ryan and take him home so that his mother does not lose any more children, since they have all died. The way this story progresses through the horrors of war puts characters in both physical and moral conflict, and the viewer himself must also fight this. Is it worth saving a soldier in exchange for the life of many more? This sounds almost absurd and pointless, but when the true mission is presented - that is, winning the war and saving Ryan so everyone can go home - that's when the entire movie makes sense and given a reason for the characters to continue with the mission. In this way, the film turns a situation that does not seem to make sense to something much more honorable, mixed with a patriotic feeling that takes precedence even to death.
Without a doubt a film that will remain in the history of cinema for being one of the most human portraits of the war. Spielberg shows us kindness and love for the family in a totally cruel and indifferent context."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","8","0","0","3 April 2020"," I only have a few things to say about this famous, mostly great war movie
","I'll keep this review brief because Saving Private Ryan has been discussed to near death, and there's little new or interesting one can say about it. It's over 20 years old, and for as long as I can remember, it's always been held up as one of the greatest war movies of all time. The first time I watched it, back in about 2011, I wasn't super enthusiastic about it. I thought it was excellently made, but overlong, a little sappy as far as the ending was concerned, and bothered by it seeming to show both the horrors of war and the heroics.<br/><br/>With that last point, I still feel it does this to some extent. Most of the time, it makes war look pretty horrible, most famously in that opening sequence (as a note: the rest of the film suffers a bit in general coming after that scene. And as great as it is, it doesn't have a huge impact on the rest of the story; we get an introduction to some characters, and a sense of Hanks' character being a good leader, but such things could technically be conveyed in a more succinct manner, so the scene does feel a little tacked on to the rest of the film. Still, what a scene though). But then the other big action sequence near the film's climax is kind of too entertaining. There are moments of grit and horror within it, but not as frequently as the opening sequence. It's not as disorientating or stomach-churning. War doesn't look fun exactly, but now war looks heroic.<br/><br/>I can't say for sure, but sticking to one side of this might have been better for the film as a whole, rather than sitting on the fence and saying war can be heroic while also being horrifying. Maybe it's that the connection to the characters is somewhat lacking, because while I did mostly want them to succeed, I wasn't hugely attached to them in an emotional way. I prefer Gallipoli and the recent 1917 because I cared for the characters more. I respected them as individuals put into a horrible situation, while also getting the sense that the films they were in were putting forth a strong anti-war sentiment.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is anti-war, but not in as strong a manner as it could be. The second large battle scene should be as horrifying as the first battle scene to argue this in a stronger way, or otherwise, action should be avoided (look at the infamous Come And See for a go-to example of how to do an absolutely terrifying war film). But those critiques aside, there's little else to fault here, particularly on a technical front. Spielberg does an incredible job directing, and the cast is overall solid. The music was a little disappointing I guess, considering it's John Williams, but then again, the lack of music does help make that opening scene all the more effective.<br/><br/>It's a mostly great film, and I liked it a lot more on my recent rewatch, compared to 2011. There are still a few little things here and there that bothered me, and kept me from counting this among my favourite war films. But there is also so much that's done well that I can't help but be in awe of most of what ended up on screen."

","In addition to the war scenes and the adventure scenes, the core of the movie is to convey the theme of human nature and the exploration of life. Does life have weight? Ryan was human, and so were the two teammates who died on the team. The Americans are people, and so are captured German soldiers. No matter who dies or who lives, war is a massacre. Once war and life are placed on both sides of the same balance, the word ""destruction"" is destined to weigh heavily. Real war movies never shy away from the trauma that human left for their own. However, behind the haze of war, they also reflect the brilliant light of human nature."

","Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding War Movie directed by Legend Steven Spielberg back in 1998 starring: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>It's a story about a platoon of men in US Army Ranger Battalion assigned to the search & rescue mission in Normandy France after D-Day landings (D-Day plus 3). The mission is a man. A 101st Airborne paratrooper named James Francis Ryan of Iowa who parachuted and got lost in Combat somewhere in Normandy France. From Bloody Beaches to the battered French Towns movie is just awesome.<br/><br/>The selected group of men out on the mission to find Ryan face danger, death and destruction every minute n hour facing the Germans. Movie also depicts what men go through during Combat in Wartime. Movie highlights the brutalities and harsh realities of war and brotherhood of men during combat.<br/><br/>Movie opens at Bloody Omaha beach Operation Overlord and ends with gruesome firefights with Germans in a small bombed out French town. Every scene is gripping from beginning to the end portraying the punishing monstrosity in battlefields of Normandy.<br/><br/>Story - Mission is to find a missing Airborne paratrooper of 101st Airborne division 506th outfit whose brothers were KIA in combat and has been ordered to be searched by a rescue party and send him home before he is harmed amidst the chaos of war. SPR is basically inspired from the vintage classic drama movie 'The Fighting Sullivans' which is the story of 5 Sullivan brothers who fought n died against the Japanese in the Pacific.
The Movie is also inspired by 4 American Brothers who fought in the Pacific Africa Italy and Normandy.<br/><br/>But like SPR there are many other untold stories of Normandy landings on D-Day 6th June that just need to be told. There is one moving scene in the film that touches my heart. The scene of the mother of 4 brothers who receives the telegram from the army of her 3 sons killed in combat while the other is missing in Normandy. These things happen to every family during Wartime be it any country. losing loved one's in war is painful and depressing be it a son husband or father. War is a living he'll. Who knows it more than a soldier. The world has still not learnt any lessons from WWII and evil Nazis who are a warning from history.<br/><br/>Winds of War, War & Remembrance, Battle of Britain, Sink the Bismark, Tora Tora Tora, Pearl Harbour, From Here to Eternity, Midway, Von Ryan's Express, In Harms Way, The Longest Day, Das Boot, The Enemy Below, Schindler's List, Holocaust, Wallenberg: A heroes Story, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Sound of Music, Operation Crossbow, The Thin Red Line, Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gates, Patton, Guns of Navarone, The Great Escape are some of the other War time greats and a must watch. Most are War time action n drama period classic war films based on WWII.<br/><br/>But no war movie in the past can match the brilliance excellence and master work of legendary Hollywood Director Steven Spielberg. Movie won Oscar for best Cinematography. This is the best WWII action War movie ever made by Hollywood. Opening scary combat scenes in Omaha Beach are terrible and bloody. MG-42, 34 roar with heavy MG fire, mortar artillery shell explosions along-with brutal gory war scenes.<br/><br/>After watching the movie SPR my eyes were full of tears and i was moved. War is hell and civilians don't realize what men and women in uniform go through. Since WWII many War Veterans in America suffer from PTSD.<br/><br/>My suggestion to all is to view - Band of Brothers HBO 10 part TV miniseries which is another true WWII war story of 101st US Airborne Div. Based on the true story of Lt. Richard Winters and his men. It's a true war story just like The Pacific HBO Miniseries 2010."

","Exceptional direction on part of Spielberg, especially in the action sequences at the start and to the end of the film. Relentlessly paced and edited. Grand and faithful productions. Brutal war imagery. The violence does not feel like a glorification of war, but rather an accurate, lurid depiction of the reality of war that many prefer to eschew and forget. Great acting from Tom Hanks, who shines amongst a myriad of subpar actors, except for Matt Damon and Jeremy Davies, who blossoms late with incredible acting range as Upham.<br/><br/>This film peaks very high, but it is also hindered by a lackluster middle part and a few significant flaws. The Spielberg directorial flare, while bringing a healthy does of uplifiting moments, can also do harm to the film narrative. Some scenes are rather cheesy and the characters move and act unnaturally, quite like chess pieces in the hands of a very stylish player. The script is average. I am not a fan of a lot of dialogue choices, a notable example being the last few lines of the film, where a previously silent character delivers a few unnecessary lines that would have played better and make the moment more emotional had he remained that way. Despite following the ""show not tell"" rule rather loosely, I can give the film credit for pleasing general audiences who would prefer more clarity and guidance in their viewing experience, especially since the film hits hard when it wants to hit hard.<br/><br/>The D-day scene lives on as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema, but the praise does not stop there. The almost 3 hour long epic is an eye-opener filled with great moments that certified Spielberg as a quite unique dramatic filmmaker, and it ranks as one of his best in his illustrous oeuvre."

Despite that, the storyline it's pretty basic but it is a war movie it's normal to not have a great story because like all of it's genre the main goal is to portray war, although it was basic was still entertaining. Spielberg did and excepcional job in portraying the ugliness of the war in such a beautiful way."

","Less of a movie and more of a parable, a reminder of heroism and an experience and an exercise in empathy for a new generation when it came out and today.<br/><br/>What struck me immediately with the 4K transfer, besides the vivid colours of fire and blood, and those incredible and soulful close-ups, is how the documentary style of the film is still often so present and immediate and fresh. It revivifies the themes and the meaning of the film all over again and a perfect promotion for what upgrading the quality of films can do for them. This too happened with Apocalypse, Now: Final Cut.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a film constructed to say so much with so little, the characters of the film follow the same rule, effortlessly watchable with no one painted with broad strokes and left, like comrades, with their depth and uniqueness just bubbling beneath the surface. The aural soundscape is second to none, overwhelmingly impressive and immersive.<br/><br/>There's nothing sadistic about this film and yet it is brutal and pulls no punches. It's a warm hearted warning about war and a subtle and unstuffy character study about men at war."

","We watched the film saving private ryan at school. We thought it was very good because it started in the present and then came a kind of flashback. we also liked it because it was very realistic and because I sympathized with the characters. The characters were not presented immediately, but you got to know them better and better during the film. We found the corporal a good example for people who were not heroes and were afraid of the war. In the beginning we thought the fighting scene was taking too long, making it a bit boring to watch. We also thought that it had not been portrayed very well because she filmed very close. It was a good scene because the cameraman went after it and the camera did not stand still completely. That made it more realistic and fun to watch. A scene came with background music that I thought was very suitable. It also made it more exciting. The script was very unpredictable which made it more fun to watch and therefore you would like to know what will happen next and you will not get tired of it even though the scenes took a bit too long. We thought that the scenes blended well. The film looked good for the rest. The costumes and the set looked very real. The costumes fit well with the concept of the film. Especially the collapsed buildings and the tanks looked very real."
"a-33765","8","0","0","26 November 2019"," Great Movie it is.
","I recently watched the film and this is what I think:
Although the film was filmed in 1998, it still looks like it is brand new.
In general, it is a great film (which explains the nomination for several Oscars). It is accurate to many small details. But like in every Hollywood movie, there is always a scene where I always want to facepalm myself. Like - and here is a spoiler alert - at the end when Tom Hanks lays half dead and shot his gun at a German tank when everything seemed to be lost, and then the planes come to redeem them and save everyone.
Thanks to Spielberg's camera techniques it made a completely different experience while watching. I noticed that the camera work in the battle scenes was very chaotic, I think that was the intention, so that you got more into the film and you could empathize more with the characters in the film.
I thought this was pretty well done, because it really got me into the film and I had more fun watching it.
The costumes and the attributes that were used all seemed very realistic and it seemed that they used a lot of time to find out which attributes were used and what the soldiers looked like at the time.
And all those characters who develop lamentably in the course of the film are also something you don't see often. Normally you get to see at the beginning who is who and who does what, but that was not the case here. The characters were ""lifeless"" at the start.
In general: a great movie, there were a few things that I would change myself. But it is recommended."

","What a great movie, we watched this movie in class. Sometimes it just felt like we were in the movie. We loved the camera movement, like when in combat the camera moved like someone was running. That made it feel more like we were in the movie. The outfits made it even more realistic, it looked like real WWII suits. We really loved how the character build up happened, we learned bit by bit more about the characters. The ""star"" of the movie was played by Tom Hanks, we really liked the way he took advantage of the role. Tom or, how he's called in the movie, Captain Miller, played the role how it should be played. Like when he got shellshock at the end of the movie, he shot his pistol like we would think someone with shellshock would shoot. Matt damon played really well too, it really looked like he found it unfair when Miller said he could go back. The scene where Matt, or how he's called in the movie, Ryan talked about his brother with Miller our class started laughing too. The music always came in at the right moment, like in the first scene where ryan goes to the graves of the dead people from the war. The decor really looked like it was real, there were piles of wood and stone from where bombs were thrown.
Overall we found it a great movie and would recommend it people who haven't watched it yet.."

The decisions they made were also well thought out. It is a very serious film without humor.<br/><br/>The script was great because I think the right things were said at the right time. At a certain moment in the movie the captain was hit and he shot with a pistol at a Tiger with one of the bullets it looked like he was detonating the Tiger and everyone thought it was a funny scene.<br/><br/>All the costumes were very well made and fit in well with those times, you don't get the feeling that it was staged.<br/><br/>The set design was cool because it really looked like it was on the battlefield or by the bridge at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There was no background music, I thought that was a good choice, which in my opinion gives even more effect.<br/><br/>In general, I think it's a very good film that really leaves you thinking about the war"

","Guidance: Film contains graphic violence and injury scenes and very bad language.
Everyone knows about the landing scene on the Normandy beaches. This one was coded Omaha and landed on by the US Rangers in June 1944. It is every bit as graphic and bloody as described in reviews elsewhere and brings home the horrors of infantry warfare.
However this has no bearing on the story of Saving Private Ryan. It is it's own little sideshow.
Once this episode is over only then does the mission come into fruition and the story begins. I was under the impression that the action fizzled out but that is not the case.
The action is no holds barred and there are more battle scenes evry bit as intense as the Normandy beaches.
The film brings home the real horrors of war. It is unlike the war films made directly after World War 2 which sanitised modern warfare and were very black and white in their portrayal of both sides.
The plot however is paper thin and exactly as the film title."

","Saving Private Ryan (1998), starring Tom Hanks and Jeremy Davies, represents an impeccable display of 90's practical effects and cinematography. While the plot sometimes borders on cliche, WWII realism is buoyed by dramatic performances from a talented supporting cast (including Tom Sizemore and Giovanni Ribisi). The film depicts a surprisingly accurate recreation of Nazi occupied France - during the initial phase of Operation Overlord (1944). A particularly moving shot features heavy rain drops on the leaves of Normandy hedgerows - your ears first interpret gunfire. Sharp direction by Steven Spielberg mirrors real life war reporting adding a level of grit and documentary terror not seen before or since. The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan cannot be forgotten and may function as a tool to familiarize future generations on the scenarios of endless brutality generated by an environment of total war."

how many died by the overly simplistic strategy of flooding the beach until the enemy was overrun?
artillery by land. by ship. bombs by plane. were used but, this battle was sloppy. i know all the other details about this battle. all the hardships and time constraints due to the weather. but there was no lack of time for planning. so what happened? they claimed they didnt know how much defence were waiting for them on the beach. for all they already knew, how is this true?

","Director Steven Spielberg yet again brings together an all-star cast to create an influential war film. Saving Private Ryan tells the story of eight men who set out to find Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon, as his three brothers were killed in action. Their goal, is to find Private Ryan and send him home to his mother as he is her only child still living. The movie, set during WWII, shows not only the hardships of war but also what men are willing to go through to bring a fellow soldier home. These eight men, led by Captain Miller who is played by Tom Hanks must travel into enemy territory to retrieve Private Ryan and in doing so find themselves fighting for their own lives to do so. <br/><br/>While the theme of the film is war, Spielberg directed his cast in a portrayal of courage. Showing what great lengths men will go through in such a troubling time. Courage could be referenced as part of the plot of this film but it can be argued that you can't have a film with war as the theme and not have this be a subsequent role in the film. Another element of this film would be the loss of life or disregard for life. In the film, soldiers are seen killing German soldiers who are attempting to surrender. This again relates to the main theme of war but also that in which life has no real value.<br/><br/>Lighting was impactful for this film and appeared to be natural lighting but seemed to be duller than what would be expected. This brought out the element of drama and while being a typical dramatic effect, gave a real sense of mood in most of the film. Like most war films, a depressing mood is given off and with this type of lighting, it really made this feeling come true for me as a viewer. Character costume was also an important element in this film. Not only was there uniformity between officer and enlisted, you could also get a feeling for who was in the fight and who may have just arrived. Most men looked haggard and beaten down and without needing to look at their expression, you could understand this through their appearance. Men's uniforms were dirty or blood stained while men at a base would have what almost appeared as new fatigues as they had not left the safety of the base. These different elements added to the cinematic effect and helped in portraying such an exhilarating film.<br/><br/>While some may describe this as just another war film, Spielberg, Hanks, and Tom Sizemore together made this a classic. War films generally follow the action and Saving Private Ryan turned the focus to courage rather than just victory. A must see film from an all-star cast."

","This was just a fantastic movie. That opening half an hour with the allied invasion of Normandy is like nothing I've ever seen before, unflinchingly gritty, violent, bloody, loud, horrific and brutal. I was actually watching it on the treadmill and had to stop because I was gasping and then sobbing. Probably one of the most realistic portrayals of the horrors of war ever made. This was in your face throughout and doesn't glorify or lie about combat.<br/><br/>The movie itself I would have to say is a bit of a masterpiece with amazing attention to detail and Steven Spielberg deservingly winning an Oscar for his stunning war drama. The story follows a squad of US army soldiers on a mission to rescue a GI trapped behind enemy lines in France on D-day after all 3 of this brothers are killed in action.<br/><br/>Excellent performances all round but especially from (Tom Hanks) as Capt. Miller leading his men on their perilous mission to locate that one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines. I also really enjoyed Tom Sizemore.<br/><br/>This movie has so many familiar faces attached and it was interesting (and even fun) seeing all the different actors showing up along the way in the search for Ryan including Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Bryan Cranston, Dennis Farina, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Nathan Fillion, Paul Giamatti, Vin Diesel, Ryan Hurst. 11/11/15"

The story follows a group of soldiers who are risking their lives to save ""Private Ryan"", whose 3 other brothers have been killed. Steven Spielberg doesn't cut any corners or hide the truth. As in the opening Normandy Landing Scene, he shows the brutality as it is. The Film really emphasizes the Horror of War, and how risking your life for another is an honorable and rewarding thing. Tom Hanks helps boost the film to a high, with a stunning and scarily realistic performance as Captain John Miller.

","I agree with almost everybody on this one: this is definitely a very good film. The first part is excellent and is almost certainly destined to become part of cinematic history. The original music score and the special effects are uniformly excellent and the cinematography very good.<br/><br/>Having said all the above however, I did also find some faults (albeit small) hence the rating of (only) 8/10. Let's try to explore some briefly: I think the story was a bit lacking, slightly oversimplified. More in- depth characterization would have improved the movie in my opinion. Apart from this, I also think (and i am well aware that most will disagree with me here) that Tom Hanks was completely miscast here. To me (even though he is undoubtedly a great actor), he never even remotely resembles the tough, no-nonsense, war hero he is supposed to be playing. Just think of John Wayne in a very similar role in 'The Longest Day' and you will probably see what I mean.<br/><br/>Havind said the above though, this is and remains an excellent film.

","It's actually pretty sad for me, as Russian, to accept that it's America that made the best movie about WWII, but not us. But eventually it doesn't even matter. The main thing is - they managed to present the most plausible film regarding this topic, the one which dispels the myth of war's romanticism and actually shows the horrible truth about the war - terrible death, blaring perishing fear, hopelessness, despair, inexpressible brutality. The landing scene, from my point of view, is the paragon of presenting a battle experience. Blood runs cold whilst watching that scene. Generally the whole movie is watched in one breath. Yeah, one could say that the plot is a bit flimsy, but it's perfectly compensated by incredible battle scenes. It is also impossible not to mention the amazing cast. The personalities of characters are unfolded spectacularly. If you're into war movies you'll probably dive into the story and live through it together with the squad. And this is exactly what really terrific about cinematography. So in this way, if you haven't watched this movie yet you should definitely do it ASAP. I bet it would be one of the most breathtaking film experience you've ever had."
"llamabob","Null","0","0","26 October 2012"," Theme of sacrifice
","The film Saving Private Ryan(Spielberg, 1998) follows a squad of soldiers led by Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks. The squad is sent on a risky mission to locate and return Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon. Ryan has lost multiple siblings in various theaters of WWII, thus earning him a ticket home. He is however lost somewhere in France following a messy D-Day assault. The theme focuses on the sacrifices made by brothers in arms and the idea of earning what was paid for in blood.<br/><br/>Upon initially learning of the mission, the squad balks at the idea of risking an entire squad to save one man. As the squad proceeds with the mission, they convey through speech and actions that they hope to earn the right to return home, and grudgingly come to terms with the mission. However, a repeating motif in the film is that despite trying to apply the moral and ethical solution to a problem, the end result is often a large, unrewarding sacrifice. For example, Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo attempts to rescue and take with them a young girl at the request of her family. In the confusion and stress of the scene, a sniper shoots Caparzo. Additionally, when the squad later encounters a German machine gun bunker, the squad reluctantly decides to attack, hoping to prevent a future ambush. The end result is the death of the medic, Wade. Furthermore, a German soldier captured during the assault is released, and later kills Private Mellish in a different battle. Despite their willing sacrifice, the end result is often negative. This is in contrast to many other war films where sacrifice immediately pays off, such as Enemy at the Gates (Annaud, 2001), in which the sniper Vassili is able to locate an enemy sniper after his friend sacrifices himself by allowing the enemy to shoot him.<br/><br/>Not only does the film do an excellent job of visually depicting the horrors of war, but it also uses a keen detail to sound to further the experience and elaborate on the fear and stress of a war time setting. From the pings of spent ammo clips to the realistic thuds of ricochets', the sound envelops the viewer. A particularly striking scene occurs after the squad has located Private Ryan, yet are compelled to stay and help a grossly undermanned and under gunned group of soldiers defend a vital bridge from approaching Germans. As the group waits in silence to ambush the approaching German armor, a low, screeching mechanical sound can be heard in the distance. The sound becomes increasingly loud and menacing as the Germans approach, and the viewer is filled with a sense of dread, reiterated by the facial emoting of the actors. It is clear by the sound they are dealing with a very powerful force, and do not have the means to make it a fair fight, yet they must stay and fight. This scene would have lost much of its power and influence without the dramatic build up from sounds effects.<br/><br/>Ultimately, much of the squad is sacrificed and Captain Miller implores Private Ryan to earn this chance at life that he has been given, and live a good life. After a tremendous amount of sacrifice, a positive result finally comes to fruition. However, as indicated in the final scene, an aged Ryan is plagued by the burden of being a lucky survivor, and is in constant inner turmoil over whether or not he had earned what so many others had sacrificed for.<br/><br/>Spielberg, S (Director), Rodat, R (Writer).

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is certainly a good film, and a major technical achievement, but it is little more than that.<br/><br/>After the stunning first twenty minutes the movie begins to falter. The storyline seems to be based in asking the question 'What is the value of one life?' The characters struggle with risking all of their own lives to save just one. Is duty and honor important enough to die for? What if Ryan turns out to be a complete degenerate? It is a pretty heady, and ultimately unanswerable question. Yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film, Spielberg answers the question for us. This is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings. It cheapens the film. When Hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama. When the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know he'll be dead in ten minutes. When they release the German soldier we somehow know we'll see him again. How many clichés and obvious plot devices can one throw into a 'realistic' movie? How about the celebrity cameos that feed a director's ego,but serve only to distract the audience from the film (Hey! Isn't that Ted Danson?) For the most part it is completely overblown, gratuitous melodrama. It isn't even the best war movie ever made, much less the best movie ever. It's worth the three hours, but not much more."

Im sorry about this review because I have to write it for a class so i think ill just chug through my lines with random writing like tom hanks chugs through German after German while dodging bullets like Jacky Chan. This element makes the movie slightly unrealistic at times. It is also has some other neat elements like a bad-ass sniper and some kick ass scenes. This movie truly does show the gruesome affects that war has on soldiers in battle but not so much the aftermath and the symptoms of post dramatic stress. So what do you think is the best type of bear? I think the coolest ones are polar bears but they are certainly not the best. In conclusion this is a must see for war movie lovers and people who like tom hanks."

","Saving Private Ryan was a great, yet tragic war story. It truly captured the life and times of World War II. This movie allows the viewer to see how soldiers thought and acted in World War II. It showed that most soldiers will sacrifice their own life in order to save others. The actual fighting of the war was extremely impressive, in that that era was captured beautifully and the director did a great job. The opening battle that took place in Normandy was, by far, the most impressive war scene I have seen in any movie. The great, yet graphic fighting depicted the brutal war and allowed for the viewer to imagine what the war would have been like if they were to have fought in it."
"long-ford","Null","0","0","6 February 2009"," Visceral opening, but then loses its intensity and lapses occasionally into over-sentimentality
","This film is very well researched and the opening thirty minutes are intensely visceral as we experience the D-Day landings in Normandy, France. After such a stunning start, the film suffers because it never again captures that intensity. The story is simple and shows the American soldiers as good honest men who fight because it's their duty. Hanks is fine in an understated role. Matt Damon is slightly bland. No one else leaves much of an impression. The film descends into sentimentality frequently, and this does occasionally fell like overkill. Still, it's well worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"
"retroguy02","9","0","0","13 November 2008"," History aside, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the greatest propaganda films ever made and grittily epic visualizing at its finest
","Although I have had this film's DVD for a few years now, I had never been intrigued by war films and always thought of them as preachy propaganda in one way or the other. But I happened to stumble across ""Saving Private Ryan"" as our class was doing a WWII project, and so decided to watch it. Although maybe it was preachy (somewhat) and yet still not extremely historically accurate (I should know, considering that I watched it for a history project), one thing that I could not deny with an open mind is that Saving Private Ryan is epic film-making at its finest.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, I won't go too deep into historical accuracy, but as long as the important things are set straight and the story makes sense on its own, I'm happy with it. That being said, there should have been more effort put into showing how other Allied nations besides America contributed to the war, at least during the beach landing sequence. This is my biggest gripe with the story, and even then it's a fairly minor gripe.<br/><br/>Some more background on the war would have also helped a lot to lend that extra authenticity edge to the movie, but the lack of it doesn't come down hard at all since most of us know it anyways. Aside from that, the story is fairly straightforward, which is good, since most of it is packed with great, amazingly cinematographed action sequences, and even better, the high-impact action is nicely balanced out by a few tender moments  making Saving Private Ryan more than just a war-themed action film.<br/><br/>However, the whole mission of 'saving Private Ryan'  for which our heroes risk their lives  should've been justified more deeply, with more than just an Abraham Lincoln speech. And another thing that could've cleared up many misconceptions was the movie's name; Pvt. Ryan, despite being talked about throughout the movie, appears for like 15 minutes on screen, and even then has very little character development. Heck, the movie's tagline would've made for a more suitable title (""The Mission is A Man""). In fact, Pvt. Ryan is almost relegated to a minor character when it comes to screenplay, as the movie centers almost entirely around Tom Hanks' Capt. John Miller, who is also the most fleshed-out character in the movie  perhaps the only one, in fact, but considering the movie's runtime, focusing on a few characters is a good thing.<br/><br/>Like most others', my favorite scene from the movie was the Normandy beach landing at the beginning, which is one of the most intense sequences I've ever seen in a movie. If there is one vital thing that this scene would be incomplete without, it is the cinematography  the shaky hand-held camera-work wonderfully evokes the feeling that the viewer is seeing the whole thing through the eyes of one of the soldiers fighting on the beach, and it leaves a very strong impression. There are also dramatic depictions of shell shock and tons of realistic hardcore gore, none of which feels gratuitous in context of the overall turbulence of the entire sequence. The sound is just as good, as gunshots and machine-gun fire booms loud and clear amidst frantic last cries, groans and screaming of soldiers.<br/><br/>The cinematography, production design and acting are top-notch all across the board throughout the movie. Tom Hanks' performance is particularly moving and resonant. The cinematography is greatly helped by the 'handy-cam' style of camera-work and use of appropriately grayish color palettes. When it comes to the production design, destroyed villages and pastures look like they should, with dead rotting cows and all, while the piles of garbage that are found in abundance throughout the movie are also meticulously detailed, complete with chunks of 1940s-looking weaponry sticking out of them.<br/><br/>All in all, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war propaganda films ever made, if not the best (and I mean it positively)  but my dilemma was right, it is still a propaganda film because according to this movie all Nazis are one-dimensional, motiveless and spineless, but considering how good the movie already is with its current premise, I couldn't really ask for more. And besides, with a famously Jewish director, what else can you ask for? Regardless, Saving Private Ryan is without doubt among the finest movies in its dimension and in its genre. RATING: 9/10."

","It's tough being a teenager now. You have to catch up on all types of movies. Classics, older movies, and newer movies you may have missed. When Saving Private Ryan opened in 1998, I, of course, wasn't allowed to see it, nor would I have been interested in seeing it. But now, everyone at school's buzzing about that movie, saying how great it is. I finally gave into peer pressure and rented it, and it's quite a good movie. It's just not the extraordinary classic that it's made out to be.<br/><br/>The time is World War II. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to fetch the title character, hence saving him and making the title make sense. Why send out eight people to rescue just one private? His three brothers, who were also in the war, were killed, so basically eight men are sent out to ease Mrs. Ryan. Obviously, when they finally reach him, there is resentment.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a flashback to the war, as every single war movie seems to do! Why is this always necessary? That means we know that some people survive, taking some tension out. At least we usually can't figure out who yet. Then it goes in with a bang, at a loud, exciting war scene that doesn't really have much to do with the rest of the plot, but it's very exciting. The only problem is that it pads out the movie to an obnoxiously long 170 minutes and since it isn't necessary, it didn't HAVE to be in the movie.<br/><br/>While the movie is quite long, it's never boring, not at all, but some parts aren't very interesting. Also, since it's a Spielberg investment, every single character has to have a backstory, meaning that smack dab in the middle of the movie, everyone must reminisce about what their life was, even those whose names we don't know, meaning that right when it's getting good, it goes off to left field.<br/><br/>The war scenes were incredibly realistic, as far as I can tell. Although graphic at times, it's obvious how painstakingly hard they worked to make it seem like you were actually there, no matter where you were, including watching it on a 5"" screen. Also, I think something else that added to the realism is that Spielberg kept the camera to a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Therefore, he was centralizing in on the action, what needed to be shown, and what doesn't need to be shown.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan ebbs and flows. At times there's heartpounding action, at others it's just watchable so you can continue on with the plot. But however you feel about this movie, you have to admit that it's one of the most realistic war films ever made.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for war violence and language."

This is one of many really long movies, but it flows so well and the storyline just sucks you in.  I constantly kept thinking how would I feel if I was in one their shoes.

Many scenes of war fighting with all one expects, such as enemy snippers, machine gun nests and mine fields.  The enemy soldier Hanks benevolently lets go in one such scene is one who helps to kill him in the end. Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon, only coming into play in the latter part of the movie, to me some what of an anticlimax, is insistent he doesn't want to be rescued, but chooses to fight to the end; of the movie that is. Admittedly this movie is about the character played by Hanks, with Damon as an after thought.  The Pvt.

","I had put off watching this film because I'd heard it was so bloody and I wasn't sure I wanted to see it.  Well, it lived up to its billing.  The scenes of war look very realistic and it's a shocking experience to watch.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, but not as much as Spielberg's other WWII film, ""Schindler's List.""  I suppose it's because of the comparative lack of drama.  Tom Hanks is a terrific actor but his character doesn't draw you in like Liam Neeson's did.  I didn't relate to the people in ""Saving Private Ryan"" the way I did in ""Schindler.""  It's probably not a fair comparison to make, but that was my reaction anyway.<br/><br/>The premise bothered me a little bit too.  Sure, saving the lone remaining child of a family is important, but did it make sense to send a company of men out during the days right after the landing at Normandy to save one person?  Things were chaotic then and success wasn't assured by any means, and I think the military's focus would have been elsewhere.  I don't know what the real circumstances were that the film was based on, but the director did make the mission seem worthy by having the men defend a vital bridge from the Germans after they caught up with Ryan. <br/><br/>
It's a complicated subject, war, and while this movie is very good, I'm not sure I agree with the focus of this film as a way of portraying patriotism."

","When I went to see this flick, I had heard all the rumours about the beginning of this movie. I consider myself to have a strong stomach for silver-screen violence, so I thought to myself ""what could Spielberg, ""mr. Fairy-tale"", of all people, shove on my face"". Well, 30 minutes of unrelenting full-blooded grindhouse gore was NOT anything I could have prepared myself for! I don't think there's anyone in the world who can take the beginning of SPR easily.

You'll be stunned, you'll FEEL the horror and you'll end up watching helplessly as Spielberg and his team introduce you to the face of war! This is NOT entertainment with a bunch of grown-up kids cowboying it on the ""Krauts"", this is sadistic, mindless and brutal, just like the real thing. After the start things slow down just a little bit as the plot unravels, but Spielberg manages easily in staying miles away from his fairy-tale-telling alter ego. And in the end... well, here we go again. If this was a regular action flick, you'd be waiting for the big finale. This time you are so much rooting for the soldiers you hope they would get away without having to fight anymore. BUT, Steven keeps it real to the end and in the grand fnale, bombards the viewer emotionally to the ground! Only two minor complaints: close-up on the american flag (yea, yea, heroes,""land of the free"" etc.) and some light moments at the end ('the last speech of the dying hero' - cliche...) taste a bit fake in this otherly very heavy movie. I also am not so sure if portraying Germans again as back-stabbing S.O.B.:s is that good a choice.

","This has got to be one of the best war films of all time. Doing justice to actual events of Omaha beach by accurately representing the landings of June 6th was the thing that clinched my liking of the film - despite it being the opening 20 minutes. So very many films stray from the truth in order to make the film more exciting and the visual effects more pronounced, which isn't a big problem to me, as long as it's tasteful. Further developments in the film also increased how much i enjoyed the film. Well filmed action sequences littered with plot development really keep the film going, however, after the first 2 or 3 times some of the characters can become dull [Pvt. Melish for example]. Typically good acting from Tom Hanks is complimented by good performances from Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and even Vin Diesel - in his best role to date.

The cameraman really lived through all that, I thought. I have seen a quite a bit war films, but the chaotic, inhuman, and horror are not strong words enough to describe the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg did a good work, I must say, what comes to describing the actual war, what it's like. Also, following his style, he steers clear from judging things. However, soon the movie lose it's tracks. Yet it seems to be historically accurate and it's interesting to watch as a historical epic story, the moral set of the movie starts to taste strange.  Indeed. And the composition in the beginning when the old mr.Ryan is squatting on the graveyard, and folks are behind, that composition is VERY Spielberg.<br/><br/>That's afterall the best thing in the movie, but also it's the thing what makes this movie feel like a bit unfinished. Also, the movie reminded me too much of<br/><br/>""Green Mile"" which was a kind of inmature description now that I think of it. That's the thing of Spielberg movies, they get everyone inside in the first sight, but soon they abandon the audience, leaving them wander helplessly into<br/><br/>chaos of unclear and muddy world or moral questions.

Obviously, there are people complaining about ""sentimentality"", ""sickening pro-Americanism"", etc. Well, for those people - I'm anything but a patriot, but I still loved this film - it is THE greatest war film ever, and the second best FILM ever.<br/><br/>It's been said, but I will still say it: if you don't like this, fine - just DON'T BASH IT FOR BEING PRO-AMERICAN WHEN IT IS AN AMERICAN FILM! Stereotypes?  Whatever - then there are plenty of '40s and '50s movies for you to make fun of, since they were so one-sided.  This is a film about soldiers, NOT a crappy all-star extravaganza with big names top-billed for maybe twenty minutes of screen time and slow battle scenes - ""Midway"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" (extremely overrated IMO), and ""The Battle of the Bulge"" - where half of the movie is the opposing generals planning the battle. Ah well.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit hackneyed: eight crack US soldiers are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who has crashlanded behind enemy lines.  The reason?  Because all of his brothers have already been butchered, and the US Military (in the persona of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall [Harve Presnell]) decides for public relations reasons to save him. The soldiers, led by John Miller (Tom Hanks!), go through a war-scarred countryside, engaging in a skirmish or two along the way and seeing the ravages of war up close and personal.<br/><br/>Sound corny?<br/><br/>Well, it is: but the EXECUTION is perfect.  Yes, the opening and closing scenes at the Normany Memorial could've been left out without making the film any worse - but they're a very small part of the experience.<br/><br/>The battle scenes and the acting are great - even Vin Diesel, who after seeing the abomination that is ""XXX"" I now despise, is good (though he only has about fifteen minutes of screen time anyway).  The opening D-Day fighting features some of the most graphic violence ever put on film, with ""Dr. Strangelove""-esque cinematography.  Let's just say, however, that after seeing ""We Were Soldiers"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Patriot"", etc. before this, I was not shocked by the violence at all.  Even the soldier who had his guts blown out did not disgust me - I thought it looked like foam spray. But it's still a graphic scene.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes of the film is the attack on the radar station, for more than one reason.  Seven of the US troops (Diesel's character was killed by a German sniper in a French town a while back) attack a small German force.  The battle is not shown, really: instead, we see a brief firefight with no gore at all through the view of the green interpreter Corporal Upham (the superb Jeffrey Davies).  Then one of the grunts, a Private Wade (Giovanni Rizzi), has been gut shot.  In a heart-rendering scene, his comrades gather around him and attempt to stop the bleeding before he dies. Then, the Americans come across a German soldier (Joerg Sadler), who is forced to dig a grave for Wade.  Upham pleads for the German's life, while Miller and his men want to execute him.  The German utters token English phrases (such as ""F*ck Hitler!"") in an attempt to have himself spared. Miller, for whatever reason, decides to let him go.<br/><br/>The best battle scene of all, however, is the final confrontation.  Having finally found Ryan and several men of his patrol, Miller and his men decide to join them in the defense of a crucial bridgehead against what would prove to be a last-stand.  This battle scene is graphic and moving - no realism is spared.  The ending was predictably cop-out, but given how it played out, I didn't much care.<br/><br/>Ten stars is an award that I give very few films - but Spielberg - arguably the greatest filmmaker working today - deserves it with this."

Either him or Roberto Benigi deserved to win. The bad aspects (Tom Hanks and the Screenplay by Robert Rodat) however ARE BAD because they just don't work. It's not that he's a bad actor but he just does not fit the picture. Neither does Matt Damon by the way...and Ted Danson? What was he doing in there?

Indeed, there are many points in this film where one feels that it is less a 'powerful anti-war statement' and more a '1970s War Movie', The Dirty Dozen with highbrow pretensions.<br/><br/>This is a terrible shame of course as the film has many virtues; combat is depicted in a defining cinematic fashion, and generally presents war as existing in a moral void where, after all, the participants are attempting to slaughter each other.  Good manners seem like something of an irrelevance when the bullets begin to fly.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film remains mired in the results its own incestuous matings with Clint Eastwood-Era cliche.  Soldiers talk about their mothers in a church at night.  Isolated and demoralised soldiers face down overwhelming odds.  Soldiers improvise powerful weaponry from a everyday objects and some explosive.  A charismatic, strong-but-silent soldier buys it in the last reel prompting many in the audience to pine ""Oh... I liked him!""<br/><br/>And such obviousness is, frankly, the least of the film's worries.  In a pivotal (if practically sepia-tinted) scene Captain Dale Dye adds another silver-haired martial patriarch to his already extensive Cv of such characters, and expresses the view that sending a squad of men after one paratrooper because of his mother is simple foolishness, on a purely mathematical level if nothing else.  His CO offers a devastating counter-argument which is... nonsensical, frankly.<br/><br/>As the scene closes, the CO having read out a very admirable letter by Abraham Lincoln, he has not made the case for his proposed military venture. He hasn't made the case for anything, actually.  In fact, if the letter has a message it is that young men die in war and tragically that's inevitable and the bereaved parents should be proud of their sacrifice.  Even if one agrees with this sentiment it is still rather difficult to see how it supports the case for sending a squad to find Jimmy Ryan.  Indeed, it would appear to run utterly counter to it!  But presumably everybody - including the otherwise reliable Captain 'Calm Down Son' Dye - is too caught up in the moment to still be, you know, thinking or anything.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the characterisation of the squad themselves is largely cardboard-cut-out.  A group of very able young actors are all saddled here with underdeveloped characters, all of whom appear to have been freshly unearthed from a metaphorical toybox where these lead soldiers have presumably been languishing since 1977.  Only the ironically-named Sergeant Horvath truly impresses, and that is as much because of the way in which Tom Sizemore masterfully transforms cliche into archetype.  It is surely plain to all that had this film involved any lengthy sequences in a French or Italian town, the good Sergeant would have shacked up with the madam of the local whorehouse in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>This film is something of a Jekyll & Hyde then - quite honestly it's far too exciting to be genuinely anti-war, and perversely far too glib and simplistic on the subject of heroism and sacrifice to be an effective memorial to those who gave their lives.  It's a shame that Spielberg did not choose to make a film that was in one camp or the other rather than straddling both in this way.  As a technical achievement this film should not be missed, but it should not be mistaken for more than it is - a glorified 1970s war movie.  Any who truly doubt this should reflect that the makers of this film saw no moral complications in adapting it into a succesful series of computer games, in which war is once again an exciting and heroic game."

","From the literally breath taking opening sequence, which immediately became a standard which newer movies would only try to touch (""Gladiator"") to the brilliant photography and sound, unprecedented cinematic achievements that Spielberg became very fond of (I think he used the ENR process in ""Minority Report"" as well) and the Oscar worthy performances of every single leading actor. So what exactly is missing, what possible thing makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" one of the best and not maybe the best war movie of all time. It's the final message. I though that just ending the movie with the elderly Ryan, comforted by the thought that he was indeed a good man who lived his life the best he could was just to trivial to be inserted in the movie. And of course Spielberg had to take a long final shot of the American flag, despite the fact that the movie was almost completely fictional when it came to the plot. But despite these flaws the movie is spectacular and is one of the best movies of 1998, falling in second place to ""The Thin Red Line"" which should have won every Oscar it was nominated for. But then again, loosing to ""Shakespeare In Love"" hurts every bit as much. A visual triumph. War never looked so real and brutal. 8/10"

","When I first saw the trailer for Private Ryan, I had high expectations, because Spielberg's last 2 wars films "" Empire of the Sun and Schinders List "" were amazing, so I couldn't wait to see Saving Private Ryan, and after seeing it, I was very impressed and pleased with what I saw, but I think it could have been much better.   The ending of the film left me feeling dissapointed, because I thought the ending of the film was just too nice, and you probably think what the hell I am going on about, but the truth of the matter is that my Girlfriends Grandfather was at Normandy, and he told me that even though they triumphed over the Germans, it didn't make it easier to carry on because they were used to all the bloodshed and the tragedy of World War 2 is much worse than we all think because the whole situation was a complete tragedy of war, and once told me all about what happened amongst the madness I wasn't expecting the film to end the way it did, so I went out and actually researched a bit about what happened before seeing the film, and I just don't think that they covered it well enough for me to be totally satisfied.

","I like to contrast ""Saving Private Ryan"" with ""Thin Red Line.""  Both came out in 1998, and both deal with WWII from the American perspective.  Yet it would be difficult to find two more radically different films.  Each has strong and weak points.  ""Saving Private Ryan's"" strong point is its intense realism.  Viewers who were used to the traditional WWII movies of the '40's or '50's, or even later WWII epics, were not prepared for the intense violence of this film.  For the first time, we saw what sighted-in MG-42's and a line of Mausers can do to advancing troops.  This was not gratuitous. It is important for us to remember that the Nazis did not simply fall over. The allies, including our own soldiers, had to fight very hard to beat them.<br/><br/>Yet ""Saving Private Ryan's"" strength doesn't go nearly as deep as ""Thin Red Line.""  SPR is at heart a sharpened version of all the WWII movies that came before.  It is a very good war movie, but that's all it is.  There is no deeper exploration of the characters or the nature of humanity.  That's not a criticism, just an observation."

","Saving Private Ryan was a very good war film, but not a scratch on the Great Escape. The film follows the story of Private James Francis Ryan, whose brothers have been killed during the war. We follow Captain John Miller and his team accross France looking for Ryan, who is to be returned home. Throughout the movie thee are many refernces the Easy Company and th 101st Airborn, on which Band of Brothers mini series was based.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the action involved but mostly because of the strong cast. Tom Hanks' performance was superb.<br/><br/>The Great Escape was definately the best war film I've ever seen, and is so much better than Ryan because of its superior cast, script and action. The first 15 mins of Ryan is extremely gory, which will entertain some people. Band Of Brothers is just as good as Saving Private Ryan, and there are countless similarities between the two.<br/><br/>Overall, Saving Private Ryan was a very good film by Steven Spielberg, with excellent performances from the likes of Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Matt Damon. However, this does not make it the greatest war film ever made. For that, I believe, you should look at The Great Escape."

","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>I cannot begin to say how much I loved this movie. Probably the most engrossing plot line of any war movie. I liked the story, especially at the end because the end really makes the film what it is, which is amazing. The entire point of the movie is summed up in one line: ""Tell me I've lived a good life."" Ryan wants to have lived a good life because almost a whole squad died to bring him home. This is the genius of the movie, because the mission is so deadly, just for saving one man.<br/><br/>The end battle is brutally violent. One guy gets stabbed slowly through the heart, a couple are blown up, and just about everyone else gets shot. The few that are left at the end are in hysteria. This movie does an excellent job of proving just how insane war can be, because they sacrificed so many people just to save one."

I was still bothered by the beginning.<br/><br/> (SPOILERS) We're taken into Hanks' ""horror-of-it-all""  shell-shocked world in the first few minutes, then they reach safety behind a berm, he grabs his radio man, sees that his face is missing and tosses him aside like yesterday's newspaper, and then tries to use a shot up radio. Some guy gets a ricochet in the helmet, is told how lucky he is, then gets watermeloned. Visual gags? This after watching guys get torn in half by the most enveloping surround-sound machine guns and shells to ever reach the big screen. It kind of made me wonder where the movie was going. A deafeningly fictional account of war showing us how horrible it is? Okay, great, I'm totally there, now am I supposed to laugh? Ha ha. I've been a War Channel junkie since watching Victory at Sea on PBS in my Garanimals, and if the Insomnia Channel's got Richard Burton giving em' the what-for or even Kojak piloting a Sherman I am totally there as well, but don't overwhelm me with awesome auditory and visual effects and then fail to effectively draw the line between serious and sarcastic determination. Okay, no problem, time to relax, tell us about yourselves. Wow, what an assault. Take your time filling us in on the plot. (The scene back on the rolling farmland with the mother and her four stars was IMO the best scene in the movie.) Okay, so you're not going to blow up a dam or smoke cigars in the Eagle's Nest, that's fine, so the rest of the movie is a nitpicker, because it all looks great, but if you sense the fatalism and the mission is not to outwit the enemy toward victory (! ...Winston rules), then the vignettes on the way to your fate are all you have.  The countryside and all kept me going nearly three hours in the theater, but zipping around with the DVD...okay, gripes on the vignettes...that sniper tower was not 450 yards away...three civilians left in the village, all hanging out out on the recently remodeled second floor veranda...if a wall falls down and the enemy is pointing guns at you, you open fire immediately (they would)...hey guys, keep your head(s) down, or at least show us somebody representing a sentinel, especially in a scene in which we're not sure if you've taken out that position...that half-track didn't see you?...a couple of sparkling ""tankbusters!"" straight from the Reno Air Races do a fly-over and it's surrender-monkey time?

","I'm in two minds about this one, folks...<br/><br/>The opening is magnificent, possibly the greatest achievement in US film history to this date. The reality of these sequences are breathtaking, and Spielberg (along with his cast and crew) should get enormous credit for it. As a whole, however, this one is a disappointment.<br/><br/>In spite of the marvellous work of recapturing the stress and anguish of the common soldier of a major modern military conflict, I would say that Spielberg and his script-writer spoils most of it by creating a line of clichés, both when it comes to the characters involved and the dialogue between them. In my opinion, there is no place in a feature like this one for the kind of conversations the characters get involved in. I'm thinking here mainly of the pathetic attempts to turn everyone of the main characters into noble heroes, and do it just in time before the great German assault. Which brings me to another point of complaint: the portrayal and behaviour of the German soldiers. They are (with a single exception) anonymous characters whos only role in this film is to get gunned down by the invincible (well, I'm overstating this in order to prove a point, but you'll (hopefully) get the idea) American troopers. I'm the first to admit that the combat scenes are formidably done, set with an accute sense of reality to them that's rare in WWII related films. Nevertheless, Spielberg falls into another pitfall by portraying his single German identifiable soldier as a traitor, both to his own countrymen and his American captors. This is all in the spirit of the classical dehumanisation of the Germans in Hollywood WWII-productions. They're usually in any feature just to be used as extras, mowed down in the pursuit of freedom. I feel that a greater depth is lost when these stereotypes are repoduced yet again in a feature that promised to be (and perhaps still is) a classic. In spite of these reservations, I would like to congratulate Mr. Spielberg and his cast and crew on a great achievement, only sligthly tarnished by the points I've mentioned above."

","It's hard to argue Spielberg can't shoot a beautiful picture.  Rarely, if ever, has a film so accurately portrayed the horrific consequences of war.<br/><br/>That said, despite excellent acting jobs by the cast, the film suffers from a frequent Spielberg curse - that of the oh-so-obvious moral theme and the dreaded ""bookends"".<br/><br/>The scenes of the old man weeping at the end of the film, in my mind, ruins its message.  Clearly, after the scene on the bridge where Miller (Hanks) tells Ryan (Damon), ""earn this"", we can see all of the evils and horrors this man has absorbed and will carry for the rest of his life.  It is unnecessary to see the older Ryan, fifty years later, having proved he took his captain's words to heart.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's still a great film - and one that's worth seeing, if not for all of the actors, who were somewhat unknown at the time.<br/><br/>It is not, however, worth seeing Ted Danson in any way, shape, or form."

","SPR is really two movies, the one gutsy and innovative, the other improbable and in need of much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. The first twenty minutes of SPR deal with the realities of the landing on Normandy Beach, by the elite US Army Rangers. This is the movie with the level of gore and computer pyrotechnics that Hollywood, as part WWII war propaganda machine was totally unwilling, let alone incapable of showing. This was what was missing from a half century of war movies. The gruesome nature of true combat, the psychological effect on even trained soldiers are impeccably portrayed. On the other hand, after the landing has been achieved, we're thrown into a platoon of Rangers who are saddled with the unlikely task of locating a trooper (private Ryan) because all his brothers have already been killed. Although the movie now and then returns to it's war movie roots, the premise is so unlikely as to lose the viewer.

","It may be silly to say this, but I feel like I just survived World War II. But that's silly, of course I never fought in World War II.  I'm only eighteen years old.  But I still feel like I survived the war, because I just watched Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>With most reviews I write for IMDB, I begin writing with a sense of purpose. I know what I want to say and how I want to say it.  This time I'm at a loss.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" shocked me out of any senses I had left, it disturbed me more than many other movies films ever had.  In fact, the only comparable film I can even think of is another by Spielberg, ""Schindler's List.""  Both classify as what I call ""super-realism.""  The film is so realistic, so believable that one immediately forgets that they are watching actors on celluloid and is transported to the actual event.<br/><br/>Such is the case with this entire film, especially the opening D-Day invasion.  The outstanding acting crew of Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, among others, become real soldiers.  We fight along side them. When people suffer, we cannot help but feel their pain.<br/><br/>I think the most striking thing about this film from a technical perspective was the phenomenal cinematographer of Janusz Kaminski.  As he did with ""Schindler's List,"" Kaminski achieves a consistent newsreel effect, but this time the camerawork is more frantic, more likely to take us by surprise. Particularly during the D-Day sequence, we are as confused and blind-sided as many of the actual soldiers, and this adds to the intensity.  Beyond Kaminski, everybody involved deserves a standing ovation, or perhaps more fittingly, a salute for making a film this great.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm getting hysterical, and I really don't want to.  Suffice it to say that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a phenomenal film capable of extraordinary emotional impact, able to make us week, tremble, and practically scream out with near-agony.  This film conveys the truth about war, and only those who do not fear the truth will be able to watch it.  Of course, a warning is needed.  Few films are as graphically violent as this one, but few have as much of a reason to be.<br/><br/>If nothing else I've yet said made any sense, maybe this will.  See ""Saving Private Ryan.""

This is a military boot camp training film as it can and should be with all the chaos, sound, and death given straight up.  It turned my stomach as it should anyone else's, whoever has one.  This is how war must be presented on screen to convince others of its total destructiveness before decision-makers decide to enter it and before hero-wanna-be's go too rah rah by joining it.

","The opening, twenty minute scene offered me more than most of the rest of the film. It should have been more heavily edited, and the tricks that Spielberg has used so successfully in his past blockbusters could (and should) have been foregone in this picture. I have never given him much credit as a filmmaker beyond his ability to make films that lots of people like to see: which is worth something, it's true, but with the exception of Schindler's List I haven't found much to look at in his films and even less to pay attention to in terms of plot. Most of his films, SPR even, are the basic western prototype, with good guy v. bad guy. That can be fine, too. But I really wanted him to convince me of something, to move me, with this film. I was heavily persuaded by the wonderful interview piece by Hendrik Hertzberg in The New Yorker a few weeks ago into believing that Spielberg was trying to make a smart, difficult, realistic film, and to some degree he did. But where was the swearing? Is it true that only white men fought in WWII? Did soldiers really, even in the heat of battle, immediately dive into the pockets of their dead buddies for the ""Dear Mom and Dad"" letters? I don't know the answers to these questions yet. I think this is an important film. I think many scenes were filmed very well. I think it would be a very meaningful and intense film for a WWII veteran: for those, like me, who did not fight in that war, I think it missed something to make me feel invested, to really move me.  I'm not an overly-callous or violent person, nor do I in any way *enjoy*--that is, take real pleasure in--heavy -duty war scenes, yet I never had to look away: and it seems that I should have felt compelled to do that at some point, and I went into this film expecting that."

Now, let me tell you what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>The whole thing about saving a private whose brothers have all been killed isn't at the root of this story, it is just a pretext to put some men in life or death situations and see how they react. The whole movie is a metaphor of WAR, all wars. Wars are used to have more lands, more power. Thousands, millions of men die in a war to please these people who want these lands or this power. <br/><br/>In the movie, men fight and die for something that seems so insignificant: the life of one man. All these men get slaughtered for that ONE thing that is so important for some but seems so stupid to us. So, The movie is in fact a transposition of war in a context where we know all of the characters so that we don't see a man who dies just as a simple private but as a human being. I think that was the only way to show us all the horror of WAR itself, and I think Spielberg knew that."

The way the American GIs are ""slaughtered"" is unbelievable.  The film has the shock value of the 'nam films, but also has the feelgood factor in the fact that the enemy gets what he deserves.  Personally I didn't have any sympathy for the surrendering Nazis being shot, especially after the results of one of them being released.  Tom Hanks' character is excellent - a ruthless killing machine with a sensitive school teacher.

","A lot of people had some great things to say about this film, i'm gonna lay them all together:<br/><br/>1. This movie rode on the battle scenes!  Although the reality and brutality shown is unprecedented in the war film genre, the actions scenes aren't supposed to carry the movie, although apparently they can and did for SPR.<br/><br/>2. Any depth?  I find it funny that Kubrick and Speilberg were close friends, because Kubrick is an intellectual and an artist where Speilberg is just a very succesful hollywood director.  I can't help but compare Full Metal Jacket with Saving Private Ryan.  The main difference is that FMJ is lacking the same number of barrels of blood, and it replaces that with irony, cynicism, and black comedy.  The final message of SPR ""Earn This"" is powerful but not very intellectually challenging, compared to all the messages flying through FMJ.<br/><br/>3. Being a Canadian (we fought the hardest beach on D-Day and got the farthest inland) I find it difficult to but this whole ""I'm an american and that makes me a rambo!"" The flag waving wasn't excessive but the ending ""rambo"" scene seemed contrived: ""Good thing that god sent 7 americans to guard this bridge!""...I don't buy it!<br/><br/>4. It is deplorable the way that Speilberg lacked any compassion for the enemy; he made no attempt to humanize them. I watched as germans who were surrendering were shot, but I hated them so much that I was glad they were. And for that I'll never forgive Speilberg.  It is commendable that he could make me feel such strong emotions, but these Germans are people too! Everyone walking out of the theatre is getting this subtle message ""Look what the Germans did to us!""  That's not right and that's not a good anti-war message!<br/><br/>Overall I commend Speilberg for leaving a record of WWII (and normandy) which will stick with us forever."

They always look the same, they always say the same, they are the same thing each time I see one. But Steven Spielberg just has told us that a warlike movie might be a GOOD movie. He did a great job at the Schindler's list, and he did it again in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The reality of this movie is even scary. It makes you think what would happen if a war would start now, and what would I do on front of somebody that would shoot all my partners. Would I be strong enough? He is asking that to each person that watches the movie. He is asking that. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? That is why I think is a scary movie! It looks so real that makes you think you are one of those people, and that in any time, the guy next sit will get shot. Or even that yourself is about to get shot.<br/><br/>
Not everybody is ready for a war. Most of the people is not ready for a war. And many people is not even ready to see one of the best movies ever done!<br/><br/>I can't believe Shakespeare in love was considered better for the acadamics. That was a shame.

","This is not an easy film to watch. Clearly, that was not its intent.  <br/><br/>The story begins in current time at the Normandy American Cemetary in France.  An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled toward a single grave.  When he arrives there, his memory takes a different journey back to the beaches below on the date, 6 June 1944.<br/><br/>From this moment on, especially for the ensuing 25 minutes, we are thrust into a story that, if it is hard to view, must certainly have been harder to live.  As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most powerful statements ever put on film.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, two brothers surnamed Ryan have died on the beaches of Normandy.  Another has died within a week in the Pacific.  It is discovered that a sole surviving brother has parachuted somewhere in France. It is the assignment of a survivor of Normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him home.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut-wrenching.  However, the movie isn't all blood and gore; it's the story of young men and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the evil that they saw.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks heads the cast as Capt. John Miller, the man who is given the mission to find Pvt. Ryan and bring him home.  In one sense, it works against the film to know that Matt Damon plays Pvt. James Ryan, but not so much that you can't appreciate the nuances which Miller and his platoon come up against time and time again during their mission.<br/><br/>I agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience, into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening moments until the film's end.  It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in danger.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>My vote:  11!!"
"Taz-49","10","0","0","16 December 1999"," Graphic, tense, real.
","Saving Private Ryan (SPR) is a film like no other before it.  For the first time ever the realism and gruesome detail of war is there for all who dare to face it.  Starting on perhaps the most significant day in history, D-Day, it follows the story of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his band of soldiers as they search for one James Ryan (Matt Damon), who has lost all three brothers and has been given a ticket home to be with his mother.<br/><br/>The soldiers sent to save Private Ryan question the motive of risking eight lives for one; a stranger, a faceless name for which few survive in trying to complete their mission to get Ryan home safely.<br/><br/>The footage is graphic.  When the hatches on the landing boats open, bodies are literally torn apart by high calibre machine gun bullets.  Booming explosions, agonizing screams, the whine of bullets richocheting.  At the conclusion of the initial battle, all that remains is a sea of blood washing ashore.  It is immersive and I for one was left speechless and literally shaking.<br/><br/>Some have criticised the acting, in particular the relative 'unknowns' in the supporting cast, but I believe such criticisms are harsh.  The quality of the supporting cast, with Tom Sizemore and Ed Burns, plus a cameo by Ted Danson combined to make the acting quite good.  Tom Hanks, as always, was Oscar-worthy, portraying the huge burden of an ordinary English teacher leading men into battle, knowing many men under his command will not be going home.<br/><br/>SPR is definitely the best 'war' film, and one of the best films period. The very least you should get out of Saving Private Ryan is an appreciation of war and what those men experienced in trying to protect the world's freedom.  Lest We Forget."
"christgla","Null","0","0","15 December 1999"," Saving Private Ryan has outstanding battle sequences, but little else to add
","Steven Spielberg received rave reviews last year when his movie Saving Private Ryan made it to the multiplexes in the United States and Europe.<br/><br/>Because of this my expectations where quite high, although I had some fears that the director best known for movies like JAWS, E.T. and more recently Jurassic Park would lack the skill of making the transition from pure entertainment into serious drama. To be fair Saving Private Ryan is not his first stab at serious movie-making. Spielberg directed the excellent Schindlers List in 1993.<br/><br/>Sadly when I went to see Saving Private Ryan last fall my high expectations where proved wrong. The only thing that makes this  film stand out compared to other war-movies are the much talked about battle-sequences which are outstanding in conveying the brutality of war.<br/><br/>But a movie of this magnitude can not stand on battle sequences alone. It needs substance and Saving Private lacks it all. The characters are only mildly interesting. You do  not care about their plight and ordeal. When not fighting for their lives they engage in a quasi-philosophical discussion about the validity of their mission. Is it right to sacrifice a handful of soldiers with the purpose of rescuing one man?(Private Ryan) The question is an intriguing one but it takes up too much time at the expense of character-development.<br/><br/>We don't really get to know their motives, their fears and what makes them happy. This is what separates good movies from bad ones. To me this is just another action-movie but with little else to add.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the movies which are made today emphasizes style and action at the expense of real substance. One of the reasons for the excellent reviews it has received must be that the public and critics alike where overwhelmed by the outstanding battle sequences and it's realistic depiction of gore in 20th century combat. But as I have said earlier that does not necessarily make for a compelling movie.<br/><br/>For those of you who share my opinion with the respect of this movie I highly recommend Das Boot by Wolfgang Petersen , The Iron Cross by Sam Peckinpah and Paths of Glory by Stanely Kubrick. All in their own right superb movies that in every respect are better than Saving Private Ryan with the exception of the battle-sequences."

Unlike many who believe Schindlers List has been his masterpiece, I feel ET was a greater acheivement. As good as Schindlers List was (and it was very, very good), its impact seemed at times forced. All this aside, nothing could prepare me for Saving Private Ryan. The film is not the work of a great director, it is the work of a world-class artist. It is stunning. It is devastating. It works where it should not work. It works where you do not want it to work. It is a simple war film. It is an intellectual challenge. It is cold and distant. It is raw and emotional. I have never seen or experienced anything quite like it before. The only film I can remember reacting to in such a way is Pasolinis great (and repugnant) film Salo. Both are kicks in the gut. Both (and I'm sure there are not many admirers of Salo out there) are cries from the depths that eventually by their ends not only expose human evils, but also depict hope and dignity.

","For a war film which purports to adhere to great levels of realism, here are a few thoughts: Having ""been there"" I can attest to the general realism of the film...ie: the panic and confusion on the assault beach, and the ""pop-popping"" of the cooling German 20mm machine gun. But there are two big exceptions: GI's are always ravenous and always exhausted. The characters in this film weren't real...they never ate and they never slept. Just imagine how much energy was expended with the ""real GI"". First; they probably got little or no sleep the night before the assault and then expended high amounts of nervous energy and adrenalin in the landing craft on the way to the beach. Second, the extraordinary life and death situation ON the beach would have depleted massive reserves of strength, and also raised adrenalin levels to the critical point.  Lastly, when the beach was secured and the battle over, these men would have been near to or considerably past a state of exhaustion. Further into the film, we see the squad traveling considerable miles on foot, and like the Energizer Bunny, they just kept going, and going and going.... Lastly: Hanks was the wrong actor for the part."

","This movie was great! I've seen a lot of war movies but this one is the best by far. Great character development, loads of detail and emotion. Spielberg goes into a very great amount of detail with every scene. Bullets are flying everywhere and unlike GI Joe, when a group of people fire hundreds of rounds people are bound to get killed. This movie really puts things into perspective and shows you just how many sacrafices are made during war, too many to say the least. Makes you apreciate the type of life that you got now and why you are able to live that life. The acting in this film was excellent as expected with a Hanks, Spielberg type of movie. Not for people with weak stomaches that for sure."

","Saving Private Ryan is something quite special in the 1990's pantheon of Hollywood movies- it stays with you long after you have left the cinema and truly makes you reflect on what you have just seen. Artistically it is a triumph- the cinematography is breathtaking, shot as it is with a handheld documentary style and the performances too are superb..with naturalistic dialogue and astoundingly realistic battle scenes. It works so well because it defies the cliches laid before it as a genre which even FULL METAL JACKET and PLATOON  fell unwittingly into...SAVING PRIVATE RYAN acknowledges that death can come to all or any of the characters at any time, brutally, even when you expect the characters you admire the most(through careful development) to survive. And that is how it should be, because that is the nature of true conflict. The only downpoint is the portrayal of the Americans as having been the sole Allied forces involved in the war and beach landings when this was clearly not the case.Saving Private Ryan is moving, powerful and thought provoking. One of the best WORLD WAR II films ever mad and can stand proundly next to the classics of that genre.Highly recommended, though traumtic."

","Saving Private Ryan is the recent film directed by Steven Spielberg. A director known for his audience manipulation and subsequent audience appeal, he has stated in interviews that like Schindler's List (1993), Saving Private Ryan is a story that is meant to objectively portray war.<br/><br/>The story begins on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944: D-day. At 6:30am that fateful morning, an initial assault wave lands at Omaha Beach. The story proceeds to follow the story of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the men he commands. The first thirty minutes of the film includes some of the most graphic violence known to the screen. With the aid of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List), Spielberg dispels any preconceived 'romantic' notions of the 'last Great War.' The pace is quick and the film visually mimics news cameras of the period. The fighting is presented as grim and unglamorous. With use of various hand-held camera techniques and astounding sound effects the audience becomes part of the war. Another fresh technique employed is intermittent periods with Hank's character is surreally caught up in the moment. One must see this film just for it's visual and aural aspect. It truly is a lesson of history. After surviving the initial attack, Captain Miller is given a new objective. To save the life of one, Private Ryan (Matt Damon). This comes to be due to the fact that of the four Ryan's that entered the war, one remains alive, or at least is thought to be alive. His life is worth risking that of Miller's and his men. From this point onward, I reconsidered the film's title to be ""Saving Matt Damon"". The contrived Hollywood plot was presented thus forth. Perhaps the life of the one is worth saving considering the lives of the many. I sure as hell would like to be that one life. And although a few characters suffered poignant moments, adding to much of the film's humanity, my mind could not get over the added fiction within the history."

","Saving Private Ryan certainly deserves some accolades.  The now infamous Omaha Beach scene is probably the best-choreographed war sequence I've ever seen.  It captures the horrors of war in many respects - the confusion, the bloodiness, the futility of soldiers being no more than cannon fodder. The direction is, of course, stellar - after all, we are talking about Spielberg.  The choice to mute the colors palette to washed out greens and greys is an especially nice touch.<br/><br/>However, Spielberg refuses to lay off the schmaltz.  Oftentimes, the scenes where he injects some humanity or includes the everyman ""average joe"" character (in this case the soldier-interpreter) to me appears forced. The opening and closing scenes also revel in this schmaltz, trying to bring the story into modern times and connecting it to today's audience.  Spielberg tried something similar with ""Schindler's List,"" with the stone-piling scene at the end.  To me, both movies work well enough on their own without these extras.  As good of a director as Spielberg is, he often resorts to these over-the-top techniques to jerk a tear or to invoke sadness.  I wish he would show more restraint or find a less obvious way of expressing the same emotion.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I liked the movie well enough to give it a 7 and gladly recommend it.

That is not to say that I necessarily consider this to be an inferior war film, but rather that it is not the complete war film.  This is a Spielberg film, and it plays to his strengths, with magnificent special effects which bring to bear the inherent nakedness of war.  I couldn't help but be, for wont of a better word, shell-shocked. By preserving the film in this form, almost as a documentary, Spielberg would have been onto a winning formula from the cinematic viewpoint (although perhaps not from the bank balance viewpoint).  Unfortunately Spielberg did as Spielberg does, putting into place a script and moralising undercurrent, both lacking in any sort of subtlety, which might work well in films like Jaws or ET, but serve only to blunt one's reactions to the raw images of the inhumanity of war.<br/><br/>In sum, I consider this to be a visually astonishing and moving film, but one which is ultimately impaired by the banalities and simplicity of the screenplay."

I didn't think it was THAT depressing, but the fact that 8 men set out to bring back one and that most of the 8 (I won't say how many in case you are the only one who hasn't seen it.) die trying to bring him back is a formula that I have a hard time with emotionally.

The majority of war films will simply have a soldier shot and fall to the ground with a minimum of blood lost, if this were the case then there would not have been so many soldiers who returned from wars minus limbs.<br/><br/>This film deals with many of the human aspects of war, similar in certain ways to "" The Thin Red Line "", soldiers are expected to obey orders without thought or question, no matter how impossible or crazy the orders may be.<br/><br/>A solid cast hold this film together for 2hr 40minutes, with Tom Hanks well cast in the role of Captain John Miller and Mat Damon as Private James Ryan.

For those who actually participated, it took them from 06:45 hours until well after 12:00 hours.  That's around 6 hours or more.  Just think of what hell that was for those who landed on Omaha Beach that day which will be remembered as the LONGEST DAY.  Spielberg couldn't have assaulted us with 6 hours of combat footage, so he did the next best thing:  'e got us off the beach on the quick.<br/><br/>The story itself is deep in history, not just of WWII when they mention the story of the Brothers Sullivan who died on the same ship in the Pacific, but also mentioning Mrs. Bixby's loss in the Civil War which is also a cornerstone of the plot.  Think of the sacrifice real people make on the homefront when they send their loved ones off to war.  This sacrifice cuts to the core of the story.  Should we sacrifice all of one woman's off-spring for God and Country?  No is the resounding answer.

","The first time I saw this, I was with an aviation camp and we went at night to see this. About 45 minutes into the film, I fell asleep and did not wake up until the end credits. It was not out of boredom, but rather the tiredness of flying planes and telling dirty jokes at 1AM (Typical stuff at an aviation camp). Anyway, I gave Saving Private Ryan another try and it still didn't go with me. The action sequences at the beginning were okay, but the flashback technique did not work for me. At about an hour and 35 minutes into the film, my attention span shrunk. This did not really seem like Spielberg at all. The storyline seemed very boring. It was mostly a series of very long fights."
"Bad PR","8","0","0","6 November 1999"," A great action movie, but certainly not much of a drama.
","The sad thing about this movie is the way the story takes a backseat to the gratuitous and often unrealistic level of violence. Previously to seeing this I had heard a LOT about how overblown the violence was. I've read several letters in the newspaper from actual WWII veterans who said the movie was unrealistic; and one of my co-workers (who just happened to be a First Lieutenant in Vietnam) also said that the violence was ""overkill"". Watching this movie, I really got the impression that Spielberg was just using the story of Private Ryan as an excuse to make an extremely bloody war movie that every one would go see because they had heard that it was more gory than ""Braveheart"". You'd really think that no one died in 1944 Europe unless they were exploded or had their guts blown out, or were decapitated, or disemboweled or something. When Tom Hanks pulls his radio guy over and his face was gone, I was like ""Oh please, give me a break!"". This was much more of an action movie than a war drama. I thought that ""The Thin Red Line"" was a much more thoughtful and dramatic movie that didn't rely on such copious amounts of violence. It was a far better picture. As was ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The Deer Hunter"", and ""Platoon"", and Apocalypse Now"" etc., etc."

","What makes Speilberg's WWII epic ""Saving Private Ryan"" so great is the fact that it takes a plot from a 1940's war propaganda film starring, oh...perhaps John Wayne... and makes it real. The plot line is simple: Eight men are assigned to find one man whose brothers have all been killed and send him home. The question is, is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? <br/><br/>Speilberg, in all of his brilliance, manages to take this simple story and uses it as both an excellent character study and as a vehicle for  graphic depictions of World War II: No more is there blood and glory....Just horror and fear. These men who are fighting aren't the fearless war heroes of all the propoganda films of the 40's. On the contrary, they are normal, average men who are afraid and who hate this mission. They aren't just actors...They are you and I in these situations, presenting our humanity and our frailtiess in chaos.<br/><br/>This might be the first film to depict World War II in such a way. Of course, it helps that it is backed by an excellent cast (Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Ted Danson to name only a few) that knows how to portray each character in memorable ways. But also, this might be the most gruesome of all wars films, not beating around the bush when it comes to the realistic violence that resulted from the war. Limbs are blown off, brains are shot out....The violence is aplenty, but not in a way to glorify it, as many war films do. No, this film uses it to reiterate the original idea: War is hell...no, it's worse, and it's not something be glorified. These men sacrificed their lives for us, being no better than us and no worse....And if it was you in the situation, you would have to do the same. Respect that.<br/><br/>There's no question about it. This film *should have* won best picture, and it was absolutely robbed. If ""Shakespeare in Love"" was one millionth this film, it might have had a chance at competing against it.... How it beat this masterpiece is beyond me....<br/><br/>Ignore the foolish academy.

","First let me say that the battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan are the most realistic and horrifying I have ever seen. I think most people will have some images of that film with them forever. My problem with the film is that it makes it seem like it was all worth while, not only the search for Ryan, not only WWII, but war in general. I'm hoping it was intended as an anti-war film that fell well short of the mark, but the opening and closing shots of the stars and stripes says that this wasn't the case. With the flag fluttering in the breeze, America (and the allies included I presume) fights just wars, fights GOOD wars, and Ryan being saved and then going on to live a decent, honest life, raising a family etc. is proof that it was worth it. Maybe the fast pace of the film compared to other (and what I consider better) war films like The Thin Red Line or Gallipoli is what makes it so popular. (Just compare the final scenes of those two films to the final scene of SPR). The message I got from Saving Private Ryan wasn't one of the futility of war. It was a much more realistic portrayal of the horrors modern warfare but, in the end, a romantic view none the less."

My personal favourite is Tom Sizemore and a german soldier throwing their helmets at each other, having run out of ammo, but these moments come along at a steady rate.<br/><br/>I know that some people will appreciate the film as a whole, but hate the modern day beginning and ending.

","Saving Private Ryan managed to do to me what only a combination of action/drama/comedy movies can do. It kept me at the edge of my seat in the intense battle scenes. The acting was genuinely good. The graphic nature was only excessive in the very first battle scene (it was not necessary to see the guy screaming Mama with his guts out). Otherwise, no other movie has been able to show me the intense horror and the gravity of war. The soldiers did not have romantic deaths like in most other movies about World War II. In American history, I thought only Vietnam was horrific, but this movie surely changed that picture. It is one movie that I absolutely loved, but I don't think I can tolerate seeing it one more time. I am not American and have no relatives who fought in WWII, so I cannot relate, yet I can feel it through this movie. The only other war movie comparable to this one is Glory.

I think that as a whole the cast did an incredible job filling the shoes they were given.  First and foremost, was anyone else absolutely taken by Barry Pepper as Private Roy Jackson?  Ever since seeing this movie I have been glued to my computer watching his fan website for updates on magazine articles and Barry sightings.  This guy is one to pay attention to, he is definitely going to be big.  Those cutting eyes say it all.  Second, Giovanni Ribisi.  His sleepy stare combined with his sensitivity make any one swoon.  This isn't just a phenomenon for Mr. Ribisi, either.  In every other movie he has had a major role in, he has taken over the screen.  How about Edward Burns?  Granted, he does play a New Yorker with an attitude in almost all of his films, but he does it so well we can forgive him for that. This cynical beauty of a guy plays the quintissential smart mouth that we love to hate, and love to love.  I wouldn't mind being the butt of some of his cutting jokes. And how about young Vin Diesel who plays the ill-fated Private Adrien Caparzo.  Though he doesn't make it very far into the movie, he makes a great impression.  I don't know whether I can't get past his great body or his heart melting voice.  And then there's Adam Goldberg.  A talent to be reckoned with.  This guy plays the good smart allick.  The flip side to Edward Burns' biting character, this one is the nice-jerk.  I just hope that Goldberg doesn't get type-cast as the token Jewish guy.  It would sure be a shame, this guy can work the camera.  And what about Jeremy Davies who played Umpum?  I find it hard to comment on him.  It is largely due to the fact that I can't bring myself to like him.  It is not his fault, he was only playing a character.  Was anyone else out there screaming mad when he made it through the final battle?  I would have traded him for Wade (Ribisi) or Pepper (Jackson) any day.  And was anyone else ready to burst into tears of sorrow when we had to bid farewell to both our luscious, silent but gorgeous types?"

It may be flawed and too slow for audiences who found ""The Matrix"" to be thrilling cinema but Compare Malick's believable portrayal of the confused Japanese soldiers (who by the way all behave differently to war's horrors and are individuals) with Stevie's portrayal of the Germans as evil double crossing villains not far removed from the kooky Nazis in his thrilling Indiana Jones trilogy.

","The movie is an artistic masterpiece that works best as a monument to those who fought for the 'Good Guys' during WWII.  The argument that the Germans during the war were not on the bad side is wrong.  That they, on a grunt level, were also just kids stuck in a war is true.  Spielberg does not show this for a reason, he's honoring the sacrifice and victory of our fallen Americans in the war.  The battle scenes are incredible pieces of gut wrenching artistry and the chaotic slaughter of the first 20 minutes means something to the story, but that story fails at achieving its more provocative, yet slightly out of focus ideas.  The ideas are there, and they can be reached through the important viel of the film's realism.  But Spielberg, for all his visual brilliance does not make it work.  In fact, it seems like he is constantly trying to cloud over our thoughts that may come out of the film with a scene that is meant to close out a story that should not be ended so easily.  The men fought and died and lived through that hell for the world we live in today, but instead of letting us contemplate the worth of that sacrifice and allowing those moments of horror to manifest themselves in our minds along side the lives we, as the generations born into that infant world which have taken advantage of this age, Speilberg (and or the screenwriter) has ended the story of that sacrifice.  Ryan works as a metaphor for the men who lived to go home and rebuild, or build lives. But that metaphor has a serious flaw when the character is shown finalizing his internal conflict.  Well, with that, it seems less of a thanks to a generation.  Tom hanks, on the other hand, gives one of his best performances, so does Tom Sizemore (with what little he had to work with). Everyone else overacts.  No kidding.  The dialogue is very bland and repetitive.  Spielberg and Hanks lend them power, but that doesn't hide the awkwardness.  I enjoyed the interested paradox of having an incredibly violent war film be patriot.  It shows us the horror and nobility, both right next to each other, hand in hand.  It shows men facing their own deaths as individuals as a greater good stands in the shadows, but almost completely out of site.  That is important, this is one of the first films to do that.  But there's a better way of characterizing the men than giving them each a monologue in the minutes before the final battle, or simple stereotype characteristics.  Yet this was not what I was thinking when I first saw the film.  As an experience the film works, and like a great film, it stays with you.  But the more I thought about it, the more its moral and metaphorical problems came to the surface.  It's definitely worth seeing, maybe even twice, but it will never provoke its ideas on a deeper level than the logistic banter of the men.  It's almost too visceral.  For more ideas, see The Thin Red Line.  the too films both try to say the same thing (one with a flag, the other with the Earth we fight over), but one succeeds where the other comes just within reach, but not artistically gutsey enough to grab hold and run. They are both about Human dignity in the face of the inhumane.  One encompasses the WWII generation, the other encompasses the entire human race.  We've seen violence, and if we're not trying to survive it, we should be thinking about why it is.  Only then can we overcome it. It's a noble gesture, but impossible.  It's bleak, but then again, we're only human."

","You can say what you want about Spielberg, but you can't deny he's consistent. He dazzles the eyes, the ears, the guts... but the brain remains untouched. I don't think any film has ever given a more realistic rendering of being under fire, but after the action there are only platitudes and more platitudes.<br/><br/>I suggest that those who think this is the greatest war film ever made take a look at Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". Economy of means, sobriety of tone, only the slightest touch of sentiment at the end to humanize the story. Spielberg seems to be a fan of Kubrick's (I noticed some discreet visual references to Full Metal Jacket in the sniper scene) but he's still very far from reaching that level. And he doesn't seem to be making any progress (similar comments can be made about the vastly overrated Schindler's List).<br/><br/>Briefly, Spielberg is a technical master who simply cannot escape the trap of syrupy middle-class sentimentality (with heavy string orchestration by John Williams, bless his heart) that always dissipates the potential impact of his films..."
"DanB-4","9","0","0","25 September 1999"," ""This Ryan better be worth it""
","Saving Private Ryan is an over-whelming thought provoking film which takes the baton from Platoon as the standard for war movies. Not that it is necessarily better, but it certainly raised the bar in technical achievement and graphic violence.<br/><br/>Another winning combination of Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg, the technical achievement of the opening act (D-Day invasion) is worthy of all the praise and awards the movie garnered. Spielberg again shows us, as in ""Schindler's List"", his unique way of depicting violent death as something that happens to real people, not simply a cool effect to rid the plot of bad guys. This 25 to 30 minutes of the film is one of filmmakings all-time great achievements. <br/><br/>Spielberg's real genius in his ""serious"" films is his knack for allowing us to enter inside and feel the chaos and emotions. SPR, Schindler's, The Color Purple and even Jaws surround you rather than hit you in the face.<br/><br/>There is a line spoken by one of the soldiers shortly after they receive their seemingly inane assignment to rescue one man: ""This Ryan better be worth it"". A sort of prophetic statement that to me commented on the man, the mission and the film itself.<br/><br/>A great film, for sure, but not perfect, and certainly not worthy of #7 on the IMDb top 250. The script is a little too clean and clever for a bunch of kids thrown into combat, and it so, so violent and depressing that it is physically exhausting. I feel that after the stellar and gut-wrenching opening act, SPR never lives up to the standard it sets for itself.<br/><br/>However, if the opening and closing acts are even 1% accurate in their depiction of combat, then this movie should be used as war deterrent.<br/><br/>Not Spielberg's best, but certainly a noble film and a technical watershed in movie making.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****."

","Had this movie been hyped as offering the purest carnage visualized with a high degree of technical skill, the advance promotion, at least, would have been honest.  But the film is dirty morally and bankrupt artistically.  Without plausible story, ideology, acting (character), or any redeeming social purpose, this film ends as a here-come-the-marines-just-in-time tribute to John Wayne, but without appropriate credit to its obvious inspiration.  It has all been done before, and much better, except for the artful hype--still Spielberg's outstanding skill.  ""Ryan"" is really ""Jurassic Park"" with German troops and tanks instead of dinosaurs.  Spielberg really succeeds at the level of ""War Comics"" and has earned the admiration of that audience, but adults who pay to see it ought to be ashamed.  ""Dreamworks?""

"DumaNV","10","0","0","22 September 1999"," Setting a higher standard for ""war"" movies
","Every once in a while a movie comes along and sets a new standard for the class.  In this case ""Saving Private Ryan"" has achieved that place in two areas: the ""war"" movie and the ""human condition"" movie.  On one hand ""Ryan"" does not mask, shield, or taint combat in any manner from the viewer and lets the experience of war happen in all of its stark reality.  I have a feeling that any movie depicting war will use ""Ryan"" as a model from now on. The strongest message that the movie sends is that in war there is no motivating sound track and people do die horribly, without mercy, and often without reason.  Drowning in eight feet of water within reach of the beach, applying a bomb that goes off prematurely and having no effect on the target, being shot by an unseen sniper, are all displayed without glory or the indication of some greater purpose being achieved in the end.  What is left are those alive and those that are dead and those that are alive must live with the horror of what they have been though.<br/><br/>But, the really great ""war"" movies are not really about war, but are really about how people react to an extreme condition that they are faced with.  In this case ""Ryan"" moves from one gender to another without the viewer realizing it.  Much has been said and written about the battle scenes in the movie and far too little has been said about the emotion between the squad of soldiers and how they feel about trying to rescue someone they have never met.  In the countless movies I have seen about the same basic topic this one tells the untainted truth about this emotion.  The soldiers do it because they are ordered to but like every American soldier, marine, sailor, or airman that I know, they don't like it and they will let everyone know about it.  But beyond that the film also shows the American combat soldier as they really are: crass, vulgar, dirty beyond belief, prone to raw humor. But where this film excels is the depiction of why they are how they are: long days of stress, fatigue, danger at every moment, living moment by moment.  By the time the troops leave the beach and the horror there, the viewer accepts their condition and forgives their behavior and manner.  Even the word ""forgives"" is bad word to use.  The film generates the emotion in the view that these troops have ""earned"" the right to behave in any manner that they please.  They have paid for that right 1,000 times.<br/><br/>But the humanity prevails in many ways, some large and some small: the raw emotion when one of their squad falls in combat, the sharing of gum from one mouth to another, the group resentment of those who have not been through the hell that they have been though, the appreciation of a piece of music that will relieve them of thinking of their situation for only a moment.  It is these moments in the film that elevates the movie beyond a regular war film into a classic that other films will be measured against.  I have seen ""Ryan"" four times now and it has not failed to generate a strong emotion in me every time.  There are no heroics in this film.  There is only an accurate display of humans, placed in a situation that is beyond belief, who do things because they have to, not because they want to, and to they best they can without reward or commendation.  Their only reward is survival."

The film lacks intelligence, and perhaps lacks a soul as well, despite its patriotic fervor.  Tom Hanks is quite good, though, as the tortured captain whose face is a mask of quiet despair.  In one scene, where the soldiers under his command want to shoot a German prisoner, Hanks turns away, trying to become blind to it all.  His performance and the dazzling cinematography make up for a so-so story and a script containing approximately fifteen coherent sentences (still five or six more than ""Close Encounters,"" though )."

Nevertheless, my father joined the (British) Royal Marines in February 1939 and fought throughout to May 1945, including the Normandy landings.

","Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is wonderfully developed, while the action sequences are second to none. But ultimately ""Saving Private Ryan"" is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered. The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful. You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice. Just throw the bodies out there. In Kosovo we held that number to zero. Such a lovely way to fight a war. In WW II the number was, however many it took. Says something. Spielberg makes this point with the wide-angled shot of the channel filled with Allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can see-a scene incidentally right out of Frank Capra's seminal series ""Why We Fight"" to which this film is indebted whether Spielberg knows it or not.<br/><br/>World War II was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really don't understand it or comprehend it. Spielberg thought he was being ""objective"" in showing war ""as it really was,"" with Americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance (something Capra of course was not able to do). Yes, but to show the ""saving grace"" of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system, because that valor is a fraud. It was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war. Just as it didn't matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft, it was the sheer volume of them that prevailed.<br/><br/>I think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war. Spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war, but while plying the trade he knows so well (seducing the audience) he has trumpeted the glory of war, that old fraud, and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers, only more skillful.<br/><br/>Still it is impossible to say what is right. If we had not won WW II the world today would be vastly different. Totalitarian, imperial, repressive, racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed. They may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence. Who knows? Thank God for the United States and its incredible industrial capacity, because that is what won the war, not individual heroics, much as our tribal minds, along with Spielberg's, would like to believe such fairy tales.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Normally I do not like war movies, but I watched Saving Private Ryan and loved it! It deserves to be among  the top 250 movies. The story is loosely based on a true story of The Sullivan Brothers. There were five brothers that were all put aboard a ship, the ship sunk and they all died in the same day. Imagine how devastating that must have been to that family. Because of the Sullivan Brothers there has been a law passed that siblings cannot serve on the same vessel. 	My father -in-law was a pilot and the only son during the Korean war.  He was a volunteer! His plane crashed on U.S. soil. My husband is the soul survivor and he was then seven months old. My mother-in -law heard the news on the radio. Imagine how devastating that must have been. My husband makes miniature model airplanes.  We have quite a collection of those cute little planes. Every airplane is well researched as my husband goes to National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.  He is very interested in the Pacific Theater - a war buff!  He also corresponds with several veterans. It is really adorable. He loves war movies.  I tend to fall asleep watching them, unfortunately,  but I try to stay awake and understand. We have a good collection of famous war movies, educational videos etc. I purchased Saving Private Ryan along with a very romantic movie, because I thought: I am sure that I will doze off! But no! I watched the entire thing and loved it! 	Let me tell you why I loved it: (1) There is no unnecessary use of curse words. They are used properly there are no exaggerations! I watched  ""Full Metal Jacket,""  I know that those guys curse but every word in that movie is ""F word!"" I hated it. (2) Then the painted faces. They scare me to death! I know it is a form of camouflage but I still get scared. That is what scared me the most in ""Apocalypse Now""  and ""Platoon."" (3) I understood the story in this movie and it is moving. It is nice story telling. Going back in time. Private Ryan being such a nice person makes the movie even better!  I liked two war movies so far,  this one and ""A Midnight Clear."" I must understand the point. Just plain violence does not cut it! People say but that is how war is. Well, I want to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.  I can only take so much. I did not have to go to war. It is just a movie. I do not want to be traumatized all at once in one movie!  (4) I don't like the over emphasis on the use of drugs in movies like ""Platoon""either. There is nothing like that in Saving Private Ryan. That is why I love it! 	My favorite scene: at the end of the movie cemetery, the camera pans and there are all those white crosses:  I felt that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom. Most of us enjoy such freedom undeservingly. But they died for us all.  My favorite quotes: "" All four were in the same company, but after we split them  after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juno."" Ryan: "" Tell her that when you found me, I was here and I was with the only brothers that I have left""."

Another thing that's so annoying is that people are calling this ""the greatest war or anti-war movie ever made.""  It is may be one of the best, but is isn't in the same ballpark as some of the others. This film is meant to show the horrors of war through battle and carnage. Yes that is one way to show it, but the more ""anti-war"" style to show it is to show more humanity and suffering, like ""The Killing Fields"" (the best anti-war film) or ""Born On the Fourth Of July"" (even ""Platoon""). But because of hype, it has the look of an action blood-and-guts type of film. The video stores are categorizing this under ACTION. ACTION. The film had a weak script, but still a story to buoy the film, and an annoying, overly patriotic, beginning and ending, which did play a toll on the film. For a second, you might even think it glorified war. But nevertheless, it is mostly overlooked because of the intensity<br/><br/>        But these people who call this ""the greatest war film ever"" complain about this year's other war companion ""The Thin Red Line."" it was so different from this, taking a different and interesting approach to ""war is hell"" and was a great film, but obviously, flopped.

","After making such inexcusable trash as The Lost World, Spielberg just can't be taken seriously (neither can Tom Hanks, after Forrest Gump), no matter how hard he tries. And in his most recent attempt at redemption, he doesn't succeed in the slightest: He simply cannot refrain from being the typical Spielberg with his heavy-handed, lofty and ultimately sappy direction. The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as Reality :the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I coudn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowdpleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to ""keep it real"", you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. If all the obvious false-note subplots that make this a Spielberg vehicle would be removed (Hanks' trembling hand, the German prisoner's hysterical clowning, one of the privates' ""symbolic"" confrontation with the enemy as a Jew, and so on), SPR's level of realism would have been consistent enough to allow for it's now-classic status. The main reasons to view this film, of course, are the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the Wild Bunch). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and simultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind. The last one,(a small group of men versus a veritable army - hmmm,where have I seen THIS before?) is almost as good, if not for the cheap Hollywood trick at the very end, which finds the movie venturing into Indiana Jones territory. It almost seems that SPR was directed by TWO different people: Spielberg and his WWII battle consultant. On the very primal level, however, the film achieves at least one of its makers' many aspirations: when I exited the theatre, I felt lucky to be alive."

How else could those cemetery scenes have gotten into the movie? Wasn't there someone who could have told him that those were horrible scenes? War veteran, with his sons, daughters, and barbie-doll grandchildren visits Arlington Cemetery and asks his wife if he's lived a good life. I had to look away. It was the most cheesy thing I had ever seen. I felt embarrassed for Spielberg. I thought the scene at the end of Schindler's List was pretty cheesy (""how many more could I have saved, had I sold this car?""), but this was infinitely worse.<br/><br/>Aside from those scenes (and the one with Lincoln's letter...), the movie is okay. It suffers from a weak screenplay, but the action sequences are the grittiest, most realistic, and overall most effective I've ever seen. The cinematography is dazzling, the sound is perfect, and the images horrifyingly real. You'll grip the armrests and live the fear.<br/><br/>But I don't think this movie is deserving of all the praise that's been heaped on it. It will show you, realistically, the horrors of war - and perhaps that's worth a pat on the back for Spielberg. But it could have been better. It could have been much, much better - if only it had a good plot and some real character development!<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, but not the greatest war movie ever.<br/><br/>One more thing - The Thin Red Line was overshadowed by the success of this movie, but was very different and very good.

I cam,e away reminded of the sacrifice that was made so that we can live in freedom today. It reminded everyone that WWII wasn't the neat and tidy war that it sort of gets remembered as. I was moved to tears, and I'm not even an American (the Brits landed too, by the way).<br/><br/>

What a  slap in the face this kind of thinking is to the men and women who have actually stood in the line of fire.  No one can know what war is like, unless they've actually been there.

In this class we pondered the same issues that are discussed by the soldiers in this movie.  In one scene, Hanks says every person that you kill, you have to consider it 20 lives saved, at least he says, that is how you have to think.  Some people would call it rationalizing an irrational act.  Well, this movie is full of these philosophical dilemmas.  <br/><br/>    And while I have heard some people call the bookend gravesite scenes corny and unneeded, I think they add a great touch to the movie.

This movie made me think long and hard about what people my age (20) had to go through just 50 years ago.  When I saw this film in the theater, I was surrounded by members of the WWII generation, and I could see in their eyes that this was almost too real for them.  The ability to create a movie that makes a 20 year old girl in 1999 feel like she was at Normandy in 1944 is an epic talent that should be cherished.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" is beyond a 10.

","Like anyone else I was not only spellbound but also made very uneasy by the opening scene.  There was a specific part of that scene that I have never witnessed in a war movie before, one of stark realism that I can attest to because of a tour in Vietnam.  As the landing craft begin to lower their ramps there is the vision of many of the men being cut down by German machine guns ashore.  I say ""vision"" because you don't hear the sounds of the guns as you would in the average war movie.  Instead what you hear is the sound of the rounds striking the men and the sides of the craft.  This fits with the very real tenet that you never hear the one that gets you. Obviously because of the speed of sound you take the hit before you hear the report providing you're lucky enough to hear it and if you do is not a loud report, rather a sometimes faint one depending upon the distance of the shooter from your position.  I have heard leaves all around me being clipped by enemy fire and can honestly say I don't recall hearing the shots responsible.  This is the realism that Spielberg provided during that scene and it was a bit unnerving.  Later in the film I noticed that after the firefight at the radar station where the American medic was killed, the same number of GI's are seen walking across a field as had walked across another field prior to the contact.  This obvious editing mistake was actually good for me because it put the movie in its proper perspective, the fact that that was what it was; a movie.  Considering the fact that the rest of the thing was brutally realistic I was glad to have had that little error to fall back on.  Otherwise I might have been tempted to believe that it wasn't just a movie at all. My opinion of this film, one of the best of all time if not the top.  I can watch it several times and I will."

Spielberg puts together a good flick, though I still maintain he has not achieved the status of Hitchcock or Kubrik.  The battle scenes were fantastic and by far the most realistic that I have ever seen (not including The Thin Red Line).  Anyone who thinks that Normandy was a glorious day should watch this film (which depicts the landing of the U.S. Army Rangers near Omaha beach, one of the most hellish fights in army history).  And I do have to say that the cast was one of the greatest ensemble casts ever made.  The scene where Hanks reveals who he his to stop a quarrel is just fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, this is NOT the greatest war movie ever made, as some have proclaimed.  For one thing, I just find it patently ridiculous that a platoon of soldiers would be sent deep within enemy lines to save one guy. Maybe that kind of stuff happened, maybe not, but I find it very implausible.  Unfortunately, a movie with a bunch of guys roaming the European theatre fighting Germans would have been worse.  Another thing - one more role with a pompous Tom Hanks and I will vomit!  He's a good actor, to be sure, but jeez.

You will not find action of this kind in any war movie to date.  Now we come to the plot.   War films and plots are usually blurred or non-existent (unless they are non-fiction/attempted true to life films).   In this case we have a fictional story with a plot.  Compared to Platoon and FMJ, this movie HAS a plot.   The movie has peaks and valleys, as do most films. That is how one builds a climax.

It's intense battles with a lot of boredom.<br/><br/>to sum it up:<br/><br/>Patton: better character development<br/><br/>Platoon: uses personal experience to judge a period of time, too much bias to show one side of Vietnam.

I have never seen such a film as this one, Steven Spielberg triumphantly proved to the world once again after ""Schindler's List"", just what a phenomenal director he is, it totally baffled me how he could of crafted such a physically and emotionally complicated with virtual flawlessness. There are two major battle scenes , one in the beginning and one in the end, and they are both extremely harrowing. The first one burns with unflinching realism, you almost feel like you`re right there with the soldiers instead of watching them on a screen. It shows just how terrifying the war really was, every form of anihilation and destruction is captured on film. The second one is a bit more sombre, mainly because the audience has gotten to known the main characters, and after witnessing some of their deaths, our feelings and sympathy and sorrow are evoked. The performances given by Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, and the rest of ""the crew"" (Forgot their names, but are all enormously talented) are all exceptional. They all have diverse personalities, but when they put in serious situations, we powerfully sense their shared emotions of instinct, terror, longing and grief. ""Saving Private Ryan""'s power comes mainly from it`s clear moral, as it proves just how tragic the war really was, and the devastating impact it had on the world and humanity. The story may be fictitious, but the movie still enables us to have a pretty good idea of the savage violence that rampaged the earth during the wars, all while asking the ulimate question; Was there any reason AT ALL why this had to happen?

In one a German soldier, and in the other an American, find themselves in a situation where death at the hands of the enemy is now inevitable. For each, the only remaining option is to beg for mercy, and hope that their communications are understood. But what brings out pathos in the viewer wins little understanding from these soldiers. Therein lies the most gruesome message of all; in war these men have lost the ability to treat others as humans. This contrasts sharply with what we learn of their private lives prior to the start of the war.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. Just as the beach scene (filmed in Ireland) receives acclaim for its realism, the scene on the bridge is filled with tension as the soldiers await the arrival of the tanks. It's ""High Noon"" with Tom Hanks in the role of the sheriff.<br/><br/>Private Ryan plays little role in the film. Perhaps this is why some commentators have said the film lacked depth. They wanted to see how Mrs Ryan was feeling at home. To them I say ""go watch a Lassie movie"""

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is a great movie. It contains the best battle scenes I have ever seen in a film.  Merely on the merits of the film's first half hour, SPR will deservingly have an important place in film history.<br/><br/>And although I think the movie was great, a couple things about it fell just a little short:<br/><br/>1) The contrived bookending sequence with the old man at the cemetary. Wouldn't the story have been just as powerful if told entirely during the war? 2) The script was good, but it pales in comparison to the directing, cinematography, and acting.<br/><br/>This movie had such high ambitions, that it was disappointing to not see Spielberg reach them entirely.  It's like a team that has an amazing season then loses the superbowl.  This film came very, very close to being a nearly flawless masterpiece.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/4 stars  95/100"

","I have only just seen this film on video for the first time and I must say that I regret not having seen it at the cinema (but after sitting through Schindler I was loathe to get an uncomfortable bum for a little bit more Spielberg self glory and pomposity).  Except for a jingoistic 'America is the greatest land in the world' kind of attitude - I thought that this film stood head and shoulders above any other film of this genre and literally shot down The Longest Day as my classic WW2 movie.<br/><br/>It is, as has been pointed out repeatedly in these comments, a very fine and realistic seeming drama.  OK so the plot is thin and intentionally narrow minded but what Hollywood movie isn't at the moment and It was refreshing to see the characters in the film moaning about how ludicrous and shallow their mission (and therefore the plot line) was, but in Ryan, the weak plot is it's grace.  The sheer waste of life and time hits you very hard and it is the documentary of war-time which comes at you like a screaming fury and provokes a huge emotional reaction which (I'll wager I'm not alone) had me discussing WWII,  20th Century politics and war in general for quite a few days.<br/><br/>Yes, it may have been based on a real-life story.  Yes the historical representation may have been unnervingly accurate.  Yes the Omah Landings did prove costly (the artillery bomardment and armour landings failed to materialise - Not surprising from the American Armed Forces.)  and yes, a great number of very brave men died.  What got to me though was the huge pointlessness of the fight.  Who was actually saved?  Ryan - certainly not emotionally.  The war-torn lands of France - not in the film.  The American or even, come to that, the poor German soldiers who had to obey orders which did not take into account their humanity - not if the ketchup was anything to go by.  Not even Hanks, Spielberg et al were saved the misery of Shakey in Love picking up their beloved Oscars.<br/><br/>But the direction of the piece,  the cinematography, the initial landing scene (grainy and with fantastic sound and visual effects) will stay with me for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Spielberg has once again shot up in my estimation and it was pleasant not to have his own insecurities and pats on the back so prevalent in one of his films.  I even hear that the next ""Jews during the war"" movie (The Betty someone Story) may not even be directed by him but may go to the Bard Branagh instead. But here he has at last come of age in the realms of adult drama and serious film-making."

","A scary film.  The landing scenes were so ""real"", I was left cold.  Is this what war is really like?  I personally think that soldiers who worry as much about what's happening around them as these guys did, do not last long.<br/><br/>The acting is not important - how can one who has never experienced war produce the necessary emotions, or lack of them?  The effects are good, not too flashy to let you relax, yet strong enough to shock you.  The movie seems overlong, though, as the search for Ryan continues.  A lot of the dialogue there seems superfluous - a better director might have used less talking and more expression to convey the same emotions.  Unfortunately, there was little attempt at developing the characters beyond the basic stereotypes, so their fate does not matter much, in the end.  Still,  a modern audience may need that statement of the obvious to get the point.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this movie?  If you have not seen a war movie before, do so - any attempt at illustrating the ""realities"" of war is commendable. However, if you have seen other war movies, save yourself the time.  The movie is too long, and despite a terrifying start, fails to engage you in the long run. Watch it on video...<br/><br/>I rate: 2.5 out of 4"

","I finally saw SPR on video last night. What a valiant attempt by Spielberg to realistically depict the sacrifices of the allies during the Normandy invasion and its near aftermath! This is almost a great movie. I had trouble hearing some of the dialogue, and granted some of the scenes seemed a bit trite, but mostly this film succeeded. I'm also sorry that Blacks and Hispanics were not included. Yes, the Germans were portrayed as being brutal, particularly Steamboat Willie, but on the other hand there were also scenes where Americans ruthlessly shot surrendering Germans. It just goes to show that war really is hell!<br/><br/>None of the comments that I read here focused on the Lincoln letter which General Marshall quotes by heart in the early part of the film, and later incorporates into a final letter to Mrs. Ryan. I found this to be extremely effective in establishing the overall theme, which was the sacrifice of our fathers (grandfathers, uncles, etc) on the ""altar of freedom."" In the end, it was not the brutality of war, but the self-giving sacrifices of the WWII generation which is the main point of SPR."

","A master class in filmmaking, this contains some of the most brilliantly executed battle sequences ever made. This is one of those rare films that aren't afraid to depict battle in a very realistic manner, managing to show how people can die such senseless and horrible deaths. There is one particular sequence at the beginning of the movie that really numbs you.<br/><br/>As an example of the futility of war, it certainly delivers, and the plot concerning saving Private Ryan really concerns the Tom Hanks character, for he is the one who needs saving. The film does have flaws in its narrative, and the middle section is possibly 20 minutes too long, but, taken as a whole, the film is quite an achievement, and surely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. When viewed on video, the one major aspect that will be missed is the ultra realistic sound effects that manage to add a whole new dimension to the battle scenes, making you feel as if you are really there.<br/><br/>While this isn't Spielberg's best film, technically it is his most accomplished, and is an example of a filmmaker nearing the peak of his creative abilities.

How can ANYBODY say 'what war is like' unless they have been in one?  If you see SPR you will feel like you have, the only difference is you come back alive. After the first assault on the audiences' senses, SPR tracks a group of 8 men sent out to bring back one. For all the people who say the plot is unbelievable or the characters 'weak', that is hogwash. This is one of the best movies of all time-maybe not THE BEST but it ranks up there with SCHINDLER'S LIST, GONE with the WIND, and all the other academy award winners.

It wasn't just like the United States sent in some bad ass UDT team of 8, and whooped Hitler's army. People actually died from the U.S., and they showed them on the beach of Normandy just laying there while being shot at from machine guns on hill sides. It just didn't seem chee-z compared to like some Delta Force movies I've seen, where a guy is left behind, so they jump 50 feet into a helicopter throw the guy out and luckily they have rope, or the tie something to the yoke to make it not move and they go down and rescue 'em.

","As many others have remarked, the first 25 minutes of this film are intense, brutal, and painful to endure. I agree there. However, I disagree with some that the ""shaky"" cam during the Normandy sequence was jarring or headache -inducing. Completely drawn in, never once did I stop to think I was viewing the gore and horror through a lens. I was there. And I didn't want to be. I closed my eyes during some scenes, but I couldn't close my ears, I couldn't escape - the bullets kept on flying.<br/><br/>How could anyone survive something like that and go on to lead a semi-normal life? I couldn't even watch ""White Christmas"" after seeing this movie; at the first sight of a WWII jeep, I wanted to cry. What is it like for someone who was really there?<br/><br/>Good movies simultaneously make us think and feel, and this one did that for me. I only wish Spielberg would have cast unknowns in all of the parts; seeing Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in the midst of this ultra-realistic violence reminded me it was still Hollywood pulling the strings. Most people have commented that Hanks should win an Oscar, but I think that would be unfair to the rest of the cast. The grueling process they had to endure, the dark heart of humanity each actor had to face to make such a film, makes them all deserving of recognition. Hanks played Captain Miller with honesty and grace, but I don't think he necessarily outshone the performances of Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, or Jeremy Davies.<br/><br/>Analyzing the plot or the characters is missing the point. If the ""Jew"" had been the sniper from Tennesee or the ""Brooklynite"" had been the combat-shy translator, most of you would still complain about stereotypes. People say they didn't care about the characters because they weren't ""interesting."" Is everyone you meet on the street incredibly ""interesting""? I doubt it. The point isn't to care or not care when they get killed, but to realize this really happened, to all kinds of men and women that we may find boring or typical in civilian life, but who put their lives on the line.<br/><br/>Some say they didn't need the ""war is hell"" message crammed down their throats. Well, that's great for you, but if ""everyone"" knows war is bad, death is bad, why is it still so rampant in our society? War is always happening somewhere. This movie shows that not only is war hell, but the death of one man is just as tragic. If everyone really did know this, we wouldn't have gang wars, drive-by shootings, or terrorist bombings. Everyone NEEDS to know this. And if a gut-wrenching movie will drive this message home to those people, then I'm all for it.<br/><br/>And though this is getting too long already, I have to say one more thing: many of you didn't care for the apparent sappiness of the ""bookend"" scenes of the old man at the cemetery. Why does everyone have such an aversion to sentiment? I say things in my every day life that, if someone were to make them movie dialogue, would sound hopelessly cheesy.

Sure it's good, but it isn't the best movie of the year.  I think that perhaps if Spielberg had cut out more of the action and gory scenes and had concentrated more on the fact that Mrs. Ryan would like to see her last son come home, it probably would have been a higher and better quality drama than it actually is.<br/><br/>Although the opening on the beach of Normandie on D-day is pretty well shown, I think that there were a couple of scenes that could have been cut for example one of the soldiers looking around for his arm in a pile of others or the other soldier trying to keep all his intestines inside his body.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a very good movie but it isn't even close to being nearly as good as ""Schindler's list"" (which probably explains why ""Saving private Ryan didn't win best picture of the year)."

Is this an example of the mainstream press bouncing off of itself to create an event? Is this really the first movie to show what war is really like?  Who knows, really. Well, people all around the world know exactly what war is like. There's the World War, Korea and Vietnam veterans here in the U.S.. The Vietnamese, Korean, Laotian, Chechnyan, Iraqi, Isrealite, Palestinian, Saudi Arabian, French, German, etc. etc. civilians and soldiers alive during the conflicts in their countries that either have happened or are happening right now. Or, in other words, perhaps there are more people alive who know exactly what war is like than you can shake a stick at. Maybe even more people than live in the U.S.. Maybe more than will ever plunk down cash to see this ""visceral""  fantasy, this money making effort(don't forget just how much Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and thousands of other folk whose lives depend upon the success of their entertainment ventures are going to make from this particular one) that depends, partially, upon our buying in to the acceptability(even the goodness) of killing people with guns (ie. as German soldier is sitting astride one of our heroes, about to run him through with a knife, tell me that you don't want to wrest the gun out of the ""ineffectual"" intellectual who lies frozen just around the corner, that you don't want to take that gun and shoot the heck out of the soldier killing our friend).  Oh my yes.<br/><br/>
I personally haven't lived through a war. I don't know what it is like. I can't, however, imagine that it was anything like the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. And it certainly wasn't anything like the next overly romanticized two hours.  It might have been hard to watch, sure, but I could just close my eyes, think these are all actors, and lo and behold, three hours later I'm thinking about which restaurant to eat at.  I wouldn't try to think that my experience with this movie would let me talk, with any sophistication, with someone who has lived through an armed conflict, much less imagine that I, in any way, was left with an experience that threw my very notion of myself into turmoil. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is just a movie. Perhaps it was a more ""realistic"" effort than has been previously made. But all you need to do is throw a lot of money at something, take into account an audience more prepared for on screen violence, and hire enough people who are decently skilled at what they do, and poof, you have Saving Private Ryan. Sure it is finely crafted. Certainly the acting is decent, the lines aren't completely horrible, and the cinematography doesn't intrude on the experience. But it is still just a movie.  <br/><br/>If we, as a nation, need something like Saving Private Ryan to realize that war is horrible, that people die way too quickly and without reason, then I think this means that there is something wrong with us.  There are people living situations out there that are far worse than anything we feel when we are in our air conditioned theatres, and I think that it is a bit condescending of us to think that we understand anything about war just because we watched this movie.<br/><br/>It is a fine movie. Not exceptional. Not the best of the year. Not even as interesting as Forest Gump. But a fine movie that is worth seeing. Sure."

","After scanning some of the other comments, I think I'm more disturbed by some of them than I am this film! First of all, the battle scenes are spectacular, particularly the invasion sequence. (None other than John Keegan, famed war historian, has said that it is as realistic as your going to find on film.) Some here have criticized it for being to ""amero-centric"" (I guess that's a word?) because the soldiers are all American. This is not a fair criticism -- the soldiers landing on Omaha and Utah beaches WERE all Americans. The other beaches, Gold, Juno, and Sword, were landed upon by British and Canadian soldiers mostly. If you're going to criticize a movie, do it for it is, not what it is not. Of course, many other nations participated in WWII, but because they're not seen does not invalidate this film. The men who landed at Omaha beach were by far the hardest hit. The Normandy battles were not as large as Kursk, for example, but celebrating one battle does not somehow invalidate the rest. Criticizing it for that is childish and petulant. The movie does slow a little in the middle, but I did not see any ""mushy Hollywood"" type movie making. Your stereotyped Hollywood picture has a big soundtrack and lots of gratuitous pyrotechnics -- this movie had none of that. I have often criticized some of Spielberg's films in the past, but I have none to offer this film. It's not perfect (no film is) but its very good. An indirect kudos to Stanley Kubrick, whose influence I saw in a couple of scenes. Maybe that's just me, but it seemed ""Kubrickian"" in a quiet, indirect sort of way."

","I guess you all know what it's all about, and you've heard about how real it is.<br/><br/>Well, for me, it came across mostly as very realistic although the Omaha Beach landing was more a gorefest than great cinema. This might have been intentional, as the purpose probably was to shock the audience with the full horrors of war.<br/><br/>Still this scene doesn't ""do it"" for me. Why? Because I've read so much about the D-Day and WWII that I know people died in droves (literally) on the beaches that day, such as they always do in war, only this was on a much greater scale. That same scale what is working against the scene because we don't know the characters involved and we do know that those we recognise(Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks for instance) will make it safely ashore as they have to go and find this paratrooper schmuck named Ryan. It is a good scene though, just not all that it was claimed to be.<br/><br/>Ok, ok, I've rambled on about the landing, how about the rest of the film? Well, it starts off a bit slow, to allow the audience to get their breaths back from the opening 20 minute blood bath and to introduce the main characters to the audience. We are also introduced to the films moral dilemma, is it fair to risk the lives of nine men to save one, just because his three brothers have already died? What price are we prepared to pay and for what exactly are we willing to pay that price? The message is further emphasized by the losses incurred on our small group of heroes as they traverse the French countryside. The whole mission seems like a suicide, especially as nobody knows wether Ryan is still alive at all!<br/><br/>And it's the final battle scene that really makes the movie for me. Because now it's man to man, you know the characters involved and you can see the fear in their eyes, and you can see the same fear in the germans' eyes.<br/><br/>So it's really gritty and intense, and Spielberg has managed to capture all this with a really stunning and up-close photo. The cinematics are incredible, the shots are long with few cuts, just like in the old David Lean movies (Lawrence of Arabia, most notably). All this combines into one, long and really breathtaking battle. It would probably have been easier to start a real war and film that one instead than to shoot this battle scene.

","Saving Private Ryan left me speechless.  To say it was a quality film does not do it justice.  It's a shame that there will be an inevitable posse of people who don't like this film.  (I hate those achingly typical individuals who feel a need to buck the majority.)  Admittedly, it's not a film for everyone, but no one can say that it wasn't a well-done motion picture.  The actors did a stellar job of bringing what could have easily been stereotypical soldiers to life.  Giovanni Ribisi was particularly riveting (in my humble opinion).  Still, I have one itty-bitty bone to pick with this film.  It's a shame that Spielberg had to frame his incredible WWII story with a painfully contrived modern-day scene.  I dealt with the beginning, but the end was positively gooey with cheese.  What happened  during WWII was the story, not what happened after.  Other than that,  I commend Spielberg for creating such an affecting motion picture (and for having the courage to cast such brilliant, yet relatively unknown, actors)."

","See this film for the first half hour thats all and while your watching it keep thinking to yourself 'not too long ago this actually happened'. Forget the crap in the middle for me that ruined the film cause the brutally realistic and horrific beginning just went downhill into sappy cliched hollywood stuff. I dont think Spielburg pulled this off as well as he could have. Its all very patriotic to america making out like they were the only ones fighting the war. No other nationalities apart from the Germans who are very cliched in this film very evil and cold blooded not human at all which even though they were on the opposite side they were human too just like the americans. I thought the way they were portrayed was very bitter and if youre going to make a good anti war movie you have to get across the message that war is futile and affects and hurts everyone not just one nationality that is why it is so pointless. The film is visually raw and bleak like it should be but i think the storyline flaws it too much and spielberg could have done a bit better."
"icecream-2","Null","0","0","27 June 1999"," Terrifying
","This film truly moved and terrified me at the same time when I watched it at the cinema. Not many films can do that except for maybe Schindlers List. Recently I rented it but could only watch it until half way through the Omagh Beach scene. I think this film is the kind that you can only watch once. My Dad watched it and it moved him also, he even had tears in his eyes by the end of it. I can't believe that some war veterans involved in D-Day could actually begin to watch this film, it must bring back some terrible memories. I think it's something that we all should watch because it brings home the horrific nature of war that books and even pictures cannot even begin to illustrate. Most kids like me should definitely watch this as it makes us realise just how trivial our troubles in life seem. we should not be allowed to forget the millions of ordinary men who were slaughtered in this conflict, what they died for and just how lucky we really are. My only critcism of the movie is how like many Hollywood films only concentrate on the American side of it all when many other nationalities participated. Ok I accept that Omagh was a mainly American thing but even now the American soldiers are all portrayed as the good guys who can do no wrong and the Germans as inhuman monsters, take that bit at the end for example when the german stabs the american. What I think the film fails to illustrate is that even the Germans were just ordinary men just like the American soldiers with mothers and families and I think portraying all the german soldiers as pure evil is a bit outdated and sad we should realise that now. I also wish that this film could have been about and dedicated to all the men whatever their nationality who gave their lives on D-Day, it wasn't just the americans. Despite this however I think the opening scene is about as close as we can come to how D-Day actually was and i think its about time we knew what the war veterans went through for us and how eternally grateful we should be to them."

He wouldn't ever talk about them, not even to my mother or her sister.  Sometimes I could never understand that, but now I do.  If this is really what it was like to be a soldier, no matter what war you are fighting, then it must be an incredibly difficult ordeal to drudge up memories that are this disturbing, this vivid and this real.  I have never been to war and I hope to God that I never have to experience war, but after seeing this movie I believe I can tell you at least what it may have been like.  This movie is that vivid and that honest.<br/><br/>The first half an hour of this film is some of the most amazing direction I have seen in any film in my entire life.  I have even read that Spielberg toned it down some.  That is hard to believe knowing what is up there on screen.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant in every capacity.  The direction is so clear and crisp that you feel like you know these men when the film is over.  You feel like you understand the war a little better than you did before.  The acting is terrific.  And not just Hanks and Damon, but everyone from Sizemore to Ribisi to the grunt that gets his guts blown out ( take your pick as to who that is. )<br/><br/>I can't believe a film like Shakespeare in Love, a film that could have been an after school special, was chosen as best picture.  Best picture?  Over this?  How is that possible?  If you haven't seen this ( and there aren't many of you out there ) please do yourself a favour, see it tonight.  It is such an amazing film and it is one that I will never forget.<br/><br/>A final note:  Even though my grandfather has been gone for about 8 years now, I salute him and every other guy that put it on the line and did so because they believed in what they were doing.  I have a new understanding and appreciation for people like my grandfather.  And that a film could make me feel that way is something special in itself."

The Academy Awards are trivial in the grand scheme of things, true, but when The English Patient swept a few years back, I allowed myself to be pulled back in.  This brief period of interest in the Academy came to an abrupt end, however, last March.  Not only was Ryan stiffed, but the Best Picture Award went to not even the next-best film.  Shakespeare In Love pales next to Elizabeth, let alone the greatest war movie ever made.  Yup, from now on I'll let my heart and head guide me...to hell with lists. This, of course, is not the greatest lesson one may glean from Ryan; in this age of reckless exposure it is truly satisfying to hear Tom Hanks say that the memories he has of his wife are his alone.  Some things need to die with us, otherwise our lives are mere vehicles.  Don't think that this movie falls to long, distancing reflections about intangibles--that was The Thin Red Line.  Everything here is grounded in the mud, blood and rusty mechanisms of war.  That Ryan anchors itself so firmly, yet still evokes such beauty is its greatest gift.

"BB-15","7","0","0","14 June 1999"," A Technically Brilliant Film with a Mediocre Script
","No film in 1998 was more hyped by critics than this film. The First 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan does not disappoint. The editing, sound and camera work are so energized (combined with graphic violence) that the sense of being in battle is more real than any film I have seen. Also, Spielberg is the first director to use the grotesque violence of the Coen brothers and Tarantino  in a war movie where it actually feels more natural. All of this makes for some very thrilling moments. But while Saving P. Ryan is a technical tour de force its script is not of the high standard as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The main story (let's find our guy) is routine for a war film. So, the development of the characters is very important to make the movie work. In this regard Saving Private Ryan for the most part was mediocre. I did not feel connected to most of these characters. There was too little dialogue for them to be real. Many war movies deal with the squad under pressure. Eight Iron Men (1952) comes to mind as doing a better job of showing how people cope with this.<br/><br/>Saving P. Ryan also presents us with the horrors of war. The best movie to confront this subject is Apocalypse Now. Saving P. Ryan by contrast to Apocalypse Now seems to have its morality upside down. The most interesting character in the film, the interpreter, learns that the best thing to do with prisoners is to shoot them. There is no adequate comment on this brutality in the movie.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of a final scene is essential for a high quality film and the one in Saving P. Ryan falls apart. The emotion shown by the actors works but the dialogue makes little sense as the final message of the movie. Because the film almost ignores the big picture about why we fought World War 2, it tries to make some sense of the loss of so many lives on an individual level, by private Ryan himself. This cannot be done. The justification of war, if any, is a cause for the greater good; i.e. ending slavery or stopping the Nazis. There is no other way to make sense of war and Spielberg should have used these issues.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan got what it deserved at the Oscars; the award for best direction, editing and some technical awards. It is very well made but has a script with too many flaws."
"Thomas-58","Null","0","0","13 June 1999"," 7 and 1/2 stars for successfully depicting the war experience
","Coming out of Saving Private Ryan, one detail was surprisingly clear. This is not as gruesome or violent a movie as most make it out to be.  The violence occuring onscreen is realistic, but never is it gut-wrenchingly unbearable.  For example, many images of soldiers being shot in the middle of their forehead look completely convincing, but at the same time are not disturbing.  I suspect this is due to the fact that the violence itself is not gratuitous or dwelled upon for long periods of time.  In Schindler's List, there is a scene were an old man is taken out of a line and has a gun pointed to his head by a German soldier, while the viewer gets a closeup of this cruelty.  A couple of seconds pass where we just await the man to be shot dead.  And it is in these few, passive seconds where the viewer is viscerally shaken because he or she has the preoccuring knowledge that the man is about to be killed.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan, every soldier is either shot down quickly, or the act of violence is not as closeup in the viewer's objectivity.  The violence is not there to be just flat-out disgusting but to reflect upon its effect on the characters and the film's ideals.  Although is this the film's virtue or disadvantage?  Anyway the hype is undeserved.  Never do you see a soldier's head blown away from his torso or the like.  If you can handle award-winning pyrotechnics, then you can sit through this film. With that being said, perhaps something more important should.  Saving Private Ryan just is not the best war film ever made, or even Steven Spielberg's best directing effort.  It is bogged down by a number of cliches (it begins to rain right when our protagonists approach danger, one soldier accidentely reveals the enemy simply by sitting down, the band of soldiers is comprised of the usual wide-range of character types, etc).  It lacks the thorough plot and execution of theme that Spielberg accomplished so easily and satisfactorily in his own Schindler's List.  The tears and awe of the experience people had when they left the theater after that film was not there so much this time.  Maybe that's the exact point the film is trying to get across, though.  Perhaps its purpose (and only idea achieved) is to simply show that war is hell and what it is really like--to settle the look of the war film once and for all.  If this was the movie's objective, then it does so in flying colors.  But that's about all.  The spiritual aspect is missing, and this is why the film could have been better.  Schindler's List told the horrors of the Holocaust, but left the viewer with lasting images and lessons on basic humankind--the kind of secondary impression Saving Private Ryan lacks."

","I must say that when Saving Private Ryan came to the cinemas, I wasn't compelled to go see it. I usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it (read SW Episode One). Pvt. Ryan had been on the video shelves for a few weeks before I picked it up. I wasn't really looking forward to YAAWF (Yet Another American War Film).<br/><br/>This film is absolutely brilliant filmmaking. If Speilberg had not made ET and Indiana Jones, he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece like this. He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the late 50's early 60's.<br/><br/>This film is riveting from beginning to end. Every scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated with the overall artistic vision of the film. I have a degree in Film Criticism and have seen a lot of film. You quickly become jaded by formula after formula.<br/><br/>Speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be considered a tired genre. The hand-held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the best in cinema history. The point, however, is not to bombard the viewer with gory war scenes for shock purposes. It is a setup for the rest of the film. You are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie. They payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the battle to hold the bridge.<br/><br/>One beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing. That crossfade is a film convention that Speilberg subverts for dramatic effect. When you see the final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully done) it comes full circle. This subversion of a typical film convention is what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving. You'll know what I mean when you've seen it.<br/><br/>Speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with intelligence, sensitivity and confidence."

The government wants them to save him because the mother will have lost all her sons if he dies.  There's not really much else I can say about the plot because the movie doesn't really have one.  Its whole purpose is to show what World War II soldiers went through, while throwing in a plot to keep the movie interesting. The war scenes are done very well, especially in the beginning and the end. They do a perfect job of showing the confusion and tragedy of war.  The directing is very good and Steven Spielberg definitely earned his Oscar for Best Director.  I have no idea how they made it look so real, and they managed to convey a real war atmosphere. One thing I noticed about this movie that only a few great movies have is the continuity and importance of each scene.  No scene seemed unimportant, and each one I watched with full attention.  There are never any unnecessary breaks and the movie as a whole has great continuity. Tom Hanks has always been one of my least favorite actors, because it seems like he plays the same character in all of his movies.  But in Saving Private Ryan, he did a great job and I saw no resemblance to any other of his characters.  One thing I also admired about him in this movie is that he never took attention away from any of the other actors.  Everybody seemed equally important. Overall, this movie was superb.

","It's true, the first 45 minutes is the best part of the movie.  The movie loses some of its realism later, starting with that ridiculously accurate shot by the American sniper to the German sniper.  Then, during the last battle scene, the Germans look like they are TRYING to get killed.  They don't hide behind stuff, but instead just run at the Americans.  And Tom Hanks should play professional football with that incredibly accurate arm. Every one of those mortar shells he threw killed somebody.<br/><br/>As for the demonization of Germans in the movie, I didn't see it.  Many critics point out that ""Steamboat Willy, toot toot"" guy was an ungrateful b*****d and he was the only attempted German character development.  The thing is, I didn't see him as evil and I don't think I was ""supposed"" to. He begged for his life, which is normal of anyone who thinks he is going to be killed, and he was released.  So he ran into a German unit instead of an American one.  They gave him a new rifle and sent him back to the front. That doesn't make him evil.<br/><br/>Some foreign critics have criticized that there was no representation of the British and Canadians.  If this was a documentary, I would whole-heartedly agree with this.  However, this is a story of a group of American soldiers moving from one American occupied area to another.  Why would this group run into British and Canadians who were further East?<br/><br/>As for the critics that say this movie does too much ""flag waving"", I both agree and disagree.  I did not see any real American patriotism being forced upon the viewer UNTIL that uncalled for flag scene and the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>Still a good movie that will stick in your head for a while."

","What can I say? The 25 or so minutes starting with the boats coming upon the shore of Omaha beach are 25 minutes that I will never forget. The carnage and desensitization of Tom Hanks is breathtaking.<br/><br/>I tend to agree that the plot is very thin on this film, but its main redeeming value is how the traumatic events that occur in this film shape each character. Although everyone does an astounding job as far as the cast goes, Giovanni Ribisi embodies the WWII soldier the best. His portrayal as the medic is splendid, his performance makes his character seem as if he is the only one of the 8 soldiers with a shred of humanity left, telling the others to cover up the dog tags as a mass of soldiers march by, staring at the dog tags laid out across the table. His demise is all too real, it makes the viewer cringe because you feel for this character but you know there is nothing you can do to fend off the inevitable.<br/><br/>Besides the very well choreographed battle scenes and the explosive acting job EVERYONE does, this film leaves alot to be desired. If the opening 25 minutes fail to quench your thirst of seeing humanity at its worst, then Full Metal Jacket surely will. Definitely not the best war movie of all time, although very close. If Full Metal Jacket had such brutally honest scenes of violence such as Saving Private Ryan when it came to the battle scenes instead of its glorified hollywood violence, it would reign supreme as the best example of war on film to date.<br/><br/>My final thoughts: watch this movie if you want to be slapped in the face with the horror and tragedy American soldiers endured during WWII, but don't expect to be awestruck by the plot. The only downfall is that Saving Private Ryan did not portray that the war was equally as brutal for BOTH sides - with the exception of the scene where Captain Miller's group makes the lone German soldier dig graves for their fallen comrades. Was I the only one who didn't laugh at his last-ditched efforts to appease the Americans and make them spare his life? The final complaint would be that Spielberg did not tug at the strings of the viewers heart when the lead characters died - with the exception of Ribisi's character - whereas several scenes in 'Glory' brought tears to my eyes."

I wasn't watching it to compare it with Schindler's List, or even E.T. for that matter. I watched it with my two oldest children so that when I die and they inherit their grandfather's funeral flags, they'll know what those flags stand for. All the comments about comparing this movie to The Thin Red Line are silly. A war movie is to help those of us who weren't there understand those of us who were. Yes, war is hell. WWII was hell. Korea was hell. Vietnam was hell. The Gulf war was hell. If there were still any soldiers from WWI, they'd say the same. Movies like this are for the rest of us to remember why our people were sent in the first place. For this reason, this movie is required viewing. If you wonder why your grandfather doesn't talk much, or easily, about the time he served in WWII, this movie will explain it all. 'Nuff said."

","Steven Spielberg's second great WWII epic. The beginning battle at Normandy to the last great words.

You knew the men on the screen, the bullets were flying at you, it was your family receiving the dreaded letter. It wasn't your every day film. It brought you to tears. It showed not only war, but human goodness. Eight men, men with lives and families, risk their lives to save the last of four brothers, they didn't know him, he wasn't important to them. They did it, for him and themselves. The stories told by Private James Ryan made him somebody to the soldiers, so that they fought for him after their duty of finding him was done. Told by the greatest teller of our time.<br/><br/>The true feeling of the movie is belief. In people. Would I have done this? Would I have stayed for the final battle? Someone would. Someone did.

","I saw this film the night it opened last Summer. I sat in awe for the entire film. It was amazing. So, when Harrison Ford read Shakespeare in Love off the Best Picture envelope, I was in shock. I had seen both, and I feel that SPR is so superior in every way. Shakespeare is a comedy with no real message or any quality that makes it eligible. I watched the film again when it arrived on video, and It affected me even more on video. I broke down during the end. The first 5 minutes of this film are some of the most powerful you will ever see. I doubt I will ever forget seeing a soldier searching for his arm on the ground, or a another, a intestine laying on the ground beside him, screaming mommy when he bled to death. These are the most amazing scenes ever shot. Even the Longest day's epic scale battles do not hold the same power. This film portrayed WW2 amazingly well. It was the first to really show the hell of it. The early films somewhat glorified it, this was the first to handle WW2 in a long time. Seeing it again, I realize it is easily the greatest film I have ever seen. The opening moments and the final battle will go down as some of the greatest battles ever filmed, as well as the most realistic. The Academy was wrong in choosing Shakespeare in Love. This film blew all the others away. I did see the Thin Red Line, which I consider to be the WORST film ever made. it is horrific. Even it's battle scenes don't affect as the characters are so dispicabule. Private Ryan is amazing, and will be remebered as the most powerful film of the last 40's years. A triumph of film making."

The utter confusion and slaughter of war were so realistically portrayed that I was on the edge of my seat unaware of what horror was going to appear next. The movie as a whole created that feeling in me--the feeling of unease and tension of not knowing just what was going to happen next. The kind of feeling the soldiers must've felt at the time, although in much, much greater magnitude.<br/><br/>Similarly, the last battle scene was harrowing and exciting.

"critic-22","9","0","0","26 May 1999"," Corporal Upham was outstanding!!!
","Many people have talked about this movie in terms of the realistic violence and action throughout the movie. This certainly helps to drag people into the movie, but was not the most stunning thing I saw in this movie. Some people have highlighted the simple, but effective plot as a means to prove that it was not worthy of the title of best war movie of all time. My view was the movie was not really created to have detail plots to confuse people and make them think, rather the movie was about how pictures and images of war can say much much more than words can ever do. We not only get scenes of realistic action, but fundamentally the characterisation of Corporal Upham is one of the best achievements in ANY war movie. Whereas the other characters we have seen before in other similar war movies, Upham was so unique in war movies of any sort that he blew me away. Saving Private Ryan should have focused more upon Upham's character because it was far more interesting and realistic than all the other characters put together. This movie was a character study rather than plot tangles. Upham should not even be in the war, he is not only innocent, but is the moral person in the movie who affects the decisions and lives of the other soldiers around him. Throughout the movie we see his character slowly change and develop to the final scenes that is so full of emotionally realism that he beats other war movie characters. Scenes to watch out for are: 1) When he is left behind and watches his new friends take out a guarded post. 2) When he sits on the steps - absolutely incredible. 3) When he tries to save a German person's life. 4) And the final horrific emotionally scene of realism. And so many besides.<br/><br/>The only off-putting thing about the movie is the propaganda concerning giving the impression that America is the best country in the world and saves us from losing the war, when in fact they were just additional help who did not join until Britain was in too much debt to the USA."

","I will attempt to differentiate my feelings about this film.  Technically and theatrically, this film is a masterpiece.  The visual effects and realistic atmosphere that are brought to the screen are breathtaking (in one way or another), and are unparallel by any other.  Each performance made you feel like you were that character's friend or family member, and made you feel emotion for them.  'Saving Private Ryan' is a prime example of what movie making should be ... technically.<br/><br/>Emotionally and personally, I have to admit that I can never watch this film again.  The emotions of grief, fear, sadness, horror and despair that I felt from watching it made me literally sick.  Although it was a masterpiece in the way the story was told, the story itself was disgusting.  Being a Veteran of two MUCH less violent wars, I could only sit there and think of how I would have felt if I were there.<br/><br/>I went to sleep that evening, after watching 'Ryan'; it was the most difficult night I have had in a while.  I believe that this film should have carried an NC-17 rating, because if I was Spielberg, I'm not sure if I could live with a 16 year old kid (even WITH his parents) seeing the events that unfolded on that screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a theatrical masterpiece.  But if you're going to watch it, be prepared for having your heart ripped out."

","This film (I won't be so brash as to call it a movie) confirms my belief that Steven Spielberg is one of, if not the most, talented people of the century. Yes, this sounds like butt-kissing, but it isn't. My grandfather died in WWII, as did millions of your grandfathers, fathers and brothers. Until I saw SPR, I, like many others, had tucked the mere thought of war into a drawer in my mind titled ""ignore and it might go away"". I am very much ashamed to admit I was one of those who complained that veterans should forget it and get on with their lives.  Now though, I can honestly say that this film has changed my life. What's more, anybody who denies that it changed theirs is either lying or devoid of humanity.<br/><br/>Obviously, as anybody who has seen the film will know, the first twenty minutes at Omaha beach are overwhelmingly shocking, heartbreaking and soul numbing. I sat in my seat, emotionally paralysed and totally disbelieving. I put my popcorn on the floor and couldn't bring myself to touch it again. I know people say the plot was often thin and the film slow moving but surely they realise this is far more true to life than non stop action? There were weeks on end where soldiers did nothing but wait in the trenches, where the build- up to the finale was far more nerve racking than the action itself because you knew something had to happen, you just didn't know when. The film reflects this. Therefore it is far MORE true to life than all the ""War is Hell"" films such as Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.<br/><br/>To those who remain unconvinced, may I remind them a helpline was set up to comfort those who couldn't handle the journey back to the war. I work at a cinema, I have seen the effects of this film. I spent over an hour once, comforting a seventy-five year old man who came out of the film weeping like a child and couldn't bring himself to walk away from the building.<br/><br/>War IS Hell.

The scenes where characters would just trade anecdotes of their lives in the States seemed tacked on and was a ham-fisted way of showing that the soldiers were just ""regular boys who wanted to get home."" And of course there was the final shot of the American flag fading to credits which clinched this film as being a fairly standard issue Hollywood war movie.  The beach landing scene was gut wrenching but after the movie was over I really didn't think about it for too long, unlike The Thin Red Line which I think delves much further into the emotional aspects of what war is and leaves questions which need to be explored through multiple viewings of the film.

Saying this is the best war movie ever is tough. Apocalypse Now, FMJ, and Platoon are all great movies but don't have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie. The cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique. It has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle. The story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius. It's a great Dr Strangelove feel of conflicting morals, interests, and sanity. Tom Hanks,Tom Sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and I'm not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone. Great writing and attention to detail including actual Panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie. The violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect. And the backdrop of D-Day (often called the greatest battle in history) provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is.

","Spielberg does to Kurosawa and Welles what Mark McGwire did to Roger Marris in the magnificently staged battle scenes that bookend this D-Day melodrama. His beach-storming opening pushes the how-much-can-you-stand? envelope about twenty feet farther than even the most daring moments in SCHINDLER'S LIST; he seems to have an unerring sixth sense for the audience's breaking point. And the climax--a cat-and-mouse game between the spottily armed American platoon and a series of tank-bound Germans--suggests a set piece from THE GREAT ESCAPE with nineties technology and Spielbergian horse sense.<br/><br/>It was Spielberg's derring-do that made this movie a monster hit--not the star presence of Tom Hanks as the saver and Matt Damon as the saved. And it certainly wasn't the script, which affords Spielberg a few opportunities for nicely offhand, verite-ish, lived-in scenes, but consists mostly of Tom Hanks staring at a distant cloud and delivering the most sentimental ""unsentimental"" bromides in a war movie ever. Hanks is supposed to be a scruffier, more cynical and wised-up version of the Henry Fonda Good American. His monologues of common, simple decency have the numbing monotony of a centrist Democrat Senator dedicating a new high school. Hanks morphing into a latter-day Jimmy Stewart is dismal enough; the speechifying by members of his platoon, especially the unendurable Ed Burns commemorating his girl-back-home's mammoth breasts, take the movie to flatline status. (The script was uncreditedly rewritten by Frank Darabont, of the poor-man's-Spielberg SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.)"

","It is normal to believe that once a director makes a film like SCHINDLER'S LIST, he will struggle for the rest of his career trying to live up to it; not Steven Speilberg. <br/><br/>I cannot describe with words the power of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. All I can say is that its overall execution is simply perfect.  The depiction of the D-Day invasion is more than worth the price of admission and should receive special recognition as the greatest scene ever filmed.  It is completely horrifying, as it should be; editing, cinematography and sound have been given a new standard with this terrifying sequence.  That scene, along with the rest of the movie, is ultimately a tribute to its director.  In Speilberg's hands, the level of drama reaches unchartered territory.  Be patient, I'm only getting started.<br/><br/>The screenplay totally delivers.  Robert Rodat's characterizations are subtle, yet powerful, and when someone dies, your sorrow lingers because you feel you have truly known them for that brief period of time.  This is a tribute to the actors as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, fifty years from now Tom Hanks will probably be remembered as ""the guy who played Forrest Gump""; he shouldn't be.  For me, Hanks will always be Captain John Miller -- a decent man with a knack for leadership, a man who truly loves each boy he leads into battle, a man who is quietly more terrified than any of those boys.  The genius in Hanks' performance lies not in his portrayal of an Army Captain, but in the way he makes us believe that John Miller truly IS a Captain. A word of advice to the Academy: DON'T BE POLITICAL!  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH SOMEONE WINNING THREE OSCARS IN SIX YEARS!  Not if he/she deserves it, as Hanks does.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also phenomenal.  Matt Damon brings integrity and honor to the role of Private James Ryan;  you feel that Miller's squad has made the right decision in doing their best to find him. Barry Pepper is terrific as Private Jackson, the religious sniper from Tennessee.  Edward Burns hits the bullseye as Private Reiben, the cynical chatterbox from Brooklyn.  The most solid supporting performance, however, is given by one of Hollywood's most underrated actors -- Tom Sizemore.  His portrayal of the loyal Sergeant Horvath is amazing and, at its core, truly heartfelt.  I pray he gets at least a nomination, if not a little golden boy of his own next March.<br/><br/>Next March is a fitting topic to conclude on.  Be prepared to hear ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"", ""Steven Speilberg"", ""Tom Hanks"" etc. quite frequently at the 71st Annual Academy Awards.  With this stunning epic, those phrases deserve to be all over the little white envelopes as they are torn open next year."

","Watching the Oscars, it honestly never occurred to me that SPR would not win best picture. I had seen all of the other movies, including Shakespeare In Love and Life is Beautiful, and while both were good movies, Shakespeare in Love being, in my opinion, the weakest of the big three, I could not comprehend how either one could honestly compete with SPR. Ryan was not a movie as much as it was an experience. The first scene, the landing on Omaha beach, evoked an emotional response I have never felt during a movie before. I felt as if I were there, as if bullets were wizzing past my head and bombs were ripping my closest friends to pieces around me. When the opening scene was over I almost felt as if I were going to throw up, and I was happy the experience was over. Saving Private Ryan was, by far the best movie of 1998 and the Academy showed, once again, that the quality of the movie counts much less than the ad campaign one puts on to win the big trophy. Not only did the Academy rob Spielberg and all who were involved in the making of the production, it robbed the veterans of the war. By giving the Oscar to a cute little film that, quite honestly, would have made good ol' William gag, the Academy turned their back on the veterans as a whole. Now, did anyone who suffered through the horrors of that war lose sleep because of the award ceremony; not likely. But the Academy ruined their chance to honor those who died giving us all the right to live free as we choose. It passed up its chace to say thank you to all that served by honoring the best movie ever made about the terrors our men endured over there. So, the only thing left to say is, shame on you Academy for rewarding a vigilant ad campaign as opposed to a master piece of modern times. Saving Private Ryan; Best Picture of 1998, trophy or not."

But 'Saving Private Ryan' can be more accurately described as a war drama.  In it, the war is anything but glorified.  The scale of the war is shown on both a massive size (the Normandy invasion) and on a more personal level.  The Germans seem bad, but they're just doing what we would do under the circumstances.  However, even with this in mind, the audience can't help but hate them.  This is the most dynamic part of the film; and is enough to make us forget the appallingly deflated character's in Speilberg's 'Schindler's List.'  And, of course, there's the acting, with Hanks at his best, and the rest of the cast (Tom Sizemore and Jeremey Davies in particular) shines as well.  Overall, a great film.  And an utter travesty that it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the massively inferior 'Shakespeare in Love.'"

"Osiris-11","8","0","0","9 May 1999"," An exceptional war movie.
","This film is an exceptionally well done war movie.  It is perhaps the greatest of all time, although in my mind it is waging its own war with Apocalypse Now for that prestigious title.  It pulls no punches in its representation of the horrors of war.  I am certain that most movie aficionados have heard the stories of veteran flashbacks and emotional breakdowns caused by the film.  It is certainly the best portrayal of war in this decade.  It has even bested Braveheart's violence, a feat thought impossible three years ago.  The scene in which Private Mellish is killed by the German soldier chills me to this day.  It is indeed a fantastic war movie.  As a movie in general it is not quite as great.  It still is a wonderful tale with moving emotional content but I feel certain it was not robbed at the Academy Awards.  The characters seemed quite one-dimensional to me and the plot left something to be desired.  In the end this film did not approach the quality of Tom Hanks' two Oscar winning performances. And to risk missing the forest for the trees, I must say that the opening scenes of the storming of the beaches at Normandy almost made me feel sick.  This was not from the excessive gore, and that fact does trouble me somewhat, but instead from the camera work.  I understand that in this age of ""ER"" popularity the ""messy camera"" look has become incredibly popular.  In spite of this I think the excessive motion of the camera during this scene detracted from the film.  I found it difficult to concentrate throughout. Personally I thought the camera work during the battles in Braveheart were much more effective in conveying the mood of a battlefield."

","Spielberg was shunned by the Oscar nominations last year in large part due to the controversy over who deserved the writing credit for ""Amistad."" (Then of course there's the whole white-director-black-story issue, for which he's been paying ever since ""The Color Purple"".but don't get me started on that.)  It may have been the best possible move for him to work with Tom ""He Can Do No Wrong"" Hanks this time out.  This is definitely a five-hankie picture: I wept continuously for the first twenty minutes and was on the brink of tears for almost the entire remainder of its three-hours-plus running time.  Spielberg has an uncanny ability to confront us on film with things that require our social and individual attention--consider ""The Color Purple,"" ""Empire of the Sun,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Amistad,"" and now ""Saving Private Ryan.""  That these films were made by the same man who directed ""Jaws,"" ""E.T.,"" and the Indiana Jones movies is astonishing.  No other filmmaker working today produces this variety of films, from those intended to prod and provoke thoughtful adults to those that speak so clearly to our children and to the child in each of us. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a devastating depiction of and meditation on the costs of war, a heart-breaking but ultimately affirming examination of individual human worth.  Tom Hanks is Everyman, with whom we can all identify, and Matt Damon is the titular Private Ryan, a beaming, scrub-faced, bright-eyed beautiful boy whom we all want to save.  What is one man's life worth?  What are the consequences of inhumanity?  What is the value of integrity?  This film shows us that society cannot answer these questions; the answers lie inside, and must come from within."

I challenge anyone to admit, honestly,  that they were not shaken up and moved by the sequences in SPR.  If you weren't you're either dead or Jeffrey Dahmer.  Forget the cinematography and the battle scenes. The cast assembled did a brilliant job! Specifically Giovani Ribisi's performance.  (which was underrated).  And Ed Burns who I felt should of gotten a nod for a best supporting actor award.  Hanks was solid and made his character work.<br/><br/>Now to address my friends the brits, who are seemingly angry at the depiction of America's role in the war, and how SPR glorified Americans and Americans only.  American movie, American director..do you see where this is going.  Let someone else make a movie depicting the other perspectives. SPR told the story about American soldiers looking to locate a private and bring him home.  It also did something else...It paid homage to the brave American soldiers that endured that nightmare that was D-day.  Being a veteran myself who never saw combat, thank God, I collapsed in my chair and cried knowing people that lost their lives in the Gulf War.  Let's not remember Private Ryan for who it didn't pay respect to, because I think that most of us are intelligent enough to know that there were other nations soldiers fighting and dying, but to whom it did pay homage to.  The brave soldiers who fought in a strange place, and died to preserve the way of life that is right.  War is hell and it is wrong.  Life is too precious.  I do agree that congress and the Pres. should view SPR prior to making any decision.  But I also know that WW2 is history, and the men that died, from all nations, deserve my respect and my deepest thanks for preserving the lifestyle that is my own.  There is a saying that says ""you're a better man then me.""  I extend that to every soldier that fought, bled, and died on the allied side in WW2.  And being a former sailor, I, like the elder Private Ryan, extend a hand salute to them.<br/><br/>That's what Private Ryan did.  It was  the best war film ever made."

Very few directors could do what Spielberg did for this first 20 minutes. Spielberg was able to build on this event and develop a story and a group of characters that the audience could truly identify with.

"RAS-3","8","0","0","23 April 1999"," Saving Private Ryan is two films -- one terrific, the other just okay.
","Saving Private Ryan was two films, for me.  The opening Omaha Beach landing sequence of 'Ryan' produced the most intense feeling I've ever experienced while watching a movie.  Spielberg manages to trap history in a bottle and the sights and sounds -- especially the sounds -- are terrifying.  Like the car chase in Steve McQueen's 'Bullit', Spielberg sets a marker that will hard to duplicate.  After it was over I fully felt deserving of a campaign ribbon to wear on my polo shirt.<br/><br/>Having thus been promised a peek into history, I was overly disappointed with Part II which degenerates into just a good action flic.  Spielberg junks historical accuracy for post Vietnam sensibilities.  Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his squad of Rangers are portrayed as post Vietnam philosophers who dwell on the unfairness of having to risk their lives for a political necessity -- saving the fictional Private Ryan.  In point of fact, the loss of the five Sullivan brothers when their ship, the USS Juneau,  was sunk in 1942 resulted in changed Navy policy about allowing brothers to serve on the same ship.  The public wanted (but never got) a law to that effect.  So, the idea of saving Private Ryan would not have struck these 1944 Rangers as particularly odd.   The movie, though, portrays Gen. George C. Marshall as a callous political hack for recognizing this exigency.  While the  World War II grunt fought for the same reason all grunts fight -- honor (cowardice, at least in 1944, was still viewed as more distasteful than death), these guys need fulfillment.<br/><br/>Other lapses continued to shake me out of my trance.  A cameo appearance by Ted Danson, for instance, seemed out of place and I found myself thinking about Normy and Carla on Omaha Beach,  and the pre-production Hollywood party when Spielberg says, ""say Ted, if you're not doing anything tomorrow... .""    Later, this squad of savvy Rangers is seen marching in file on the crest of a ridge, fully back-lit by the moon.  Hardly something out of the Ranger survival guide.  The action sequences, as always in a Spielberg production, were terrific, but by the end of Part 2  I was cynical about Spielberg's motives. Rated 8 out of 10 overall."

","""War is hell.""  For most of us that's an intellectual truth.  We've had no personal contact with the brutality of battle.  Steven Spielberg doesn't let us get away with such detachment.  He forces the senseless slaughter and stupidity of war right in our faces.  The first 25 minutes of this film is, without doubt, the goriest 25 minutes of film to date. In the midst of carnage, we begin to become attached to Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men.  When, after surviving the horrors of the first hours, they are assigned the perilous task of searching out one soldier (behind enemy lines), we worry for their safety.  And well we should.  The mayhem is far from over.  This is not a sentimental search-and-rescue story.  This movie is a philosophical dissertation on war--the do or die mentality of fighting men--personal courage--the rationalizations--patriotism.  It's also an excellent piece of film.  Similar to Schindler's List, you want to cringe from the knowledge, from the reality, of what you're seeing on the screen, but you are compelled to continue to watch.  The acting is excellent; awards are sure to follow.  This is a significant film which everyone should see--if they have the stomach for it."

","The effect this movie has on you is devastating.  The combat scenes in the movie are where you can find Speilberg exploring territory that no other director has before in war movies.  Spielberg comes as close to capturing the madness of war by showing us the horror in an unrelenting fashion. Deaths alternate between quick and horrifying and slow and agonizing.  It's unfortunate that such a pedestrian script was used to connect the awesome combat scenes.  But the frustratingly simplistic plotline serves as a way for the characters to question war in a way a post-Vietnam American would, without making such questioning seem historically preposterous (as it did in ""The Thin Red Line,"" whose ""hero"" has gone AWOL just months following Pearl Harbor).  The movie would have been a 10 if not for the bookends (Private Ryan visiting Normandy as an old man) that were taken from ""Titanic."""

","The most stunning war film in cinematic history. Steven Spielberg has crafted an unbelievable recreation of the Normandy Invasion and story that follows. By using bleached out lighting and a guerrilla style of camerawork, Spielberg thrusts the viewer  into the battle. Januscz Kaminski's camera seems to be everywhere at once without losing the viewer. At the center is the performance by its cast. They perform with a quiet sense of dignity not seen in films today. Tom Hanks gives his most memorable performance to date as Capt. John Miller, a battle-weary citizen-soldier who has seen too much. Hanks is without a handicap in this role, unlike Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. The character he creates is one who is faced with an insurmountable task and in carrying it out, must keep himself and his men alive, and without losing his own sanity and decency. This performance easily surpassed Oscar winner Roberto Benigni's.  Alongside Hanks' performance is beautiful portrayals by Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, and Matt Damon. This was by far the best film of the year, easily beating Shakespeare in Love. It is sad to see that an ad campaign can buy a film an Academy Award."

John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are dead and the mother was going to receive all three letters at once. The opening scene of the old man walking in the war veteran's cemetary with his family a few steps back. Unless people have seen the film before, we don't know who this man is or what significance it has on the film; It gets tied in at the end of the film. I saw Saving Private Ryan twice and the opening scene had such a powerful impact on th rest of the film, but it was one of those things that you must watch it more than once to fully understand it as I did. Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. I love the loyalty that Tom Sizemore's character, Sgt. Horwath, holds for his boss Capt. Miller. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me. The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute war scene at the beginning was eye-opening to say the least. At first, I hated that part since it was so long and drawn out; but, when I saw it the second time just a few days ago I understood why it was done this way. I think Spielberg wanted to bring out emotions and make a statement to the audience that war is something that was devastating and something that should never have happened. Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. Matt Damon continues to produce box office hits as does Tom Hanks and the incomprible legend Steven Spielberg.

In the early days of film, audiences literally ducked out of the way, reacting to a shot of a speeding locomotive.  I mention these two things because I want to communicate why we go to movies to begin with.  One reason is to witness the horrific events of our past, in hopes that we can prevent them from happening again.  The other--and this can only be done if the movie makers are skilled enough (and Spielberg clearly is) is to convince us of the authenticity of a time and place.<br/><br/>We go to the trouble of going to the movie theatre for a reason.

I had already read several of Stephen Ambrose's books about the European Theater of Operations (D-Day, Citizen Soldiers) before I saw the film.

As gory as the movie was, I believe that he was correct.  He could have made it much worse without departing from reality.

You will urge the American soldiers on, you will duck, you will smell the salt water and blood, you will yell ""medic"", and you will feel war.  Truly, this one battle is the best scene depicting war other than film taken of actual battles (and this may be better). My hat is off to Spielberg.  Truly this is a great movie, and only a few can even come close to comparing to it.  Not since Schindler's List has a movie moved me. If this movie does not win best picture, best actor, best supporting actor, best director, best writing, best cinematography, best sound, best editing, best effects, and a slew of others then those that vote did not see this movie."

","The first 30 minutes I sat with my toes clenched. People around me were sobbing, which I honestly found to be over-reacting. After the 30 minutes the movie begins to slow down and the wafer thin plot is introduced. The characters in the movie are never really fully developed and stay two dimensional. That's why I was surprised about the Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks, in my view totally undeserved. The visuals are good and effectively show the chaos during combat. Overall I would put the movie in the same category as ""The dirty dozen"" and other mission type war movies, very entertaining but not worth the hype this movie has gotten."

","The initial 30 minutes are groundbreakingly realistic, and probably give a truer sense of what it was like to storm the Normandy beaches than any film that has come before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the middle half of the film wanders about aimlessly, as the characters - a checklist of war-types - gather themselves for the finale, which sets the soldiers on a well-worn path. Also, the attitudes of the soldiers reflects the cynical, resentful 1960s generation of war protesters and draft dodgers, not the genuinely heroic generation that actually fought WWII. As a result, I think this film (like almost everything else) pales next to the more authentic THE LONGEST DAY; another good one is THE BIG RED ONE which features a checklist of movie-army-types led into battle by Lee Marvin, and is similar in structure to RYAN but more authentic as well.<br/><br/>That said, the opening scenes and the finale feature some of the best war scenes ever filmed. The movie works on another level as well: we're the ones who were saved by that generation's ultimate sacrifice, and like Ryan we should be asking ourselves, ""What have I done to deserve the sacrifices made for _me_?"""

","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a triumphant masterpiece about heroism, integrity, and humanity.<br/><br/>Imagine...a soldier, fighting in the middle of a horrific war. The date is June 6, 1944, otherwise known as 'D-Day.' On the shores of Normandy, the D-Day Invasion happens. The good guys, the U.S. Army fights valiantly against all the obstacles that fate has decided to utilize. Suddenly, pulled into the heart of the battle, machine guns start firing in all directions. Explosions could be reverberated from miles away. The soldier hesitates, waiting for that clear shot. Everywhere he goes, he watches in anguish as one by one, his allies fall. Bodies of defeated souls rest all over the place, on the grass, the sand, and even floating dead around the sea. The water is adulterated with human blood, the screams of the mortally wounded echo in a whirlpool of agony. Medical experts rush to save the injured, many are not lucky.  As a soldier, he is about to breakdown. Then, the glimmer at the end of the tunnel is an insinuation for him to keep fighting...<br/><br/>The above paragraph is an example of how technically proficient the introductory battle sequence has been directed by Steven Spielberg in this trenchant motion picture.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the story of Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other marines who go on a quest to save the life of one damned soul...Private Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three older brothers have all been killed in action. Miller's second-in-command, Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), along with the sniper expert, Private Reien (Edward Burns), are obligated to save this very one life. Unlike many others who have sacrificed themselves in pain and suffering, this particular Private Ryan can not bare to lose his very own life...for he is the last surviving member of his family so that can perpetuate the bloodline...<br/><br/>The 40 minute prelude in SAVING  PRIVATE  RYAN  is  one  of  the  most disturbing yet cogent images ever filmed on camera. At the beginning, with see Captain Miller's perspective of World War II's toll both in human costs and emotional value. Little subtleties have damaged Miller for life, i.e. he constantly shakes his right hand whenever he tries to drink from a water bottle.  Miller, a mere English schoolteacher only wants a ride home...but this time...him along with seven of his trusted allies must be coerced to get the mission done...<br/><br/>As for the cast, Tom Sizemore is equally stunning and mesmerizing as his cohort who tries to keep a straight composure, but he loses his temper as well. Edward Burns doesn't have a big role, but he contributes heavily as another of the persevering Privates, proficient with his aim. Matt Damon is also terrific as Private Ryan, one soldier who puts his duty before his own life.<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an excruciating experience that boldly pulls the viewer into the heart of the World War II so realistically unlike most other films.  The introduction showing everybody the devastating costs of inhumane violence is already a gory eye-catcher that may turn off much of the squeamish. Still, don't let  the  strong  violence   deter   you    from watching this movie, this film is a must-see.<br/><br/>Instead of glamorizing on violence as usually stereotypically depicted in other movies, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN plunges the viewer into the real consequences of war. As the stark but unforgettable saying goes, ""War is hell.""<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, though fictional, has been based on the inspirational real-life story of ""The Fighting Sullivans,"" five brothers who all served in the same naval services... Unfortunately for them...one torpedo has claimed all five of their lives and has permanently scarred a family for life...<br/><br/>Few motion pictures in cinematic history have touched so many people's lives, hearts, and souls as this epic motion picture. Often living in a society where we take freedom for granted, these steadfast soldiers portrayed in this indelible film have dedicated their lives to save us...and the world from absolute oppression, persecution, and tyranny.<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is one splendid picture, capturing every turbulent moment of the lives of these selected eight men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the archetype of the consummate war film. The intro and climactic sequences for this film are eye-catching, and the characterizations for this movie have never been in so much depth.  The climax in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN where both sides take their tolls is an exemplary concept of how talented a director Steven Spielberg truly is. The severity of war in this film and every life involved in it has been captured so well in detail.<br/><br/>If there is only one complaint I must give about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, it's that this movie is a little bit too sluggish at times. It can be cut down to around 2 hours and still be a great film. Otherwise, this is a flawless masterpiece. Superb, solemn, and sharply powerful. The lesson that has been so successfully achieved in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is that confrontation on the true aspects of the horror of war can bring out only the best and heroic attitudes of anybody who has the courage.  It is also amazing that in this film, despite all the disheveled scenes the characters must face, they still manage to retain a good sense of humor once in a while. This movie deserves all exalted praises!  Too bad the Academy Awards did not allow SAVING PRIVATE RYAN to win the Oscar for Best Picture...<br/><br/>RATING: **** out of ****."

","The film is at most fun. The production is speckless, the action very intense in the vital moments, the cinematography is excellent, the sound involving, all very beautifully done, but... it is all. It is just a millionary production, a little more than ID4. The story is very poor, and the historical context is far away from making the film outstanding. It feels like anything about war one has seen, only better made. It is outrageous that people put Saving Private Ryan above others of the genre, such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. The acting is hardly good, not because of the actors, who did what they could, but because of the story, which made the acting secondary. Since the story is so poor, and the American Hero appeal is not what can make it better, the whole film has become just another nice and entertaining Spielberg production. Far from deserving an Oscar, further from being mentioned in Cinema History (as the Art)."

","Saving Private Ryan is a film which brings up many of the important questions regarding the morality of war. It doesn't try to answer any of them, but asks each individual to examine themselves, as so many died just so that we may live. Sizemore's and Hanks' performances are of Oscar caliber, as is the cinematography and direction. During the battle scenes Spielberg overexposes the film and cranks it at a different speed which effectively takes the viewer into the surrealism of battle.

","The first time I laid my eyes on this film (I have seen it about 10 times now), I was filled with awe and inspiration.  The ""transitional"" wide-angle shot of the grunts being torn to peices just as the higgins boats reach the beach are the most horrifying (and at the same time) the most beautiful images I have ever seen on film.  The half-hour that follows (and I don't think that many will disagree with me) is flawless filmmaking. Unfortunately, that is the problem.  The first half-hour is SO damned strong in fact, that it is in MY opinion that the momentum of the rest of the film suffers in comparison.  Like ""Braveheart"" and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", Speilberg showed his ideas through emotions and feelings rather than words.  I believe that was all accomplished in the first act of the film, leaving the rest of the picture to fend for itself.  What turned out to be a very intelligent move by Robert Rodat and Speilberg was to use each member of the squad to express an intruiging symbolic idea.  To me, that made up<br/><br/>for the lack of any solidity to the story-line that may have existed.  The level of violence and arbitrariness are without a doubt maxed out here, but at good cause.  ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about what unfolded on Omaha Beach that morning knows that it was a collosal bloodbath full of blood, guts, vomit, and death.  If you would read Steven Ambroses' ""D-Day"" novel, you would actually realize that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was just an edited version of what occurred that morning on the different sectors of Omaha Beach. Never-the-less, this film is a true repreasentation of raw power and gritty realism, that I am sure, will not be passed up for a long while in scope."

","Saving Private Ryan was 100% worthy of the best picture Oscar. I can tell you that no other filmmaker could direct a more realistic depiction of warfare on Omaha beach during WWII. It was so vivid that you were almost there, witnessing (but not experiencing) the brutality, pain, and fear the soldiers went through. The first 20 minutes or so of this film is increasingly graphic, but if you've ever wondered the true nature of a story told by a surviving veteran relative, here it is!<br/><br/>The plot is part non-fiction and part fiction, focusing on a mother who wants her son brought home after his three remaining brothers are killed in battle. A platoon of men (head by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Garry Pepper) are sent to find the last remaining Ryan, Pvt. James Ryan (played by Matt Damon, who does not overact in the role) behind enemy lines.  Each and every soldier was different, and what made it so interesting was how they interacted with one another. Yes, they were extremely sympathetic. The cinematography was brilliant, as was the set (which they actually filmed in international areas.)  Another memorable scene was their conversations in that broken down French town towards the finale (Cherbourg?) speaking of romances that occurred back home and the irony of that record player working, with a French lady singing about heartbreak. A very UN-Hollywoodish movie.<br/><br/>I could recommend this film to anyone, and if you can't stand to stay to see the beginning, come in when that part is over. Anyone who says this movie was ""boring"" and ""pointless""  most likely has not seen the movie, or they are just fans of the Adam Sandler/Pauly Shore genre.

And the director's ability to make great films with epic sweep is another advantage of Ryan. I believe that every American from the age of 15 on should see this film, to understand what it means to go to war, or to send men and women into war. The realism of Ryan was overwhelming. My wife and I could not leave our seats after the film for almost 15 minutes. We were overwhelmed emotionally. A unique experience."

","Spectacular action scenes do not make a classic war movie. This film has two of them, that serve as bookends for a rather dull middle.<br/><br/>The war scenes are extremely well done, that much is true. But many people, who hail this film as a classic, seem to substitute well filmed action & carnage for that of a ""classic"". How many films that came before this one have told us of the horrors of war, that war is hell, & ""this is how it really was""? Even if the war scenes in SPR are superior to that of ,say, the Deer Hunter or Platoon, does it make it a better film? No. SPR has nothing new to say about war. It may contain more extravagant war scenes than these other war films, but don't go mistaking it for a classic, or the ""ultimate war film"".<br/><br/>Something has always bothered me about Spielberg's films. He is incapable of subtlety or nuance . Everything is out in the open, spelled out, leaving nothing to the imagination, or to the mysteries & complexities of human nature.He has always struck me as a kid, showing off his film making skills, trying to outdo everyone else's films on whichever genre. .He takes heavy weight subjects such as the holocaust, war, slavery, & cheapens them. And because of the sensitivity of these topics, we are not allowed to criticize him or his films, because his intentions are worthy or noble. It's not the subject matter of his films I have a problem with, it's his treatment of them that I dislike.<br/><br/>Compared to the Thin Red Line, SPR has a connect the dots mentality.It has none of the compassion, complexity or rich layering that the TRL has. But because it does have the enormous amount of carnage & gore that the TRL doesn't have, it gets more attention.Even in a war film such as the TRL, there is still room for subtlety. Spielberg is only trying to outdo the war films that have come before his. He'll push all the buttons necessary & use all the tricks he knows to do this.<br/><br/>SPR is firstly an action film, and that's why most people like it. The bits about the loss of human life, the sacrifices these men made,etc. are secondary, and only serve to prop the film up and attempt to give it loftier & more meaningful ideals than it actually has. Let's face it, SPR enthusiasts are going to see this film for the very thing that the film (unsuccessfully) tries to denounce: the horror & violence of war. Don't be fooled."

","Saving Private Ryan.  The title alone is brilliantly written, obviously by Robert Rodat, but the title doesn't really even begin to match the movie's over all breadth and scope.  Yes a hodgepodge of war-versed soldiers enter into heavily German infested French countryside and find many little happenstance adventures along the way to Ryan, but that is not what this film 'wants' to be about.  The long extended scenes of pure adrenaline horror, was an exercise in realism by Spielberg, never sophomoric, but absolutely true in its depiction of terror while in combat.  In past attempts at 'experiencing' film terror, or as Alex from Clockwork Orange would say, ""Vidying terror"", I viewed some 8 or 9 snuff films known as the 'faces of death', and my memories of those grisly scenes coincided at times in SPR.  One scene in particular, when Tom and his men are clinging for dear life on bullet ridden sand dunes, and the camera frenetically shifts back and forth between screaming characters, then captures Tom pulling over a man with his face caved in. I swore at that moment that I had seen something similar in faces of death.  Scenes like this, or Cpt. Miller kneeling on the beach with stream of blood trickling down his face as soldiers engulfed in flames try to carry on fighting, or Medic Wade vaingloriously claiming to have 'stopped the bleeding' as a bullet rips thru the soldier's helmet, remind me of the gritty atrociousness not only in movies, but in life.  Yes, real life.  The opening of Ryan, not the Normandy beach opening, but the Normandy cemetery is very poignant.  Line after line of white marble headstones, extending into the vanishing point, and the bereaved veteran humbled into silent weeping in their presence.  Then, another genius stroke of Spielberg, the camera dollies slowly into the veteran's deep transcendant eyes,  and then the crash of waves into the rusted hedgehogs; saltwater ebbing and flowing cautiously thru its iron legs.  Although, as I watched SPR, the critic in me couldn't completely be astonished by  the 'warrior poetry'.  I saw Spielberg draw influences from such directors as Kubrick, De Palma, Kurosawa, and even Tarantino.  One scene, I think borrows heavily from True Romance, a movie written by the feverishly popculture zeitgeist genius of Quentin Tarantino, in which the soldiers are locked in a Mexican standoff with equally surprised Nazis, chaotically yelling profanities at each other.  Peckinpah I think would be especially proud with the usage of chameleon-like and unexpected violence and gore.  There's one scene in The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah's answer to the 7 samurai, in which a bank robber's horse wobbles and then crashes through a plate glass shop window, whilst the camera frenetically weaves between slow and fast motion.  In the final battle in SPR, this Wild Bunch scene re-emerged in my mind when a bomb blasted soldier hurdles thru a shop window ala Peckinpah.  There is so much to write about this movie that it would take several days and nights to fully begin to encompass its creative inputs.  I'll leave with one final comment;  I think the final battle was a homage to Stalingrad, one of the last and greatest sieges in military history, where Nazi and Russian soldiers battled it out tooth and nail in the bomb hollowed city and in such odd places like wine cellers, church bell towers and antique shops.  Saving Private Ryan definately does it justice."

Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performence,  I think Tom Hanks will get the Oscar, I also have strong feelings that it will get at least Director and Picture also. I think everyone should see the movie, so everyone knows that World War II wasn't something that was just there.

Well, isn't that the point of cinema, to make something on a screen seem real?  Apparently, some people on this website don't think so. As for the extreme-violence, HELLO, this was a war film, and war is violent. Another general criticism of this film was its dull, and unrealstic plot. Whoever said that this film's premise was unrealsitic should have done some research since the whole plot is based on a true story of a platoon that was sent to save a soldier whose brothers were lost in WWII.  And finally, the person that criticized the film for having too much nationalism was just trying to attack the film for the opening and closing scenes with the American flag blowing in the wind.  Those scenes were not there to imply nationalism----they were actually there to say that the country's involvement in WWII is what was honorable.  Get it....the flag was waving from the beginning of the war to the end, i.e, fighting the war was something we should be proud of.

The gore was necessary in order to depict the real hell war gives. People say it's too much, but it is perfect when realism is required. The plot was based loosely on a true story of WWII and nobody should put down that the idea has been done before. We take a step in to the minds of people during war and their views, along the way they fight gory battles that are nothing less than fantastic. So people shouldn't talk when they say there is no real screenplay. It deserves to win all the Oscars its nominated for, all of them. Any movie going against it in any way should just back down. People say that it may lose Best Screenplay to either Shakespeare in Love or the Truman Show and I say they do have a great chance, maybe better than ""SPR"" does. But nobody should put it down. People always complain about the gore, but the gore is not the problem, the problem is the people with soft stomachs or don't have enough nerve to stand the violence. That is as close to real life as you can get. And people should just admit it. The best movie of the year, hands down is definitely Saving Private Ryan."

A movie of such power and grim reality as Schindler's can only tear the inner-child that has spawned such classics from the man who draws so perfectly from it.  Lost World and even Amistad showed nuances of this.  Saving Private Ryan has proven that Spielberg is still in control and can wield his Storytelling prowess like a master.  The gritty realism and ""you are there"" style in which Ryan was filmed allows the viewer to experience every sense around him, surpassing ALL other war films that offer only a voyeuristic journey in a glorified battle spectacle.

"Casa2000","Null","0","0","8 March 1999"," Visually and Emotionally Stunning Film but Without Heart and Soul.
","I sat in a theatre, surrounded by strangers and by the end of this film, I felt I was pulled into the battlefields of WWII.  Spielberg's main goal with this film was to create the reality of war, the horror, the fear, the gore, the devastation.  He succeeded on all counts.  The action sequences were nothing short of incredible, very realistic and frightening.  But unfortunately, I think that Speilberg's desire to create the most visually powerful war film of all time was overpowering his ability to tell a good story.<br/><br/>The story was not a very good one.  The story is the heart and soul of a film and it cannot be compromised for the sake of expressing the strictly visual component of that story.  Not only was it completely unbelievable that the US army would send out a group of soldiers in search of one man in the middle of war but the whole movie you are just waiting for another battle to take place.  It kind of reminded me a bit of the movie, ""Twister."" Of course, it was much better than ""Twister"" as a whole but it had a similar structure, good action interrupted by a bad story.  All of the performances are fantastic (and that makes the story watchable, unlike ""Twister"") and some of the Rodat's writing is good (Like Matt Damon's ""back home"" speech) but the film's visual presentation of war is just so enthralling that no story could probably match it.  It is the downfall of any movie which has a much more talented director than screenwriter.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean to say that that combination of writer/director can't work. I believe that Face/Off had a pretty unbelieveable story but John Woo's ability to intergrate the visuals of the film into the story itself and tell the crazy story so matter-a-factly makes it work.  Spielberg didn't seem to take as much interest in the progression of the narrative as he did into the progression of the battle scene. And ultimately, this makes the film stagnate quite frequently.<br/><br/>I still believe the film to be worthy of Best Picture, Cinematography, Editing and a number of technical awards. I don't think that it deserves to win Best Director or Screenplay (but it mostly still will win).  The chemistry that is essential to making a story work was not there and that holds the film back from being a complete masterpiece. If you want to watch WWII film which incorporates both good writing and good direction watch Terrence Malik's ""The Thin Red Line"" (it at least has a better balance of the two).  Still watch ""Saving Private Ryan"", just don't expect to start crying for the characters and their conflict, but expect to cringe in your seats at the horrors of war which Speilberg brings to the screen with incredible authenticity and realism."

Of course there is no reason to criticize the depiction of Americans in an American war film. However, maybe, just maybe, the film would be stronger if nationality was taken out of the equation and we saw it for what war is...People killing each other while in fear of their own lives because of politics. We can be proud of what these people did for our freedom but they didn't do it for a coloured piece of cloth, they did it because they were asked to defend freedom and once in battle, they did it to survive.

What he's seen and done?  ""Saving Private Ryan"" caused me to stop and think about that.  It caused me to stop and consider the sacrifices young American men have made throughout this nation's history.  Sacrifices many of the men in my own family have made. <br/><br/>
This is no John Wayne war film.  The heroes of this movie were young men who were there to do a job.  They were scared to death.  They screamed and prayed and cried for their mothers. This film brings home (as best as any film can) the absolute horror and carnage of war and the very human way people react to such a nightmare.  They were unwilling heroes, just like every other dogface who went to war in real life.<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg has made the best war movie ever to hit the theaters, and the actors-- all of them-- were outstanding.  But let this film remind you of the real men who fought for us in real battles.  This film is a tribute to them, and I don't think Mr. Spielberg will disagree with that statement.

","Spielberg's 2nd masterpiece of war is a shocking and relentless epic that is a perfect blend of emotion and current film technology. There has never been a battle scene as brutally realized as the storming of Omaha Beach, and no other filmmaker has come anywhere remotely close to capturing the horrors of war. You find yourself forgetting where you are and who is even in this 'movie'. I say this meaning the film seems like a documentary, as well as a first hand account, exemplified in the compelling scenes where Hanks' Captain Miller sees everything in slow motion, blood splattering on him and all. The carnage is as close to war as anyone who has never been to war can get. Forget APOCALYPSE, forget THIN RED LINE, forget even PLATOON. This is it.<br/><br/>Actors who have participated in the film say they cannot believe what is on the screen.

The documentary-style cinematography and gritty violence draws the audience into the terror that faced every person that came ashore in Normandy that cold June morning.<br/><br/>As incredibly nerve-wracking as that sequence is in the film, there is a hard truth that every viewer keeps in his mind.  It is this fact alone that allows us to watch in fascination as scores of men are slaughtered on the beach.<br/><br/>The undeniable truth is that this is make-believe.<br/><br/>The bullets are not real.  The blood is fake.  When the director called ""Cut!"" everyone in the scene got up and went to the buffet.

This movie is about how horrific the war is for its first two thirds and then turns into romantic mush about how great it is to be a hero. The ending sequence has nothing to do with opposing the war.<br/><br/>Also where is the human side of the other side? Where is the human side of Germans? Spielberg fails to show that the soldiers are the same no matter what side they fight. This is the true horror of war. That humans are fighting humans. And usually those whoe are fighting are not the ones that are in command. Where are all the generals and admirals and what not I ask? This movie was not supposed to be about the politics it was supposed to show the inhumanness of the war.

","SPR is without a doubt one of the most talked about films of the year. I recently went to see it in the theatre to figure out why. It's impossible to judge this movie on a grand scale, since there are so many little intricacies.<br/><br/>Storyline: Less than fresh. Three brothers die, so a team of men is sent to find the remaining brother to take him home. Uh-huh, yeah, that's realistic. This movie basically has no storyline. It's just a bunch of dialogue strung together in the hopes that someone will make sense out of it all.<br/><br/>Casting: While each one of the actors cast in the role did an admirable job (with particular notice going to Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, who were both extremely impressive), I'd be interested in knowing why Spielberg thought he couldn't go within ten miles of reality. I'm sorry, but the average age of a soldier during WWII was not 35. It was 20. It's a sad, sad day when a 22-yr-old Giovanni Ribisi is the closest thing Spielberg has to a realistic soldier.<br/><br/>Emotional Reality: In as far as getting the reactions of soldiers, Spielberg did a fairly good job. Yes, war is Hell, which is what Spielberg showed with his message that war could turn any man into a monster. Too bad he killed it with chain of command. Those officers were just a tad too willing to scream at their CO's.<br/><br/>Physical Reality: There are a lot of complaints about the Americanism of the film. Of COURSE the film is Americanised! The only unit that actually managed to land anywhere near Omaha Beach was American. While it is asking a little much to expect viewers to believe that the troops never ran into troops from any other army, I don't think Spielberg wanted to test his luck. He couldn't get his OWN country's uniforms A-OK, let alone another country's.<br/><br/>Truthfulness: We ALL know that there is absolutely no fact in this movie whatsoever. Spielberg may have originally touted this as ""the true story of the Niland brothers"", but he recanted long ago, since it's obvious it wasn't. (If it was, they'd have gotten at least one fact in that story right.)<br/><br/>Military Reality: I'm with the experts on this one. A little less flash and trash there, Spielberg, and make an effort next time to get the right kind of weaponry. And BTW, Spielberg, no army would risk losing eight men to get one home, even if he was the president's son.<br/><br/>Cinematic Worth: Excellent. While the direction at times was a little choppy and left something to be desired, this was still an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Most people who are dissatisfied with this movie are probably those who expected to see a true story. Sorry, but you got the wrong war movie of 1998 -- the true story is in ""The Thin Red Line"", which in itself is an excellent war movie. Now sure, I admit, I spent half the movie hoping Matt Damon's character would get it in the end, but I was still extremely satisfied. (I did have to practically hold my great-uncles, both of whom were at Normandy, down to get them to stay -- both wanted to leave in disgust with Spielberg's Hollywoodization and capitalization on this horrific event.) It was well worth going to see in the theatre, and I don't often do that. I do think, though, that the movie will be highly disappointing once on video, because it's the kind of movie one NEEDS to see in a theatre.<br/><br/>Altogether? It's not the best movie of the year, but it's not the worst. It's an excellent fictional account of what life COULD have been like in WWII for a group of soldiers. If you want reality, watch ""The Thin Red Line"", but if you enjoy fictionalized war films like SPR, check out any of the films available in the ""War"" section of your local video store. Well, okay, so maybe ""Rambo"" isn't the thing to go for, but there are a number of excellent movies out there."

","When Spielberg makes a serious film he makes a SERIOUS film. After Schindlers List all I could think was: ""That wasn't Spielberg. It can't have been. Where was the crowd pleaser set pieces? Where was the whimsical family aspect?"" I really didn't think Spielberg was capable of the viciousness he displayed when that film was made. Until I saw this one. 'Vicious' doesn't even begin to describe him.<br/><br/>I came into this film knowing all the hype. How it was such a harrowing account. How it never flinched. How it didn't look away from the gory details. But no matter how much you know coming in you're never prepared enough. Within the first ten minutes you're dropped into this picture of Hell on Earth.<br/><br/>As the boats charge relentlessly towards Omaha beach you can see it coming. As the soldiers on board throw up from seasickness and fear the conclusion is inevitable. The twenty second call is heard. The palms sweat from your feeling of helplessness. The locks on the landing craft doors spin open. The faces of the soldiers behind it eat into your heart. And then it happens. They're dead. They didn't know what hit them. All hell breaks loose. Men drop left, right and centre. Machine-gun fire rains down on them like hailstones. Except these troops aren't punched by neat, circular holes. Oh no. They're torn apart. Shredded. Minced. Arms are removed. Heads caved in. Troops turn to see the person they were dragging to safety has turned into a piece of meat. The ensuing 25 minutes feel like an eternity. Please God let this end. When the beach assault was finally over my mother, who I saw the film with, turned to me and said ""They didn't stand a chance did they?"" I didn't reply.<br/><br/>The motive of this film was to take the heroic notions of War films and crush them totally. War just doesn't work. It's a stupid way to solve an argument. The message is agonisingly unavoidable. It's hard to argue a case for conflict after you've seen too many people die. Anyone that says that prolonged contact with scenes of violence de-sensitizes you clearly hasn't watched this. In a similar vein to All Quiet On The Western Front, this film should be shown to future generations until the word 'War' is removed from the dictionaries. At least the first 30 minutes should be.<br/><br/>After the brutality of Omaha the film calms down to become a more philosophical study into the futility of war. This is where things start to derail. Apart from Hanks' Miller, whose third Oscar was no doubt being moulded while this was made, none of the other leads get a look in. Miller's unit is made up of a pretty stereotypical bunch (whining jew, sympathetic medic, cowardly translator) and attempts to give them an extra dimension don't really work. Sizemore comes close with the job of dependable Sergeant but he just isn't given enough to do. The Germans are also given something of a rough ride. Whilst they are shown as being more human this time there's still an unshakable 'Evil Master Race' feel to the whole affair. There's also the problem of the final battle sequence. Where Omaha gave us the war=meatgrinder equation, the bridge defense opts for the more normal ""A few good men can make a difference"" approach. Add the lack of any allied units (We're in France. Where are the French Resistance?) and you have a rather mixed final message.<br/><br/>This isn't the greatest War film ever (Full Metal Jacket wins easily) but it's an unflinchingly moving movie which will often chill and occasionally scar. It sometimes feels like a grown up Indiana Jones but Omaha Beach has to be seen to be believed. You may not be the same person after."

","All the other reviews have pretty much summed up how great a movie this is. An instant classic. So I'll just add a few of my own thoughts. This is a must-see movie for a GOOD THEATRE with GOOD SOUND if you want to appreciate the battle sequences. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the battle with explosions all over the place and bullets whizzing by to the right and left. See it in the theatre with the best sound system possible. The D-Day sequence is one of the most brilliant movie sequences ever filmed. This is Spielberg's second greatest film: Schindler's List is still his most powerful. And this is probably one of the best, if not the best, war films. The only other one that comes close is Full Metal Jacket, which is more disturbing but not as comprehensive or as emotionally involving. <br/><br/>As far as the gore and violence, it's intense and brutal but is not nearly as bad as most gory horror films; it doesn't even come close to the Day of the Dead/Dawn of the Dead movies, but it's a completely different kind of violence. It's very real, not fantasy or comic-book violence. I think most 12-year old kids can handle this, and I think most boys 12 and up should see this film, since it will show them a glimpse of what real violence looks like, and maybe counteract the kind of stuff they see in Armageddon and video games."

In my opinion, this movie should get an Oscar for best picture and possibly Tom Hanks for best actor. I was impressed with his portrayal of Capt. Miller. He was very believable. I say this because I have served with men like this. But I am thankful I never had to go through what those men went though on the day or at any other time. I would like to thank all those who helped keep this country great in its history. I am proud beyond measure to be an American. And I thank Mr. Speilberg for bringing this story to the motion picture screen."

","This movie made me realize how horrible war is, and why it is important that we are never involved in another one.  As always Spielberg has presented us with such an exciting and involving picture that the experience will not soon be forgotten.  There are some stand-out performances in this movie.  Tom Hanks puts on an exceptional performance as ""Capt. John Miller"", trying to keep his men alive as they engage in a mission that even he himself has trouble believing in.  Another great performance by a fine young actor named Barry Pepper, as the talented sniper who quotes scripture as he disposes of his enemies.  This film grabs a hold of you from the opening scene storming the beach, and doesn't let go until the closing credits and beyond.  About the highest endorsement I can give this movie, is that my Grandfather was in the WWII and he saw the film and said that it was as close to being in a war that(hopefully) I would ever get. Kudos to all involved in this amazing motion picture."

","I agree that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a good movie. Mostly because, to me, it was able to show the horrors of war in a quite realistic way. And how there are no heroes, in fact, for an American movie, its strength was that it showed the grays, not the black and whites. And the first twenty minutes I sat watching as the lump in my throat grew.<br/><br/>But why the present-past-structure? I think the message would have been brought across to me just as powerfully if it had been done in the past only. Without the manipulation of perspective, without the dreadfully over-the-top sentimental scene at the end at the cemetary. Without those frightfully unbelievable last words (wouldn't he have thought about his wife, maybe linked to that memory in the garden?). I could've done without it. And also without those glorious American flags that started and ended the movie.<br/><br/>Why claim this war? What I liked about it was that it was quite vague about all the different nationalities, making it more of a general protest against war. The American flags weaken that aspect. Other than that, it could've been a perfect and very powerful movie. That makes me, a post-war child, respect all people who've experienced and survived war even more."

","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made. Not only has Spielberg outdone himself, he has outdone every war movie since. Never before have i seen a movie that is so powerful, gutwrenching, and brutal. Yeah the movie has flaws, doesn't every other great movie. The flaws in this movie are minor, who cares about the framing sequence at the beginning. Spielberg was just setting us up for what was about to happen. After that the movie picks up speed and never slows down. The d-day sequence is the best combat footage ever shot on film, if that half hour doesn't affect in some way then you're crazy. The way spielberg films it is amazing, using hand held cameras to capture the terror and chaos that reigned on omaha beach that day. The acting is superb, tom hanks is a lock for his third academy award. The supporting characters also do a great job, tom sizemore as sarge, jeremy davies as upham. The end battle is also filmed superbly by spielberg. Not as intense as the beginning battle, but a close second. So to the people who thought this movie was overrated, guess you're too much hooked on hamburger hill. Unlike that movie, saving private ryan will be around for a very,very,very, long time.

Personally I enjoyed Saving Private Ryan very much. I had some pros and cons to it though: the pros were that it was long, intense (like on the battle of normandy scene was very disturbing yet it felt like you were there), but the cons were that halfway through though i thought was a little bit yawnish, but still i sat and enjoyed a wonderful tale of a group of soldiers searching for another soldier to take back home to his mother since his mother had 3 other brothers that died in the war too. This is a type of movie that should be shown to schools worldwide, but one thing i found amazing was the fact that there were old people in the cinema, after the normandy scene, they all left, one was in a wheelchair and collapsed, so i thought that the graphical scenes had to just pull you like a hand and take you into what was probably like in real life.

","After his self-imposed 5 year exile from film, Steven Spielberg returns with a graphic account of World War Two and eight men's mission to find one man. The film's beginning is one of the most realistic and draining<br/><br/>that I have seen. The US marines land on Omaha beach to a constant barrage of fire from German troops on the cliffs. It's a truly graphic part of the film and one which holds your attention with masterful use of the camera. A recurring piece of cinematic genius in the film is when the camera focuses on Captain Miller (Hanks) and the sound is distorted. It's a terrible dream-like moment of being as his face shows he cannot comprehend why he is there. Another scene is when Sgt Jackson (Barry Pepper) is attempting to shoot down a sniper which has already claimed the life of one of his comrades. The shot is reversed and we see the view of the German sniper-shooter. It's a thrilling piece of cinema. It is a film which underlines the futility and horror of war but also mixes in the humour which kept up the men's moral, e.g. FUBAR, and the bets they place on their captain telling them about himself.

","My sympathies to the authors of the few comments critical of this film. You are not alone. The legion of fans this movie has accumulated seem to treat its detractors like Martians.<br/><br/>The film is hysterically overrated, and even the Omaha Beach sequence isn't all its cracked up to be. As someone who has seen a lot of Italian horror movies, the graphic violence didn't affect me. Some might think the comparison is inappropriate, but this is a MOVIE, after all, not actual battle footage. Critics droning on about the ""realistic"", ""authentic"", ""true-to-life"" depiction of the ""horrors of war"" are responding more to the DreamWorks press kit than to the film itself, since I can't imagine many walked out of the theater thinking to themselves ""that's exactly how I remember WWII"".<br/><br/>Regarding Spielberg's teachings on the ""horrors of war"" (a subject so well-covered in movies it sounds like a cliche), it's nothing you can't get from scores of other films from directors like Ford, Aldrich, Coppola, Lean, Stone, etc. and you're better served by most of them. I'd especially suggest Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory or almost any of Sam Fuller's WWII or Korean war films. The only thing SPR has on any of them is gore.<br/><br/>The drama between the (type) characters is hackneyed and hollow, John Williams' score is slopped on like emotional fingerpainting, and the politics are infantile and shallow. The action sequences are OK, but not as good as the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg's most original WWII film remains 1941."

","Usually I'm pretty reluctant to see movies at a friend's recommendation- -they're so built up by the time I actually see them and I'm rather disappointed.  However, there is no way that anyone can be prepared for the effects of this film, and I was certainly NOT disappointed.  There is no way that anyone can accurately describe what this movie contains--the people it portrays, the senses and sounds it illustrates, and the emotions that it evokes.  It is true that this film is frighteningly realistic; it's certainly not for the faint of heart.  However, it is still only a film, and it delivers only a mere FRACTION of what our veterans experienced in the horrors of battle.  This is one of the most horrifying yet fascinating and moving films that I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a very emotionally disturbing movie in terms of seeing the too real horrors of war on the silver screen because Hollywood is usually shiny, happy and perfect.  In a way it's a bit ironic that something so horrible can appear in such compact form.  It's not supposed to be real, and it's supposed to comfort us--isn't that what show business is about?  This movie didn't do that.  I almost became ill at some of the scenes.  Merely sitting in an air-conditioned theatre with Dolby Digital Surround Sound watching this film was a bit nerve-racking, I must say. Imagine what real war must be like.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I felt sickened with paralyzing fear at the thoughts of war, being wounded, and dying in battle; in my mind's eye, I imagined my friends and I in the same situation.  I simply couldn't fathom it, nor will I ever.  I thank the powers that be for the men and women who did suffer through those battles.  I thank the men and women who died for me, who died for my family, and who died for my friends.  I thank the soldiers who serve today, who keep the rest of us safe so that we don't have to go into battle ourselves.<br/><br/>It's films like Saving Private Ryan that give me a hundred times more respect for the armed forces.  This is the film that gives us a glimpse of what we normally don't see or experience.  This is the film everybody should see to gain insight into how lucky we civilians really are.  This is the film about horrifying truth and enlightening respect and understanding.

Steven Spielberg has really pushed the envelope of film-making for the years to come. With a style and courage which is becoming his trade-mark (who else had the guts to make a disaster movie about a seven foot fish or shoot a big studio production in black and white?)<br/><br/>The opening scene is often called brilliant but had little to do with the rest of the movie. I believe those 24 minutes were as essential to the movie as sound is. Those 24 minutes showed us that the men who surrvived that torment to tell the rest of the story, could only do so not because they where brave, or skilled, but because they where plain lucky. Every single scene after that sequence was covered with a blanket of dreadfulness, never to be sure who`s next.<br/><br/>Then the story about the men. To some, they weren't very convincing. I believe that they were supported with enough information to give an audience with a bit of imagination the tools to fill-in the blanks. It`s not King Lear we are looking at but regular joes, the kind you would sit next to on a bus and never care to notice, as in fact the same kind of people who saved my country.  That`s why I don`t have a problem with the American flag waving at the closing scene.

It in no way diminishes, overlooks or ignores British or other Allied contributions and  sacrifices, without which victory certainly would not have been accomplished.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg deserves the thanks of every one on this planet for so clearly defining the central issues of war in general and specifically what is arguably the defining moment of the twentieth century, World War II.

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is an interesting film. As far as basis in fact goes, this movie rests on the truthful scale somewhere between ""Titanic"" and ""Star Wars"". About the only thing Spielberg got right was the fact that there was a war going on at the time. He owes both the Niland and Sullivan families very sincere apologies for butchering what he originally claimed was ""their true story"".<br/><br/>I had a harder time judging this movie on a reality scale. In some ways, the movie was very gripping and realistic, but in other ways, Spielberg failed miserably. In Spielberg's WWII, there were two groups of people. The horrible, murdering Nazis, and the good ol' boys of the US. I may be biased because I currently reside in Canada, but I know that there were probably just as many Canadian (not to mention British and others) troops roaming around during WWII. I admit they did do a tolerable job on the WWII ambience, but did very poorly on creating a realistic military environment.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, and well worth every penny it cost to see eight times in the theater (eight different groups of friends), but I wouldn't laud it as a fabulous war film, nor would I use it to teach military history, as some schools are considering doing. There were two things that really hurt the movie; 1) Spielberg's Hollywoodization of the film and his insistance on hiring over-aged big-name actors; 2) Spielberg's insistance (until recently) that Saving Private Ryan was a ""true story"". Spielberg would have done better hiring some relatively unknowns and making clear the film was fiction. It may have just been me, but seeing Matt Damon as Private Ryan made me wish they had just left him there. Matt Damon was the Hollywood heart-throb after ""Good Will Hunting"", and it was so obvious it was Spielberg's way of pulling in the teen crowd. I was surprised he didn't hire the DiCaprio boy.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" wasn't the best film of the year, but it was by no means the worst. I recommend it to anyone over 18 who is looking for an entertaining, hard-hitting way to pass three hours. The scenes on the beach really are well done and excellently written (makes it easy to overlook the mistakes), and while the movie does drag at times, it's worth taking a look-see. I would not suggest allowing children to see this movie, because many of the scenes are highly graphical and highly disturbing. I have no plans on letting my children see this film until they're old enough to understand that film isn't reality, and that Saving Private Ryan is just as fictional as most war films (""G. I. Jane"", ""Courage Under Fire"", etc). If military films are a real interest, I would suggest either adaptation of ""The Thin Red Line"". It is more realistic than ""Saving Private Ryan"", and as opposed to the fictional Saving Private Ryan, ""The Thin Red Line"" has a high basis in fact."

But please, PLEASE, don't hit us over the head so you can make the ending ""neat.""  Everything always has to wrap up so nicely with Speilberg that you wonder where all that realism went.  If he thinks we were mature enough to handle the intense violence of the opening thirty minutes, then why can't we also be mature enough to decide for ourselves (and grapple a bit with the ideas presented), whether or not Ryan's life was ""worth it""? To see the first and last five minutes of this movie is to understand why this film does not deserve the Oscar everyone so absently wants to give it. Call me bitter, but I'd rather watch The Longest Day anyday of the week over this."

","This is the best movie I've seen this year so far.  I can't describe just how great this movie is.  From the first scene in the beaches of Normandy to the final confrontation, the movie is a tour-de-force on the terrors of war.  The battle scenes have an authenticity and intensity never before seen in film, and you ask yourself what could possibly lead men to slaughter each other in such a horrible manner.  Steven Spielberg proves he's a Grand Master of directors, and Tom Hanks and company also did a great job in the acting department.  When I was watching this movie in the theater, an old man sat beside me.  He had a Purple Star in his shirt.  Then when the movie was over, everyone got out in silence, as if catatonic.  And the first thing I see when I get out into the lobby is the old man and his wife, hugging and crying.  That's how powewrful this film is."

"Eryn","Null","0","0","4 February 1999"," Am I nuts?
","I'm writing here almost out of desperation. I seem to be the only one left in the world that didn't really like Saving Private Ryan. And although the other comments here were encouraging, I still feel slightly at a difference with them. Because I didn't dislike the movie because of its cinematic defects - I just disliked it because of the message it sent about war.<br/><br/>Now, I've been told that I'm being too hard on Spielberg. After all, Saving Private Ryan is supposedly less enthusiastic and glorifying about war than any previous movie (I would beg those of this persuasion to re-examine their opinion of Apocalypse Now). But I can't condone this trumpeting of a movie which concludes with a shot of the American flag waving in the sun as being a new representation of war.<br/><br/>War isn't about nobility. But Saving Private Ryan is. War is about dirt and sweat and blood and tears and futility. It's about dehumanization and loss. There are no men in war who want to reward a Mrs. Ryan with the gift of the only son she's got left. Only men who want to claim strategic posts.<br/><br/>Elements of these things sometimes appear in Saving Private Ryan. But they disappear again in favour of a close-up of Tom Hanks' sad-but-surviving facial expression, or an old frail man standing proud at a war grave. Any attempt at reality is then lost.<br/><br/>The performances are good - but everyone seems to be tripping over each other to appear the most ordinary. Although this was probably an attempt at allowing the viewer to identify the soldier with the boy-next-door, it ends up sacrificing character depth in favour of surface considerations.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say that Saving Private Ryan is awful, and could even be called a step in the right direction. The movie has a good premise and hits some strong notes - especially in the strange conjecture of risking the lives of five men to find one. The problem is, like all war movies to date, it tries to make sense out of what is happening to the people onscreen. Give them a goal, a purpose, and it will seem like the horror that was, was a horror that had to be.<br/><br/>The problem is that in doing that, Saving Private Ryan fails to say anything we haven't heard before. It's not that I don't believe good things can happen in war - it's just that I don't believe only good things can happen. And with Saving Private Ryan, cinema failed once again to take that stance."

","I liked this film from top to bottom.  I have to disagree with other reviewers (and there have been many) who claim the film is overly patriotic in tone.  Have they noticed that the American flag shown at the beginning and end of the film looks washed out, almost bled down?  I'm sure this is no accident.  I felt that there was a message in that curiously colorless flag. I somehow knew the instant that flag was shown that there were some bad things to come.   It said to me that patriotism is a little hollow in light of the fearsome carnage that people are put through in a war.  As for the flag being American, well it was an American beach and the choice of the U.S. symbol is entirely appropriate.  I would expect the Maple Leaf on Juno, or the Union Jack on Sword or Gold beaches. This movie isn't really about D-day in a grand sense anyway.<br/><br/>I also disagree with those who say the ""bookends"" (boy do they love that term) with the old man at the beginning and end are unnecessary.  Maybe it's just me, but his reaction doesn't seem overly dramatic in light of what transpires for him in this story (and other things that happened to many people for real)  The thing of it is, it seemed absolutely necessary to point the finger squarely at this generation of people.  We have a bad habit of shrugging off or even never bothering to learn what it meant to live through those days and times.  They're old men now, they look a lot like that old man in the film.  Shouldn't the mantle rest on their shoulders?  Be honest now, aren't you glad it was theirs and not yours to bear?  Give credit where credit is due.  I think that this is a specific American story aimed at everyone everywhere.  Not an American story aimed at only Americans.  I would dearly love to see an honest treatment of the horrors of the Eastern front, for both the Germans and the Russians and the hordes of desperate souls trapped between them.  Now that would be graphic."

"Valancy","Null","0","0","3 August 1998"," The message of Saving Private Ryan
","When a film like Saving Private Ryan (hereafter SPR) is released, too often people focus more upon the film itself than the message that it carries. SPR is a brilliantly filmed, marvelously executed story, but it is not a perfect film.  No movie could ever be perfect and please everyone.  I will not deny that the flaws many have pointed out here are not present - but I disagree that those flaws render the movie less impactful or important. This was a film that NEEDED to be made, because if one can look beyond the film itself to the message that it delivers, I believe that this film shows better than any other the terrible futility of warfare and the fundamental endurance of the human spirit against all odds. SPR is, ultimately, an allegory.  The story of eight men sent out to find one stranger in the midst of hell on earth is not what is important.  Yes, it is unbelievable that a situation like this, which defies all logic, could actually occur.  But nothing about war is logical.  This is proved so brilliantly through Speilburg's film.  Take, for example, the scene where Mellisch fights the nameless German soldier in hand-to-hand combat.  It is, perhaps, one of the most brutal fighting sequences ever filmed, and in its brutality, Speilburg is showing us just how insane war can become.  This situation, as is pointed out repeatedly throughout the film, is FUBAR - it defies all attempt to be processed rationally.  Why should eight men be forced to risk their lives to save one?  Why should eight hundred, or eight thousand, or eight million risk their lives fighting in a war to save the lives of civilians, total strangers?  We are all indebted to these men - we are all, in a sense, ""Private Ryan"". By allowing us to view warfare through the eyes of the ordinary GI's who fought and died, Speilburg is giving us, as civilians, a window into the hellish nightmare that is modern warfare.  It is a gift, of sorts - the chance to experience what those who sacrificed their lives for us went through.  I, for one, am deeply grateful that these men found it in themselves to transcend themselves and risk everything so that I could be born in a country that is free.  Not only is this a powerfully patriotic film for Americans, it also carries a message for humanity as a whole.  We must, as a species, consider the costs of warfare, and decide whether another such sacrifice is necessary."
"bat-5","9","0","0","2 February 1999"," Best film of 1998
","Saving Private Ryan is the best film of 1998.  Why?  It is the most accurate description that anyone living today will ever see of World War II combat. It is visceral, it is gut wrenching and it was real.  What we are exposed to in Saving Private Ryan was a meat grinder, and that's what the soldiers on Omaha Beach faced that day.  Spielberg throws us into the melee and we are there, we get to feel the dread as the boats come ashore.  We hear the pounding bass of mortar rounds as they roar in from above, and we feel the fear that the soldiers feel.  We don't know what's waiting for us on that beach, and when those doors open, we step into hell.<br/><br/>The camera work during this sequence is amazing.  You are disoriented, and you don't know where the fire is coming from.  You try to make it to cover as machine gun bullets tear into the beach and your fellow soldiers.  Mortar rounds deafen you as they explode a few feet away, and you watch in a numb horror as you see friends vanish before your eyes.  That's what war is, pure and simple.  No time for thoughts on what the nature of God is or any of that metaphysical junk, you're just thinking am I going to live?<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan lets us see what it was like to be a soldier in WWII. We get to know each of the soldiers under Tom Hanks' command.  We feel the loss of their lives because Spielberg invests time with these men.  We feel their anger and resentment toward Ryan.  Why is he so special?  Why does he get the ticket home and we get to stay here?  The more time we spend with these men, the more we know them.  When they finally find Ryan, our view of him changes.  He's not just some punk that the top brass sent us out to find, he's a soldier.  He's one of us, and we'll do everything in our power to get him out alive.<br/><br/>You want a meditation on the nature of war and man and what God is?  Watch The Thin Red Line and have your butt numbed.  You want an experience that will linger with you for days?  Watch Saving Private Ryan, then ask your grandparents about WWII.  See what they say."

Usually, those opinions display a number of recurring themes and tend to form a pattern. Not so for SPR. The comments I've read run the full spectrum of criticisms, some of them highly contradictory. Only a truly monumental film can garner this type and degree of reaction, and draw such a diverse response from so many. Some of the greatest films ever made have continued to be controversial for long periods after their release. ""2001:A Space Oddysey"" is a good example.

","The thing that hit me the most after seeing this movie was the way that the audience, upon the turning on of the theater lights, simply rose as one and walked silently out of the theater.  Not more than a word was said, and I think that's the best compliment anyone can give this movie.  Out of all the teenagers and Gen-Xers that were in the theater, not one of us felt compelled to speak after watching this.  I can say that the opening sequence hit me harder than anything I have ever witnessed in my (albeit short) life. I found myself wrapping my arms around my knees, trying to hide my eyes but unable to avoid the horror unfolding on the screen.  I actually felt like somehow I was in danger.  The horror I felt as the soldiers stepped out of the boats into the gunfire was gut-wrenching.  All the movies we watch in school, all the History Channel specials don't even touch what this movie touched, honestly.  I never realized the horror of what D-Day and this war was until I saw this movie.  It took it out of the abstract and forced those of us who have never had to live through a real war to see it as they did. It makes me want to thank every one of the men who were in this war for what they sacrificed for those of us who live here now.  I don't know if I would be strong enough to handle it, and I hold as my heroes anyone who was.<br/><br/>About the movie in itself, I actually thought the scenes at the beginning and end were touching.  A bit too theatrically staged, definitely, but I thought it was a nice beginning and end for the movie.  The battle scenes, enough said.  Phenomenal.  The one and only criticism I have is that I think the script was a little weak in its character development.  I had a hard time really feeling for the characters, and I think that maybe the battle scenes were emphasized so much that we lost who the men really were.  It's hard to develop characters while the audience is concentrating on gunfire. However, this was an excellent, excellent movie, definitely, a 9 out of 10."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best war films ever made simply because of its refusal to leave anything to the imagination.  Nothing in this film is ambiguous, supported by vehement images of dismembering and dying. Whereas water drops hit the camera lens in another movie, blood splatters all over it in this one.  The first 24 minutes are shot confusingly, using shaky, hand-held camera motion, ground level angle shots, numerous soldiers' POVS, as well as expert cinematography, creating a ""news-reel"" footage feel, gritty and fast.  The war is chaotic and anything but fun. <br/><br/>Dialogue in this movie is succint and to the point.  Most of the characters exhibit their emotions merely by staring, emaciated, into the camera.   Spielberg has created a graphic, candid image of war, something unparalled but highly controversial.  Many people argue that some things should be left lightly without gratuity. To get the poignant purpose across, as well as many of the themes, however, Spielberg must let the audience identify with the characters, their fears and their insanity.  The human stories are bettered by the horrific images.  When they lose it, we don't question them.  I don't question Spielberg either for taking a great story and providing it with vivid visuals."

","I'm waiting for the second run of SPR so I can see it for a third time. This is not to say I loved this film or consider it to be the great masterpiece so many have over-hyped it to be. I happen to love historical epics and WWII is my favorite history subject along with the rarity of this type film these days makes it the more desirable for me to view. I do concur with all the rave about the opening beach landing being an intense awe-inspiring film experience however the remaining two plus hours of the film are quite ordinary and only the exciting battle at the conclusion of the film rescues SPR from being a dull disappointment. I also find the battle at the end of the film to be a contradiction to the opening battle and confuses the whole message.  In the first battle we are in the middle of massive carnage and gore and get the feel of being pinned down and what it's like to fear moving an inch and being killed but if you don't move you will be killed anyway! There is no false heroics only desperate men trying to stay alive and do their job. This better than any battle I've seen on film convinces me that I don't want any part of combat and there is nothing glorious about it and those that endured through it deserve our greatest admiration and respect which I believe is the primary message in the film.  The conclusion however resembles the rousing old adventure war films of the past.  Capt. Miller has found Ryan and has orders to bring him back to be sent home and this is his mission but instead he is talked into defending an important bridge by Ryan who doesn't want to abandon his comrades. We are then treated to an exhilarating battle that does not nearly match the terror and gore of the first and all the old W.W.II movie clichÃ©s start to show up. The rock hard sergeant who feels no pain no matter how many times he is shot, Ryan and his honorable loyalty to his men refusing to go home without having to risk his life any longer and of course the cavalry saving the day at the end when all appears lost !? I have a problem with films today dealing with war in that they go out of there way to try and convey too many messages as I believe there is a fear that its no longer politically correct or acceptable to make a war film for the sake of entertainment.  I do believe there have been some great war films with a message such as Paths Of Glory and Go Tell The Spartans and others but there have been far too many that try too hard to preach war is hell and so on and SPR is one of them. I'm not ashamed to say that I prefer films like The Longest Day and Where Eagles dare as they are more entertaining and far more successful at what they are trying to be. No film today tomorrow or a hundred years from now will ever convey the horror of war or will impact society's view of war alone.  Twenty years from now some other war film will come along and SPR will seem tame in comparison but it will still just be a movie like SPR is.   I went to see SPR for the action and my W.W.II interest and was compelled only by those two things not the weak story line or pretentious messages and syrupy drama. SPR is a good film because of two great action pieces that hold up the long message laden middle and if it wasn't for the cliched conclusion and Ryan simply returned to the rear this film would not be seen by as many people who would have been disappointed by a anti-climactic non action conclusion which is the primary reason people view war films to see combat action not be preached at about how horrible war is !"

And why? Because, when I watched the others, I was just watching. When I went to the movies to see SPR, I WAS THERE. I could feel the war in me... I could feel all that human strength fighting against something they did not even know.<br/><br/>Cliche? I'll tell you what is a cliche in a war movie: the man is shot and in slow motion camera he cries and falls on the ground. His friends stop to look at him, and the bullets stop to be shot to them. The dying man says: ""Please, tell my girlfriend I love her... i wanted to have been a better man, i wanted to..."" (and he dies) At this moment, the viewer's eyes are full of tears and the director of this movie has done what he wanted to: make the viewer cry in a classic war scene. In Spielberg's SPR, the same scene happens like this: the man is shot in real motion camera, he cries, falls on the ground and doesn't stop crying, looking at his body, drowning blood everywhere, desperated, unable to think about her girlfriend. Only one thing passes through his mind ""I'm gonna die"". He cries it... His friends stop to look at him and are  shot too, some lose a leg, some just a foot, others an arm... and the scene left the viewer shocked, and sure that THAT IS WAR, THAT IS REAL.<br/><br/>Of course, Mr. Spielberg committed his mistakes in this movie, as anyone commits in any other film: the opening scene (the old man) is unnecessary, just as the final one. The American flag should be filmed, (after all, Spielberg is a patriot, too) but why forget Canada, France and England flags? R the Americans the only saviors of the world? And, at last, the stereotyped German... why not choose a German with a family, with integrity, honor? Why must they always be bad? I'm sorry to say it to someone so closed-mind as Robert Rodat, but in a war, you don't fight against ONE German, you fight against a country. That German could be GENE KELLY Singing in the rain, but he would still be an enemy. So, why make him BAD?<br/><br/>If you see, the mistakes committed in this movie r not Spielberg's. They r from the screenplayer, the writer. I don't think SPR deserves the Oscar for best Screenplay, but Spielberg is the best director and SPR DOES deserve the title of best 1998 movie, if not, as Academy is so imprevisible and unjust to S Spileberg, may people, at least, make this film eternal, eternal as the remembrances of the worst tragedy men could live in this century: WWAR II!"

","I was taken to this movie by my 79-yr-old grandfather, a World War II veteran who had read the reviews declaring this movie to be ""based on a true story"", and a truly epic movie about WWII. He couldn't wait to see this movie that was heralded by Spielberg and others as a bonafide docudrama, a true story based on a young man in WWII who lost three brothers to death behind enemy lines, and the most stunning war movie to ever hit Hollywood's silver screen.<br/><br/>Both he and I were shocked by the brutal reality of the scenes on the beach. That was truly amazing cinematography and imagery by Spielberg. Sure, both he and I noticed the many unrealistic aspects of even these scenes, minor errors in small details, but my grandfather said those scenes were closer to the reality than any movie had come yet.<br/><br/>But both my grandfather (a veteran and retired military historian) and I (a hobby historian) noticed the movie soon changed. While the movie was without a doubt strong with feeling an imagery, the realism is soon gone. The soldiers are out of character, the special effects overdone, and the military equipment (particularly the Tiger tanks) used/referenced incorrect. The worst part was that this movie, heralded as a ""true story"" didn't have enough truth in it to fill an eye-dropper.<br/><br/>This movie was not, however, a failure. Spielberg did an excellent job at creating a fictitious storyline that almost seems like it was real, and then used the Hollywood glitz and glamour to create his version of WWII. This movie is extremely well done for a war movie, and well worth watching as long as the viewer remembers two important things: 1) This movie is NOT real. 2) This movie is NOT a true story. There was no Pvt. Ryan. This movie is *extremely* loosely based on the losses of two families in WWII -- the Nilands, who lost two of their four sons (one was MIA and later found, and the other wandered around in enemy territory for 18 days before finding his way back to camp and being told he was being sent home), and the Sullivans, who lost all five of their sons in a 1942 loss at sea. (For more on those five, watch the film ""The Sullivans"".) Neither situation involved what was seen in the film.<br/><br/>This movie should be rated on three separate scales. The only true rating for this movie can be on it's ability to entertain and hold the viewers interest (nine out of ten by both my grandfather and I). For its rating on realistically portraying the general conditions on WWII, it measures about a six and a half, and on its realism as far as ""based on a true story"", this movie deserves a zero, because it is entirely fictionalised.<br/><br/>Definitely see this movie, but if you're looking for realism in a 1998 war film, check out ""The Thin Red Line"". Both its storyline and its basic cinematography is more ""realistic"" and ""true"". It is only for true war buffs though -- the movie rates high for both realism and truth, but fairly low for entertainment value because of Malick's attempt at keeping it realistic."

","i have to disagree with the idea that Ryan is an anti war movie, let alone the best ever. it was well shot, and in parts well acted but i found it repulsively right wing. when the good guys get shot they die painful deaths but when the evil Germans (also human too mr Spielberg, also with families) get shot they fall over like cardboard cut outs. the one german who we get a close look at turns out to be a callous cowardly pig who will happily lie to escape and then shoot the man who showed him respect. moral? never trust a german.<br/><br/>tom hanks was miscast, his character should not have been there, tom sizemore would have made a much better lead. cut out the sentiment, it was cloying and pointless. also there was the deliberate misleading scene at the beginning. old man sees tombstone and thinks back.... back.... back to the beaches where he suddenly becomes tom hanks. well we know he doesn't die then, because he was the one at the beginning. oh how clever he was really ryan. that flag waving at the beginning was almost a joke, even Capra would have balked at that. drop the prologue and epilogue please it was dire. ""tell me i'm a good man."" the whole finding the wrong ryan bit was guff and a waste of time too because we all knew dopey matt damon was ryan. on that subject, brave ryan refuses to leave his boys but when the shooting starts what does he do? crouch down and start crying! surely a coward like him would have jumped ship at the first opportunity. another big mistake was casting ted danson, the whole cinema said ""ooh it's ted danson in a wig"" in unison. next up at that point could well have been a madonna cameo as edith piaf in a dream sequence.<br/><br/>the opening battle sequence was some of Spielberg's best work since Jaws. without a doubt great cinema, but what was the point? it bore no relation to the story and was not anti war either. it was anti being shot, portraying the horrors of being blown up. war was not condemmed, the question of soldiers on both sides being unwitting pawns was never raised and the film was totally lacking a moral centre. war was a matter of the good people overcoming the bad people and if that meant killing them with no remorse (anyone in the film troubled by the horror?) then it was done in the name of (the) right (wing). unfortunately  by making the opening so realistic Spielberg has succeeded in passing the whole thing off as history so another generation of americans and anyone else who has not studied history will think that the war between america and germany started in 1941. would it have been too much trouble to include some british, french or any other european soldiers. and correct me if i'm wrong but i'm sure there were black soldiers in WWII, but i must have missed them in this film.<br/><br/>yes i left the cinema angry, angry that such a good opportunity was wasted with pro american revisionist flag waving claptrap. and if tom hanks gets another oscar for being wet and dying then i will handing mine back to the academy."

","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies that I have ever seen. From the opening scenes on D-Day to the finale at American bridgehead, the movie never lost a beat in its portrayal of the American fighting men.  What I liked about the movie was its simplicity of message.  It attempts to historically document a time in history without much of the underlying political messages.  Men did not fight for honor or courage like some of Hollywood's creations would lead us to believe.  They did not fight to purposely crush the enemy or defeat Hitler.  GI's fought for themselves and the survival of their fellow men.  Saving Private Ryan also dispelled many of the myths of war.  Anyone who thinks war is glorious and glamorous needs to experience Spielberg's masterpiece.  War is not fun; it is hell, and Spielberg conveyed that message very clearly in the opening battle scenes. Men were being machine-gunned without knowing what had happened to them. Yet there were moments in the movie where I felt that I had forgotten about the war.  For example, before the final battle scene at the bridgehead, American GI's were swapping back and forth stories about the homefront.  War definitely has moments of comradeship as portrayed by Spielberg.  Overall, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Steven Spielberg creates yet another masterpiece.  I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone (except small children, of course)."

Spielberg was so close and yet Saving Private Ryan is not quite the movie it should be. Don't get me wrong, it is an impressive film and I'm glad I paid to go see it. The opening sequence on the beach is utterly perfect - there are no other words to describe it, and Tom Hanks actually performs a role that is definitely Oscar worthy (Philadelphia was overrated). But there are mistakes Spielberg makes: The opening and closing shots of the American flag - (didn't Spielberg see Minghella's 'The English Patient'?), the use of the older Ryan attending the graveyard - completely unnecessary - Spielberg should have left it during WWII; and finally the character focus on Ryan - I had more interest in the Corporal Upham character played brilliantly by Jeremy Davies. I felt that at times Spielberg was doing so but then he switched back to Hanks and Damon's characters. It would have proved more effective to use Davies' character as the main protagonist. But enough of the criticising - it is nevertheless still a fine film and I think the only reason I find myself picking at these little things is my disappointment in the fact that it could have been one of the greatest films ever - and fell just a few feet short of it."

","This is the most realistic war movie that has probably ever been produced. Realistic, in that sometimes I felt that I was actually in there ducking, dodging, running and crawling. As they were waiting at the bridge for the tanks it gave an eerie feeling. I am not a veteran so I can only imagine, the ""waiting"" for the enemy which you know is coming would be quite harrowing, as against being in the thick of the action where you don't get time to worry.<br/><br/>Purists may complain that certain events would not have happened, but those are just technicalities that do not detract from it being a superb film.(to the layman in any case) Although, I think I spotted a mistake too. (not a military or historical one, just a minor production one) Just before they came across the guarded radar, there was a long distance shot of them walking across a field in formation. I counted 8 of them. (It looks like the filmclip used when they first began their mission.)<br/><br/>War veterans don't like to talk about some of their experiences, and having watched this movie I can understand why. Many would have seen and done things that they now regret, such as murdering prisoners of war, acts of cowardice, the making of crucial decisions that resulted in the loss of our mens lives, inaction or hesitation and just being plain ""scared"".Other war veterans would have many painful memories of the loss of friends and relatives, and just the ugliness and horrors of war.I understand that the age range of those that went to war were 18 to 21yr olds. Unbelievable!

This isn't a film with a political agenda (such as the ""War turns innocent children into mindless killers"" of  Stone's ""Platoon,"" or the corny pro-American schmaltz of ""The Green Berets"")...  Any governmental politics would have definitely hampered this film; instead, it focuses on war and war only.  It focuses on the attitudes of soldiers and the fat cats who sent them in to battle.  More importantly, SPR is about the thoughts and actions of eight men as they search for Private Ryan:  We see them as they're crying, we see them as they're killing, we see them as they're laughing...  Encompassing all these facts, the film provides a monumental look at the attitude of Americans towards war back in the day, and the attitude of Americans towards war in the present.<br/><br/>The battle sequences at the beginning and ending of the film are some of the most powerful sequences ever caught on celluloid.  Yes, they are indeed technical marvels, to be sure...  However, to say that the movie depends too much on the technical proficiency of its director is not true in the slightest...  The film is exemplary all around.  Likewise, to say that this film relies solely on Hanks' star power and Damon's looks is also untrue. The supporting cast, especially Ribisi, Goldberg, and Davies, more than hold their own, if not overshadow the also great performance of Hanks.<br/><br/>More importantly, in it's general honesty regarding the attitudes of Americans during and after the war, SPR succeeds in being one of the greatest, if not THE greatest war film ever produced.  True, the script is not exactly the greatest ever written, but the raw power of the war sequences, the superb performances from all involved, and the humanity given to all soldiers who fought in this war more than make up for it.<br/><br/>And to those of you who denounce it for demonizing Nazis: 1) What of the scene where Davies screams for the release of the bawling German soldier? 2) This movie is shot from the perspectives of those fighting the Nazis; anyone trying to kill you is going to be perceived in a negative light.  3) Remember:  The Nazis were the BAD guys.<br/><br/>And for those denouncing it for it's solely American perspective:  the film followed only eight American soldiers and STILL clocked in at three hours...

When one looks at the attempt at glamour, beginning with TV shows that trivialised the so-called ""good war'' in the 1960s (e.g. ''Hogan's Heroes'', ''McCale's Navy''), not to mention a warehouse full of WW2 flicks where soldiers fought with clean uniforms on dirty beaches -- cranked into production beginning not long after the Japanese surrendered aboard ship with two nuclear holes where cities once sat -- one can certainly understand why Spielberg felt the need to bring home this long-overdue message.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone and others have already reminded us of how horrible was Vietnam, and the DMZ on the Korean peninsula is a living reminder of that war, but WW2 remained glamourised until relatively recent times.  While the first 20 minutes of ''Saving Private Ryan'', following a brief but touching introduction, have received much ''press'' -- and indeed that stretch of film is quite an ordeal for the viewer having ANY level of sensitivity whatsoever to get through -- it is the remainder of the film that will convince you utterly that war of any kind is a useless waste.  Kudos go in abundance to Spielberg & Co. and one quickly envisages at least 6-7 Oscar nominations on the way, to include ''Best Actor'' (Tom Hanks -- who just keeps getting better and better with age), Spielberg for ''Best Director'', and the film itself for ''Best Picture''.

I have never been so affected by a movie. All I hear is people arguing that they didn't know about radar then or that the story is not feasible and so on.

It may have been a little too long and some scenes may have made the movie much better if they were shortened (ie, church scene) but that doesn't stay away from the importance of the film.<br/><br/>The first 25 minutes of the film are going to remembered as probably the best war scene ever created.  It was brutal, grotesque, disturbing, breathtaking, gruesome, horrifying, so many words can't describe the visuals you see during the D-Day experience Spielburg gives us.  And if that didn't give you the anti-war feeling then the next 10 minutes to see the mother's reaction when she finds out 3 of her 4 boys died is sure to be enough.  The first 1/3 of this film stab you with any type of emotion that can ever be put into a war film.<br/><br/>The next 45 minutes of the film have a few scenes that drag on to give strong characterization to understand the 8 men army out looking for Private Ryan.  Some may feel bored during a few parts even though I found them necessiry.  But during this 45 minutes of the film to see French people trying to live in their torn apart homes during the war and to see the hundreds of dog-tags the soldiers looked through are still dramatic.  And when the medic dies toward the end of this section of the film is another scene capable of bringing tears to the eyes.<br/><br/>The last 1/3 of the movie never lets up.  They soon find Private Ryan and when they decide to stay and help him and his platoon fight off the German forces leads to a dramatic climax which goes on just as long as the opening D-Day experiance.  This scene has a much larger battlefield and the soldiers aren't running in to battle like the opening and are rather spread apart to let us know each characters reaction to the war they are fighting in.  The conclusion is just almost as sad as the scenes during the opening and definitely get across the message that war is hell.<br/><br/>It has recently been announced that SPR will return to theaters shortly along with another WWII film The Thin Red Line.  The Thin Red Line looks very promising to be another war film to receive amazing excellence but it is said that the two films differ drastically in just about every way.

","As I left the theatre after watching SPR, my first thought was ""World War II meets Indiana Jones"". There were just too many Spielberg standard cliches in this movie for me to really appreciate his attempt at a ""realistic"" war movie. The opening 20 minutes was a good attempt at realism, but somehow spoiled by later unbelievable little twists that I found silly. (And seemed more appropriate in a Indiana Jones movie) Yes, some of the things in the movie did happen in real life, but others simply did not, so I question the whole reality thing. If you really want to know what happened, read the eye-witness accounts currently available out there in book stores. I think you'll find some things in the movie accurate, while others far from it. In addition, the movie misses some of the real drama and herosim that went on down on the beaches that day. What about the bravery of General Norman Cota who rallied the men over the beach defenses? What about the role of the Navy Destroyers, who<br/><br/>closed to within 500 yards of the beach and took out numerous pillboxes with their guns? Those stories should be worth at least a mention, in addition to all the blood and gore thats displayed. (By the way, not all the defenders were German, some were captured Russians, Poles, Czechs and Chinese!!)<br/><br/>Still, with all that said, I understand the attempt here at trying to give you the feel of real combat, with all the horror and blood and gore. But ultimately nothing can substitute for the real thing. (Although this movie probably comes closer than any other movie before.) Yet I felt that the display of gore was given too much focus, and that the story was sacrificed in favour of this. I felt something was missing after seeing this movie. In the end, the film-maker tries to make up for this by ending the film with a message. However, the whole film ride to get to that point seems to have little in common to that message."

","Saving Private Ryan Rated:  R For: Graphic Violence, Adult Langauge, Adult Content Starring:  Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Ed Burns, Tom Sizmore Directed by:  Steven Spielberg Running Time:  2 hours 48 minutes<br/><br/>Well, to start off, this movie should not be viewed by children under 15, that is, unless you want to teach your children about the real effects of war.  This movie starts off with an older James Ryan at Omaha Beach, his family behind him.  He has walked up to the marble gravestones that are placed there in remembrance of the soldiers that dies at D-Day, which he flashes back to.  In the flashback (which is simular to Titanic as in it being the whole movie) to the beginning of D-Day, with a shot of Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), and his platoon of soldiers, who, before landing on Omaha, vomit in terror, they hit the beach and two rows of soldiers are taken out, the others dive into the water, a couple drown under the weight of they're equipment, others dying before even hitting the beach.  For the first half-hour of this masterpiece, I dare say ""masterpiece"" because that's what it is, the soldiers go through hell, a mess of blood, dead bodies, and gun fire that'll make you appreciate those that went through that.  After that, Captain Miller and his team of soldiers, on the mission to save Private Ryan (Matt Damon), along the way save Ryan, they run into a run down radar tower, a run down town, and several other things which leave them with unexpected loses.  And the final battle may be the best, and most prolific  in the history of cinema, Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar worthy performance, Steven Spielberg should get an Oscar for best director, and he proves his is the greatest director of our time.  Edward Burns, Matt Damon, and Tom Sizemore are also giving great perforances, along with guest appearances by Dennis Farina and Ted Danson, this movie has major star power, a great plot, great dialogue, and a great direction, all-in-all, this gets my vote for best movie of the year.

He kept these things hidden within him and they only surfaced around loud noises or when the mentioning of his old comrades was brought up in certain circles.  You could see the pain and suffering that hit him.  The movie's ending followed this as if my dad had written his own autobiography.  Watching help myself answer these unknown questions and prepared me more for what my job entitles as a leader of Marines.<br/><br/>The best part of watching this movie was doing it near a military base. Opening night the theatre was completely crowded with Marines and their significant others.  The Marines enter cocky as usual; proud, confident and ready to see another action war movie.

This movie is about war in all of its infinite inhumanity...and you are there...right at the front lines...watching men brutally dying around you.  In ""Apocalypse Now"", this was shown to a degree...then all of a sudden, we are swept up into a chaotic nightmare about a renegade Colonel who goes over the edge.  This film explores war on a more real life scale.  When the boats arrive at Omaha Beach...you feel what the soldiers feel.  When the men decide to go after Ryan, you feel their courage...and their probable destiny.  Movies like ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Paths of Glory"" all gave us a reason to hate war.  This film does the same, however, it explores all of the reasons for wanting to go to war...and fighting for what you believe in.

","Saving Private Ryan's going to take a whole bunch of oscars and probably best picture, but it shouldn't. Okay, it may be a realistic portrayal of war and blah-blah, but let's look at it as a real MOVIE.  Tom Hanks doesn't deserve any sort of oscar for this (he was good, but it's nothing Jim Carrey didn't do ten times better in The Truman Show).  Matt Damon, let's face it, reeked. Jeremy Davies gave about the only oscar-caliber performance in the whole thing.  Any movie that opens with a shot of an american  flag can't be too original. It must have been done by fifty other movies. The script was pathetic, with some pretty dumb lines and not much of a story (if the script is even nominated for an oscar, it'll show how low the academy sinks to meet hype.) But every review of the movie gave it 5 out of 4 stars and so-on, and I'm starting to get the feeling this is one of those movies the media almost *forces* you to like, such as Titanic and Forrest Gump.  I'm not saying it's not a decent movie.  It is very realistic, and the cinematography, sound and art direction is great.  Jeremy Davies should at least be nominated for something. And it's one of Spielberg's best directing efforts.  But as for being the best war movie of all time.... to this day, nothing compares with Apocalypse Now. And if Saving Private Ryan wins over the Truman Show (heck, over Pleasantville) then there's something seriously wrong. But that's just my opinion."

Shattered bones. Impossibly loud explosions, raising dust and ashes. The cry of the wounded mixed with the confused shouts of officers. I see bullets piercing chests and heads. It is all live, horrible and shocking.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan brings a new angle on War. The personal angle, that of a single human being facing the horror of death around him, of blind chance deciding whether he'll get wounded or killed or just scratched. Spielberg managed to do what no director have done before - bring you inside a battlezone and let you feel the chaos from within. You suddenly find yourself crouched in your chair, not knowing when the next blow will come from. Shaking with every bone of your body when a tank approaches. Ducking when bullets come near.<br/><br/>The film could have been a masterpiece, if the plot was more sharp, if the characters were less flat and if the 'dirty dozen' ending was avoided.

"Taiyo","Null","0","0","10 December 1998"," There's something to be said for fiction...
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best fictionalized accounts of war I have ever seen. The first twenty minutes (which will most likely be cut when the film makes its television premiere) are more than just war itself -- they are real. The real face of war, pain, death, and loss.<br/><br/>I loved this movie for the cohesiveness (seldom found in other war movies), but there was a major problem with it -- the claim that it was true. A little research into the situation soon shows that Spielberg took more than a LITTLE dramatic license -- the last two hours never happened. There was no major ""rescue mission"". Poor Pvt. Ryan wandered home one day, and they said, ""Oh, hey, we were looking for you!""<br/><br/>As a movie educating people about the horrors of war, though, this is an excellent choice, provided the audience knows it's fiction. It's right up there with ""Courage Under Fire"" (also starring Matt Damon) as an excellent fiction resource. People wishing to check out a more realistic account of war will want to view ""Thin Red Line"" and the Canadian mini-series ""The Valour and the Horror"", both of which are more or less ""true"" accounts of wartime events.<br/><br/>Although an excellent movie, there is an inherent problem with using big name actors like Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore. Not only are they far too old for the roles (it was highly unusual to find a WWII soldier over 25 -- most were between 18 and 21 -- and almost every soldier in this movie is late thirties or older), but viewers come in with an already formed opinion. ""Tom Hanks? Oh, yes, he's the comedian who often plays an uptight neurotic who's likely to have a nervous breakdown."" ""Tom Sizemore? Cynical guy with a fairly crude sense of humor and an eye for the ladies."" ""Adam Goldberg? Ah! Chandler's freaky and psychopathic roommate on ""Friends""!"" Edward Burns, Canadian actor Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, and to a certain extent Goldberg were far better for their roles than big time actors Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, Damon, Sizemore, and Hanks. It's not lack of ability, but rather lack of SUITability.<br/><br/>The movie deserves a high rating, but mis-representation (saying the movie was historically based when it was in fact fictional) and glamorizing (casting big name actors to draw viewers) detracted from the movie in some ways. It's got an 8.5 from me, and two thumbs up."

","Spielberg is back, but - there's something missing! In his new movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"", Spielberg once again showed that he is one of the best directors in the world. But the problem with this movie is in the script. The beginning and the end of the movie, i.e. parts that take place in present time, are redundant and belong in soap opera, not in movie. In the scenes on Omaha beach solders die violently and realistically, but as the movie develops it becomes more ""Hollywood"" movie, and less an intensive and (relatively) realistic story about war. The most disappointing moment is the one in which captain Miller dies. Why should he give his little speech instead dying like all the others? Is he ""better"" than the others are? And even if he is better (I don't think that he is) - so what??? In my opinion the whole movie aims to justify war and tries to do so by proving that: a) people get killed so that other can live, and b), war was horrible, but it made this beautiful presence possible.

I think this movie provided many with an insight into the reality of war on a level which has not been previously captured.  There are scenes in this movie which once seen cannot be ""unseen"".  Images which will last in your mind for a very long time and make you appreciate the sacrifice of so many not so long ago.  We praise Firemen for their courage to stand ready to enter a burning building to save a life.  How should we praise the men and women in uniform who likewise stand ready to enter combat, at a moments notice, to preserve our way of life.  Yet the latter group tends to be praised or spurned with the changing of the political tides.  Every now and then a movie comes along which can do something to correct such an injustice in our mindsets.  This was one such movie.  It should become part of high school or college history curriculums for either the study of the history of war (though this was not based on a true story) or as a study in human character and psychology, much as Moby Dick is a study of human obsession with a task which must be accomplished.

Secondly, anyone who says this is easily the best movie they've ever watched needs to watch more movies. That said, this is an exceptionally well made film and definitely worth seeing. The criticisms I have with the movie don't nearly outweigh its finer qualities. Too many criicisms focus on what a movie isn't (and should be?) rather than what it is. This movie attempts to provide some insight into the horrors of war, without straying too far from the standard war-fare (cute pun). I also felt a touch of the Cameron-esque (chiefly in the unnecessary use of the flash-back but other things too). The 'hooray for America' line that is so common is trundled out again, the only reference to the rest of the Allies is criticism. I was impressed 'though that Spielberg didn't try to suggest that American soldiers were flawless saviours. The execution of prisoners was an important part of this. The comments of others seem to suggest some tenuous holds on reality. The camera work in the battle scenes could be jerky, but I thought it was effective and didn't last too long. The bloodshed was unpleasant and realistic, but not real. If this movie made people a little more educated about how horrific war really is, how chaotic and terrifying, all the better. I am not sure 'though that some glory did not attach itself to Miller's team and their deaths. Lastly, I was impressed that, although this was a long movie, it didn't feel it at all. It held my attention the whole time. Anyway, enough already. Very good movie, 8/10 (9 being my highest - no such thing as a 10 in art).

The movie has a plot and the effect, sound, etc really grasp the audience. Moreover, what the film really delivers is that no one really wins in a war, but it is important that young people know about the past.<br/><br/>Yet it was an allied campaign and forces from the British empire and Australia were totally involved.

At their best, these great war films made me commiserate with the plight of the common soldier, see the futility and the waste of war, and understand the sacrifices made to preserve the world I live in today.<br/><br/>All of them, however, were observed by me.  They moved me, but they were still somehow distant.<br/><br/>Not so with ""Saving Private Ryan"".  From the opening frame, I was *there*.  I wasn't watching a moving tribute, I was being shot at, watching comrades die horribly, and running for my life.  This movie will make those who've never been to war say, ""My God, that's what it was really like""  and any veteran say, ""My God, they've finally shown the truth.""  If you aren't moved by this film, I'd venture to guess you are either cold-hearted, or a film student who can't get past examining camera angles in order to experience what's going on in front of your face.<br/><br/>It was, without a doubt, the most powerful war film I've ever seen, perhaps the most powerful *film* I've ever seen.<br/><br/>People gripe about the plot.  Those who do, don't know much about military protocol.  Yes, eight men might be sent to risk their lives to return one home.  After all, it sounds like a far easier mission than it actually turns out to be...until the chaos of a large scale military operation enters into the picture.  Far sillier orders have been issued in every major war in history.<br/><br/>As for the camera work, complain about the jostling camera all you want.  There's only so much you can do to simulate the fog of war, how everything seems slightly off-kilter when the bullets start flying and your stomach knots up.  The Oscar for cinematography, which is a shoe-in, will be vindication enough against the naysayers.<br/><br/>If you absolutely can't stand gore and violence onscreen, this film is not for you.  For anyone who can, please don't miss it. It truly is unforgettable.<br/><br/>It will win Spielberg his second directorial Oscar, it will win for cinematography, it will win best picture, and Hanks will probably win for best actor.

","This film is an amazing piece of film. The first thirty minutes are at the height of cinema anywhere - sound design is awesome. However, the film continues from such a prodigious sequence and actually improves as we get to know the finely constructed characters. The film is a visual masterpiece, more than complimenting any of the dialogue. No one can tell a story through images like Spielberg can, and that's why people call him ""simplistic."" However, only high minded critics that want a greater 'text' would say this - In reality, the great text comes through the images, which is what film is really about.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are constructed with greatness. The editing is outstanding, especially the sound editing, which is amazing (the fear/security contrast that Spielberg always uses is demonstrated between the sound of the bullets in combat, and the ticking of the typewriters. Another bullet like sound used effectively is the rain drops). This is undoubtedly a great film. It is in my mind, highly anti-war, and the first thirty minutes are perhaps the most eloquent statement of that - for no other film maker has really captured an anti-war message by expressing the sheer chaos of an event that saw thousands sacrificed before they even got out of the landing craft. This film will raise many issues and ignite much debate - the film may look deceptively simple, but behind it lie many issues that run very deep."

It's the hideous, laughing face of War personified, and seeing that is the most disturbing aspect of this film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to agree that the work as a whole seemed flawed. To put it bluntly, it's a story reminiscent of an episode of Combat (now that someone brought it up), plus some movie-scale battle scenes. All bound by that flashback structure. It all held together all right, but just a tad less satisfactorily. It's painfully (yet distantly) similar to what Titanic suffered from.<br/><br/>Nonetheless high production values, all-round good performances, and an undeniable capacity to put you ""right there"" in the middle of the action (the apprehension was almost unbearable during the early moments of the final battle) far outweigh the gripes. Heck I still ended up giving it an 8/10. That's a ""Go watch it!"" rating."

","Spielberg has, without doubt, an extraordinary talent to put together images and visual structure in a film. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of his ability to develop character or present the complexities of human chaos. SPR attacks the senses with a stunning opening sequence that conveys the noise and confusion of battle, but as soon as the film has to concentrate on the characters, and their motivations, it sinks into a grossly jingoistic and sentimentalised version of history in which every company in the American Army is made up of a representative of each personality type, America saves the free world (three cheers from the ever grateful British, French, Dutch etc etc and where were the civilians in all of this) and the enemy (the Germans) are barely one-dimensional caricatures of monsters and bufoons (they are so much the Other that the battle tanks resemble flying saucers from a 1950s Sci-fi cartoon) .Remember that a good old GI sock can beat the might of German demonic technology. We even have the Cavalry (in this case, the airstrike) coming to the rescue in the final reel.<br/><br/>Have we grown up at all ? It would appear not.  Maybe Spielberg just can't help himself, but to regard this as anything more than a hopelessly naive, patronising and ill-considered attempt to present ""War as the true Measure of a Man"" (not women you may note) is to be blind to the world outside Norman Rockwell, Apple Pie and the Great American Dream.<br/><br/>What is most distressing is that Spielberg has the eye and ear of (perhaps) millions of people, and they may come away believing that this is history (because of the apparent verisimilitude of the battle scenes in particular).<br/><br/>This fundamentally flawed film flatters to deceive. There is less to it than meets the eye."

After Schindler's List, Mr. Spielberg may have created the next BIG Oscar winner.<br/><br/>I would venture to add that if SPR fails to win more Oscars than that pathetic excuse for a multiple Oscar winner Titanic, then I say the members of the Academy board should all just resign.<br/><br/>First, the bad things: Although Mr. Spielberg showed both sides of the story and the atrocities committed by each, you can't help but notice the obvious American bias this movie has. That flying American flag before the closing credits sure proclaimed to the world that America is King!<br/><br/>I also can't help but point out the flawed way by which the film relied on the flashback vehicle. The movie was seen through the eyes of one of those involved, but the thing is, he never had first hand knowledge of some of the events that transpired. It could have been better if two men met in the cemetery and recalled the events.<br/><br/>Although Tom Hanks' acting once again shows through, the movie did not quite fully utilize his wonderful gift. Ditto for Matt Damon's character. Tom Sizemore's was actually better.<br/><br/>In any event, the portrayal of the horrors which occurred during such a sad and terrible event effectively makes Mr. Spielberg's film a classic. It not only is a poignant and honest film, but is also a voice for ""documentary-type"" films. The cinematography was fantastic and the pacing dramatic.

","I think this movie is a good first step towards making more realistic war movies, but it hasn't quite reached there yet. I felt that wimpy translator guy would have been a better old man than Ryan at the end. Besides, he was there for more than 1/3 of the time, unlike Ryan. There are a few areas of improvement. Firstly, they need to cut out all that sentimental and bonding crap, and find other ways of developing characters rather than just a few silly laughs while retelling old times... Secondly, acknowledge that the enemy (in this case, the Germans), were at least partially human, and experienced some of the same emotions those heroic Americans experienced. (F*** Hitler? Man, I would like to hear some of the Americans say that about their leaders). Thirdly, link those excellent battle sequences with the plot of the movie. Oh...and most importantly, don't glorify the war by making all the dead characters look like such big heroes. I thought this movie was supposed to be anti-war. And I can't believe how Ryan was so emotional at the end. He had only met Miller and Co. a few hours before the big battle, and he barely knew Miller or what they went through to save him, except that two of their men died (and I believe that people dying was rather common during that time). Oh, but I guess it was still pretty good."

","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt a must-see movie because of the message it conveys in the first 30 minutes or so. I found myself curling up in my seat, cringeing, and hoping not to see any more disturbing scenes, while still glad that I was merely watching a movie. That's how mind-blowing it was. But I seriously felt that the rest of the movie wasn't all that great- it was simply an above average war movie, and the remaining 2.5 hours or so was nowhere near comparable to the first half-hour of the film. There was nothing extraordinarily brilliant, with the exception of a few of the final battle scenes. When I watch a movie, for me, the most important thing is enjoyment. And this movie, while being extremely compelling and thought provoking, was hardly enjoyable (anyone who has seen it would know why). Nevertheless, I had absolutely no idea how the war sequences were choreographed to be so realistic. It really makes you feel that you are in the war itself. But towards the end, Spielberg just couldn't resist to put in his trademark sentimentality into the movie. And for me, that kind of ruined it, because it was undoing all the brilliance of the first 30 minutes. Making it so blatantly obvious that he was trying to make it sentimental and dramatically heroic was in fact glorifying the war, which was the exact opposite of what Spielberg was trying to convey throughout the entire movie. And the nonsense of the final scene made me feel like I was watching another movie written by James Cameron. Despite all the criticisms, I still feel this movie is worthy of the recognition it has been getting. Its brilliance is difficult to deny, and personally, I'll give it 4 out of 5."

The war itself is marginalised, the experience of war is the subject, and is examined simply through the harrowing recreation of it.<br/><br/>Mr Showbiz also compared the film's opening scene to that of ""The Wild Bunch"", and it does have the same power. The difference is that the latter film would maintain a certain greatness MINUS the violence, whereas SPR rides on the power of its opening scene.<br/><br/>As pure technique, Saving Private Ryan is genius, and ranks among the most noble achievements of cinema in recent memory. But as an original work of true greatness, it is something less. 9 out of 10."

","I have to say that the criticisms I have read concerning this movie just don't ring true, but some of the praise seems equally wrong.<br/><br/>The movie seemingly uses a 'retrospective' method of framing the main action... which turns out to be not quite what it seems (to say more would give too much away). Some have called this cheesy, but I doubt that anyone would be saying that if 'Titanic' hadn't beaten SPR to it. It's effective, and sets you up for a plot twist at the end (If you still don't get it, that's too bad). The characters are fleshed out stereotypes because they are *representative* characters, and in a plot that's largely a cog in the whole symbolism of the thing. The battle of Omaha beach is not relevant for the plot, but this is a movie which steps outside its plot. It's a morality tale, not about soldiers, but about the modern world where some people are safe because others have died (horribly) bringing that about. This is what the seemingly confusing flashback is about, this is what the battle scenes are about and the whole point of the screenplay seems to be to get us to ask ourselves the question that the old man asks at the end of the movie. It's a shame that nit-picking amateur film critics fail to see the big picture.<br/><br/>As for the whole goriness thing... that's the way it is. Gory. You are supposed to be horrified, not entertained (someone described the landing sequence as 'exciting'. I don't know what's more frightening, the sequence or that response). And finally we have a film that pulls no punches and has so much moral ambiguity that we can identify with the characters, loathe them, and find no fault in them all at the same time. I would say 'brilliant', except that it's a function of the sheer horrific nature of the circumstances they find themselves in and not something you feel like applauding.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that should, at the very least, change the way that the viewer thinks about action movies. Spielberg has done here for the War and Action genres what Eastwood did to the Western with 'Unforgiven': that is to say, completely debunked all the old Hollywood mythos and glorification. With all the tricks in the book Spielberg and co have created a nightmare image all from the perspective of its victims. I've never seen anything like it. Spielberg's battlefield is like the industrial revolution gone horribly wrong: a huge machine of percussive clashes, explosions and fire spitting out buzzing fragments of metal tearing chunks out of masonry, landscape and people.

It does nothing for the story, which has a good premise, but fails to deliver. Are we suppose to care for any of these people, that we know nothing about? And the main character (Tom Hanks) would like it to stay that way. Because we don't know the characters, we feel less the terror of the war. We see it (very realistically and well done), but we don't FEEL it. And then they have to remind us that everything is strange, Tom Hanks saying that he feels it's a surreal situation. Don't tell us, show us! Then there is Spielberg's sentimentality pushed to the limit and over. ""Am I a good man? Tell me I've been a good man."" Enough is enough."

They might not differentiate too much between film or real life and therefore might have a tendency to act in a violent way or be attracted to violence and shock... in order to FEEL something... because they are numb most of the time....<br/><br/>You get the idea.<br/><br/>Okay the film has some flaws. The framing device doesn't work particularly well and feels .. well like an attempt to do what Speilberg in Schindler's List.  If the movie is a character's memory, then why are some scenes not possibly the memory of the character?<br/><br/>Not a serious flaw but a really unnecessary device to use in<br/><br/>the film.<br/><br/>The characters are not particularly well-drawn, and what little back story they do have (with the exception of Hanks) is very cliche'd stuff.<br/><br/>These things don't matter much however over-all.  It depicts in a gruesomely realistic and emotional way what war is about. And that's a feat that has rarely been accomplished.<br/><br/>This is a powerful anti-war film for the coming millennium, much as All Quiet on the Western Front was in the 1930's.<br/><br/>There is a minimal amount of pathos and sentimentality in the film, and what there is, although cliche'd, works to some degree.<br/><br/>There are some wonderful moments.  The man who picks up his own arm (or is it leg) on the field of battle.  The young man who is amazed his helmet has saved his life.  He takes off his helmet looks at the dent where the bullet was  and then.... that's right... he gets shot in the head and dies.<br/><br/>The nervous breakdown Hanks house in the battle.<br/><br/>The inability of the interpreter character to be a hero and save someone's life....during the final battle scene. More affecting perhaps because some of the film does resort to cliche's.  But not here.  When you really want it to.  When you hope it will.   It doesn't, making the scene more powerful.<br/><br/>Bravo.<br/><br/>Please stop letting your kids see violence in movies.  Sex and language is one matter and isn't going to hurt them.

If you want to see this movie for the plot of 8 men saving the lives of 1 and the questions, conflicts, and emotions that go along with that, don't see this movie.  I went because I was interested in the Sullivan law and the internal conflicts that arise from it.<br/><br/>However, if you want to be appalled and emotionally changed by the realities of war, this is the movie for you.  It is so powerful.  During the first twenty minutes, there was nothing but horrified silence from the audience with a gasp interjected here and there.  The battle scenes were so gory and jarring that I found myself bracing myself for the next battle scene as opposed to concentrating on what little character development there was actually taking place.<br/><br/>That leads me to the characters.  I thought the acting was excellent, but the character development lacking.   By the time I actually began to get to know a character or care about him, a battle started or he was killed (graphically).  I thought Tom Sizemore did an excellent job along with Tom Hanks.  For the whole 15 minutes Matt Damon was actually on-screen, I thought he too, was excellent.<br/><br/>I felt like I ended up paying for 3 hours of camera-shaking, bloody, musicless torture.

During the first battlescene on the beach my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was nearly sick in my popcorn, the portrayal of the landings was so accurate I could cry. I have great knowledge of the D-Day landings having read books, been to France and strolled around the museums for the 50 year anniversary and watched many films and thus I can say with all sincerity that this is the most realsitic yet. Other films such as 'The Longest Day' do not really show the full horror of D-Day whereas in SPR I felt as if I was their experiencing the soldiers fear and anguish, it was fantastic. As for the claims that 'without the two battlescenes it wouldn't be any good' they are rubbish, their is still plenty of tense and exciting moments in between to keep me happy, anyway if it just consisted of battlescenes all the way through my heart would have packed up. Also in this months Total Film two people have written in letters that suggest that SPR has no substance and character development. I do not agree with these statements as you really have to look into the film and what it's about to get something out of it. I could tell you something about all of the eight men as the characters were developed in such a way that was probably realistic for the period. You have to realise that this is a war film not some movie about a man trapped in a TV show (Truman Show), so character development is not as important in this case although it is still crucial for a good film. Also the cinematography is excellent. Mr Spielberg used a slightly slower film than normal during the battlescenes to give the feeling of speed and this is why I spent the first 30 minutes with my heart in overdrive, the direction from Mr Spielberg was as ever excellent. He attempted something new in the portrayal of injuries and deaths (guy picking arm up off the beach, German sniper, knife in chest close up) and I was overjoyed yet disturbed. For too long film directors have side stepped the brutal reality of war. I also liked the way war is not glorified as invariably happens in a war film. In all a great movie which had the right blend of ingredients for a war movie and it has now replaced Platoon (Oliver Stone) as my favourite war movie. It is a particuarly exciting  but moving film and I will look upon war in a different light from this day forth."

","No one can deny American movie makers, and Spielberg is a king, can produce the best technical effects in movies.   This movie also has some wonderfully personable stars.   (Tom Hanks is great, and I liked the sergeant, too.) And the human scenes are tastefully understated - no brash posturing here. This is Hollywood art.  But under the beautiful technical veneer, is there anything more here than an incoherent collection of cliches?<br/><br/>Is consistent thought or feeling or fundamental honesty too much to ask? What is the point of making another movie about World War II after all this time?   What does this movie say that so many others have missed, if anything?  War is a serious subject - ""serious"" is a drastic understatement, if you happen to be in one - one that a new generation knows nothing about. And it doesn't look as if the world has made any progress in avoiding them, since the one depicted here.<br/><br/>I think it's dishonest to play the patriotic sentimentality card with such intensity while claiming credit for condemning war.   To show blood and guts is not necessarily to say that war is wrong - only that it is unpleasant, or possibly, exciting.   Is shooting prisoners really wrong?   Or only what you gotta do, and the mark of a real man?   Is war really senseless?  Or is it a patriotic duty, well worth giving your life for?<br/><br/>I have never been in a war, but I promise you war is a lot worse than what you will see here."

It was a little gory, but everyone should see this movie except young children, and WWII vets (May bring back flashbacks...they've been through enough) The only thing I thought was weak about Saving Private Ryan was its characters....in a war movie like Platoon, you're incredibly horrified to see the characters die, because you feel like you actually know them.  Its like you were there with them.  You KNEW them, you FELT for them.  This was completely absent in Saving Private Ryan.  It was still great though.

It is true, no movie can ever give true credit to the real feelings of WWII soldiers, but Saving Private Ryan seems to come close.<br/><br/>I have never been close to being in a war or even in the military, but Saving Private Ryan has given me new respect not only of WWII, but of all our armed forces today.  In these days, it seems freedom in America is something that almost has naturally always existed. Most children and teens don't realize the sacrifice that has been made to bring about that freedom. Steven Spielberg, has crafted a movie to bring that lost reality of war to us who do not fully understand the terror of it.  The details in this movie especially in the opening battle scene, allowed me some idea, although can never do justice, of what my grandfathers had to endure. I was truly impacted in more ways than I had expected before viewing the movie.  This movie has succeeded in making people think seriously about life and death and what it all means.

Other scenes made me more uncomfortable (which was good; I should be uncomfortable with them.)<br/><br/>I had a problem with the present-day bookends; they were ok, but too sweet. And there were some places where I think the movie told us too much, which always seems to me like the easy way out. Show us instead! I had a line or two that didn't ring true for me; one was too modern sounding, too funny; I assume it was ad-libbed. There were a couple of details that didn't ring true. And there is at least one major detail that my coworkers did not get: is the guy who...the same guy who...the same guy who... or are there three different guys? Each of us sees it differently.<br/><br/>So--it's really powerful, and I think people should see it to get a feel for history.

","Being an amateur historian, SPR confirmed a lesson I had already learned: next time the USA gets into a war -- WIN IT!  And don't let up or pull punches until the enemy is beaten and *knows* he's beaten.  FDR was the last US president who could make up his mind to win a war.  Truman split the difference in Korea -- granted, a good move in an uncertain world.  LBJ sent millions into a war he had absolutely no intention of winning or even settling for a Korea-style armistice.  Bush, with his hazy, myopic talk about some ""New World Order"" and ""the vision thing"", is now unemployed while Saddam Hussein still butchers Iraqi civilians and blames the UN (read: US) for it.  And Clinton -- great at negotiating a peace, for those who want peace.  But for those who don't...?<br/><br/>I refer, of course, to the scene dripping with face-to-face hate where the German SS trooper (betcha didn't notice he was) whom they let go on a promise to turn himself in (""be-e-e-e good!"") shoots and knifes some of them while the last one sits in a soiled diaper of his own fear and self-pity. Minerva was the Greco-Roman Goddess of Wisdom;  she was also the Gs. of Just Wars.  But this was the image of Mars: the God of Combat in War.  Even von Clausewitz refers to the Hate in combat.<br/><br/>(Pause.  Deep breath.)<br/><br/>That much said, I have to agree with just about every comment on SPR.  The story is weak.  The bits with the flags and the strings are maudlin, to say the least.  And all the other stuff about plot development/character development.  Yes, Spielberg himself admitted it took the disillusionment of the Vietnam War to make this movie, yet he still blatantly tugs at your heartstrings -- he's been doing that since ET;  I've long since learned to ignore his saccharine ploys.  And yes, this is one of the best movies ever made, even if there were better war or antiwar pics made.  Only the battle scenes really make this movie -- it should get the Oscar for Cinematography.<br/><br/>But the thing I got from SPR throughout was from the characters griping about why they should risk their necks for one man.  The general theme of the movie appears, to me at any rate, to be ""this $%^& better be worth it!"" -- the universal gripe from the universal soldier.  Now, you tell me, is any of this $%^& worth your neck or mine if your side has absolutely no intent of winning or even getting something out of all this?  The US military morale went down the toilet after 1968 and spent the '70s in a drug-induced haze.  It took Reagan's 1980s build-up to rebuild morale;  without it the Gulf War would never have been so one-sided.<br/><br/>No, I'm no soldier, nor some fascist war-freak in a rathole filled with white-trash-militia collectables.  I've watched the horrors of war comfortably on my TV or my PC, just like many of us surfing this site.  I'm as revulsed as anyone else at the pictures and the news-stories.  I get an impotent rage demanding ""do something, Powers-That-Be!"", knowing full well they have no idea what to do, given the limits they set on themselves.  I'm as pro-peace as they come.  But I'm also pro-good-sense -- not just ""common-sense.""  There was a difference between Chamberlain and Churchill. One saw hell coming and tried to buy it off; the other saw it coming and said, ""get ready!""  And this, certainly, was a disciple of Minerva.<br/><br/>(Pause again.  Another deep breath.)<br/><br/>I'd say more but the guys with the butterfly nets have traced me.  Just let me sign off by saying that if we want a world at peace then we best make our minds up to make that peace and *enforce* it!  Nobody did in the 1930s; that's why there was a *Second* World War.<br/><br/>One other thing -- I wonder how will SPR play on home-video?  Will it be as horrifying?"

He is also a great critic of movies, rarely saying that any movie was good, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear him say that he thought that this was the best war movie ever made and that it contained scenes that could never be topped.

All the rest were a bunch of bad Hollywood stereotypes (the guy from Brooklyn, the hardass, the mysterious commander... etc.).  and the acting made the movie even worse.  I love Ed Burns as a director but think he is awful as an actor (especially after viewing this film), and Tom Hanks assumed his standard heroic role doing little to draw all of the Oscar attention that has come his way. The two portions that made this movie worthwhile were the two battle scenes in which Spielberg masterfully placed us in this horrifying world. but I would have been just as satisfied if the movie consisted of just these two parts leaving out all the excess garbage.

","I have been reading some of the comments posted within the IMDb, and I am not surprised to see a line drawn in the sand. Many of my American compatriots have declared this movie to be amazing, moving, and eye-opening. On the other side of the pond, we get comments like, ""I hated it. This is nowhere near to be called 'The Greatest War Movie Ever Made'"" This all depends on where you grew up. In the United States, during the Time of War, WWII did not happen to us. We went to fight an injustice on another shore, in another world from where we were. Our fathers, brothers and sons were dying for something that indirectly affected us. So, in order to make it palpable for American viewpoints, the Hollywood machines glossed over it, glamourized it, and made it bland. For years we were fed this malarkey about the glory of war, how ""Our Boys went over and blah blah blah"". This the first ""true"" representation of what our men did in this most unholy of campaigns. It pulls no punches, all the shades are pulled up, the veil is lifted. We, in this idyllic bubble had no earthly idea. We did not see first-hand the aftermath, the tears, the rebuilding. That all happened ""Over There"". According to our myths, we went in, kicked butt, left, and became a world power. That's it. No one ever talked about it, except while waving an American Flag. To one of the many who believed the half-truth, it was not just a sock in the jaw, but a punch in the stomach as well, the kind that knocks the wind out of you. For what it's worth, this has been a long time coming. We saw the inhumanness of it all. Some of my European brothers have complained that this portrayed the Germans in a bad light. That maybe so, but for once the bad light has surrounded our viewpoint as well. We are not the ""saviours of the world"" that we thought were.

But then it deteriorates steadily. Especially, it is very one-sided. Some people say it's an anti-war movie, I can't agree with that. This movie shows only the allied soldiers as human, and the Germans as faceless monsters. The real horror of war is that there are ordinary scared young men on both sides. This dimension is lost completely in this movie."

","It isn't often that I leave a movie theater with a new appreciation of life, but that is what Saving Private Ryan has given me.  I remember driving home afterward in silence, just staring at all the beauty around me and think, ""My God, I am so lucky to be alive.""  Not only was this a brilliantly filmed movie, technically, but its message was so extremely powerful, and necessary in a world such as ours.  The vast majority of Americans who have never experienced the horrors of war first-hand learn their history from textbooks, which emphasize only the facts surrounding certain battles, and the figures of generals who rarely fight in the trenches alongside the ordinary men.  Saving Private Ryan shows us the experiences of those men in graphic, terrible detail, and begs the question - How could these men, no different from you or I, transcend themselves and rise to the occasion in these terribly unordinary circumstances?  This film, just as in Schindler's List (perhaps the only film of the 1990's that equals SPR's brilliance in filming and emotional intensity) demonstrates the fundamental goodness of man and the endurance of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity.  I will not go so far to say that the film is perfect - even the greatest film has flaws, and SPR is no exception - but its technical merits and sheer emotional power more than make up for any of its defects.  All in all, it is, as many have said before me, a masterpiece - a film that will be remembered by me, and hopefully by every American, for a long, long time."

","Actually, the one-liner actually covers it.  Growing up at a time when personal sacrifice is not emphasized or encouraged among the youth of America, Saving Private Ryan gives me a new sense of what the generation of my grandparents went through so I could know the world as it is today.<br/><br/> From the ""movie"" point of view, this is definitely an excellent movie. Spielberg has mastered the art, and he proves it yet again with a new style of cinematography, putting the audience in the foxhole with the soldier instead of on the outside looking in.  A masterful performance is turned in by Ed Burns, but the real art comes from Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, and of course, Tom Hanks.  Though Matt Damon is one of the headliners, his performance is short and solid, but lacks the great emotion that earns Oscars.  The great performances in my opinion are by Jeremy Davies, who masterfully portrays an unexperienced soldier/translator in the heat of battle, and by Tom Sizemore, who portrays a hard core, experienced, loyal sergeant that hasn't been seen in the movies since John Wayne.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie at least once in their lives.  The acting is great, the story is great, and the realism is shocking.  Its wrenching tale and realistic portrayal of war should give everyone a new appreciation for the American flag and for the independence we call freedom."

","Wow. One word that sums up the whole film. I was totally blown away with it. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job with 'Saving Private Ryan', furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in Tom Hanks' career. For those of you who manage to sit through the first twenty-five minutes of carnage, you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call, 'the greatest war movie of all time'. I was in awe of the feat Steven Spielberg has accomplished. Some may place it alongside 'Schindler's List' as his greatest achievement. Me, I rate it higher.<br/><br/>Seeing the film in a cinema, with surround sound, places the audience in the middle of the D-Day Invasion. Gruesome as it may be, the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history. With strong back-up performances from the relatively young supporting cast, 'Saving Private Ryan' will no doubt go into the 1999 Academy Awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories, including best actor (Hanks), best director (Spielberg), and best picture.<br/><br/>It has opened the door to reality. The public can finally see what war was really like. Frightening. Some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie. But finally we have a realistic war film. 'Rambo', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter'. None of the myths of war these films have created. Yes, they are all Vietnam movies. But give me an example of a decent World War II movie. Alongside, or even above, 'Das Boot', and perhaps 'Platoon', 'Saving Private Ryan' is a classic war film. A modern classic. No more, no less. Congratulations to Steven Spielberg on such a fine effort."

I, personally, have never viewed a film that inspires more raw emotion than this gripping tale of risking eight men to save one. I am glad to see that Dreamworks SKG has finally gotten its act together and developed a high caliber motion picture. The graphic quality of this WWII tale exposes war for what it is: not some heroic venture in the realm of personal glory, but a horrific combination of death and destruction. The use of hand held cameras and dulled color themes only enhances the experience almost to the point of suggesting that the audience is there with Capt. Miller and his men to witness the terror first hand. I truly regard Steven Spielberg as a genius and at the same time cannot imagine any circumstance that would prevent this film from receiving the academy's ""best picture"" award. In short, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing work of art that cannot be adequately described in words. So go see it, you'll cherish the experience."

For the rest of the film I sat in a trance-like state, unable to comprehend what I was seeing.  I left the theartre empty and cold.  However, for the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  The movie invaded every conscience moment, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something profound.<br/><br/>The following weekend I decided to see it again.  I'm glad I did because it was a totally different experience for me.  Symbolism plays a huge part in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and most of it, along with character development, is extremely subtle.  Pay close attention to the soldiers expressions and actions and you will learn more about them then by anything that they say. Sure there were slow, boring stretches in the movie.  Spielberg intentions was for the viewer to ""experience the war"", as well as can be done in a film,  from a soldiers standpoint.  How many boring moments do you think a soldier had to endure keeping watch for the enemy or snaking across the countryside?  Quite a few I suppose.  And just how chatty do you think war was?  I doubt soldiers spouted their life stories off to their fellow comrades.  And talking with WW2 vets, including my grandfather, the Germans, right or wrong, were nameless, faceless enemies.  I feel that these instances were portrayed fairly accurately in SPR.<br/><br/>I feel this movie requires a second viewing.  It will give you a chance to remove  yourself from the violence and pay closer attention to other details.  Then compare your reactions.   I doubt that Spielberg's point of this movie was that ""war is hell"".  That analogy is too simplistic, an easy synopsis to come up with when we are presented with material that actually requires some thought."

The most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed, but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet. Think of it, they are flesh and blood, not the characters in the TV games. Should they be killed just for one or two people's foolish decision? They all have families, they are innocent. I appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal, to save private Ryan and send him home at any cost, he didn't mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fields.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has produced a very great movie, different from the other scientific films he had ever made, but it is a most touching film that give a good lesson to most of the people.

","After making such inexcusable trash as ""The Lost World"", Spielberg just can't be taken seriously (neither can Tom Hanks, after ""Forrest Gump""), no matter how hard he tries. And in his most recent attempt at redemption, he doesn't completely succeed: He simply cannot refrain from being the typical Spielberg with his heavy-handed, lofty and ultimately sappy direction. The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as REALITY :the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I couldn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowd-pleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to ""keep it real"", you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. However, THE reason to view this film is the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the ""Wild Bunch""). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and stimultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind. The last one,(a small group of men versus a veritable army - hmmm,where have I seen THIS before?) is almost as good, if not for the cheap Hollywood trick at the very end, which finds the movie venturing into Indiana Jones territory. It almost seems that SPR was directed by TWO different people: Spielberg and his WWII battle consultant. On the very primal level, however, the film achieves at least one of its makers' many aspirations: when I exited the theatre, I felt lucky to be alive."

","Profoundly powerful. This film is just that. When you see this film you'll realise that Schindler's List was just a warm up exercise for Spielberg. Everything is just incredible. The acting is just one intense ensemble effort (Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore are assured of Oscar nominations), the direction is stunning (the graining in the film, the lack of sickly sentimentality, an unbiased view of the Germans, the handheld photography, visceral but vital violence, the silent moments in which Tom Hanks blocks out all noise in the heat of battle etc.etc.etc.) There are countless reasons to see this film and they are all as important as each other. I saw this movie last week and I'm still lying awake thinking about it and what the real war heroes went through. True, I cried at Titanic but it pales into insignificance when compared to the sheer brilliance of this film and the emotional hell you experience whilst watching it. Guilt, horror, awe. Private Ryan will almost certainly clean up at the Oscars but this won't be enough. It should win every single award going and then some. Maybe then people will stop wasting their money on Godzillas and Armageddons and begin to make more movies like this."
"pericles","Null","0","0","1 October 1998"," The second best anti-war movie ever made.
","Spielberg has once again proved himself to be a true master of his chosen profession. The attention given to minute detail and photography is simply outstanding. Technically brilliant, the film strikes at every man's primal fears when faced with danger. The themes of heroism, cowardice, loyalty, existentialism and redemption are beautifully woven into a fictional story revolving around the finding of one man, namely Pvt. Ryan. But realistic (awesome, I may say) battle scenes aside, I still say it is not the best war film ever made. Still sitting upon that mantle is ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" For better or worse, ""Pvt. Ryan"" does not take a holistic view of war as it affected all sections of society. Of course, it may have not been intention to do so, and the films certainly have a different focus. But for depth of story, ""Quiet"" is unparalleled for content. All that aside, ""Pvt. Ryan"" is still tied, along with ""Schindler's List"" for the honor of the most important movies of the past two decades. In my opinion ""Pvt. Ryan"" is to war films as ""2001"" is to sci-fi films. As an ex-Marine I was forced to think about the 12 landings my grandfather made during WWII against the Japanese. Did he go through hell? Did he think about the meaning of bravery and honor? Or did he shake and cry, and pray to God for forgiveness and hope for a better life for all? Go see ""Pvt. Ryan"" and allow your mind to wonder and explore the meaning of humanity. If you come away unmoved, then you're not human."

"ldf-2","10","0","0","29 September 1998"," Saving Private Ryan is a no holes barred epic film...
","Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and two time Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks have collaborated on their first film and might well add to that collection come Oscar night. Saving Private Ryan is a no holes barred epic film about a group of Rangers who land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and then get sent on a very personal mission, to find one man who has parachuted behind enemy lines and is being sent home because his three older brothers have all been casualties of war.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of SPR is filled with seemingly never-ending images of the savagery and brutality of war.  It is the landing at Omaha Beach on June 6 (aka D-Day). Hanks plays everyman Captain John Miller, who leads his men into battle there. Some survive the carnage but many do not. The imagery is fierce and honest from the opening of the first transport to the blood washed beaches at the end.  In the middle of this film we have a philosophical dilemma which Miller's men try to sort out - is one man worth the lives of 9 men (Miller and his elite team)? And in the course of trying to answer this question we get to know John Miller and his first sergeant Horvath (well-played by Tom Sizemore), his sharp-shooter Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), his translator Corporal Upham (superbly acted by Jeremy Davies) and the other men in his unit - Edward Burns as Private Reiben - the NY bred, cocky recruit, Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) who is Jewish and takes great satisfaction in killing Germans and who also plays a prominent role in an unforgettable scene at the film's conclusion,  Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) who becomes frustrated over his inability to save everyone, and Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) who tries to save a young French girl in the face of sniper fire. But it is Hanks who holds the film and the unit together with his quiet determination.<br/><br/>Also admirable in smaller roles are Ted Danson as another Captain who helps Miller's unit track down Ryan and Dennis Farina as a Lieutenant, Harve Presnell as General George Marshall, whose decision to extract Private Ryan will change the lives of 10 men forever and Matt Damon as Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Not for the faint of heart, this movie pulls no punches and spares no one as the human carnage continues throughout the film but particularly at the end where the juxtapositioning of the troops listening to a German love song while preparing to ambush some German tanks trying to traverse the bridge at Ravell lends an eerie quality to the eventual fighting and emotionally charged climax of the film.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure - once you have seen this movies you will never look upon World War II in quite the same way.<br/><br/>Not to be missed, see this on the big screen and in a THX theatre and prepare to be devastated"
"Cactus-7","10","0","0","28 September 1998"," Where did we find such men?
","""Saving Private Ryan""  provides, in stark relief, a portrait of the American infantryman in World War II. For those looking for a whiney anti-war film in the Vietnam tradition, this isn't it. The men portrayed in ""Saving Private Ryan"" are American soldiers of the 1940's who realize that, like it or not, they stand between the dark night of Nazi tyranny and freedom for millions. They have truly gone in harm's way. In case you are still unfamiliar with the story, Private Ryan is the sole survivor of four brothers who are serving in the military. Two are killed in the Normandy invasion, a third has been killed a short time earlier at New Guinea in the Pacific Theater. Army Chief of Staff George Marshall is so trouble by the prospect that another family will lose all of its sons to the war, that he orders a small unit of eight men to find the surviving Ryan. Marshall is haunted by the deaths of the five Sullivan brothers who all perished when the ship on which they served went down in the Pacific. Marshall is clearly not doing this as an Army publicity stunt. A letter he posseses which was written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who made a similar sacrifice during the War Between the States also spurs Marshall into action. Ryan parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne Division the night before the beach actions and, thus, will be difficult to find. The men on the rescue mission are just guys. Nothing special about them. The thing that makes them stand out is their determination to just do their job. They're not sure why Ryan is so special, but they intend to find out or die trying.<br/><br/>This is Tom Hanks at his best. His portrayal of a World War II officer is never better than when he gives his men their last minute instructions in the landing craft. He ends by saying, ""And I'll see you on the beach.""  His quiet confidence is remarkable and accurate.<br/><br/>Barry Pepper is excellent as the unit's Tennessee born and bred sniper and Giovanni Ribisi is outstanding as the medic.  If you're looking for an anti-war ""message"" movie, this one isn't it.  It's about duty, honor and the type of men who stood on the ramparts during one of the world's darkest hours. After seeing this, go thank a World War II veteran. Plenty of them traded their tomorrows so we could have today."

"FrankN","Null","0","0","26 September 1998"," Is the mission really one man.
","For most of us, fortunate to have only read about, and not experienced, the kind of action portrayed in ""Saving Private Ryan"", that portrayal accomplishes complete suspension of disbelief, and leaves us completely exhausted by its end. The only other film of its genre that has the same effect is Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>If the viewers draw moral conclusions strictly from the material Spielberg provides, many if not most will conclude that making war should NEVER be an option. Of course, Spielberg scrupulously avoids any explanation for the presence and actions of Captain Miller's men other than rescuing this one man. This is in contrast to ""Schindler's List"", which is a continuous justification for using whatever force is necessary to liberate the innocent and punish the guilty. Perhaps unsurprisingly, ""Schindler's List"" liberates the innocent without any evidence of men like Captain Miller, his squad, or the millions of other GIs that made it possible.<br/><br/>How could Spielberg, if he wanted to, have combined the two, giving the viewer a sense of the reaction of those occupied by the Nazis to the Allied landings, yet not completely switch the film out of context?<br/><br/>Consider the film ""Playing for Time"". This TV film, released approximately ten years ago, achieved extreme notoriety even before its release by virtue of its central casting of Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave's extreme political left wing views are regrettably, considering her occupation, tainted with a devotion to the cause of Palestinian statehood. She played a Jewish woman in a Nazi labor camp. The film recounts the ""real world"" assembly of musically talented female inmates, who form a small orchestra and perform for the camp Nazis. As long as they played, they gained time. The continuous horror of ""life"" in a labor camp is interrupted very briefly when, just before the start of a concert, a male technician arranges something on stage in front of Ms. Redgrave, and opens his palm to her sight. On the skin is written ""Allies landing in France"". He closes his palm and goes on with his work. Redgrave gives the slightest of all smiles, but one which the viewer understands is a shout of joy. It will be over. Survival is possible.<br/><br/>This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in ""Schindler's List"".<br/><br/>Chester Wilmot's ""The Struggle For Europe"" describes an event he witnessed during the liberation of Brussels. He writes ""In one square the [British] tanks were halted by the [Belgian civilian] throng and the Brussels police attempted to move the crowd back, but they could not restrain one little old woman who wore on her drab black dress her husband's medals from another war. She made a quick dart across to the nearest jeep, took the hand of the driver, kissed it, and said, 'Je vous remercie, Tommie. Je vous remercie.' And into his hand she pressed what was obviously all that she had -- three cigarettes.""<br/><br/>This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>I am extremely fortunate to have a father who was a Normandy to Berlin GI, and a mother who was a Belgian native, lived under the Nazi occupation, and could very well have been in that Brussels crowd that day. Through their eyes I saw as much as anyone could second hand. This is not a luxury available to many people today. The WW2 generation is dying, and they are dying with the knowledge of what happened, why it happened, and how to avoid having it happen again. Spielberg has the responsibility to pass that information on, and in that respect, both ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are failures."

It reminds us that during conflict people die in the most horrible ways immaginable and that good people sacrifice their lives for the cause. If taken on its own Saving Private Ryan would seem to say that war is a senseless waste of human life and that there is no justification for this activity, but when added to the message in Schindlers's List, which showed us the evil which the war strove to eliminate, one is left asking the question.<br/><br/>When is the cause worth the cost?"

","Reading some of the above comments, it becomes obvious that some people are busy composing their criticisms when they would do better to watch the film. e.g. why didn't the high command just radio instructions to send Ryan home instead of sending a squad after him? The answer is in the film. if you're paying attention. The airborne forces, were scattered, lost, decimated by casualties and out of touch with what was going on generally - which is, by the way, historically accurate.<br/><br/>Also to address the moans about the lack of characterisation among the US soldiers. If you met such a group in real life they would probably appear just as 2-dimensional. Soldiers in combat only relate to each other - they don't care about anyone else. Through their shared experiences, they already know each other intimately, and nobody else counts outside of their immediate circle. So nobody else gets to see the real side of their characters. Let's not forget that these men are in a war, not a Chekhov play.<br/><br/>As to the ""standard mix"" of soldier's backgrounds, this is the way armies organise their units. If units all consisted of men from the same town or area, the social consequences can be disastrous if that unit suffers heavy losses, as with the British ""Pals"" battalions of the First World War."

"mwsk","Null","0","0","21 September 1998"," An intelligent film. See it twice and think about it.
","Some thoughts about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (SPR).<br/><br/>It's an intelligent and carefully made film. You must view it intelligently and carefully, and see it two or three times to be able to see the detail.<br/><br/>It will be a misunderstood film, I think. Naturally, there is no ONE right way to view a film. The better the film, the more ways it can be viewed. But SPR has already been evaluated in a very unidimensional way.<br/><br/>People have commented that there is a good action sequence at the beginning, a good action sequence at the end, a long boring middle with no character development, and 'bookend' sentimentality. The ""opening 25 minutes"" were very realistic...but is that all that the film is about? You can view it that way, but perhaps the film is more than a technically masterful B-film.<br/><br/>The film's message is ""war is hell""? If that's all it was, it would be shallow realism. A dog has four feet, war is hell, sugar is sweet. These are just preconditions for telling a story. Consider this possibility: that the realism and attention to detail is MORE than the sound of bullets against steel or sand.<br/><br/>Shallow character development? You don't know enough about the soldiers to care? What's that supposed to mean? That you look at a cross-filled cemetery and feel nothing? That you see a landing boat full of men killed before they can disembark and you feel nothing because you don't know who they were? Think about this: veterans report not wanting to know anything about their fellow combatants. It made the loss more difficult. And isn't it interesting that part of the story of SPR has to do with the soldiers wondering who Captain Miller is. Why don't you ask yourself why? Character development? The war context has to do with how you behave there and then. That's how you assess each other. Now: think about whether such a message can be carried to other everyday contexts. Observe the soldiers and how they behave. That long 'boring' bit in the middle?? That's the whole film! Look at the events and think: why am I being shown this? Why not something else? Isn't it interesting that the ONE German soldier that Upham kills is the one who both killed Miller AND witnessed Upham's own failure to live up to his responsibilities (cowardice?).<br/><br/>Go see the film a second time and think about it. Ask yourself: why, amid the chaos of the Omaha beach landing, we are not only shown slow motion pans of Miller staring without comprehension at corpses and men cringed in fear, but also of him later, equally white-faced, staring at coffee being poured, at a man shaving, at a sandwich being eaten?<br/><br/>A good film can work at several levels. Is this a war film? An anti-war film? Is that all that SPR is about? If so, then the so-called bookend pieces are indeed cheap sentimentality. But consider another hypothesis: Perhaps the film is also a character study of one person in particular, of Captain Miller. And it's not simply about 'war'. The war is a context to make something else meaningful. No, not just ""earn this"", something else.<br/><br/>When I saw the film there was a veteran who began crying when another message was given, at the very end.<br/><br/>Interesting, wasn't it, that we don't hear triumphant music and see the stars and stripes in full glory. We could have been shown this, but we weren't. We see a bleached out remnant of something almost unrecognizable as stars and stripes, and music dying away in a long sad whisper. Earlier, we hear Miller's own comments on the standard Emersonian line on the value of war ""Perhaps that's his way of seeing the good side of things"". You can accuse Spielberg of being a sentimentalist. Miller HIMSELF would not buy the sentimentality interpretation.<br/><br/>Whatever else the film might be, SPR is also good enough to give me something to think about after I view it. Something else, about the rest of everyday life. Don't waste your time thinking about whether it's the best film ever,or the best war film ever, or how many academy awards it will win. Who cares?<br/><br/>Forget about that guy looking for his arm on Omaha beach.<br/><br/>View the film and then think about this: Are YOU a good person? Are YOU living a good life?<br/><br/>Then go back and look again at those dying and dead strangers and weep for your own life.<br/><br/>Perhaps Spielberg made a better film than he intended..."

","There is nothing new in Saving Private Ryan but the standard war-is-hell details are so well done they seem to have been re-invented for this movie. In lesser hands: stereotypes, cliches and schmaltz. In Spielberg's: well-rounded characters, genuine drama and real emotions. The only problem is that the opening scene is so real and terrifying that it upstages the rest of the story. (10/10 - easily)."

Saving Private Ryan is by far the best movie you will see in 1998."

","Never before have I seen people cringe, stare open-mouthed, cheer, and cry, then walk out of a theater in complete silence.<br/><br/>Having witnessed the so-called ""greatest act of terrorism ever to occur in our nation,"" I can only say we have been so naive.  My generation doesn't understand what war is.  We watch our movies and we get excited by violence and gore, never feeling any guilt or sorrow for the people the actors portray.  This film changes all of that.  It is so hard to see the men murdered as they do ""their duty"" and then come to the realization that THIS REALLY HAPPENED.  These men, our grandfathers, risked and in some cases gave up their lives to protect all that we take for granted.  <br/><br/>Today we cry and demand justice for the 169 people who died because a PART of ONE building in a small city was destroyed by a bomb.  We can't even begin to imagine running off of the landing boat only to be shot and killed by the unseen enemy.  We see countless buildings annihilated in small, tactically insignificant cities.<br/><br/>This movie has made a difference in my life.  Being only 20, I have to face that it could easily be me in the line of fire if our nation were called once again to defend the cause of freedom and the draft were reinstated. All I can say is after seeing this movie, war and violence will no longer be glorified in my mind.  <br/><br/>Aside from the stunningly realistic portrayal of war, I can't ignore the fact that the movie itself is spectacular.  Although the content takes the front seat, the acting, script, and cinematography are superior.  This film is hands down the best of the year, and one of the best movies ever made. Four stars!"

","""Saving Private Ryan"" was an excellent movie, but that's no surprise coming from Steven Spielberg.  The one thing I would comment on is that there were several sections of the movie that could have been left out, thus making it a little shorter.

","Saving Private Ryan is the most hauntingly realistic movie of all time. While sitting in the theater witnessing this extraordinary piece of cinema history, I couldn't help but think about what it must have been like that day, in Normandy.  Although I felt like I was right there on the beach with the brave soldiers who risked, and gave their lives for us.  This is a movie that makes you think.  Oscar caliber performances delivered by every member of the cast, especially Tom Hanks.  The story involves Private Ryan, who's brothers died in the d-day invasion, and the eight men sent to return him home.  Eight men sent to save one may be unfair, but their soldiers and will follow orders, no matter what the cost.  This movie has many very gory moments, but what else do you expect from the man who brought you Schindler's List and Amistad, Steven Spielberg.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend it to anyone who can handle it.  It's been said that war is hell.  But I can't imagine a hell being any worse."

However I was never expecting a film to be as important as Schindler's List until now and by the same director.  Steven Spielberg has once again made easily one of the best and most important films of all time. Many past war films have tried to be important but nothing has came as close to reality as Saving Private Ryan.  From the scenes of graphically violent war where gun shots are the only noise you can hear to the different aspects each character has it is definitely the most realistic war film ever made.  After seeing this film you will be reminded of the many people who have died for our freedom today and what it is really like to be on a battlefield.  Some people may find it to graphic to watch but must know that this is a true story and this is how graphic a war is.

","Steven Spielberg films come with high expectations. You've come to expect a sense of wonderment, of magic, of taking the audience places they've never been to before in film.  Unfortunately, as Spielberg has said himself, his films the past few years have not touched or grabbed us the way they used to. This is most likely due to a combination of our high expectations and Spielberg's losing touch with the general public.<br/><br/>That said, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has well exceeded my expectations and may be the finest film of his career.<br/><br/>This film shows you how powerful movies can be. Marrying the creative, ingenious minds of Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski with new film technology provides us with the most realistic war movie ever made.<br/><br/>The opening 24-minute invasion sequence relentlessly assaults your eyes & ears. The combination of jerky camera movement (by using hand-held cameras) , stuttered framing (by skipping some frames), special film (for grittiness) , slow motion, surround sound, and perfect choreography make this section of the film an instant classic and worth the price of admission.  From the second the ramp drops on one of the landing crafts, the audience is a participant in this invasion. I peered around the audience for a few seconds and as the bombs and explosions reflected light off their faces I was able to see their eyes. In them, I saw fear, shock, horror and disbelief.<br/><br/>There are two scenes, which bookend the movie, that force you to absorb the carnage & chaos of war at a deep level. In both scenes, you are watching the bloody battle all around you through Captain John Miller's (played by Tom Hanks) eyes. The sounds of gunfire and explosions which only moments before were piercing your ears are now all but silent. These two surreal and haunting scenes provide the audience with a few seconds to step back, feel themselves breathing heavier, feel their hearts beating faster and truly see the horror & devastation of war. <br/><br/>Another scene that will stay with you is seeing Corporal Upham (played by Jeremy Davies), glued to a stairwell, panic ridden with fright.<br/><br/>Acting: Barry Pepper as Private Jackson the expert marksman and Tom Sizemore as tough Sergeant Horvath stood out among the cast. <br/><br/>Hollywood plot devices (e.g., family gathered at cemetery, airplane appearance, etc) and weak dialogue at times, prevent this film from being a true 4 star classic.  Never the less, this is still the most realistic and powerful war film ever made and will be remembered throughout the annuls of film history.<br/><br/>The film is rated R due to graphic violence. The film may be disturbing for war veterans who may not want to invoke their battlefield memories."

","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the best war movie that I ever seen. Before seeing it I had heard that it was amazingly realistic and that some war veterans had to abandon it after 30 minutes because of horrific memories flooding back. And I have to agree with this. The opening 25 minutes or so in particular are like nothing I have ever witnessed. Some of the scenes of the dead and wounded are really gruesome but this only adds to the overwhelming effect this film has on all who see it.<br/><br/>It is quite a long film but it doesn't feel it. I was disappointed when it ended because I was enjoying it so much. Spielberg really captures the essence of war in this film and hopefully would make all who see it realize the grim reality of war and turn them against violence for life. All I have left to say is that if you haven't gone out to see Saving Private Ryan yet, do so now, it really is as good as everyone says it is."

The violence is so realistic and plentiful it's at times desensitizing, a common feeling among soldiers in World War II.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the movie revolves around the gore and the combat, and as a result fails to resolve many of the questions the movie raises -- namely whether risking an entire group is worth saving one man.<br/><br/>There are many other movies that more strongly illustrate the wide range of attitudes, emotions, and pure brutality of war; among those, All Quiet On The Western Front (the original), The Big Red One, and Platoon involve the viewer on a much deeper emotional and intellectual level than this film."
"leebod","9","0","0","12 September 1998"," Horrific brilliance that no-one should miss
","I'd read plenty of reviews both here and in magazines before I saw this film - most described was the first twenty minutes of the movie concerning the Omaha beach landings in France. The horrors written in those text prepared me for what I knew were going to be gruesome scenes - or so I thought. Wrong WRONG WRONG. The first twenty minutes will be stuck etched on my brain until I die - if nothing else they serve as the best reason I've ever seen for pacifism. When the first boat lands and the bullets rip the occupants to shreds you feel you are right there with them - then you know that no film review will do justice to the visuals in this film. To say it 's the best war movie ever made is a kind of injustice - I didn't feel I was watching a war film more a documentary. You've seen people shot before a million times on film and tv right? Wrong again - you feel every bullet thats fired in this film and beleive me every one feels and sounds like a hot piece of metal that kills. When the first twenty minutes are over you feel numb and you stay like that until the last image of the film has left the screen. To complain about the plot is essentially pointless - sure its straight forward and sure its one sided (the germans all being depicted as pretty much emotionless skinheads - the only one in the film for any length of time being a nasty piece of work who you want to die anyway) but I dont think this is meant as a film in that way. To me it's a document of the horrors of war and of the futility of it - If I were a young man thinking of joining the forces before seeing this I'd rip the application form up after, any romantic ideals of that lifestyle get ripped up with it in this film.<br/><br/>See this movie, be hurt and haunted by it's images but most of all remember it as a document of why we are free today.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wonder why they bothered."

","Even though this movie was excellent I did agree with some comments, about how the old man Ryan scenes were played for sympathy and how character development was a bit stunted, but I think that's part of the point. These aren't supposed to be complex characters with inner demons or personal problems, they're supposed to be ordinary joes, just like the millions of others who fought and died. If you were going to develop personalities you 'd either have to cut out the fighting or make that movie REALLY long. In that respect I had no problem. About the believability of rescuing one man, have you at all been paying attention?!! The Sullivan Law which prevents all of a family's sons from being killed in combat had been mentioned ad nauseam, so they had to rescue him, it was the freakin law! How is that ""romantic Hollywood""? Someone also said that the point of the movie was to say ""war is bad, well duh."" Well then,. I say ""duh"" right back to you because don't you think Spielberg already assumed we know that? He's not that stupid to make a movie with such a superficial, obvious  message. One of the main goals, in addition to depicting the reality of war, was to show all of us how much we take freedom for granted. Example: how many of you actually celebrate Veterans or Memorial Days in memoriam for people who served in combat, and how many of you simply go ""woohoo, no school/work today"", like it's just a holiday? People celebrate martyrs, and that's good , but how are the poor shlubs who went to die when freedom really was on the line any less important? To paraphrase a source, if they failed, whether or not you can imagine it, we'd all be doing the ""Zieg heil"". I have been nowhere near a war and wouldn't want to after having seen this film, but the only people whose opinions about the honesty and treatment of the subject matter matter at all to me are those who have been through and seen such carnage as in the war. Of all the veterans of WWII who I've seen interviewed about this film, I have yet to see one who says that movie sucked or was only okay. The reason I trust the realism of it, for one thing, is because they had advisors who experienced sh*t like that firsthand. Truth is everything is subjective. You can read lots of stuff and watch tons of films on war and have a good imagination but you honestly can't say a damn thing about it until you've been through one yourself. I am part cynic, but I do not think the purpose of this movie was to win Oscars. Why shouldn't a movie like this deserve to win anything but sound and visual awards anyway? Platoon did. After seeing this movie I have a greater understanding and appreciation of our history. I'm all for the freedom to express opinions, but I'd like to see someone do as good a job or better with such profound material (a statement not yet, if at all, applicable to The Thin Red Line). I'm no filmmaker but that movie was pretty darn good. Oscar-worthy? I don't know. There are still months left in the Oscar year."

","What can you say about the opening battle scene at Normandy and the climactic final scene in the village? They are probably the two best war scenes ever recorded on film. The images from the beach landing will haunt me for a long time; the soldiers praying, crying, vomiting, and then dying, dying so fast and furious you don't even have time to breathe before the next one goes down. And yet they are all very human, which is what breaks your heart. The same can be said of the final battle scene. The way the momentary peace of listening to Edith Piaf singing in French while the educated young soldier interprets for the others is shattered by the rumbling of the treads of the German tanks. Your brain starts going, why is this happening? For this reason, the reality and ridiculousness of war is made clear. There are other good scenes in this poignant and terrifying film; most of the deaths are treated with the shock of cold reality and at the same time with dignity. <br/><br/>However, I was totally disgusted by the director's 'good guy vs. bad guy' depiction of the Nazi soldiers. I'm sure that the Germans loved their mothers, too, that they were afraid to die, that they were also following orders from above, and not deranged Hitlers. The lone German character in the film is portrayed as a sick, evil clown, and that is all we're allowed to see him as. How sad that we have to do that to appreciate what our soldiers did for us. Woudldn't it have made it an even better statement if the movie had shown us how crazy war is from BOTH sides of the fence? It was an opportunity lost.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I agree with the other viewer that I also would have appreciated seeing the daily hardships that the soldiers must have gone through; the cold, the wet, the hunger, etc. I think this would have made it a more complete and realistic film.<br/><br/>Still, congratulations to Spielberg. He gave us his heart."

I am a soldier in an Army town, and the movie theater was silent, silent because what we saw wasn't glamorous.  It was honest, and the truth was very blunt.  We were forced to watch people die, people panic, and people that actually behaved like real people.<br/><br/>We saw a compelling view of the mettle required to be a leader in combat. Hanks undertook the role of a Captain as the Army would like its officers to be.  He was focused on his Mission and his Commander's intent.  He had to lead those that weren't motivated, and he even had to be human and deal with his own shortcomings.<br/><br/>This movie inspires patriotism, but it defines war as a sobering test of a soldier's true character, and dedication.

Now, I'm no expert in movies and I haven't seen a lot of old war movies, (The only one I've seen is The Longest Day), but I think this movie stands out among the others because it is real. The characters are real. They don't have incredible luck, beating odds every time. You see grown men crying out for their mothers, screaming out in pain when they're hit... The movie focuses on the characters, the people. It shows the human side of this war. It shows how men devolve into savage creatures who are just trying to survive. It shows that every life taken, is another bit of humanity that is lost. (eg. shooting surrendering prisoners. beating up a POW). The mission they're assigned is probably one of the only good deeds they will accomplish in the war. The little bit of humanity that is left in them compels them accomplish their objective, and helps them redeem their soul. The team dispatched to save Private Ryan, evolves from a group of savages trying to survive to a higher moral level. A level in which they are willing to sacrifice their lives to do something good, something they rarely do.<br/><br/>Now you may disagree with my point of view, I don't really care but whether you agree or not, you have to see Saving Private Ryan. You a least owe it to the veterans to see what they faced when they fought for our freedom."

","This movie at least the first 20 minutes or more seal my opinion of the film,and the rest was rather curious at least to the last half an hour of the movie. Now,as a civilian,born 1958,I certainly don't have the experience to talk about this war,but I watched documentaries that bring tears to my eyes. I assume that I am personally  not friendly with many serviceman in civilian life past or present,but I deeply respect the blood that was given and that they continue to give since it was and is the price of my freedom! I am black,and aware that this period was not the best for black servicemen ;nevertheless I am proud of the (WW2)servicemen white,black,and any other race of Americans,that served during that period. I hate to see in films about (WW2)American soldiers dying or being killed. I didn't notice in this film any black soldiers,but that wouldn't make me any less proud of the superhuman courage as represented by the actors in this film as white soldiers under such inconceivable pressure to secure the freedom that I take for granted. I didn't at first want to see this movie,because I thought that it was nothing more than a big budget film,and that it would depict a theme of heroism that was going to be a romance about gun-ho characters. The characters were very human,and the late actor (John Wayne) if he was in this movie as one  of the characters his character would have been scared silly by the battle scenes in this film(no one is dying pretty in this film )! It is a real war movie or the real deal of fighting,suffering,and dying !"
"pgmcrk","Null","0","0","9 September 1998"," A masterpiece of fictional reality...
","This movie has found a place in my all time top ten.  I can't name the other nine right off of the top of my head but I have to say that this movie would be in it.  There isn't a lot you can say to explain this movie because it's a huge, heaping dose of reality encased in three hours of film. The plot is simple, four brothers go off to war, three die, and the government wants to bring the sole surviving Ryan brother home.  After a grueling and gruesome landing at Omaha Beach, the men who are sent after him search all over the war theater of Europe during WWII for the lone, living Ryan brother.  Still, if they had tacked much more of a plot on to the movie with the time they used, it wouldn't have had the same impact. The movie would have to have been longer.  I wouldn't have minded if it had been. The characters don't have a lot of time to be developed, due to the nature of war and the film, but the parts are all well delivered and acted, (I'm sure at least partially to the direction of Spielberg), but it is Tom Hanks that makes it all stick together.  I read another review of this movie which said that Tom Hanks' performance was ""a quiet miracle"". This is the most accurate description of the part he plays that I have read to date. This movie illustrates the differences between modern/faces-never-seen warfare and warfare of a past era.  You have to wonder after seeing this movie if violence wouldn't be so prevalent in our world if it war was now as it once was in the past.  The first 45 minutes of this movie are so overwhelming I would be surprised if a person could bring themselves to speak after it.  In fact, I've never been in a theater with such silence throughout an entire movie, (except for when I saw Highlander II, and that silence was more due to disappointment and disgust than any profound impact ). The whole sequence of events moves at such break-neck speed, with such reality, that you forget there is a camera filming it all.  At times, it seems as if you're seeing it all through the eyes of someone on the field of battle.  The climax of the film, in relation to the beginning of the film, has a slight plot twist, (that's how I perceived it), that makes the whole thing come together plot-wise, and it attempts to give a little tug at the heart strings- I didn't mind. I should say, as I finish this, that this isn't a movie for those with weak stomachs.  The movie isn't filled with blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore.  It is VERY realistic though, almost sickeningly so.  Take all of the war movies ever made, strip away the bravado, the glory, the bravery, and the chest clutching sort of ""tough guy"" attitudes, throw in the violence and horrific injury that accompanies that kind of combat and you'll have the feeling of a good part of ""Saving Private Ryan"" - at least I think so.  Basically, I wouldn't take the kids to it and I wouldn't go if the sight of blood makes you ill.  Amazing, impacting, overwhelming, horrifying, and realistic are words I would use to describe this movie. Wow."

Nearly every single element of the film is perfect.  Spielberg's direction is unbelievable, Hanks' performance is probably the greatest that I have ever witnessed, and the story and script are awe-inspiring.

Saving Private Ryan is unbelievable, and you should immediately go to see if you haven't had the opportunity to do so.  <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is rated R for extreme violence and a heavy dosage of profanity.  The MPAA actually considered giving it and NC-17 due to the extreme realism that it portrays.  Fortunately, however, they didn't. Every single American, no matter what the age, should be required to see this movie.  Don't let the strong rating and its respective reasons scare you away.

The war scenes in Saving Private Ryan are far from fun.  They are graphic and brutal.  That's what makes the movie powerful.  While reading another person's comment, they said ""this is nothing like real combat.""  I can't disagree with them, because I have never seen real combat.

","The first segment makes you say, ""hmmm, I wonder what this is about"".  Then it cuts to the Omaha Beach invasion.  As war-realistic as Spielberg wants us to believe it is, the most realism that this segment portrays is the excruciating pains WW2 soldiers felt as compared to our excruciating headaches we received from this ""vibrating cam"".  Don't get me wrong.  I think the first and last war segment should have been shot with this camera, but all the segments in between should have been toned down.  Any scene shot with this cam would make just about any person want to vomit, whether it be a love scene or just a still scene.  I understand that Spielberg wanted to mix the effect received psychologically to make one uncomfortable with the effect received from the explosions, blood, guts, and screaming to make this movie seem ""real"".  Well, it worked.  But still, it was a movie that people want to be entertained, and the only entertainment received was during the calm scenes. On the IMDB scale, I gave it an 8.

There are several instances that were far too manipulative on Spielberg's part.  The little girl and her family? The German soldier/prisoner incident?  The aging veteran?

","""Saving Private Ryan"" left me with some of the conflicted feelings I'd had toward Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" -- I wanted to admire the film, but as powerful as parts of it were, I felt it didn't quite achieve what it was reaching for. The first half-hour offers a searing re-creation of the invasion of Normandy, rightly so. But after that chaotic, gory opening, the movie seems to lose its way. Steven Spielberg apparently wanted to make an epic film -- without any epic characters. (At least ""Schindler's List"" had Oskar Schindler.) The American soldiers who are assigned to try to save Private Ryan are, with the exception of Captain Miller and Corporal Upham, pretty much ciphers. Someone might reply, ""You're missing the point -- men in combat usually don't have time to get well acquainted."" But ""Private Ryan"" doesn't seem to be about the anonymity of war. This is not to say it needed the jolly, ragtag group of stereotypes you'd get in a John Wayne war picture. But the characters -- the ones we care about -- should have loomed a bit larger. And while Spielberg gets credit for avoiding the clichÃ©s of a John Wayne picture, he still falls back on a Hollywood style of story -telling, complete with silhouetted figures against a dying sunlight and uplifting John Williams music on the soundtrack. As surprising as this may sound, I found myself half-wishing that John Wayne had played Captain Miller instead of Tom Hanks. I can picture the Duke shouting Hanks' line, ""We're not here to do the decent thing, we're here to follow orders!"" Wayne, by his booming presence, would have automatically filled up the general blankness of the character. Hanks' Miller doesn't seem interesting enough to justify the pool his men are running (they're wondering what his occupation in civilian life was.) ""Saving Private Ryan"" seems to suffer from Spielberg's desire to make it the definitive World War II movie (just as ""Schindler's List"" seemed to suffer from a desire to be the definite Holocaust drama). The scene in which General George C. Marshall makes his little speech in favor of saving Private Ryan is very touching, but I couldn't help wondering: If the U.S. Army is that concerned about the last of the Ryan brothers, why were all four of them sent to the front lines in the first place?"

","My first suggestion to anyone who has not yet seen this movie is GO.  Don't wait for video; don't think it can't be half as good as they say; don't use the 1,000 different procrastinator's excuses.  Just GO.  Saving Private Ryan is every bit as moving, amazing and harrowing as you've heard...and then some.  More importantly, Saving Private Ryan gives the audience just a taste of what it must have been like to be a soldier in what is called the Last Great War, and in the process shows you, in no uncertain terms, that *no* war is great.  Saving Private Ryan also made me realize just what a sacrifice the men who fought World War II made to ensure that you and I and everyone that came after lived in a safer, freer world.<br/><br/>Yes, the 25-minute Omaha Beach scene is terrifying, intense and graphic, but stick it out.  You'll see some incredible feats, made more so by the realization that real men actually *did* these things.  A small, non -spoiler example:  one of the medics, with his corpsman, going down a line of wounded soldiers; bullets are flying all around, men are still being killed and maimed in horrific ways, yet here is this medic, performing triage, knowing at any second one of those bullets might find him.<br/><br/>Spielberg, and especially Tom Hanks, bring you *into* the war; you truly see that, to the soldier, war isn't about opposing ideologies, but about accomplishing your mission, and getting your guys, and hopefully yourself, home in one piece.  That's it.  Not patriotism, at least not on the front lines; not idealism; just survival and duty, and loyalty to your guys.  And Hanks shows you how, in the midst of loss and destruction and almost intolerable inhumanity, a man can still do his duty; more than any other actor in the film, Hanks shows you how a man, normal and mild-mannered back home, finds the strength to do what is asked, and continue doing it, until the task is complete.<br/><br/>For me, Tom Hanks makes this movie.  Many reviews have pointed out that Tom Hanks delivers another of the brilliant, emotionally three-dimensional performances we, as one critic put it, have come to expect of him.  Tom Hanks' work in Private Ryan is so subtle, so real, yet so breathtakingly beautiful that the Academy will have taken leave of its collective senses if they *don't* give him a third Oscar.  In my humble opinion, Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of this generation.  You can keep your DeNiros, your Hoffmans, your Pacinos; give me Tom Hanks any day.<br/><br/>It's a powerful movie; not perfect, but very nearly so.

","Spielberg was robbed!  Spielberg was robbed!  This was the rallying cry of the 1998 Oscars as ""Shakespeare in Love"" went on to win Best Picture in place of this dark portrayl of D-Day and the days following.  This, however, is not my opinion.  The FILM itself was robbed of appropriate actors, a strong script, and a good ending.<br/><br/>However, before ripping ""Ryan"" to shreds, let first tell you the good.  The first scene is horrifyingly good.  The stark, real, unedited scene truly shows you the horrors of war.  Furthermore, it is mixed in with the artistic craftsmanship of Steven Spielberg (pay attention to the part where bullets pierce the underwater environment.)<br/><br/>Now, on to the bad.  Tom Hanks, great as he may be, was not a smart choice for the leading role.  He is so gentle in the role that you expect him to put the word ""please"" after every line.  Second, Matt Damon, as the dreadfully forgettable Ryan.  The last scene, which is drawn out, long, and at times boring.  And finally, the final scene, which defies the meaning of corny by ending with an American flag flapping in the wind.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a good movie, not a great one.  This situation would be best described as ""its parts are better than the whole.""  Particularly, the first scene.  So, see it for what it is, and please resist the temptation to shout ""Cool!""  This is a war movie, not Gladiator."

","Aside from the first 15 minutes, where the near disaster on Omaha beach is effectively portrayed, the rest of the film is a standard John Wayne, 'Sands of Iwo Jima"" type propaganda film made up of the most mundane and unbelievable tripe. If the truth be told, the American forces at Omaha would have been pushed back into the sea except for the British and Canadian forces immediately on their left flank who achieved ALL their objectives that day and pinned down the bulk of the Germans forces within their HQ area centred in Caen and thus prevented them from swinging south and completely obliterating the Omaha beachhead. Aside from that historical fact (not referred to in the film), the movie had other major shortcomings, ie; - no combat commander in his right mind would risk the lives of a full patrol to rescue a single, ""Private Ryan"", no matter what the reason; - no platoon leader (played by Tom Hanks) would go into combat with his officer stripes shining brightly on his helmet. To do so would invite an immediate sniper bullet from Germans who specifically targeted officers for priority elimination. - no platoon leader would insist on attacking an enemy strongpoint unnecessarily - especially since his orders were to only to ""get Private Ryan"". He could have detoured around the strong point but instead chose to attack it and lose some of his valuable platoon members. Why? - Tom Hanks and his heroic defence of the French town which climaxed the film was frankly unbelievable. The Germans may have been the enemy, but they were not stupid. In real life, Hanks and his little patrol would have surrendered or been brushed aside within seconds by a determined German force backed by tanks. When, oh when, are the Americans going to produce a realistic war movie which truthfully captures the events, flavour and outcome of combat reality without the John Wayne histrionics?"

","What made me perplexed about this movie is the message sent by Spielberg. During the dramatic sequences of the Normandy battle, I thought he was attempting to show the horror and absurdity of war. But he chooses to dehumanize the German soldiers. More, you should not spare the life of one (even a unarmed prisoner), because that ungrateful coward will comeback to kill you and all your journeymen with pleasure.<br/><br/>I guess it would be to difficult for Spielberg to show that the horrors of the holocaust and of the war were not perpetrated by a different species contained in a certain  time, but by men like every others, and under certain conditions these could be reproduced anywhere else.<br/><br/>
Why not make a film that makes us realize (even the Jewish), that we could be (are?) those monsters, so history does not repeat itself. Instead we have another one about courage under fire... And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."

"wildhome","Null","0","0","29 April 2001"," A comment on comments regarding combat
","I've seen the movie..and read the comments. A few minor points. To the response regarding the unreality of the ""kissing the crucifixes"" et. al., as a former Marine infantry rifleman (in Vietnam)about 2/3's of my comrades, and I, carried everything from St Christopher medals to Stars of David..and we DID kiss them, hold them and talk to them. That isn't unrealistic or hypocritical..it's fact. And WWII had a more religious cadre than Vietnam. To the response on how bad the cinematography was, how boring the non combat scenes were, and how grotesquely horrific the combat scenes were; Spielberg was trying his best to show reality. He succeeded. The cinematography wasn't bad..June, 1944 was a miserably cold rainy month..it LOOKED dreary because it was! Periods between combat ARE boring..stupifyingly so. Combat is horrific...the only way Mr. Spielberg could have made it more realistic would have been to pour blood, excrement and puke into the theatres and occasionally step up behind a viewer and whack him across the back of the head when a shell exploded nearby. That's reality people. Good cinematography gives us reality. The comment regarding the ordinariness of the participants..well that is what makes them heroes. WWII was not fought by supermen..it was fought by normal people. Admiral Halsey once commented ""There are no great men...there are only extraordinary challenges that ordinary men are forced by circumstance to overcome."" Finally, in regard to the complaint that the story was absurd. It wasn't. After the five Sullivan brothers all died aboard the USS Juneau, brothers were routinely separated to avoid precisely this kind of occurrence. That is historical fact. There was a set of brothers involved in Normandy. One died with the 4th Infantry on Utah Beach, one with the 82nd Airborne, one was missing in Burma, and one (presumably the ""Pvt. Ryan"") was missing with the 101st. The one in Burma and the one with the 101st eventually turned up safe, bless them. But the situation was NOT unheard of. And the generals were not being overly gentle (although contrary to current opinion, WWII generals weren't monsters and could be gentle), they were trying to avoid/prevent what could have been a horrible morale blow to the American people. One set of Sullivan's can be inspiring, two sets can be terribly depressing. It was a legitimate action.<br/><br/>I was wounded twice in Vietnam. I fought and killed. Saving Private Ryan is a truthful movie. The violence is real as opposed to gratuitous. The horror is real, and it's very mundane quality is what made it horrific. The premise is neither ridiculous nor evil. (Read about how Joe Kennedy was killed, and the military theory behind THAT mission ...then come back and explain about absurd theories in war being made up.) It is a great movie..A Schindler's List for the infantryman. By the way..the German's weren't protrayed as that bad. They fought and died just as the American's did. Consider the first battle scene, the American's on the attack and getting pounded. Then consider the last battle scene, the German's on the attack and getting pounded. Attacking isn't easy, nor fun..the odds are with the defense. Not evil...just fact. And regarding the German who was released and then eventually shot Hank's character; from that range and in that situation, it is doubtful he even knew who he was shooting. There was no evil intent. Just bad luck. Another truth about combat. Enough. Thank you for the chance to comment."

Don't get me wrong there is no arguing that the opening scenes of the Americans storming the beach at Normandy are graphic and thanks to modern technology all too realistic, but these scenes are pretty much where the ""war"" movie ends, and the melodrama begins. For a movie about WWII the film lacks giving any information about the war, why the soldiers are there or any other facts in regards to what occurred in Normandy or elsewhere during the war.  What ensues is a very pathetic character study of a group of entirely uninteresting individuals. While some performances stand out there is not much to work with, the script is such a gloss Hollywood piece of work, but then anything about the war seems to be one of the best films! these days. For those who argue this is one of the best war-anti-war films ever take another look at Catch-22 or better yet Dr. Strangelove, or even Slaughterhouse-Five, great depictions of the horrors of war and the toll that battle can take on people.

","As a 17-year-old, I find the thought of war particularly harrowing, since I and my peers would be eligible for the draft if war were to break out.  If it did, I honestly don't know what I'd do; but the action of going into the middle of the battlefield surrounded by bullets and men with blood streaming out of their bodies seems too terrible to contemplate.  And it's all too easy to intellectualize war, particularly for those who are well beyond draftable age, saying, ""Yeah, it would be terrible, but it's your duty as a citizen.""  That's not considering the complete picture; people who have such a simple answer can't possibly understand what being in a war would be like .  ""Saving Private Ryan,"" in all its brutal realism, should make people think twice before saying something like that so nonchalantly.  Because the fact is, people go into battles and get their limbs blown off, get shot five times in the chest, or, worst of all, get hit where they don't die immediately and then just have to lie there, whimpering that they're going to die.  People who haven't been in war can say it's terrible but if you're called, it's your duty; but I imagine that most people who have experienced war will only tell you that it's terrible.  Many things have already been said about this movie that I needn't repeat.  It definitely was an outstanding motion picture.  <br/><br/>But there is one thing I want to say about those who are so intent on complaining about the bookend scenes being too sentimental, and that's this : the sentimentality wasn't the point.  At least not in my mind.  At the end , when the old man  is looking at the grave of one of his comrades, his wife walks up to him.  She looks at the grave too, but her expression is blank, and her gaze quickly away from the grave to the old man's face, a face that has written on it the knowledge of what the man whose name is on the cross did for him. When I saw those two people, I gasped, because I realized that the two of them were on opposite sides of the spectrum of experience and were therefore seeing completely different things embodied by the cross- to the woman, the cross was simply the life of her husband; he was what mattered to her.  But to the man, the cross was everything the war had been- the terrible fighting, the killing, the sacrifice that the man in the ground beneath him had given for him.  That was what I got out of the ""bookend"" scenes, and I found that moment to be one of the most poignant moments of the entire movie.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" transcended the form of cinema; it didn't even feel like a movie, or a documentary, for that matter, it was so well-done.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" still struck me as a movie (save the first scene, which really puts you there), but it was, nevertheless, one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen."

He is, without a doubt, the Beatles of cinema. And, if ""Schindler's List"" was his ""Revolver"", then ""Saving Private Ryan"" is his ""SGT. Peppers""."

"lethalweasel","Null","0","0","2 December 2000"," Simply, the most visceral movie ever made
","All I can say about this movie is that it blows away any other war movie. It is accessibly to anyone who watches it, from a high-school drop out factory worker to some rich guy with a doctorate in film studies, it leaves you with an impression that only a movie could deliver: ""This is what it was like.""<br/><br/>Some pople may not know this, but the plot of the movie is based on an extraction of what almost happened.  One single mother sent her four sons into the war, and, on one day, recieved death notices for three of them (two died on D-Day, one was lost and presumed killed in the Pacific theatre, though he was actually captured and returned at the end of the war).  The U.S. Army sent the last son home for the same reasons as in the movie. Fortunately, in reality, a chaplain found the homeward-bound GI very quickly.  The movie asks, what would have happened had he not been so accessible?<br/><br/>Watching this film, it really gives you more an idea of what the war was like.  I'm a history major, and my focus is on the Second World War; I've read at many dozens of books on the war, and written more than a few essays, including several on D-Day itself.  Still, nothing brought me closer to a visceral understanding than this movie.  Everything is so real, from the opening sequence, to the more subtle body of the movie (the two times city-fighting in the French town are amazing).  It does not rely on any pansy artistic nonsense in the directing to make its point (as the far inferior ""Thing Red Line"" does), it simply presents the reality.<br/><br/>To address some of the complaints of the movie:<br/><br/>The lack of other nationalities is understandable.  Normandy was divided into five zones, two of them were American, it is in one of those two that the story takes place.  Simple.  Also, the man the story is based on was American, so that's were he is in the movie.  And, to be honest, the American landings on Utah and Omaha beaches were more exciting than the Canadian one of Juno beach and the British ones on Gold and Sword beaches. This was true because the Commonwealth armies were competent; the Americans messed up by over-planning their landings and by declining to engage in pre-landing naval and aerial bombardment.<br/><br/>I've heard some complaints about the GI's comments on British General Montgomery, but those comments were true to what the American troops believed.  Further, Montgomery, like most Allied commanders was no great shakes.  Its like that in almost every field in the war.  Rommel was better than Patton and Montgomery combined, Isoroku Yamamoto was ten times the admiral (and the man) Chester Nimits was, and so on.  Face facts.<br/><br/>To close up here: That this film lost the Oscar to Shakespeare in Love is almost criminal.  There can be no comparing the two films.<br/><br/>See this movie, if you already haven't.<br/><br/>**Spoilers**: The most profound part of the movie, comes with a single line. As he's dying, Tom Hank's character says to the man six men died to save, Matt Damon's character, ""Earn this.""  The look in Damon's eyes (easily his best moment as an actor) brought a tear to my eye as the screen faded into an aged version of the same character fifty-plus years later.  To live be told when you're a teenager that six people died to save you, and have to somehow live a good enough life to earn it...wow!  I can hardly imagine that sort of pressure.  Very intense."

If Spielberg would've logically answered this question during the course of this film, then I guess he would not have a film to make would he?

And he got his richly deserved Oscar for Best Director (the fact that Best Picture eluded them was a cheap move on the part of the Academy).  Most war movies paint the enemy in a way that makes them really easy to hate, ending up as a fascist, pseudo-propagandic piece. <br/><br/>
But this wasn't.  They weren't on a mission for war secrets, or to assassinate a Nazi general, but to get this ONE guy out of the madness. <br/><br/>
There's Captain Miller, with a Yossarian-like attempt to escape the madness, his relentlessly cheerful staff, the roadblocks and obstacles, and finally, Ryan, who they'd not expected.  <br/><br/>It didn't focus on the evils of the war, showing only the soldiers and not the kind of anti-whatsit speeches about their enemies, and it didn't promote the greatness of American power, despite all the patriotic music.  Except, maybe, when you see the star-spangled banner at the beginning and so on, but otherwise, it was pretty neutral politically.<br/><br/>At any rate, it deserves its place among the 200 best films of all time (according ot IMDB), and all the blood and guts and gore somehow wasn't brutal or sadistic, but merely showing it as it was."
"blakes-4","9","0","0","22 November 2000"," An epic war movie
","I was simply stunned when I saw Saving Private Ryan back in Fall 1998. I had very low expectations because the movie title sounded flat, director was Spielberg, who had not directed any ""grunt-level"" war movies so far. Also, Tom Hanks was starring it-I regarded him unsuitable to the role, despite being versatile actor. But these thoughts quickly vanished from my mind as landing crafts hit the beach and German MGs began peppering the shoreline. I began to feel almost as uncomfortable as the US troops pinned on the beach, everything was chaotic, tracer bullets whistling in the air, limbs blown off by mortar shells, men dying and screaming in agony, waves colored red with blood... Everything in these first 20 minutes or so was done in amazing detail and accuracy. It forced me to adapt totally different attitude towards the rest of the movie: this was war, nothing less or more, just war like it was in Summer 1944 in bocage hell of Normandy.<br/><br/>Captain Miller and his squad's mission is to bring back Private James Ryan, whose all brothers are killed in various theaters of war almost at the same time and he is now the only surviving son of the Ryan family. Despite this naive plot setting and some emotional and patriotic overtones (like scene of Gen. Marshall referring to Lincoln) they seem irrelevant since the movie is all about a squad of Army Rangers, their fighting, suffering and griping in Normandy battles. The chaos of war is captured very well with airborne troops and German units scattered all over Normandy cut out of command and communications. Sometimes only a wall separates Germans from Americans and solitary German machine-guns and snipers take their toll even before Captain Miller's (Hanks) squad even reaches Private Ryan's unit in a remote village. As they finally reach the ruined village, Ryan refuses to leave and Miller decides to stay also to defend an important bridge. As the troops wait for a German attack, there are some good scenes like idle soldiers killing time talking ""grunt talk"", but also the worst scene in the movie: Matt Damon starts to tell Miller about some ""hilarious"" events taking place with an ugly girl at attic of his homestead's barn. I think this scene could have been easily been cut out, now it looks only a clumsy attemp to bring depth in the Ryan character.<br/><br/>The final battle is another longer combat sequence in this movie and it takes place in the streets of Ramelle. The fighting is again shown in a realistic manner, but I doubt that the elite German SS would advance the main street with tanks like in a parade while expecting US resistance. And at some scenes Germans just seem to run mindlessly towards intense US machine gun and sniper fire without any cover. There are some macho scenes, like sgt. Horvath (Sizemore) and a German running out of ammo and throwing helmets at each other.  But these issues might only matter to WWII history buffs (like me) and generally the combat is more realistic and intense than anything ever seen on the screen before.<br/><br/>At the end of the bloodbath, only two men are left of original Miller's squad with Miller gasping ""Earn this.."" with his last breath to Private Ryan. The very end is a return to the beginning of the movie, with Ryan shown as an old man making visit to Miller's grave in Normandy. The final dialogue is between Ryan and his wife, and the scene is a bit Spielbergishly over-melodramatic with Ryan asking his wife is he a good man. And he then makes a military salute to Miller's grave, which I think is a proper end to to this great war movie.<br/><br/>Overally, this is a classic war movie, perhaps not the greatest of all time but at least best of the 90's. The acting is excellent, Tom Hanks making his best role so far as emotional, yet tough Captain Miller. Certainly would have deserved an Oscar for that. Supporting roles are also good, but perhaps kind of one dimensional and shadowed by Hank's Milller character. Effects are equally good, on the special and sound department. The washed colors work well and add to realism. The general feeling of being there is captured very well.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT HISTORICAL NOTE** *Some British comments here state that there were other nationalities like British and Canadians in Normandy Invasion. Of course there were, but this movie is about a squad of men, not the whole vast scope of the Invasion. If you are looking for that, watch also ""The Longest Day"". SPR is by no means telling that the Americans made Normandy Invasion single-handedly.<br/><br/>The scene where Miller and some airborne officer are talking about the progress of the Invasion and refer to General Montgomery as ""Overrated"" or ""he can't get through at Caen"". They were just talking about how American GI's really thought during summer 1944. There WAS a certain amount of friction between western allies and this movie is not claiming that British were incompetent-it merely show what was thought in those days.*<br/><br/>I give ""The best war movie of the 90's"" a score of 9.5/10<br/><br/>PS. The Thin Red Line, the other big '98 war movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece. Saving Private Ryan makes you think by just showing what war really is. The Thin Red Line shows what war really isn't and wants you to think like director has already thought for you."

Is duty and honor important enough to die for?  What if Ryan turns out to be a complete degenerate?  It is a pretty heady, and ultimately unanswerable question. Yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film, Spielberg answers the question for us.  This is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings.  It cheapens the film.  When Hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama.  When the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know he'll be dead in ten minutes. When they release the German soldier we somehow know we'll see him again.

Every detail was paid close attention to in the making of this extraordinary motion picture that has become possibly the greatest war film ever made."

"Jeb-9","10","0","0","21 August 2000"," Spielberg at his Best?...directing wise yes.
","I own this movie on DVD and it still remains very solid amongst my large collection.  Spielberg is truly a master director.  Finally someone has accurately portrayed what it was like in battle.  From the ultra-realistic depiction of gore and violence to the drama of the dying medic (get to that later)and most importantly portraying the wounded in battle.  I also like the way Spielberg kind of exposed, or degraded the film to kind of give it an old, gritty look to it, very nice effect.  Saving Private Ryan is, honestly in my opinion, Speilberg at his directing best.  However, there are a few gripes. First off, I have yet to see a war movie which combined all of the needed elements to make it ""the best war movie ever!""  Full Metal Jacket is close but no cigar.  Anyway one of the most important of these elements would be character development, in which case Saving Private Ryan had none. The whole story behind Saving Private Ryan was to figure out who the old man was.  And what little character development they did have turned out to be fruitless and not very interesting.  Another element missed was emotion. True, the soldiers frightened faces and yells of mass hysteria was great and all, but I thought if this movie would some how have implemented a narration of some kind, then maybe I would care for the main characters a bit more. Third element missing was the plot.  What can you do in 3 hours when the whole plot revolves around going out to find someone.  Walk a little talk a little, fight, walk a little talk a little fight, die, fight, walk.  It seemed kind of muddled and boring.  And another gripe, which isn't really a big deal, is how the medic died.  What the hell is he doing charging at a machine gun nest?  Since medics aren't allowed to carry weapons, I was just pondering why they would have him run along with them.  I mean, what's he going to do when he gets to the enemy, heal them to death?  Or maybe, just maybe, if he was in syringe range he could take an enemy out with a critical stab, ahhh die Germans die!!! Anyway, with all gripes aside, I still loved this movie.  Thanks to Spielberg that is.  I enjoyed it in the theaters and I enjoyed it at home. The war scenes are unmatched, music is great and overall it was well done. Kudos. *** out of ****"

","What can you say about this movie. I know one thing I can say is, ""Steven Spielberg is a genius"". This movie tells outstanding story. It is the story of 8 soldiers and their quest to save one man. Mr. Spielberg did an amazing job of telling this story. The characters are very well-developed. The scene where the mother receives the telegram telling of her sons' deaths, is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever beheld. I could go on forever about the cast, the scenery, the realism, and the action. However, I will just tell you, ""If you haven't seen this movie you have to see it!!!"" One thing I would like to ask is why FOR PETE'S SAKE did anyone ever give this movie a rating of 1, instead of 10. They must be the type of people who don't have any beauty in their life.

The realism of this film can have so much impact on your life if you just let it, and understand the real sacrifice that solders have made.  Solders who are real people and not just names on a wall or in a book or on a death certificate. This movie was not made for your entertainment, it was made for the vets of WWII... and American vets at that.  I don't believe that there is any possible way to know the impact a war can have on your life when serving in combat without experiencing it first hand.  Saving Private Ryan is the closest thing possible to that.  I have more respect and admiration for those who have fought for their country now that I have seen this film. This is by far the best film ever made."

","The movie starts and ends with a sun-bleached American flag whipping in the wind. Between these images we see several intense and very believable battle sequences. We get a good glimpse into the nightmares of every modern war veteran. But this movie isn't all just battle scenes, gore, and death. It has characters we can associate with. The normal guys who find themselves in extraordinary situations -- not action heroes or superstars who fit right in to battle scenes. Their fear expressed in high-speed stuttered camera techniques (everything comes into sharp focus.) We watch one man's, Cap'n Miller, descent into insanity. We watch eight men fight for a simple idea of military etiquette. We watch hate grow in both our heroes and the Germans'. We watch poetic injustice. This movie questions the cost of war. The cost of human lives and ideas, and it recalls a memory that in a couple of decades will be lost forever in the graves of ancient men. This is not just another war flick.  It's deep, meaningful, intellectual, and real. And as a film student, I'd be ashamed should this impressive and powerful film not receive both popular and awards recognition."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" starts out with a very graphic, difficult, and fascinating scene of American soldiers storming the beaches on D-Day.  The scene is tragic and merciless, but probably almost exactly what is was like for the real soldiers in WWII.  Tom Hanks plays a Captain John H. Miller, one of the first soldiers on the beach, and a leader of the attack on the Germans at the fortified beach-heads.  Three days after that first landing on the beaches of Normandy, Capt. Miller is given a new assignment:  He is to take a special task force of eight men through occupied, war-torn northern France to try and find one wayward paratrooper named James Francis Ryan.  The reason for this seemingly absurd mission to find one man, a simple Private, is because his mother back in Iowa has already lost three sons, and the army wants to do the decent thing and let the last Ryan brother, James, have a free ticket home to be with his mother.  The movie is long, graphic, and painful to watch at times, but it has absolutely excellent acting, writing, camerawork, directing, and cinematography.  This is definitely one of the greatest war films I've ever seen."

","I was impressed with both of Spielberg's Second World War movies:  Schindler 's List and Saving Private Ryan.  They created a level of realism that evoked  an emotional level very much like grief that one experiences through family loss.  Spielberg's  development of the character Captain Miller was effective in symbolizing the general level of support for the war--teacher turned warrior.  Similarly, Oskar Schindler represented  higher values in a chaotic setting. Spielberg is such a force that one would have to go back to D.W. Griffith to find a director who was the star of the picture. As a Baby Boomer who grew up on war ""entertainment"" I can tell you that most war movies did little more that heighten my hormonal levels.  Both Schindler's and Pvt. Ryan made me cry--heaving types of release that one would assume would be reserved for family losses.  Now that is empathy by the viewer! I was impressed by the way that Spielberg recreated battle scenes, rather than inventing them.  I am sure that the veterans had a sense of flashback, whereas the uninitiated were merely horrified. Spielberg gave the viewer the opportunity to identify with the struggles and sacrifices of veterans; an opportunity to attempt to understand the trauma suffered by all combat veterans."

Then one day in late summer I decided to go see this film. I walked out of the theater that day, a humbled 16 year old boy, crying like a child. What was that I had just seen? Did those things really happen? Why?<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is the single greatest movie I have ever seen. A lot of people recommend movies that make you think about something, whether it be a cause, an emotion or a question. Saving Private Ryan makes you think, it makes you think of the price of our freedom. This movie, and this movie alone, shows the horrors that our fathers and grandfathers had to face. This movie has sparked several conversations with my grandfather about what he went through during the years of 1939-1945 and boy, would his stories make a good movie.<br/><br/>I just can not describe the emotional impact this film has had on me and the ones close to me. It was made with such precision and care, it is undescribable. The story is moving, the acting is absolutely flawless, the realism is beyond comparison to any other war film and the time spent on historical accuracy must have lasted for years. Just watch the Omaha Beach sequence and you will see what I mean about historical accuracy. John Williams musical score is amazing and heart felt as is Mr. Spielberg's direction.<br/><br/>In closing, Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.

","""Saving Private Ryan,"" with the possible exception of ""Glory"" and ""Platoon"" (and neither of those was about WWII) is the most spectacular and, as far as I can tell, accurate portrayal of a major world war, except for maybe one point: War is worse. And here's the difference I have with most reviewers, and even Spielberg himself; I believe that EVERY child, of about 15+ in age, should see this movie. If only for an understanding of the absolute horror of killing other human beings (and fish) by the THOUSANDS in the name of democracy or some other damn thing. I confess that I never really understood such issues as the taking of Omaha Beach on D-Day. At least, not beyond the reflection of poets and storytellers ""...And those men took that beach..."" I never realized quite how terrible the ground war was. As an Air Force Cadet, I studied the aspects of the world's first air war, which in and of itself was bad enough.<br/><br/>A friend of mine was telling me what he thought of the movie today, and he said ""It was enjoyable."" Well, that's not quite how I would describe the experience. ""Excruciatingly emotional"" is more what I was feeling. Yup, I cried. And one line at the very end between a man and his wife strikes me even now, two days later. Eric knows what I'm talking about, I'm sure. I've been crying a lot at movies recently, which is odd. ""Titanic"", I cried at, but sort of enjoyed having that little damn burst. Before that, ""Braveheart"" got me every time. Even ""Deep Impact"" got the tears flowing a bit. But those were all a little fun in the release. As I was walking out of ""Ryan,"" (in a theater that was, although sold out, absolutely dead silent as people exited, most looking at the floor) I felt not a cleansing, but a slightly gnawing guilt. I'll see it again. Mostly so I can pay more attention to the technical aspects of the film (if I can) and try to determine how I might someday make a film half as good as the one Steven Spielberg's genius has wrought this time. His best? Possibly. But it's hard to differentiate five or six ""five stars out of five"" movies. If you're looking for another, less gory but still brutal look at WWII from Spielberg, check out ""Empire of the Sun,"" a movie that was far better than it's box office take, and one of the first people movies that makes me cry."

At only 23 years old, I have found a new appreciation for what those sevicemen did and what they stood for. I have visited the D-Day Museum in Normandy and the American Cemetary.  Ironically, I have never been to a more peaceful place than Omaha Beach, walking through the bombed out bunkers. I felt a presence of what it was like to be there on that day in June. I hope that others, especially people not old enough to have lived through a war, can begin to appreciate what the American military stands for and what they protect.

He succeeds in all 3, but only the third is what really interests me when seeing a movie.  The other objectives lead to overdoing the gory aspects of things, and some uncharacteristically poor editing and confusing use of slow-motion.

WWII wasn't all happiness and brotherhood among men.  There was a war going on as well.  Tom Hanks easily earned his third oscar with his role as the captain of a unit on a mission to find Priv. James Ryan.  Speilberg easily gets an Oscar as well."

","THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER WAR LIKE WWII. And though Hollywood has done everything in its power to glamorize full-scale combat, Saving Private Ryan is an important reminder that war is not glamorous, noble nor pleasant in any way. In Ryan, Steven Spielberg delivers some of the most terrifying battle scenes ever committed to film, and in the process, uncovers the lingering bits of humanity found in the hearts of all men, even soldiers in the midst of an all out invasion.<br/><br/> Most of the action in Ryantakes place on the battle field <br/><br/>the brutality of war Saving Private Ryan is a story of mutilation. Soldier's bodies are torn in half, exploded, gutted, sliced, stabbed, dismembered, and generally desecrated in every way imaginable. And for their trouble, the lucky ones receive a quick-and-dirty burial in a mass shallow grave. It's this reality that Spielberg embraces, never giving the viewer anything less than a close-up and graphic look at the carnage. But unlike slasher or Hong Kong action movies, Saving Private Ryan was not made to impress the viewer with its creative violence. The graphic violence is meant to scare the living hell out of the audience, and give some kind of explanation for the surviving characters' state of mind.<br/><br/> With war comes suffering for all, not just the soldiers <br/><br/>technical mastery Despite the horrors of war depicted in the movie, even the most squeamish of viewers will find it difficult, if not impossible, to tear their eyes away from the screen during the disturbingly intense battle scenes. From the hand-held camera work (complete with occasional dropped frames for that classic WWII stock footage look), to the devastating visual effects of bombs exploding, bodies being torn to hell and, most of all, bullets flying everywhere, Saving Private Ryan is a thing of absolute wonder. And yet the visual effects pale in comparison to the sound effects which are thick and powerful, and do more to bring the audience into the world of the movie than anything actually on the screen.<br/><br/>
 The opening scene beach invasion is the most intense battle of the entire movie what about ryan? Beyond the amazing effects, sets and spot-on performances from Sizemore, Burns, Davies and Pepper, Saving Private Ryan fails to deliver the knockout punch in some aspects of the story. Yes, Private Ryan is the last remaining brother of the Ryan family, and, of course it will be difficult to find one foot soldier in the middle of a war, but that's about all you get. Tom Hanks, as solid as his performance is, never quite takes his character where it wants to go, and Matt Damon's character proves practically meaningless, making it difficult to justify the loss suffered trying to save him.<br/><br/>so does it work? Saving Private Ryan will leave your nerves absolutely frazzled and give you plenty to think about on the subject of humanity. And though, there are a few disappointments along the way, the negatives are few and the strengths are many and impressive."

The bullets tore holes in the water around me, and I made for the nearest steal obstacle...it was still very early and very gray for good pictures, but the gray water and gray sky made the little men, dodging under the surrealistic designs of Hitler's anti-invasion braintrust, very effective."", he said later of the day. The photograph is very grainy. You can see the steal barricades and a soldier, blurry in the foreground gritting his teeth, swimming towards his destiny. Clearly Capa was afraid while taking the picture. Speilberg has filled in Capa's grainy, blurry photo for me. I can see Speilberg's  Capt.

I thought, given the scope of the film, that the characters were developed very subtly - for example, the scene in which the medic was rewriting the bloody letter home written by the first man killed while confessing a wish that he had not pretended to be sleeping so his Mom wouldn't chat it up with him. Very real. <br/><br/>The camera work was intended to make you feel ""first person"" intensity, which it did.

","I was deeply moved after seeing Saving Private Ryan.  It is simply the best war movie ever made.  And to the European critics: it was not meant to be an all-encompassing work about the allied effort in Normandy during World War II (see The Longest Day for that).  It is an American story, about American sacrifice, made by a master of American film.  Its purpose is clear: to help remind and educate our country about the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation, and this education is long overdue.  If Spielberg had to wave a flag and tug at emotions to do this, so be it.<br/><br/>Beyond mere words, this film has spurred people to action.  Many Americans now seek out World War II veterans to give them the respect they deserve, and to hear their stories, before they are gone.  For me, it was a catalyst. My father landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, and it was with great pride that I took him back there last year for the 55th anniversary of the event.  He was able to meet and discuss his experiences with many American, Canadian, and British veterans.<br/><br/>In a particularly personal and memorable moment, and reminiscent of the opening and closing sequences of the film, my father and I visited his buddy's grave at the American Cemetery in Colleville Sur Mer.  His friend was killed in action on Omaha Beach on D-Day.  Memories of the friendship shared and lost overwhelmed him, and brought the visit into perspective.

"eastie","7","0","0","20 March 2000"," great movie, but not as anti-war as people claim
","Certainly, SPR is powerful, mind-numbing stuff, but so are most decent war movies if you spend three hours in the cinema. Maybe it was just that the beginning was so hyped that it didn't quite have the impact I was expecting, although a few fantastic moments did stand out (the ""lucky guy"" who's helmet gets scratched by a bullet, for example). The problem is that for a movie which is so brutally honest in its depiction of the horrors of battle, the film is lazy to the point of dishonesty in so many other areas and insodoing it undermines its credentials as an antiwar film.<br/><br/>To start with a point made in a number of other reviews, the Germans are utterly unsympathetic. The one German we feel sorry for turns out to be a real baddie, eager to kill the heroic Americans as soon as he gets the chance. The result is a movie whose values are completely the wrong way round - the war was rightful insofar as it attempted to check an aggresive and horrifically inhumane regime. It wasn't justified of itself by American patriotism, rather, patriotism provided a powerful rallying point. Yet the Stars and Stripes are far more redolent of America than of liberty itself, in spite of the perceived American monopoly on freedom.  By making the Americans heroic and the Germans either faceless or treacherous, by excluding the involvement of Canadian, British and British Imperial troops, and by the emphasis on the worshipful Flag, Spielberg turned the second world war into a matter of Americans vs Germans, American patriotism vs German nationalism, rather than right vs wrong. It was the noblest of sacrifices for these men to die in a country that was halfway round the world from their homes. Many, probably most, fought for their country rather than for France, or Poland or for any ideal of liberty, but if you argue that patriotism actually justified the war, then you're back to ""Dulce et decorum est"". SPR certainly doesn't make war ""dulce"", but it comes pretty close to making patriotism ""decorum"", when this is precisely what many of the vilified Germans were fighting for.<br/><br/>There are other problems with the film, with its story and characterisation. Most, however, are covered in other reviews. One thing, though: the film was much praised because all of the major protagonists are terrified by war. Yet, the same old cliche remains - the weak link in the team who is too scared to fight, but ends up finding his courage (admittedly after one of the most brilliant scenes in any war movie, where the knife fight is happening while the cowardly soldier waits on the stair). It's just a bit disappointing. So many things in SPR are brilliant and uncompromising (like the knife fight, people blowing themselves up with their own mines etc.) that all the cop-outs and compromises are additionally galling. A pity."

While the relatively plotless (but never less than compelling) middle section has attracted criticism, in terms of sheer visceral authenticity and dramatic impact Saving Private Ryan is absolutely peerless.  Tom Hanks gives possibly his finest performance yet, and the rest of the cast, despite essentially playing a selection of stereotypes, do admirably well.<br/><br/>Admittedly the battle sequences are quite bloody, and it is not quite as great as the shatteringly unforgettable Schindler's List, but Saving Private Ryan is none the less a towering achievement, and essential viewing.<br/><br/>10/10"

I think that this film proves my point better than any book or essay.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by World War II, and have enjoyed many of Steven Spielberg's WWII-era films as a result. After seeing this one, I see every other WWII movie before it as almost an insult to the reality of war. But I don't think a true account of what it was like on Normandy beach would be possible before now.<br/><br/>Unlike other war movies, this one shows a larger picture, as seen from the perspective of individual soldiers. The characters in Saving Private Ryan are certainly the emphasis of the story, but Spielberg does not shy away from showing us the countless others they meet along the way. ALL of the characters in the movie are believable, not exaggerated as in many other war movies.<br/><br/>Anyone who ""enjoys"" the battle scenes is so completely desensitized to violence that even this movie won't be able to resensitize you. Anyone who says the movie's story is weak or that Spielberg's direction is a problem has either not seen the movie at all or made their minds up before they saw it. To fully appreciate Saving Private Ryan, one must put themselves in the soldiers' shoes, which in this case is made excruciatingly easy.<br/><br/>This film's only weak point is far stronger than most American WWII movies.

The battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite elaborate in detail. While there are many warnings about how graphic this picture is, it almost seems that there should be no age restriction on the movie, so that everyone (of all ages) can see the horrid side of war. The story line is a good one, though not true, it does remind you of the true story of the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who were killed while serving on the same navy ship in WWII). I feel the movie could have been a bit more emotional, or played to the audience's emotions better, instead it was oriented more toward the details of war, and less to the personalities of the persons portrayed serving in that war.

","First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re-creation footage you're ever likely to see. Definitely not for the squeamish, it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of ""excitement"" (which most battle simulations end up doing on some level, even the well-meaning ones). Spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown: as pure Hell, a nightmare that it is impossible to waken from.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence. . . well, I'm not sure. The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well. But upon further viewings, the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable. I don't know, it's a toss-up. There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his ""dramatic"" career anyway - I'm one who still believes there's much to be said for Tom's earlier work in comedy) but there just seems to be an overall ""falseness"" in the structure that undercuts some of the film's power. I wish a better framing story could have been found.<br/><br/>But by all means see this movie. Warts and all, it's the kind that only a truly great director could make - and the opening alone is worth the cost. Just don't expect a masterpiece; think of it more as a flawed gem."

","If you like this movie, you like it because of the style.  The battle scenes are amazing and some of the best ever put on film. This movie could have been great had someone paid attention to the script. There are so many problems with it (apart from being quite an average plot) I don't even know where to start.  Let's point out the obvious one:  the movie is told from the Matt Damon character's point of view -- and he wasn't even in most of the movie!  There's no way he can know the story of how Hanks found Private Ryan, because he wasn't there! If you want to know why this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar, that's it. The underlying structure of the script is so flawed, it undermines everything Spielberg did with the movie. Still, this is a good movie.  A very good movie even and it is certainly worth your while.  I'm just sorry most people will rent it on video because it really benefits from a cinema experience."

","We've heard reams of praise for Private Ryan.  We're sure to see it win some major film awards in the coming months.  Let's be honest, this film is well above average for a Hollywood product. Spielberg is a bona-fide talent and has proved that he can make serious, engaging films.<br/><br/>Still, as much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, I left the theater feeling strangely unfulfilled.  The story of the D-Day invasion and dubiously honorable search for one soldier is very well told and pays homage to the finest and most brutally honest WWII films ever made.  Spielberg's smartest decision in this film was in using John Williams' score rather sparingly.  The sight of soldiers jumping off the gunboats to their immediate deaths is horrific, and we don't need music to remind us.  The story plays itself out very naturally.  Not every gruesome event happens for a reason; we're reminded that war has no immediately discernible logic.  Even the recognizable stars aren't spared the horrors of war.<br/><br/>However, this film is bookmarked by an opening and closing sequence in the present day that, while well-intentioned, is more of a distraction than anything else. The apparent message is that not a minute of your life should be taken for granted when others make great sacrifices for you.<br/><br/>We study history so that we may appreciate our existence, not so we can plug into mindless entertainment.  When will Hollywood realize this?"

","In my opinion, Saving Private Ryan is the best war film ever made. It is my personal favorite movie, and I will tell you why. Many people claim this movie is too graphic and violent, but the fact is that it is based on D-Day, an actual event taking place in World War 2. By seeing this movie, you get the experience of what combat in war is like, an experience you can't get from just reading a book. Many veterans and other people have stated that the battlefield scenes in this movie are 100% realistic, and the only thing missing is the smell of the dead bodies. I think Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making a good story out of history, with a great and original plot, believable characters, and realistic events. I suggest you see this movie as soon as possible, especially if you are into World War 2 movies like I am."

","Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I have ever seen.  It is one of the few films ever made that actually attempts to depict war in its actual, horrific form.  All of the other war films feature soldiers dying ""sugar-coated"" deaths, suddenly falling to the ground.  This occurred maybe 1% of the time in reality.  In truth, soldiers were more likely to suffer greatly before their wounds took them.  War is brutal- and this film depicts it very accurately.  It makes me think very much about what the soldiers in D-Day went through on June 6, 1944, and in any other battle or war.  They all helped to make the world a better place.  My heart goes out to all who dare to change the world in such a way.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the carnage of war was not only abundant during World War II, but that this happened both before and after.  From the American Revolution to the Civil War, from World War I to World War II, from Korea to Vietnam, and beyond.<br/><br/>Each time I see Saving Private Ryan, I think even more about the sacrifice a dedicated soldier will make for his country, and how many soldiers are willing to do just that.<br/><br/>If you are one of those soldiers who helped to change the world by risking your own ultimate sacrifice and are reading this, thank you!<br/><br/>If you are one of the many people out there that does not care about sacrifice at all and saw this movie, I have no idea what will make you care."

","When I went to the theatre with some friends to see Saving Private Ryan, nothing had me prepared for what was about to come.  The opening scene on the beach of Normandy was so graphic and realistic, it was truly a sensory-overload experience.  Throughout the movie, Spielberg lets action to speak for itself, instead of settling for hip dialogues that tries to sound smart.<br/><br/>So far, this is the most well-made and greatest war film ever made.  Forget what other people have said about other war movies!!  Saving Private Ryan is the only film where I almost felt pain whenever I see bullets and explosions annihilate the soldiers.  It has succeeded where other war movies have tried unsuccesfully to do: to shock the nerve out of you, and to make the audience fully realize the stark reality of war.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan doesn't lecture about war.  Instead, the scenes will do it without words.  My friends and I left the cinema feeling so shocked and affected, and that's how I knew that this is the best war movie ever made.

After releasing a Nazi P.O.W (to the protest of a few of his subordinates who wanted to seek revenge on for slaughtering one of their friends) Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) gives a nice speech on how killing a man makes him feel further and further from home each time, yet he doesn't take a second's thought when clipping a few Nazi goons in the final act.

","I suspect that only a veteran who actually experienced the horrors shown in the film could attest to their authenticity. However, the scenes have the feel of reality as do the reactions of the soldier characters to their situations. The peg of the story that the high brass would sacrifice other men to save one man for public relations reasons certainly rings true. We are shown nothing to make war look attractive as the camera and special effects move from one aspect of bloody death to another without pause. One may carp that Spielberg takes a parochial view of the war in that no mention whatever is made of other allies fighting Hitler. It looks like solely a U.S. war. That's most likely just what it did look like to the grunts facing the krauts and the japs in 1944. He is also accused of taking a middle class view of the war: i.e. officers were teachers or other professionals, while other ranks were not. Well, that is just about the way it actually was so far as officers were concerned, but plenty of educated folks served in the ranks. Nobody in the film talks about the lofty ideals of the war. Again, that's realism. As a non-combat soldier in WW2 who served only stateside, I cannot recall ever being involved in a discussion about ""saving the world for democracy"". There was a lot of talk about the viciousness of the enemy, though, both before and after the U.S. involvement. I expect the soldiers ""over there"" were not much different. Lofty ideals are mostly spouted in the speeches of politicians. I doubt that anyone can view this film without being profoundly moved by the sheer monumental brutality depicted. Note that it is a re-creation of brutality that actually happened; it is not the fake horrors of your usual Hollywood ""action"" flick."

"beana","10","0","0","9 August 1998"," Saving Private Ryan- just a few comments
","First, I want to say that I was thoroughly shocked and impressed by this film. I can't say I enjoyed it, because, as you know, this wasn't the type of film to be enjoyed. This was the type of film to be remembered and hallowed, which I will for the rest of my life. As a member of generation X, I have to agree with all those who have said that younger people need to see this. Before I saw this movie, I have to admit, war was merely a concept I learned in history, and the realism of SPR opened my eyes wide (not to mention my mouth in that first half hour or so). And I also agree the message was to us. I have yet to experience a loss or a sacrifice that even comes close to what those families went through, and of course I hope I never have to experience anything remotely resembling it, especially after seeing this movie. Before I end this message, I would just like to clear something up. The meaning of sending eight guys after one guy, besides the figurative meaning, the reason given in the movie, is addressed in the first half of the movie. General Marshall read a very poignant letter that had been written by Abraham Lincoln to a woman who had lost all of her children in the Civil War. The brothers had been put in the army together so they would be with people they knew. Putting family members together in the armed services was a common practice up to and including WWII. The reason General Marshall sent those eight men after Private Ryan was so that he could send Ryan home, instead of his body in a box, like he would have to do for so many men from so many families. This movie is not entirely fiction based. There were many incidents during WWI and II in which whole families were killed all at once. After WWII, it was declared that members of the same family had to be split up, so that the chances of that family having sons left after the war were greater than before. Besides all that, if more families lost more sons, they'd have more contempt for the government for sending their men into a no-win situation, which makes it a good thing we won! But all of that speculation aside, I choose to ignore all those who complain about the *shaking camera*! What's that about? Take some Dramamine for pete's sake! I also choose to ignore those who said the movie lacked character development and emotion. Look a little deeper, that was the whole movie! In closing, I'd like to say that all is not lost in trying to reach the heart of human compassion. If Steven can do it, so can we!"

I'm thankful none of the money I spent on this filth (a pound in a charity shop) will find its way into American pockets. Incidentally, I can't agree with those criticising the portrayal of the Germans. Whether or not individuals were keen to be in occupied countries is irrelevant - they all bore some responsibility for laying waste a whole continent and the murder or enslavement of its population.

The only female actor that has more than five minutes of screen time is a man and he is closeted, whose character doesn't seem to have two brain cells to rub together, and therefore correctly represents (in the eyes of those sad individuals who stand behind this piece of s**t of a movie)the entire male population. Ironically, he still manages to kill every German he meets because he's non-nazi.

","In the aftermath of D-Day, Tom Hanks and his platoon of soldiers are sent off on a glorified PR-mission into harm's way to ""rescue"" and bring home the last surviving member of the Ryan family.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg can be a truly great director, but Saving Private Ryan is an increasingly tiresome and nearly unwatchable trudge through war movie clichés. After the harrowing opening recreation, the film slides inexorably downhill into a rut from which it never emerges. For all of the heralding by critics and fans of what a great film this is, it is predictable, mind-numbing and finally butt-numbing.<br/><br/>A minor history lesson. While it is true that in events where an entire generation of a family enlisted and all but one died, there were efforts to extract and return the soldier in question home. However, extraction often meant waiting for the soldier or his commanding officer(s) to be in contact and then make appropriate arrangements for said soldier to be removed as soon as possible. Try as I might, I can find no historic evidence that documents what happens in this film, in that an entire platoon of men are placed in constant life-threatening situations in order to extract a single private for a glorified PR stunt.<br/><br/>Spielberg often has problems with conclusions, especially in his more serious endeavors. That is definitely the case here, which features a wraparound, which opens at Arlington Cemetery with the aged Ryan and concludes there as well. The entire segment is badly directed and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>The script itself is almost ridiculously slight, particularly for a near 3-hour running time. The men in the platoon are all marching clichés reduced to types seen in a thousand other (and in many cases much better) war films. Each actor pretty much fastens in on one character trait and allows that to suffice for a performance. Hanks fares best as the everyman leader and Tom Sizemore is adequate as the second-in-command, but they have given very similar performances elsewhere. Worst performances come from Jeremy Davies, who overacts hysterically in the final third, and Edward Burns, who somehow manages to make his character supremely unlikable.<br/><br/>For the duration of the film, it hits the same tedious notes. The men trod through the ugly war zone, one of them confides something personal and is then subsequently obliterated in an often painfully protracted geyser of gore. The platoon's slog resumes, someone else confides a personal story and then said person is annihilated shortly thereafter. Over and over again and again...until a handful remain to find their quarry. Given that their losses do not endear the survivors to their quarry, it comes as no surprise when they finally face Private Ryan (solidly played by Matt Damon), who is such a congenial, aw-shucks, Middle American nice guy, that not only are the surviving men immediately charmed by him, but when Ryan refuses to leave his post, our survivors defy their orders to extract him immediately and stand by him in the chaotic final onslaught.<br/><br/>There is pretty much nothing in the way of surprise in the film and everything unfolds in a slow and tortuously predictable fashion. About the only surprise is how needlessly and relentlessly brutal Spielberg is with the violence. After the opening moments of horrific carnage, I think everyone gets the whole ""war is hell"" scenario. Unfortunately, Spielberg never ratchets back the violence - releasing free-flowing blood, gore and body parts at the camera.<br/><br/>Worse, the film is incredibly ugly to look at. Many WW2 veterans recount the beauty of Europe during their service, yet the entire color palette of this film consists of mud brown, bleak greys and depressing blues (and of course dark red blood). Spielberg also over-utilizes the now too common place Shake-cam 4000, in which the camera jitters all over the place like its got palsy or is afflicted by St. Vitus's Dance, which I gather is supposed to provide a ""you are there"" authenticity, but instead generates motion sickness, migraines and frustration.<br/><br/>A really tiresome and criminally overrated viewing experience. By the climax, when the elderly Ryan questions whether it was all worth it, you may well find yourself responding negatively."
"owen_twistfield","7","3","8","25 June 2007"," Nice, but sentimental and historically flawed
","Summary Saving Private Ryan a good movie, but it is a times painfully sentimental, American centred and, while suggesting realism, historically flawed.<br/><br/>Sentimental because the movie is laden with strong emotional moments. The most marked of which is the one when the aged Ryan drops to his knees at the grave of a the captain who saved him exclaiming, ""did i do good?"".<br/><br/>American centered because, while the us characters are lifelike all others are not. Most absurd are the Germans. For instance the climax of the movie sees the us cast being attacked by SS men. SS where no that old(average age of SS rank and file was between 17-21)but they where also not bald. Nor all that ugly. Nor that inept(front assaults with what is obvious a 20 mm gun is a laugh, tiger tanks where general deployed in groups, not in single instances, tanks where usually covered by infantry to prevent them from being ambushed by enemy infantry etc.) But most of all: there where no SS at that moment in time at that place. The SS units moving up to Normandy which could have intervened where delayed by an exceptional campaign of sabotage and interdictions. The airborne where in fact opposed by regular infantry and the unreliable ost-truppen most of the time. The only crack units that crossed swords with the airborne in early June where the fallschirmjaeger unit's near ST Lo. These did not posses tiger tanks. <br/><br/>The story while breathing an air of being historically true is in fact mostly true to the American part, all the others are just to embellish the story. In this movie the US cast had to fight the SS equipped with tigertanks because in the US mind frame that was the best the Germans had to offer. (ironically: an inquiry among us soldier what they feared most put the tiger tank at the top of the list, it's ironical because of the 1350 odd produced tiger tanks 2/3 went to the east-front, 1/3 to the south and west front. What reached the Normandy front(running the gauntlet of interdictions and sabotage) where mostly deployed against the English sector and not the US sector(yes more than 50% of the forces landed where non us). The chance therefore that the us airborne would have been facing tigertanks in the early days of the invasion was equal to zero. <br/><br/>And then the strange plot twists. The main characters land on Omaha beach, giving birth to one of the most intense movie scenes every filmed. It had to be Omaha because it was the hardest fought for. But then comes the weird part: the heroes are charged with saving Ryan who could have been better reached with less hassle by starting from Utah beach, which was closer to the drop zones and less opposed by the Germans. No the logical move would be to be shipped to the other beach but instead the story let's the saviors take a round-abound trip of 30 odd kilometres through enemy held territory without any explanation given. The movie wasn't aiming to be the historically accurate, it was a movie which made heroes of soldiers who did their job, despite misgivings and in the face of adversity. I somehow feel that the way the movie display heroism is wrong, that it is detracted in the way this movies tells the story. The stories main emotion is exemplified by the sentimental looking guy who looks at the stars thinking of home, murmuring something about the cakes his mother made for him when he was ten. Investigations into the mindset of the average soldier paints another picture. Home was another planet, there was no time to look at the stars, if you had that time, you went to sleep, for there was always a lack of sleep. If you didn't sleep you ate or drank. Instead of creating a band, veteran soldiers shut themselves of from others because most of those others would be dead within a months time. There might have been a band, but it wasn't one of brothers. It was a band of survivors. Like Letters of Iwo Jima it isn't an overtly political statement, but it is historically flawed and overtly sentimental to the point of being untrue. <br/><br/>Nevertheless it is still a good movie that should be looked at as being fiction and the sentimental part can be skipped and the historical vaults forgiven."
"rmax304823","8","3","8","11 November 2005"," The Fate of Rebels
","Seeing it again, nine years after its release, you can't help being struck by how familiar things are: the pale blue cast of the photography, the distinctive special effects, the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit, the clank of bullet against armor, the shaky camera, the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield, the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt, the attention to period detail, the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward moments.<br/><br/>All of this is familiar now because it's been so often aped, often in strong films like ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Blackhawk Down"". I doubt that anyone could make an ""ordinary"" war film anymore. Slow, cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like ""Platoon."" If you're going to make a war movie now, Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the bogie you have to match. It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies.<br/><br/>And what an innovation this movie was. Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years, because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated. If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags, tinkling a little bell, and crying ""Unclean, unclean."" ""Saving Private Ryan""'s subject is less controversial. First, the enemy really WAS our enemy. (Germany declared war on the USA first, not the other way around.) Second, well -- we won, didn't we? But it is probably more original in its details. And candid too. A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict, and the German wins! And not by cheating either! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest. He does not gloat or smile. It's no tennis game to the German, but a deadly necessity, just as it is for the American soldier. ""Relax,"" the German pants in a low voice, ""it's very simple,"" as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest. The scene is phenomenally stark.<br/><br/>The most complex character is Upham's. The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles, performing impossible feats of bravery. This is precisely what the Germans are doing too. But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies. The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character, but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes. He translated, was almost run over by a tank, ran across open spaces under fire, and carried ammunition. But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side, only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility, a fundamental mammalian trait which -- not having been in Upham's place ourselves -- we can condemn him for.<br/><br/>Maybe nobody can define an ""anti-war movie."" They ALL claim to be anti-war movies. How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation? To many people, an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood. Put Steven Segal in combat boots. Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line. But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win, as indeed we do in ""Saving Private Ryan"". (The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue.) All war movies, even those depicting a ""defeat"" like Pearl Harbor, seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan: ""No matter how sneaky or noble they may be, they can't whip us."" I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage -- in Hollywood -- to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy. It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as ""A Bridge Too Far."" And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in ""Saving Private Ryan."" That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives. What? We LOSE? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through ""Psycho."" Don't miss ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a milestone at the time."

","For once the hype surrounding a Spielberg film proves accurate: the first half-hour of the film, which shows the WWII Allied invasion of Normandy, is every bit as powerful as you've heard, a knock-you-flat piece of film-making that surpasses every other cinematic image of war's hell. Unfortunately, D-Day as such has absolutely nothing to do with the story of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: once this brilliant sequence is over, we are left with a highly sentimental, tiresomely repetitive, and completely unoriginal film that drags on and on to an extremely obvious conclusion.<br/><br/>The story concerns a young man (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in battle, leaving him as his parents' only surviving child. Top brass decide that Pvt. Ryan must be sent home--but they are not entirely sure where he is in war-torn Europe. Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is accordingly snatched up from the D-Day battle and along with a handful of men is sent to find Ryan and bring him back in one piece--and at this point the film pretty much comes to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>Hanks once again proves why he is among Hollywood's most bankable stars: like James Stewart, he has an everyman quality sure to appeal to most viewers--but although he remains as likable as ever, the script really doesn't give Hanks much to work with, and neither he nor his co-stars are greatly memorable. Indeed, once the opening battle sequence ends the film becomes so slow and so repetitive that you could easily nip outside, cut the lawn, and come back in to find you've not missed anything at all. Final word? The opening battle scene is worth the movie, but don't think you're missing anything if you can't stay awake for the end.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","There is a line, however fine, between cinematic masterpiece and good filmmaking.  Though I believe ""Private Ryan"" is neither, I would definitely place it in mediocre standing towards the latter category.  It is a questionably solid example of a type of filmmaking known as realism; that is, ""what"" is more important than ""how.""  Notice the lack of character development and the absence of closeness with organized plot.  Most movies today, whether they be masterpieces or not, are at least cinematic. ""Private Ryan"" should not have been marketed like these other films.  It is not cohesive, nor is it engaging.  It is meant to shock us into believing that this is how it was in WWII.  Therein lies it's merit.  Spielberg should have promoted it this way: ""My film is a realistic recreation of difficult and dramatic events, not a 'flick.'""  He should have shown it in art houses and college classrooms.  I wish that I could say his isolated attempt to engage audiences with realism was precise, but alas, I must also note that Speilberg's idea of realism is off-base.  The movie, to me, seemed technically poor in some spots with inconsistent lighting and obvious computer manipulation.  However, the real problem with the format of the film lies in it's breaches of realism.  We get glimpses of character analysis with the very plastic opening and ending scenes in the cemetery. In addition, the inner scene in a crumbling old church (beautiful images out of place) where the young medic remembers his mother, lets us journey far too deeply within the mind and soul for realism.  On a more positive note, the acting was superb all around.  If Speilberg has accomplished anything with ""Private Ryan,"" he has revealed the strengths of some outstanding young actors."

","Steven Spielbergs, Saving Private Ryan has some of the best directing of all time, one of the greatest performances of all time from Tom Hanks and truly is one of the greatest films of all time as well as the greatest war film ever made. The opening scene alone makes this movie a masterpiece it's just the perfect way to set the stage for the threat and brutality of war and showing the solider who fought in it to be human beings who are just as terrified as anyone else would be in the same situation. But the film doesn't stop after that the hunt for Private Ryan is incredibly investing because you understand the reasons as to why even if you don't agree with them you understand them perfectly. The fact that the main characters choose to address the somewhat unfair nature of picking one particular solider to go home out of the thousands was a very good decision because you can't help but see their point of view and understand them more. Another good decision was the fact that we don't meet Private Ryan until about 2/3 of the way through the film it puts you in the characters difficult situation of finding one solider out of thousands. Like is said before Tom Hanks is truly amazing in this movie he gives his greatest performance in my opinion and one of the greatest of all time. A lot rides on Matt Damon as Private Ryan in this film because he has to come across as innocent enough and likable enough to justify all the hard ship and death that the characters go through in order to find him but he doesn't, Ryan doesn't want to leave and feels immense guilt for all that has been done in his name and this makes him a much more compelling character. While the opening scene on Normandy Beach is still the films best action sequences there are plenty of other amazing ones because they feel so real you know the danger these characters face when they charge into battle, war isn't glorified in this movie it's shown for what it is and nothing more. Tom Hanks final words to Ryan ""Earn This"" is haunting and forces the viewer to think about how they would earn such a gift of life and creates for a truly emotional last scene with Ryan which is the perfect ending to this masterpiece. <br/><br/>There are few films that are more universally beloved than Saving Private Ryan for good reasons it does everything that not only a war movie should do but movies as a whole. <br/><br/>A+/100%"

","I had heard about the near 30 minute opening scene, how graphic and scary it was. I had actually dreamed about these scene before watching this film, and there an all too haunting identity to it. This was D day, a.k.a the battle of Normandy, where those small navy boats came onto the shores, and the soldiers were picked off like chickens at a shooting gallery. Many didn't make it ashore, where others that made it ashore, became bloody graphic examples of what this deadly and horrific war was like. This is the most scariest and bloodiest scene I've seen in a war film, where it's near thirty minute duration as it violently depicted what went down, in depth, highly benefited, but made the rest of the other film drop, or seem standard, but I mean that, only in contrast, to the war sequence, which really set the bar high, in one sense. The scene prior to this, in the cemetery, which comes back at the end, makes this story only the more heartbreaking, as we view a sea of graves, just to show you, how shockingly easy the lives of these boys were lost. Now moving on, Captain John Miller (Hanks) assigns a squad to track down one Private Ryan, risking the lives of his squad for this one guy. There are more shockingly violent bits in this too, the atmosphere in the last thirty, resembling that of the ruins in Full Metal Jacket, which unlike that, this one remarkably dodged an R certificate. What surprised me, acting wise, was Vin Diesel as one of Hanks squad, who unfortunately buys it early in the piece, while Hanks wasn't bad, but I have seen better from him, while Barry Pepper again steals their thunder. I like Ted Danson's brief performance too, as another squad captain we bump into on our search for that one party, where his two other brothers didn't make it. I'll be frank, SPR has a very unsettling and frightening aura to it, like I've never felt in any other war film. Another way of saying this, is in the how ""easy to die"" scenario which which I've never felt stronger as in this. Spielberg, again, has pulled off something respectfully and undeniably brilliant, but as someone who's created the most scariest war film, I've ever seen, he should be widely commended, where this film should of walked away with the best film Oscar."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies that you can watch with regular intervals of time, and even if you've seen it multiple times and am familiar with the storyline, the movie is solid enough to be watched over and over, and keeps on being entertaining.<br/><br/>The story, quickly summarized, is about a small squad of soldiers during the 2nd World War who are given a mission to find private Ryan in war-torn Europe after having survived the D-Day onslaught at Omaha Beach.<br/><br/>What makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" good, is a combination of multiple things. First, of course, is the storyline. But also the way it is filmed, which puts the audience right in the midst of the action. Most importantly, though, is the more than impressive cast who perform above and beyond the call of duty so to speak, no pun intended.<br/><br/>The action is formidable and impressive, showing that war is brutal and bloody. And it is presented in a very realistic manner, again adding to the conviction of the entire movie.<br/><br/>The cast list for ""Saving Private Ryan"" was impressive. And there is a number of actors who really prove their acting talents and break out of the stereotypical roles and genres they tend to cling to. Tom Hanks, of course, is the center of the movie and he fitted so well into the role and the movie. Usually I am not particularly fond of Tom Sizemore, but he was perfect for this movie and did a great job. Ted Danson was a breath of fresh air, and he was a great addition to the movie, as were Paul Giamatti. Barry Pepper was phenomenal in his role and brought a good amount of flavor to the movie. However, for me, it was Jeremy Davies who was the most outstanding of all in the movie, proving once again what a phenomenal character actor he is.<br/><br/>And it is always a plus when Germans actually do speak German in a World War 2 movie, and not have those awful German accents added when they in fact are speaking English.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie experience that everyone should have, at least once. It is an impressive and very entertaining movie to say the least."
"marinesangiorgio","5","2","5","12 May 2014"," Review Saving Private Ryan
","Living the war with Private Ryan.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a fantastic film by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodatin colors which was produced in 1998 in America. It's a wonderful war, drama and action film about World War II. We find such well-known actors as Tom Hanks (playing the role of Captain John Miller), Tom Sizemore (playing the role of Sergeant Michael Horvath), Edward Burns (as Private Reiben), Barry Pepper (as Private Jackson), Matt Damon (as the role of Private Ryan), Adam Goldberg (as Private Mallish) and Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo.<br/><br/>While the Allied Force land to Omaha Beach, Miller has to lead his platoon behind the enemy lines for a dangerous mission : find and return safe and sound Private James Francis Ryan, who's got three brothers who died in the fight within three days. While the platoon progresses on enemy territory, Miller's men wonder themselves : is it necessary to risk the life of eight men to save the only one from it ? The acting presence of the actors is successful, we feel different emotions with actors, the pain when, for instance, two policemen announce to Mrs. Ryan that her three sons are dead. There is no dialogue and it makes us understand that there are no words to talk about death. We can't put some words, some ""good"" words not to destroy somebody to soften the pain. Steven Spielberg Reveals that. We can see this old woman falling down on the ground, devastated and this scene tear our heart. Sometimes, the camera zooms on a soldier's face and we feel deeply in our chest that they are petrified and they transmit this feeling very well.<br/><br/>This film is visually breath-taking, because of the landscapes and the sets are so realistic that we lose ourselves in them and live , discover the atrocities of the war at the same time as the soldiers. We follow them, we belong to the platoon. And on top of that, sometimes we are surprised to hear an explosion, to see the ground explode as fireworks, as if it were next to us. It permits the spectator to live the war as never. We are both an actor and a soldier.<br/><br/>The story line is down-to-earth : first, there is no love story like in ""Pear Harbor"" which gives a ""sweet side"" to the story. Here, there are only blood, bravery, brotherhood, fights and a duty to fulfill. It permits the spectator to really know what happened during D-Day. Moreover, even the good characters die, some scenes are violent, for instance, when a German stabs a Jew very slowly to make him suffer because it's important to say that during World War II, Germans tried to eliminate all the Jews : it's called a genocide. This film doesn't hide the reality of war.<br/><br/>But this beautiful and fantastic film reveals something about soldiers during World War II : they were both loving and ruthless. They are presented as survivors and heroes (soldiers are always filmed with the high angle shot except when they are crying or dying because at this moment they are weak), respectful men, brave because they face danger even if they are afraid because they are willing to fulfill their duty for their country, wives and children. And we can see this at the beginning of the film when the American soldiers land to Normandy. Tom Hanks appears totally lost, his helmet on the floor, he discovers the nightmare of war. He could have given up, but we can finally see a light of determination on his eyes and all of a sudden, he catches his helmet and put it on his head : he really wants to achieve his duty. He's courageous. Soldiers also appear self-sacrificing and brotherhood is highlighted in this film. Because they landed together and they will come back home together, no matter what The music by John Williams contributes to release feelings deep in the chest of the spectator. And music is useful to carve the image of the soldier. We have a patriotic music when, for instance, a soldier talks about his life at home with his family, to show that they are heroes and that they will come back home or to show that they had to leave them behind to accomplish their duty for the country. So the spectator is totally overwhelmed with feelings thanks to music which makes soldiers appear both brave and heart-broken because they miss their family. And we can identify ourselves to them ; it's a very moving film which turns our hearts upside down.<br/><br/>This film received two awards : in 1999, Steven Spielberg got a Golden Globe for the Best Director of a Motion Picture with ""Saving Private Ryan"". Then, in 1999, the film ""Saving Private Ryan"" received a Golden Globe for the best Motion Picture. Moreover, the film received some good critics : The New York Times said ""This film simply looks at war as if war had not been looked at before."" Which was very positive. In The city Review, Carter B. Horsley said ""With extreme gore, deep sincerity, fabulous cinematography and great acting, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a stupendous movie."".<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a film which remains important in time, it echoes to the past, without lies. It presents World War II soldiers as self-sacrificing heroes and they can be fathers, brothers too : they have a heart. ""Saving Private Ryan"" will never stop moving us and make us admire what soldiers did, to help us to live in the world that we know nowadays.<br/><br/>By Sangiorgio Marine."

","Many things are flawed in this fiction, which seems to be far away from reality. This does not touch at any point. Better than ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" are ""the Pianist"", ""Downfall"", and even ""Apocalypse Now"". And even the TV series of ""The Pacific"" is a lot better. I am not a historian, so I may not be 100% correct in many of my thoughts. But in my opinion the kind of sentiments that have been shown in this movie by the military and Military General --- is unbelievable, and somehow ridiculous. Especially if it is related to World War 2, and when America is just getting up from the great depression. Why one boy is so important who had been admitted to the Army to serve his country. Now Army wants to protect this Baby!!! Funny. Every soldier has a Mom and Wife and family. At many times when the soldiers should shoot the enemy, they are letting him walk away in the name of POW. That kind of kindness never happens in reality. And I listened a lot about the opening 30 minutes scene, that it is really fantastic. But it was horrible. The opening scene of ""Shooter"" was much more realistic and exciting. Why the Army will land on the beach in such a suicidal way, for the massacre of their own men??? This is just a good action movie like Black Hawk Down, or Matt Damon's Green Zone."
"Andy-296","6","2","5","2 March 2011"," Sentimental film about D-Day has both flaws and merits
","I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair."

","I can't claim that Spielberg has overwhelmed me on many an occasion. I tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and up-beat for my world-view. But here, he delivers. The first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to know(and I mean that in the most positive way possible), and few will manage to avoid being pulled in, right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll. The production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest. The direction is spot-on(there's some beautiful underplaying going on here), and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly right(there was perhaps one bit near the end that just it is not quite there). The pacing is flawless, this never loses your interest(in spite of being close to three hours) nor moves so fast that the audience is lost. The acting is impressive(this thing's got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these), even Mark Vincent(even if he'd prefer we called him Vin Diesel) isn't bad(yeah, I know...I could kick myself, and no thanks, Amy). The realism is an accomplishment; the situations, the reactions, the people, everything, almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing you'd swear someone colorized actual footage or something. There is some Hollywood herein, however, but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity, it's a very, very minor complaint. Cinematography and editing are just amazing... they really bring the scenes to life, and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there. This has got atmosphere to spare. There is a lot of violence and language. The writing is remarkable, and many details are magnificent. The story isn't the most engaging ever in an anti-war film, but it certainly is good. I recommend this to any fan of war movies, just do realize that this holds little back in its depiction. 8/10"

","Because I have younger siblings, most war films I have seen are the least realistic ones that are just fairly decent (Tears of the Sun, Behind Enemy Lines). Upon finally having my siblings out of the house, I was able to watch it. Let me tell you, I was blown away; the movie was incredible.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes are all about D-Day, the bloodiest battle I have ever seen on screen. It was very realistic and accurate; the dead and the wounded were lying around everywhere, getting plowed down as the ships opened. Not too many survived. One of the survivors is one of my all-time favorite actors, Tom Hanks. He is affected by the battle severely, and he recruits men afterward to hunt down Private Ryan, whose other brothers have been killed in combat.<br/><br/>The next two hours show us the complete trek to finding Private Ryan and developing all the characters to their fullest. Every character has his own personality, and you learn so much about each and every character. Each one does a great job at showing what type of person they are. Along the way, they have to fight off some Nazis and two men are killed. This effects each and every soldier in Tom Hank's squadron, and the life of war is seen taking its toll on each man, emotionally and mentally breaking them and hurting them.<br/><br/>Every time a character has a meltdown, it is very powerful. The moments are calm and slow, but not soft on the heart. And yet they must press on through the washed-up world until they find Private Ryan and have a historic showdown in cinema history.<br/><br/>Heroes die. Men are wounded and left for dead. Only some survive. The final battle is merciless and although not as bloody as the D-Day Invasion in the beginning, its more difficult to watch because more men die and you know each and every one. What makes it even sadder is that it was all real.<br/><br/>Even my Grandpa, who was in several battles in the Korean War and held as a prisoner for two years in Korea, said the movie was fairly realistic. Steven Spielberg, cinematic genius of the 20th Century, is not afraid to show the blood and gore and hammer disturbingly devastating pain into the hearts of the viewer. And after the movie you find yourself silent, quietly honoring the heroes of WWII. That is what Saving Private Ryan did. 9.8/10."

","Reading several of the negative comments about this film, I concluded that they could be grouped into a handful of categories, the pedantic, the America haters, and those who find innate fault with the Spielbergian tendency to manipulate the audience. For those in the Spielberg hating camp, I would ask, What do you expect? Audience manipulation is every bit a hallmark of a Spielberg film as a sappy ending is to a Capra film or existential Jewish angst is to an Allen film.<br/><br/>As for the other two categories, it doesn't pretend to be an historically accurate film, it is a dramatization. For the people that feel that Spielberg depicts the Americans as purely good or the Germans as purely evil, I would ask you to go back to two scenes, one where GIs summarily execute a surrendering German, and second, the look of compassion in the eyes of the German sniper when the GI he has just shot is trying to hand off a letter to his family.<br/><br/>That said, I would focus on the technical aspects of the film. The initial scene of the invasion looks just like first hand accounts of the Omaha beach invasion I have read. Veterans of the landing who have seen the film have attested to the authentic look and feel of the film. Perhaps what I find most striking is Spielberg's use of old style cameras and film stock that give the movie an old newsreel type flavor.<br/><br/>I won't argue with anyone who accuses the actual mission as being unrealistic--I would say that the mission itself is secondary to the storytelling art. It takes little vignettes assembled from stories I have heard over and over from WW2 vets and tells them succinctly.<br/><br/>Hank's character suffers from PTSD, known then as ""battle fatigue"" ; Vin Diesel's character was the guy who forgot for one second to keep his head down and it cost him; the interpreter overcomes his initial cowardice after it costs his buddy's life; overcome with emotion, another character wants to summarily execute an unarmed German, but is talked out of it; two opposing soldiers who have lost their arms attack each other hand to hand. All of these stories are archetypal and universal among veterans who survived the war.<br/><br/>These characters represent the amalgam of experience of all combat soldiers; similar to Platoon, its unrealistic to believe that one small group of soldiers experienced them all, but as a dramatization the story is excellently filmed and told."
"jzappa","10","2","5","31 October 2006"," A Work of Art
","In Hollywood war film tradition, epic warfare orbits on the actions of already acquainted heroes. In Steven Spielberg's judicial and exacting masterwork, thousands of horror-struck and nauseated men, most of them green to battle, are chucked into the grimace of devastating German fire. The opening sequence is as detailed as any war footage. In the blood-soaked opening steps, the landing forces and the enemy never connect eye to eye, but are just faceless clots of men who have been commanded to shoot at one another until one side is overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Spielberg's camera makes no comprehension of the engagement. That is the function of his approach. For the individual soldier on the beach, the landing was a cacophony of clamor, sludge, gore, entrails and morbidity. The scene is filled with various nongermane fragments of chronology, as when a soldier has his arm blown off.<br/><br/>This landing sequence is essential to form the remoteness between those who give the order that Pvt. Ryan be saved, and those who are dictated to do the saving. For Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, the landing at Omaha has been a melting pot of crossfire. For the Army Chief in his Washington office, war feels more secluded and nationalistic. His advisors doubt the judgment and even the plausibility of a mission to save Ryan. That sets up the second act of the film, in which Miller and his men infiltrate spryly inflamed French terrain, while entertaining defiant ideas about the prudence of the assignment. All of Miller's men have served with him before, save for Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), the translator, who speaks excellent German and French but has never fired a rifle in rage and is frightened nearly to the point of his morality's deterioration. The war was fought by civilians just like him, whose lives had not readied them for the brass tacks of combat.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is often thought of as a throwaway name to refer to when speaking of the greatest directors of all time, mainly because his movies are often romanticized, Hollywood blockbusters and not hard, tough, cool grungy stuff. Spielberg, while he demonstrates a mastery of pace and story crescendo that should be taught in every film school in the world, proves with Saving Private Ryan, not to mention with the more recent Munich, that he is capable of true grit and shocking realism.<br/><br/>The story begins with the most gut-wrenchingly violent battle scene I've seen in any war film. This prolonged sequence depicts D-Day in the most realistic possible way, not only with gore and violence but also with the ambient violence that must be dealt with in moments of hasty contemplation and desperate but emotionally diluted dialogue. The film then segues into a story that applies the deeply affecting theme of the mother. What makes the film so profound is its core drawing of sympathy from the audience for the common boy's mother and the pain and worry they endure in times of war that we can only imagine.<br/><br/>His cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who also shot Schindler's List, brings a newsreel texture to a lot of the footage, but that's rather elementary next to his most substantial stroke, which is to make everything manifest lucid. Following the meticulous pandemonium of the landing scenes, Kaminski handles the attack on the machine gun nest, and an extensive climax concerning the fortification of a bridge, in a way that keeps us aligned. It's not simply men shooting at one another. We learn the plan of the action, the subtle victory of optimism over despair, the spontaneity, the corresponding locations of the soldiers.<br/><br/>Hanks has a subtle sense of drama in his personal commitment to the role of Capt. Miller, an English teacher who has outlived ordeals so overwhelming that he doubts if his wife will even place him. With a reserved, collected, and even exacting bearing, his hands nonetheless quiver. He is on the verge of breakdown, but he does his best since that is his duty. All of the actors, all the countless noteworthy faces, playing the men under him are compelling, somewhat on account of Spielberg defying the inducement to make them stereotypical caricatures in the custom of WWII movies, and makes them emphatically everyday.<br/><br/>Everything approaches the third act, when Private Ryan is found, and the soldiers determine what to do next. Spielberg and his screenwriter, Robert Rodat, have done a penetrating and personally transcendent thing: They have made a philosophical film about war in effect thoroughly in circumstances of action. Their sweeping ode says things about war that are as intricate and demanding as any essayist could likely assert, and does it with expansive, forceful imagery, with brutality, with coarseness, with movement, with rapport. It is conceivable to get across even the most sensitive notions in the most elementary words and actions, and that's what Spielberg does with keen instincts, because he signifies his impressions in visceral reactions, not words. Steven Spielberg is as technically accomplished as any filmmaker alive, and due to his mammoth eminence, he has admittance to any asset he entails. Both of those facts are relevant to the punch of this seamless period piece. He knows how to express his emotional fervor about men in combat with utmost moralistic intensity, and he has the apparatus, the greenback and the running dogs to make it happen."

","Winner of five Academy Awards® including Best Director, the film also captured Oscars® for Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound and Sound Effects Editing. More than 70 critics and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, Dallas Ft-Worth and Great Britain named the film Best Picture of the Year, while the Los Angeles, Toronto and Broadcast Film Critics honored it with both Best Picture and Best Director awards. In addition, Spielberg received his third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion ""The Spirit of Normandy"" Award, a USO Merit Award from the USO of Metropolitan Washington, as well as the highest civilian public service award from the Department of the Army. Selected for more than 160 Top Ten lists, Saving Private Ryan's other honors include Golden Globes for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director, the Producers Guild of America Award and ten nominations from the British Academy Film Awards. Saving Private Ryan was the top-grossing motion picture of 1998.<br/><br/>Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage.<br/><br/>As I have watched this movie, I was astounded and amazed with this brilliant and perfectly made film. I think no war movie can replace this one. While watching it, it really seems like you're with them in a real war. The plot and story are great! You'll really feel what war is. It's sad, emotional, and historical. You will realize that life is important even with your enemies. Unity and courage are the morals of this movie. I insist you watch this movie. You'll surely enjoy and watch it over and over and over again! I'll give this perfect 10 rating."

","Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and for good reason. When released on video several years ago, I watched about the first 5 minutes and turned away, with no stomach for the blood and graphic violence in the opening scene...with the release of the special edition DVD and it's reasonable price and many accolades, I had to buy it to add to my collection. And am I glad I did. First Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks were absolutely superb as director and actor, respectively. No one in tinseltown could have done a better job with a war movie. And Spielber's objective was met with me anyway....know why we celebrate ""Memorial Day"" and ""Veterans Day""...this movie will explain why... The cinematography in this film won the Oscar and rightly so!! I watched the special features and Spielberg stated he extracted something like 60% of the color to allow for more of a dated type film appearance, to look like footage....and it worked...it made the movie so much more believable...and bring you to the time and place and the horrors of war and heroes we hear about but never meet. The viewer is spared no brutality, no violence of war...it's frightening but gripping, hard to watch but also hard to look away....<br/><br/>There are many tearful moments in this movie, so it's definitely a ""have a tissue nearby"" film. Sad, poignant, profound moments that (if you're human i.e. compassionate) will force you, however subliminally to remember what honoring our fallen heroes and the survivors of war is all about. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg will bring you into the lives of the soldiers of WWII. And this movie should awaken the viewer who sees it now to the honor that our soldiers from any way, whether it's WWI, WWII, Vietnam (especially) and now Iraq, DESERVE to be honored for their losses..for they're lack of tomorrows are for our todays!<br/><br/>A 10/10!! Kudos to Spielberg! This will join the movie classics of all time!!"

","This is one of the best war movies that I have ever seen. It had a wonderful plot and was based on a true story. It not only entertains us it also gives us a small history lesson: What the war was like How many people gave their lives to save this country The weapons that they used All in all I would give this movie a Ten out of Ten and proclaim it the best war movie ever. Also the actual way they fought back then was very interesting. Like the last scene in the movie, when they fought the Germans to keep a hold of the bridge that they were protecting. Even the character that were fictional appeared to have real lives and actually participate in the war. There was only one thing that I did not like and it was not enough to bring my vote down from a ten, and it was the fact that some of the lines that they used were a little bit crummy. ""O my god they shot me"" while he was still moving, first scene of the movie. This was one of about three lines that I really do not believe should have been included in the final script. Otherwise this was still the best movie that I have ever seen in my entire life."
"JoseFrancis","Null","2","5","1 October 2004"," Nothing but American rubbish..
","Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the ""glorious, morally superior American armed forces"", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all ""good guys"". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the communist threat and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the ""Red Hunt"", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities."
"marc242","Null","2","5","8 March 2004"," good opening, goes downhill from that
","Well, the movie starts off with a credible depiction of D-Day, not shying away from the insane violence and carnage. very shocking and puts you right in the middle of WW2 combat. Unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there. The production quality is still on a high-level,but the story itself isn`t. Spielberg is too fond of his hollywood-type heroism, and spices his otherwise gritty tale with unecessary blandness. The worst part is the display of the german troops. They are displayed as mindless thugs and not as humans. Even much older movies like ""Battle for Arnheim"", portray germans in a more acceptable way.<br/><br/>Enemies like the Japanese,Germans,Vietkong and later on the Russians (former WW2 Allies !) are always shown in US-Warmovies as pure Cannonfodder for the Americans.<br/><br/>Back to ""Ryan"". Spielberg has a fixed mindset about germans, probably heavily influenced by the comic-book nazis of his own ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". (which is a good and entertaining movie btw.) He doesn`t trust his story and thinks he has to pump it up with some patriotic music and ""heroic"" dialogue.<br/><br/>Just terrible. I was very dissapointed. Why is it not possible to make a movie at least trying to show both sides, from a soldiers perspective ?<br/><br/>ah well..."

A lot of movies has been made on that subject and there are lots of true stories that deserve to be told without such sugarcoated style. Maybe if Spielberg had made a remake of ""The longest day"" with the production used for this movie, he would have made a great movie. He wouldn't have to resort to  the predictable last scene when Pvt Ryan salutes John Miller's grave."

The scene is the one where the sniper gets shoot through the scope. TERRIBLE. The story is so predictable and the character development it poor. Tisk Tisk.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks. His worst acting performance to date. Compare this performance to his best work (Turner and Hooch) and you see that his acting is terrible and embarrassing.

"leplatypus","1","3","11","4 April 2012"," Shutting up private Ryan (Cinematheque)
","Among all Spielberg's movies that I saw at the festival, this is the only one when I felt nothing leaving out except being disappointed and angry. Worst, I felt like this as soon as the first scene. Seeing this old man walking alone with his wife and family trotting behind was like a slap at my face. At this old age and having survived the war, it was extremely selfish for him to act like this. Having watched buddies killed and thus never experienced their family life, it was like he haven't learn anything of this trauma, for him or for them.<br/><br/>Next, we are thrown at D-Day. It's the more interesting part of the movie: the value of any single soldier's life is dramatically visualized: those poor guys who got killed as soon as they opened the door of their boats are the true noble and courageous ones. They were sent to slaughter but they stick to their orders. For that matter, during WWI, a relative of my grand mother died the same way: In spite of being terribly myopic, he was among the first to be sent at the front and as it's above all rabbles, he lost his glasses and was killed immediately. Personally, I would never have behaved like them because I would have gone awol as much to not be killed as to not kill. At this moment, Spielberg's takes you in the guts and he may be the first director to show how bloody and stupid the war is. <br/><br/>But as his trademark and sensibility lead him to find hope in this complete darkness, the story becomes a rescue mission. It could have been moving but the characters of this platoon is rather a band of capricious and lunatic soldiers: one wants to hang on with a child, the other left a German alive, the one that killed them later and finally, we met again with Mr. Ego who doesn't want to leave because he has a bridge to defend. Sure, as they stay there, they got all killed. Well, it was too much for me: I don't understand how Spielberg wanted the audience to relate with such stupidity . A life later, this private Ryan remains totally shameful as he rejects his family and I really wonder if he should have been left behind instead.<br/><br/>Pairing: ""1941"" a good laugh at WWII but not for the same reasons."

The actual Omaha beach scene at the start is the only real historic event, the rest is all fictional. Thoug I cannot reveal why it is not all fictional I can still tell you that whatever the movie describes and/or you think it is, war is not always actually like what you see.<br/><br/>War is gruesome, painful, depressing (x 9222845363), terrible, and basically it is one of the most horrible things that can ever happen. Dying is not horrible, as everyone is meant to die, but the pain and agony and all the other things that go along with war is.<br/><br/>So basically I'd like to stick to more historically accurate movies.<br/><br/>Also, America FORGOT (OR MAYBE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO INCLUDE) THE COUNTRIES THAT DID MOST OF THE DIRTY WORK!!!!!

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is, more or less, a character study, not of only one person, but of U.S. philosophy. Why send a squad to find one guy and send him home? The premise is that the mother had already lost 3 of her 4 sons to the War (World War II, or the Great Patriotic War), and that she should not be expected to lose her 4th and final son to the War. She had lost 75% of her children, and shouldn't have to lose 100% of her children.<br/><br/>However, what about the mother who watches her only child go off to war? If he dies, she already lost 100% of her children to war. It's an issue that comes up many times in the film, and we get to see every man in the squad fight with this issue in his own mind during the film.<br/><br/>The ""Private Ryan"" character (Matt Damon) fights with this issue too. He's already been designated as an object of hatred and contempt by the entire squad, before they even meet him. He understands that the mission is both justified and ludicrous, at the same time. He didn't ask to be ""rescued"", and he doesn't want to be rescued, but he seems to understand why he should be rescued. He represents the feeling that the USA shouldn't lose all of its children to the War.<br/><br/>The main characters are a brilliant mix...<br/><br/>The captain, who is fulfilling his duty to his country in its time of need.<br/><br/>The sergeant... a crusty old lifetime war veteran... the kind of guy who actually eats MREs because he likes the taste.<br/><br/>The sniper... a soldier who feels that his God gave him an amazing gift, specifically for the purpose of defeating the German army.<br/><br/>The Jew... who joined the army specifically to fight against the anti-Jewish Nazis.<br/><br/>The ""Tough Guy""... an almost Mafia-like character from New York City, who has no problem with getting in the face of his Sergeant, and even his Captain.<br/><br/>The ""Good Guy""... who initially seems like a Tough Guy, but ends up being a soft-hearted guy who royally screws up by trying to save the life of a little girl in a war zone, at an inopportune moment.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for Giovanni Ribisi's character in the film. The character just didn't seem realistic to me. However, the rest of the cast is a total Home Run.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of capturing the horrors and realism of first-person warfare, and the story is awesome, too. Surely, one of Spielberg's finest films."

","Spoilers, Ho! The first scene in the Normandy cemetery of Saving Private Ryan is enough to put me on my knees and from there it gets even more emotional as we see the faces of the troops about to be the first to set foot on Omaha Beach which has since become a synonym of hellish warfare. It's hard for me to watch anything about vets of WWII without losing it. Just the damn trailer for Saving Private Ryan deserves an Academy Award. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The acting is great to not-so-great depending on the actors (and non-actors). I think you call it ""screen presence"" wherein you like seeing some people while others make you cringe. Great: Tom Sizemore, Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovani Ribisi, Matt Damon, Adam Goldberg. I won't go into detail on those I didn't like but to contrast the cast of this movie just take a look at Band of Brothers. I loved every character in that series. <br/><br/>I just jotted down a few thoughts as I watched this classic for the umpteenth time: <br/><br/>The initial fight for the beach was about as intense as movies about war can be.<br/><br/>Although a visual masterpiece, the scene of the official car going to the home of the slain soldiers was a bit over-the-top as far as Americana. She should have been baking an apple pie. Any home in American, any crappy flat in New York would have served the same purpose without being quite as maudlin.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel couldn't get killed too soon for me. Had he met his maker during the opening credits would have been better but this was soon enough.<br/><br/>There is no freaking way they would have let that German soldier go. He would have picked up the first available weapon and continued fighting.<br/><br/>The pansy translator kid was terrible, both he and his role. I didn't like anything about him and the film would have been better without this character. There is a right and a wrong way to do smarmy.<br/><br/>Dying sucks, we get it already. I just thought they over-did this a bit. I realize this is a movie about one of the bloodiest wars ever but the long, drawn-out death scenes became corny and not dramatic.<br/><br/>There were a couple of great moments in the film. When Tom Hanks sort of splits through the tension verging on mutiny with the story of where he is from and what he did was the best of scene in the film. Matt Damon's dialogue about the last night with his brothers could have used a little work (the story about his brother trying to screw some ugly chick in the barn). It was a poor bit of writing."
"ritonobono","3","2","6","11 November 2015"," There's no ""saving"" this movie...
","I knew going in and it being Spielberg that there wasn't going to be much variety, but wow there is almost none. Most of the movie is focused around of course ""saving"" Private Ryan. And yet it almost feels like the movie is more about how much Spielberg is at his old tricks. Most of the characters are one dimensional and hardly get any development other than Tom Hanks who is as always golden. The worst of them though is Matt Damon (he's Pvt. Ryan). He's stereotypically arrogant and seems like the type of guy who's all talk and no walk. It makes him pretty much impossible to like and leaves you with the desire to shut off the movie once he's on the screen. As for the story, what story? Most of what should be story is hampered by more arguing and attempts at comedic, more lighthearted moments. In the middle of war? Really? And the film being nearly 3 hours feels so padded and stretched out that it's like watching a 90 minute movie in slow motion. So if you want my advice, skip this and rent Full Metal Jacket."
"paul2001sw-1","7","2","6","27 March 2010"," Competent but conventional
","There's a fairly standard narrative in war films today: that wars are hell, but that the men who fight them deserve our respect, and it's perhaps unsurprising that Stephen Spielberg's film about the Normandy landings essentially repeats the message. The movie's structure: an initial battle, an interlude, and then a concluding fight, is also typical; and background music, slow motion scenes and a present day top-and-tail to the story are added in to make sure that the audience knows what to think. In spite of this, it's not a bad film, fully depicting the chaotic horror of war and resisting the temptation to easily close at least some of its subplots; although on other occasions, it's too clear how a given tale is going to end. A bigger problem for me, however, was the absence of a character I could really care about: Tom Hanks's hero is just too heroic for me to care about, not in a silly way but a character for us to admire rather than for us to feel empathy for. Although a lengthy movie, it didn't feel like one; but in the end, I didn't feel moved by its respectful conclusion."

","Yes, this may sound like blasphemy, but yes, Saving Private Ryan (SPR) is better than Apocalypse Now. How exactly? Well, for one thing, while sharing some themes, SPR is just so much more moving than Apocalypse Now. and, at least SPR doesn't go on, and on, and on, and on. Don't get me wrong, I liked Apocalypse Now, but SPR just didn't leave you with the feeling that there's no hope for the world, it left you with the feeling that there's hope for the world, that there's hope for humanity. And that it may be easy to descend into the heart of darkness, it's just as easy to ascend into the heart of light.<br/><br/>And as I was saying from the beginning, about how SPR is more moving than AN, in the first 24 minutes I felt like crying. Watching all those people dying, imploding, exploding, being amputated, and etc. I realized, that had I been 18 in 1945, I could have been one of those people. And I further realized, that one person in that film represented 10 others, and that was just a softened version of the great D-Day Invasion.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan also brilliantly showed how the suits in Washington thought of their soldiers. As Risk (copyright by Parker Brothers and Hasbro Co.) pieces. preferring to send 19 or so soldiers to their death to satisfy an unhappy mother, than send them home.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is by far my most favorite war movie. (1. Saving Private Ryan. 2. Glory. 3. Apocalypse Now.) It has won 5 Oscars, deserved every single one, and more, and is one of the best movies out there."

","First of all I would like to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and historically it was right on the ball for the landings and the subsequent movement of the other American troops.<br/><br/>However, after doing a lot of research on D-Day, I was really disappointed in the way the filmmakers seemed to leave out important facts about the others who got involved in the war, primarily the British and the Canadians, who sent thousands of troops in to other beeches and didn't even get a mention. Another example of Hollywood feeding Americas ""We single handedly saved the world"" ego.<br/><br/>However, like I said, a fantastic film, great actors and a great pulsating story filled with some amazing war shots and some great dialogue between characters, ""Earn it!"".<br/><br/>Now i now this film was primarily about saving private Ryan and not so much about D-Day in depth, I think this is a fantastic opportunity for Hollywood to make an in-depth film about D-Day, by that I mean the intensive three year planning that had begun even before America joined the war, the RAF missions over Callais and other bluffs to make the Germans convicned the attack was coming there, even during the middle D-Day they were still convinced that another wave would hit elsewhere. And prehaps more about the thousands of paratroopers who took out the legendary Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of the morning to hold the entire post invasion operation together.<br/><br/>However, random tangent aside, I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in history, it is incredibly accurate in all the other area apart from where I mentioned.<br/><br/>I gave it 8 *"

","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands alongside SCHINDLER'S LIST as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements as a director. And just recently, I had the pleasure of re-discovering his EMPIRE OF THE SUN, and realized then how well he captures on film the horror and brutality of war without going in for stereotyped characters.<br/><br/>During the '40s, when war films were largely produced for propaganda purposes and for injecting much needed patriotism into all Americans while we fought Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese, we had films like A WALK IN THE SUN or GUADALCANAL DIARY or SO PROUDLY WE HAIL. All of them were fine, in their own way, but often resorted to creating Hollywood stereotypes among the characters, the soldiers and nurses who fought during the war.<br/><br/>Not true here. From the startling twenty-minute opening sequence on the D-day invasion, through the intricacies of inter-personal relationships among a disparate group of men, we never once feel we're watching stereotypes but real people. All of the performances are first-rate, beginning with TOM HANKS, whose everyman personality is put to excellent use here. Others too numerous to mention do great jobs in the large supporting cast.<br/><br/>No cheap heroics here, just a compelling war story, extremely well done and holding interest from beginning to end. Recommended highly.<br/><br/>Trivia note: John Williams' score is never intrusive enough to damage the stark reality of some of the most brutal scenes."

","Without a question one of the greatest films ever made (in my humble opinion). It's very sad gripping and often disturbing. Jaws was amazing but this is my favorite out of Steven Spielberg's films (i have not yet seen Schindler's list (but will soon). This film actually managed to make me shed a few tears at the end (it was very sad. this is EXTREMELY well made and brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg using great shots especially during the war scenes. This film will stay with you long after you have watched it, and it's very moving. Beware though if you have a weak stomach Don't watch this movie!. The scenes between Hanks and Damon were awesome and very touching. The plot was awesome but sending tons of soldiers just to find Private Ryan a lot of people had a problem with that but i loved it. this is now the 2nd war film i have seen and i will be seeing lots more VERY soon. this movie is EXTREMELY gory. we get a leg blown off, severed arm, HUNDREDS of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, one to the eye (cringe inducing) one to the neck that spurts TONS of blood, blood everywhere someone's guts falls out of someone's belly, as he tried to hold them in , very graphic surgery (you see guts intestines), more graphic surgery, blood keeps pouring from a gunshot wound (VERY bloody), badly wounded soldier, bloody corpses, TONS of people explode into pieces, arm's torso's and other severed limbs fly everywhere, hand bitten on, TONS of graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting, (one of the goriest films i have ever seen). The acting is no doubt Oscar worthy Tom Hanks gives a performance of a lifetime,and deserved an Oscar for his Incredible performance. he is incredible just incredible, he is EXTREMELY likable, and what he said to James Ryan near the ending, was very moving. He is one of the best actors out there Matt Damon gives a wonderful performance here as the young i liked him lots, in my opinion he is a very talented actor, him and Hanks had awesome chemistry together.Edawrd Burns is good here and did what he had to do well. Tom Sizemore was funny and did very well here i liked him lots.Jeremy Davies is very good he showed vulnerability and did great. Adam Goldberg does rock solid here as the tough guy of the bunch. Barry Peppers also did well. Giovani Ribsi did not have much to do. Vin Diesel was good in his limited screen time. Ted Danson has a cool cameo. Harrison Young does great as the older Ryan. Overall I can't recommend this movie enough you must see this as soon as possible if you haven't. ***** out of 5"
"Boba_Fett1138","10","2","6","1 June 2004"," The movie got me interested in WWII.
","Before I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I wasn't interested in anything WWII related. Every time there was a documentary on I would change the channel, I couldn't stand classics such as ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""The Eagle Has Landed"" and ""The Longest Day"", I even didn't liked ""Schindler's List"". And then I saw ""Saving Private Ryan""...<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is more than just an ordinary war movie. Its realism makes it important to watch for the entire world. It shows the horrors of war in a very direct way. It is mainly important to see for the young generation these days and those to come. Sure you can watch tons of documentaries and read dozens of books but watching this movie is the closest you can get to the real thing, it's that realistic.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes is a real wake up call. The Normandy invasion is really impressive and made very realistic with lots of noise and body parts flying around. The cinematography and the sound makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it. Yes, after that the movie becomes a bit slow but it never becomes uninteresting. The movie takes its time to build up the characters. As a result there follow some typical Spielberg sentiments but in this case I'll forgive him for that, I even forgive him for some of the American patriotism he puts in the movie.<br/><br/>The D-Day landing isn't the only impressive thing about this movie. All of the battle sequences are filmed in an unique and very realistic way. The final battle is very tense, especially in the beginning when the tension gets build up right before the battle begins and you can hear the tanks approaching while the men nervously await. My heartbeat went at least 3 times faster than normal.<br/><br/>I also like the portrayal of the German soldiers. In most other earlier movies they were portrayed as the ultimate bad guys that love to march and kill and follow every order they receive without thinking for them selves. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" they are more portrayed as just soldiers. Sure they do some bad things in the movie but so do the American soldiers, shooting surrendering Germans for instance. ""Saving Private Ryan"" show that there are no real good guys in war, which is very close to the truth I think.<br/><br/>The characters are very realistic with real emotions. It also doesn't matter in the movie if you're a main character or the most interesting character of the movie, just like in real life everybody is vulnerable. The characters are wonderfully portrayed by an at the time and still relatively unknown cast, with the exception of Tom Hanks and Matt Damon of course<br/><br/>The movie and its style set the standards for many later war movies to come but none of them comes really close to this masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The opening scene is one of the most difficult viewing experiences I have ever had. I almost turned it off because it was so real and horrifying. I heard vets walked out during this scene when it was in theaters for that reason. I BELIEVE IT! Anyway, the score for this movie was one of the best I've ever heard... such emotion portrayed through music... I love this! Every shot (with the camera, that is) is purposeful and amazing. Some of the best editing I've ever seen! The visual effects were definitely ahead of their time. Wow... just wow! A plot that is very different and a script that feel genuine.

This the Captain achieves; but it is more a matter of luck as Ryan survives on his own....!!
When the Captain takes his Squad on the Mission; and they come across a German Radar installation; he insists on attacking it, instead of going around it.as some of his men suggest.
Attacking it is inconsistent with his orders to retrieve Private Ryan.
In so doing the Captain loses one of his men; and could have lost more.
Later; when he finds Private Ryan; he allows the Private to insist they stay and defend the town from a German attack.

"gpeevers","9","1","2","1 April 2019"," Hard to Believe this did not Win the Oscar
","Incredibly harrowing and unrelenting look at the horrors of war filmed with hand held cameras and using film stock and lenses that give it both a documentary and historical feel in an attempt to give the audience some sort of visceral impression of what it might have been like to be there on the beaches of Normandy. The audience is dragged right into the film and with only a few slow scenes you soon discover that three somewhat grueling hours have passed.<br/><br/>Some of the characters are somewhat cliched, in that they are stereotypical for war movies which I think may be intentional on the part of Spielberg to give more impact to his vision by making the characters familiar to the audience. Further it is also somewhat reminiscent of other recent war movies like Platoon in it depictions of the horrors of war, but I though it went even a step further in that it never tries to make the combat in any way poetic. The music isn't used in the same way or does it rely on voice over's or any other cinematic tools to make the combat scenes any less horrifying.<br/><br/>I found this to be perhaps Tom Hank's best performance and although he would nominated for an Oscar he would not win, perhaps his two fairly recent Oscars had some effect. The rest of the cast is uniformly strong and effective, there are some great cameos and the film served to accelerate the careers of relative newcomers Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Edward Burns as well as some of the other more experienced cast members.<br/><br/>While I don't believe this was Spielberg's best (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List) and he does use a few unnecessary directorial tricks this is still a really great film that should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It's not a film for the faint of heart but it is a very powerful film that effectively delivers the directors vision. The film would secure Spielberg an Oscar for Best Director among its 5 wins and 11 nominations."

","After playing so many video games about WW2 it is incredible how the games capture only a piece of how WW2 was in comparison to this film which is incredibly accurate of how the soldiers had to deal with both the pain and torture of the war and mentally how it affected them as well. There is a reason why this film is classed as a Rated R film.<br/><br/>The plot follows a group of soldiers which are ordered to locate a private and return him home, over the course of the film you see this band of soldiers form a bond between them to the point where you could class them as a band of brothers that help each other through the horrors they see.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's directing of this film shows why he is a master in film-making, If he didn't win that Oscar for best director for this film it would be an absolute crime, in my opinion I would class this film in the top 10s of IMBD top 250 films not 27. To say that Tom Hanks who plays the lead role in the film did a brilliant role in portraying his character is a sheer understatement, the emotion his character has during the film is easily seen and it hits you hard.<br/><br/>The battles that the film shows is not shown as winning one town after another and moving on, they are a much more accurate portrayal of the war by showing it as the soldiers winning it street by street with each one being as hard fought to gain as the last. The way the towns are shown in this film being bombed and turned into just a pile of rubble is a great way of showing what the towns during WW2 were actually like. The cinematography in this film is brilliant and the sound editing perfectly captures the fear that was felt in WW2.<br/><br/>To class this film as just a film about WW2 is incredibly wrong, it is the closest depiction as to WW2 was actually like, and the closest to the terror the soldiers had to face, it is a masterpiece of a film."

","Saving Private Ryan was a heartfelt, explosive, gritty and violent war film that just knew what exactly happened on the events of WWII for the American allies. This movie was so forward, so riveting and so disturbing that it really made me look at my own military career and see how far we've come hundreds of years later. I cannot say that this film is inaccurate in anyway possible because it is just TOO accurate with the American men and women of the war. I was pleasantly impressed by how realistic the soldiers were and how each one had this unique story behind their enlistment, and prior life before deployment. The story revolves around saving just one man, but, anyone can see the true reason behind that. The movie was a huge success and I believe that reason was merely because of the fact that it truly acknowledges what happened to our soldiers and what they experienced overseas. As a soldier, this film speaks volumes and reaches miles to my heart. It is truly the greatest war film you can ever indulge yourself in. Because of how immersive and honest it is. Even if it's a violent, gory film, that's something people have to see to know just a percentage of what happens in combat and how it can change a man single handedly."

","As always, Spielberg at it's finest. In order for someone to be able to fully encapsulate all the emotions and little aspects involved in war, one has to be out of this war. All the scenes in the movie were crafted in such a way, that viewers get the ability to feel the psychology of those who go through war. Blood scenes including the cruelty of war give you the insight of real war, where everyone is ready to kill and fight till they die. Amazing work from the perspective of cinematography. However, the scenario is somehow weak. They could have picked a better one that will convey more meaning. Good movie, overall."
"cccockrell","10","1","2","24 November 2018"," Extremely Powerful, Intense, And Immersive Experience Involving Rangers Throughout/After The Normandy Landings (One Of The Greatest War Movies Of All Time!)
","Bravery, courage, and determination are some key terms that involve around this powerful look on the events during and after the Normandy Landings. As to having a more complex plot, Saving Private Ryan is a story about the mission being a man. If the soldiers think that going through terrible trouble is worth it, then audiences will experience (probably) the most immersive look on the subject of war. Steven Spielberg directs Saving Private Ryan with the amount of direction a director needs to pull off a story about true horrific events. Before starting my first review, I really want to put out on how powerful this movie was. I was shocked, surprised, and interested all at the same time! I give thanks to all of our soldiers who have fought to protect our country during the World Wars, the rest of the 20th century wars, and even wars today. Without them, protection wouldn't be seen throughout in our country.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan involves around Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his team of Rangers during the Normandy Landings. His team consisted of Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), and Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). They suddenly get into a task with the mission being only one man. As to his three brothers being killed in action, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is sentenced to return home. However, the war still isn't over while these group of Rangers track down Ryan. After the Normandy Landings, danger still heads their way during the war.<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed, Saving Private Ryan is truly (if not) my favorite War movie of all time so far! The scenery is real and Spielberg's direction makes the movie even more powerful. Also, this movie probably has got the most realistic representation of D-Day in 1944. The first 20 minutes of the movie is definitely not fun. Don't get me wrong that the rest of the movie is extremely intense and violent as well. As to watching this movie, I also found some form of messages. Soldiers (even important characters throughout the film) change in many ways. It can come from what's really important through the eyes of an American soldier. These soldiers stick together throughout the war, but going ""behind enemy lines"" is different. I give credit to the cast and crew for their amazing performances and work on this historically accurate World War II picture. I also give credit to Janusz Kaminski for his absolutely outstanding movie cinematography and to Spielberg for his leading direction.<br/><br/>I give Saving Private Ryan a 10/10 for Spielberg's outstanding direction, the great performances from the cast, and the stunning cinematography from Kaminski. The score, including ""Hymn to the Fallen"", is also outstanding from John Williams himself! The whole war experience of D-Day was outstanding and accurate! And again to the soldiers: thank you so much for your service!<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hanks), Best Director (Spielberg), Best Screenplay Written Directly For The Screen, Best Cinematography (Kaminski), Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup, and for Best Original Score. It won for Best Director (Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Kaminski), Best Sound, Best Film Editing, and for Best Sound Effects Editing."
"TheNabOwnzz","9","1","2","18 November 2018"," An utter masterpiece of visuals and sound, resulting in one of the most immersive war experiences ever created
","The 90s is arguably the greatest decade for master filmmaker Steven Spielberg, with possibly his three greatest films emerging from this era. Saving Private Ryan is one of these three films, and once more shows Spielberg's versatility as a director.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan consists mostly of a constant use of Steadicam shots, which is these days often confused with 'Shakycam'. When comparing Saving Private Ryan's camera movements to those of the modern action movies of today, what stands out is that it is seemingly only used to heighten the immersion of the scene ( Unlike shakycam ). For example, if there is an explosion, the camera will often move with the tremor of this, and the same is true for heavy gunfire. All of this makes the audience seemingly 'present' in the inhuman war setting that is displayed, and the result is that SPR is undeniably one of the most realistic and immersive war films ever created. This is why, even though the camera is shaking a lot, the situation is still clear, and the audience doesn't miss a whole lot in the overview of the battles. SPR utilizes a lot of long takes that frequently differ from being a complete wideshot to a medium or a close-up, which creates a great variety in shot compositions, and the long takes ofcourse significantly increase the immersion, as every little detail and every piece of movement is there in a single shot, while not having to adjust to the new image of an edit.<br/><br/>Yet SPR is not just a constant stream of chaos, as there are also many reflecting scenes between the lines. Many of these 'calm' moments between battle sequences such as the conversations at night in the church, the discussions right before the final battle, Tom Hanks's speech after the bunker attack about his prior job result in a lot of fantastic characterization. All of these conversations will significantly enhance the audience's connection with these characters, as every one of the main characters in the SPR squad is fleshed out and developed, with all of them having defining traits, such as Miller's shaking hands, or Jackson's kissing of the cross. Thus a lot of reason is given to care for the fates of these characters, which ofcourse heightens the emotional core of this film to a high degree.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is, as usual, once again Brilliant as Captain Miller, from the slow motion reflection scenes during battles to his conversations between them, his acting is top notch and once again proves his versatility as an actor, since he has played roles varying from a very low IQ individual, a loner on an Island & a mobster with a lot of conviction. Be it Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon or Edward Burns, there is not a single unconvincing acting performance in the film. The dialogue is ofcourse also a fantastic addition ( Particularly the Lincoln quote ) to a good script. John Williams's score is superb, and is one of the most American sounding scores ever created for a film, which makes you wonder if any other movie score could ever be more fitting to the subject in question.<br/><br/>With all its technical marvels in the use of the camerawork, there is also a fantastic use of sound, and the battle sequences always feature bombastic sound effects which are usually pitched higher than conversations to truly make the audience hear the terror of WWII. The sound of bombs or gunfire is as terrifying as possibly in SPR, which truly makes the audience feel as if they were there with the characters. Even after all this mayhem, the film still feels as if you are going through Hell, which is ofcourse an extraordinary feat for a film so heavily reliant on extended battle sequences.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a rare example of an action filled anti-war statement, and Spielberg's impeccable direction allows the audience to live and breathe the experience of it, all the while there is also a lot of characterization going on that makes the audience care significantly about what happens to the main characters."

","Saving Private Ryan <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a good World War 2 movie based on a true story. <br/><br/>The movie was directed by Steven Spielberg. The movie tells the story of a squad of men who where ordered to look for a soldier named private Ryan. The film is set in a war-torn France on June 1944. The main characters are played by Tom Hanks,Edward Burns,Matt Damon,Tom Sizemore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie starts when a world war 2 veteran walks into the cemetery and sees a grave of his comrade. He falls to his feet and then a flashback happens. Then the set changes and you see Omaha Beach for a few minutes before the assault begins. Then we see a landing craft on which the main character Ranger Captain John.H.Miller is getting ready for disembarkment. Then many of the men who landed on the beach were shot and killed and some got shot in their legs and had their hands torn off, but they got into the Nazi position and won the battle. Later in the movie captain Miller was issued an order to save a private from behind the enemy lines. <br/><br/> I think film succeeded in showing its pacifist massage. I don't think the movie has any faults. <br/><br/>I want to say that I like the movie and would recommend it to any one who wants to learn more about World War 2."

","This film is absolutely brilliant, it is a must watch for anyone who likes war films. Even if you aren't too keen on them, you should still watch it; it would be a mistake to miss it. It has some very good action scenes that hit hard and leave you wanting more and some extreme tension later on in the film. The opening scene on Omaha Beach still stands as one of the best openings to date. It manages to make you care about almost all of the characters it follows, it will even make you care about Vin Diesal! That's an achievement right there. If you have seen Band of Brothers but not this film, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen this film and enjoyed a lot much like I did, check out HBO's Band Of Brothers mini series, it is fantastic."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","2","17 July 2016"," Can be appreciated without being enjoyed.
","""A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."" Joseph Stalin. The most renowned war epic of modern times and perhaps all times exemplifies this quote quite well, though not perfectly. Now, I'm sure that the Normandy invasion sequence was extremely emotional for those who were present for it or who had relatives and friends die in the attack. But for the rest of the audience, I would expect that the following scene that tells of the three Ryan brothers' deaths was more striking. Sometimes I feel bad when I watch movies depicting tragedy like this one, because I don't always feel for the characters' sufferings. I know I'm supposed to, but it just doesn't always happen. I only share this because there are probably people who feel the same way and maybe it will help them make sense of their own lack of sympathy.<br/><br/>That aside, I can see why this is held in such high regard. It has great visual and audio quality in the battle scenes, an all-star ensemble, multiple emotionally charged characters, historical significance, a simple plot, decent character development, and an above average script that is translated proficiently on camera by Spielberg. None of these made watching it a great experience. It certainly didn't top any of my lists and was frankly rather forgettable. But I was still able to appreciate it for what it was. But part of appreciating it is having ties to the war itself, which is something that cannot be gained intentionally.<br/><br/>There could probably have been less minor characters included. Had they been based on real people or generated conflict or been more important to the thru line, I wouldn't say this, but there got to be too many of them. You recognize each one and get to know them a little, but are never thinking about them when they aren't on screen. It's a little disappointing, but probably intentional that Private Ryan gets more character than most of Miller's soldiers in about a third of the amount of screen time.<br/><br/>If you're concerned about it being American patriotic propaganda, I wouldn't watch it if you're going to be trying to pick out propaganda. The vast majority of it is subtle. The characters question their mission but never once question the war as a whole. Private Ryan's aversion to going home is more blatant, as are the voice-over letters to soldier's families. The portrayal of the one German soldier might put some people off. He isn't portrayed as evil, but you could argue that he is made an object of ridicule for the audience.<br/><br/>Don't watch this if you don't like long run times. The scenes are put to good use, but the movie as a whole could easily have been made shorter and retained its quality. I'll let you make your own decision on whether to watch the Normandy invasion, but be warned that it is very gory and uncompromising in its depiction. If you like any of the actors, expect a good performance from them, but don't expect that to make it a great movie for you. There are some slow parts, so don't choose this if you're looking for action. Prospective viewers looking to make a career in making action movies and special effects should definitely watch this, or at least study the D-Day invasion scene and the climax. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."
"oOoBarracuda","7","1","2","9 May 2016"," Saving Private Ryan
","Steven Spielberg's gripping epic, Saving Private Ryan was a film that went to great lengths to accurately depict the events of WWII. The 1998 Best Picture winner starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and a great ensemble cast tells the story of the sacrifice of many for the one. Conveying the message of brotherhood and sacrifice, Spielberg drove the message home through his grand WWII epic. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan opens with the allied invasion of Normandy with an intensely elaborate 12-minute scene in which Spielberg captures the essence of war with incredible accuracy. During the invasion, two brothers are killed, along with many others. Previously, a third brother was killed as well and thankfully, a sharp-eyed stenographer noticed that the mother, Mrs. Ryan (Amanda Boxer) would be receiving all three telegraphs informing her of her 3 son's deaths on the same day. When the Army General, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) learns of a fourth enlisted brother, he takes the opportunity to alleviate the mother's stress and find the fourth brother and return him home safely to his family. Marshall assembles a group of 8 men on a death- defying mission to find Private Ryan and get him to safety. <br/><br/>I will doubtfully never tire of a film told backward, as Saving Private Ryan was. We first meet an elderly gentleman that we later find out is present-day Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery with his family. Spielberg especially uses this technique to its full capacity in this film, allowing the audience to see how much sacrifice is worth when we see a trove of people that wouldn't have been possible without the mission to save Private Ryan. The opening battle scene with the invasion of Normandy was obviously intense and gripping. Spielberg went to great lengths to ensure the film's realism, even down to the positioning of body's on the beach. On a much lighter note, it was fun to see the cameos that were frequent and unexpected throughout the movie. We see Ted Danson and Bryan Cranston with bit parts in the film and unexpected big name cameos that don't distract from the story are always fun. There were several scenes with great use of characters storytelling throughout the film. This device was well utilized and helped distract from how much the film slowed down in the middle, or how needlessly long some of the battle scenes were. I typically find Spielberg films over the top and just aiming too hard for the jugular of the audience; Saving Private Ryan was probably doing those things too, but it was a better film in spite of it than some other Spielberg productions."
"jordanmarkwiseman","8","1","2","31 August 2015"," Eye opening
","This (in my opinion) is the only film that captures the true nature of war. Films often glorify war. Saving Private Ryan exposes the beast for what it truly is. The first five minutes of the landings are the best example of the second World war for what it truly was. the sacrifice and the suffering that was felt by men on both sides and what the effects where on the survivors. As ever Hanks delivers a fantastic performance that is both believable and gripping. the supporting actors at first appear distant but the film creates a bond between the viewer and the men involved as we experience the same events as they do that exposes us to their incredible story. The film also stimulates a debate. Was it right for the lives of several men for the life of a last brother. Through this the film shows the true sacrifice that comes with war. Best war film ever."

","Saving Private Ryan (1998): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper: Superbly crafted war film about the value of a single human being. Three out of four brothers die in the war 1914 while the fourth was a paratrooper deemed lost. Private James Ryan is still alive and Tom Hanks is ordered to bring troops in to extreme danger to bring him home at the request of his mother. The first 25 minutes are horrifyingly realistic as distorted bodies pile up on the Omaha Beach. Director by Steven Spielberg details the reality of surviving an explosion only to discover that your legs are missing. This can easily play double billing with his Schindler's List. Tom Hanks delivers an excellent performance as Captain Miller who leads the mission and is committed to life itself. Matt Damon is well cast as James Ryan who makes a turn for the good of others. Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and Barry Pepper are also featured among the squadron. The problem is that most of these supporting roles are cardboard types that are always overshadowed by the two leads. Even the scene where an enemy is saved only to later gun one of them down. How likely is it for that same enemy to turn up again with someone set to avenge his act? Featuring some of the best war footage ever shot with a strong human story of havoc, heroism and the value of human life. Score: 9 ½ / 10"
"panchodh_12","7","1","2","22 May 2015"," The Ultimate WWII Blockbuster
","This is such a Spielberg movie, such a Hollywood blockbuster, such a WWII drama, I can't even. All the cheesy dialogues, the sentimental scenes, the horror of the war, the pathetic American nationalism with the movie beginning and finishing with a take of the American flag, the old war Veteran speaking to the grave, all the possible war tropes (the nice guy who is afraid of killing, the highly moral doctor, the macho Vin Diesel, the Jew fighting against Germans, the rebel who doesn't follow the Captain's orders, and of course the heroic, brave Captain)... I've seen these a million times, though probably never as well put-together as in Saving Private Ryan. So I guess you could say that it is, among its kind, the best; even if I'm not a fan of that kind.<br/><br/>The opening scene is a whole different story, though. The Normandy landing is quite masterly filmed, and it probably ranks among the best opening scenes ever (can't really think of any other opening scene as memorable). It's cruel, bloody, and impressive.<br/><br/>The ending, on the other hand, really put me down. Everything was so cliché, and what's up with the Allied troops ending thanks to the last-minute, never-mentioned help of the Air force? Script writers, take note: NEVER let the plot be solved by an element that you never mentioned to the public. Nothing creaks the illusion of reality as much."
"jjserpe","7","1","2","27 March 2015"," Deep in the war
","Recently, war movies have aroused great interest. Accordingly, a plethora of this sort of movies has invaded our cinemas. Maybe the two most popular war movies in recent years have been Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg, focused on the Normandy Landings, and Flags of our Fathers, directed by Clint Eastwood, focused on the battle of Iwo Jima (together with Letters from Iwo Jima, the Japanese view of the conflict, whose premiere in Spain will be held in few weeks). Both films show bloody scenes of fights and, as a result, the cruelty of the war. In addition, a large part of both films is focused on the miseries and attitudes towards death, danger and desperation of a small group of soldiers. Also common to both films is the fact that the main characters are actually antiheroes. The Spielberg's film takes place mostly in the battlefield and is perfectly linear. On the other hand, flashbacks are used in Flags of our Fathers in order to show both the war and the propaganda campaign undertaken by the main characters going across the United States. By virtue of this we can see a different drama in this film related to the feelings and problems of the soldiers when they come back home to undertake a mission they have not been trained for. Furthermore, we clearly identify with the leading actor in Saving Private Ryan (Tom Hanks). On the contrary, the three actors in Eastwood's film actually share the prominence. The strength of Saving Private Ryan lies in the intense representation of the war and it is a typical war film, maybe better than others, but a war film nevertheless. However, Flags of our Fathers is more complex. With his usual skill, Eastwood shows a combination of war and politics, death and propaganda."

The most gruesome scene is by far the opening beach assault scene in the movie as it was very realistic,action packed and made your stomach turn. It's characters like Pvt.Jackson that movies like this great especially with his bible quoting and inch perfect shots. The other most significant character in the movie for me is Captain Miller. Captain Miler, the school teacher is perhaps one of the most inspiring people for me personally. His leadership, awareness and overall calmness is amazing. This is perhaps Spielberg's best ever movie(debatable) and it will always be in my personnel top 10 because of its realism and one of its main themes, the basis of war."
"The Grand Master","10","1","2","30 January 2015"," Saving Private Ryan is the quintessential war movie
","Without question Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie of all time. It is also credited for renewing worldwide interest in World War II and also renewed popularity with old and new movies, TV shows, and video games. Saving Private Ryan set the bar very high for all war movies since its release. Steven Spielberg is a great director and Saving Private Ryan is easily one of his best movies of all time. The all star cast is fantastic.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan starts with a World War II veteran bringing his family to the American cemetery at Normandy when he is overcome with emotion when visiting the graves of fellow soldiers who he served with. The film then flashes back to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks in one of his best roles) leads the 2nd Ranger Battalion onto Omaha Beach to secure the beach and overcome the German defense amidst heavy casualties. While the opening 25 minute scene is unforgettable and excellently choreographed, this scene is a perfect depiction of the brutality of the horrors of war. It is realistically graphic and in no way glamorizes nor glorifies war unlike other movies.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in Washington D.C. at the U.S. War Department, correspondence is being prepared to send to the various families notifying them of the loss of their loved ones during the war. In one of the saddest scenes of the movie in which you can't help but shed a tear, Mrs Ryan receives three letters on the same day notifying her that three of her sons were killed in action. A decision is made for the fourth son, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), to be located and sent home immediately.<br/><br/>The mission to find Private Ryan is handed to Captain Miller and his squad which includes his second in command Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cynical machine gunner Private Rieben (Edward Burns), Jewish soldier Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the deeply religious sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), medic Private Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Italian-American soldier Private Carparzo (Vin Diesel in an early role), and a skilled translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has not seen combat and finds himself bumbling throughout the mission and also resented by most of the squad members. The squad members find themselves questioning their mission to find one soldier and bring him home, but continue in their quest to locate Private Ryan as well as battling through numerous encounters with the German Army and confusion reigns as to whether Private Ryan is missing or presumably killed in action.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Robert Rodat is excellent and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski perfectly captures the desaturated colour imagery of World War II. Steven Spielberg's eye for detail as well as the ability to bring out the emotional side of viewers is highly admirable. The cast, particularly Tom Hanks as Captain Miller as an everyman thrust into action as the leader of men is excellent and he makes this role his own. Matt Damon as the young Private James Ryan must also be highly commended. The rest of the cast such as Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies shine in their respective outstanding roles.<br/><br/>Also in the all star cast, Dennis Farina (a well known character actor who sadly passed away in 2013), Paul Giamatti (another character actor known for comedic roles), Bryan Cranston (before his famous role as Walter White in Breaking Bad), and Ted Danson (best known for TV shows Cheers and Becker) pop up in small roles in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is one of the few emotionally powerful movies that is capable of making grown men shed a tear, despite many unwilling to openly admit it. There are a few scenes, particularly the ending that evoke the emotional side of many viewers. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan deserved its widespread critical acclaim and success at the box office. It also garnered numerous awards and Steven Spielberg was a well deserved winner, but in a complete travesty was unfairly robbed of the 1998 Best Picture Academy Award. Why Saving Private Ryan missed out on the Best Picture Academy Award I'll never know.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan exhibits Steven Spielberg's finest movie to date, and this is certainly a very memorable movie for Tom Hanks. I take my hat off to Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their fantastic work in this movie. A lot of people say that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies of all time due to its realistic depiction of the horrors of World War II. I wholeheartedly agree that it truly deserves its recognition as the best war movie of all time, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>10/10."

"joetufano882","10","1","2","19 January 2015"," Still continues to amaze me
","Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have proved many times that they have a great deep respect and understanding of war and the ones who fight on either side, and this along with Band of Brothers is probably the best on screen portrayal of war that I've seen personally.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the rest of the Army Rangers landing on Omaha Beach is one of the most jaw dropping openings ever put into film. I still remember my reaction to the opening scene when I first watched this and I was literally stunned when they show the soldiers in the boats immediately getting struck by bullets the moment the doors open up. The rest of the battle sequences are filmed with so much authentic realism and are never seem glorified in the slightest, and the final battle is one of the most intense, nail biting battle sequences I've ever seen. A lot of detail was put into the locations and the American and German Army uniforms and tanks. The sound design and the camera movements by Spielberg make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. This is one of those times where shaky cam can be used with skill, given that it's set in the middle of a war zone.<br/><br/>Story wise, it's very well done. Captain Miller and his men are sent deep into German occupied Normandy to look for Private James Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division after his 3 brothers are killed in combat elsewhere in the war, and they question why they should even bother going along with it. Up until you meet James Ryan and get to know him, the movie does a good job of posing the question: ""Why should we sacrifice all these lives for just one man?"" I don't know the answer to that question, but it seems to me that when they meet him at the final act, they see what kind of person he is and they decide he's worth saving and literally go through hell to ensure his safety.<br/><br/>As for the cast/characters, each character gets their own moment to shine even if it's not that long. This is one of Tom Hanks' best performances, and the scene where he breaks down after losing Wade shows you how great of an actor this guy is. Matt Damon is the best actor they could've chosen as Private James Ryan even if he's not in it that much, Edward Burns' character gets on my nerves a bit on how big of an a-hole he is until the end when he decides to help Private Ryan in the end. Tom Sizemore is really funny, Giovanni Ribisi and Barry Pepper are very good in their parts. As is Vin Diesel surprisingly. As for Upham (Jeremy Davies), a lot of people hate his character since he didn't rescue Mellish from being stabbed in the chest by a German soldier, and while I do agree that he should've helped at the same time I can't really blame him for being scared the way he was. I've been in the National Guard for the last two years, though I've never been in combat but I can tell you that not everybody is going to look and act like the Terminator when they're put into a life threatening situation. Some people just can't deal with that. Plus I found it pretty satisfying when he shoots the same German soldier in the end not only for Mellish but also in response to shooting Captain Miller.<br/><br/>And another thing I've appreciated is how the movie doesn't portray the Germans as monsters. The story is told from an American perspective and don't really focus on the German side on the war and even though there were some who truly believed in Nazism, most of the Germans were just human beings like you and I. They were just doing what they were told, fighting for their country, family and fellow comrades.<br/><br/>Even though a lot of directors have done this with their movies, Spielberg has this cool way of pulling all these familiar faces out of thin air into his movies even if it's for a brief amount of time: Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad is in here (as a fan of the show I get all giddy whenever he's on screen), Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dale Dye, Leland Orser, the late Dennis Farina and fans of Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" will pleased to see Nathan Fillion in this movie even if it's only for about 3 minutes.<br/><br/>In the end, this is one of my all time favorite movies and probably my favorite war film by far. It has a well executed story, well realized characters, intense battle scenes, a great musical score by the one and only John Williams, respect for the historical setting and finally the part where Captain Miller says to Private Ryan, ""Earn this"" chokes me up every time I watch it. Spielberg has done great work before and after he made this movie but he really outdoes himself with this one."
"williampsamuel","10","1","2","15 January 2015"," A Great War Movie and a Worthy Tribute to the American Soldier
","Three brothers have been killed in the line of duty, all within days of each other. The fourth brother is somewhere in Normandy. Orders come from the highest level to bring him home. Improbable as the scenario may be, this provides the setup for one of the best war movies ever made.<br/><br/>First off, Saving Private Ryan is one of the most realistic portrayals of combat I've ever seen. It pulls no punches when it comes to the sheer brutality of war. The opening assault on Omaha Beach was possibly the bloodiest sequence filmed up to that time, and the subsequent engagements have no shortage of carnage either. But this is no splatterfest; while it doesn't shy away from the blood and gore, it doesn't dwell on them either. The violence is here because that's what war is like, not for shock value.<br/><br/>The same approach is taken with the numerous death scenes. When a member of the team is killed, the movie doesn't just move on and say ""Oh well."" It makes you feel for the deceased, and for his comrades. Yet it never falls to the level of melodrama. There are no half-baked dying speeches, nothing about how he was supporting six kids who will now be left on the street (and yes, I have seen that line used, although it was in the context of a mining collapse.) Saving Private Ryan also deals with the thoughts and emotions of ordinary men thrust into war. The men of the Second Rangers, battle hardened though they may be, are not career soldiers. They answered the call of duty, but more than anything else, they just want the war to end so they can go home alive. Every time Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) loses a man, he consoles himself that one life was given so that two or three or ten could be saved, that the war is bigger than one man. But this time, the mission is about one man; a man they can't even be sure is still alive. It is a testament to these men's courage and sense of duty that they continue on a dangerous mission that few of them believe in.<br/><br/>As for Captain Miller, he is quite likely Hank's best role since Forrest Gump. He's quiet and reserved- to the point that there's a $300 prize for guessing his hometown- but he knows what he's doing and cares about the men under his command. He is ever the example for the men, never complaining or expressing doubts in front of the men. He praises them when they do well, tells it to them in no uncertain terms when they screw up, and does whatever he has to to keep them focused on their mission, even if deep down he thinks the whole thing is Fubar. And when he's given the choice between returning to headquarters, his objective achieved, or risking everything to make a stand against long odds, he makes the right decision.<br/><br/>And in the end, when the now aged James Ryan stands over the graves of the men who died to save him, it was one of the most moving, uplifting cinematic experiences I've had. Spielberg and Hanks have created not only a gripping war film, but a fitting tribute to the American soldier."
"powermandan","10","1","2","14 December 2014"," Spielberg Does It Again!
","A few years after winning his first Oscar for his best movie (Schindler's List) Spielberg wins his second Best Directing Oscar for his next war epic, Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest war movie of all time. In my opinion, this is tied with Apocalypse Now as the best. Both are fantastic war movies, but they're too different to really pick which is better. But I do agree when people say this should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. My favourite movie of the year was American History X, but Saving Private Ryan was a better piece of film. The movie that beat Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love, was a great and deserving flick, but not as deserving as this.<br/><br/>This movie has a very simple concept, a war Captain (Hanks) leads a group of eight soldiers in the Normandy invasion during the Second World War to rescue a Private Ryan (Damon) and bring him back to his mother. The closer the group gets, the deadlier the mission becomes with the men dying one by one. Why are eight men risking their lives just to save one? <br/><br/>Best war movie or not, this is the most realistic, bar none. The camera is shaky and distorted to capture the most realistic experience possible. Even more realistic than Schindler's List. So much that it looks like actual found footage. That is what makes the movie so brilliant, and so disturbing. The deadlier the mission becomes, the more exciting the movie gets. A fascinating tale of courage and heroism, the end result will leave you clapping with joy."
"Hawkensian","9","1","2","17 November 2014"," Saving Private Ryan's genre changing depiction of battle means that thinly drawn narrative and characterisation is unimportant
","Saving Private Ryan is technically excellent, it achieved what very few films do – it set a new benchmark. The film's harsh aesthetic and desaturated colour palette has been emulated many times, Ryan's influence can be seen in films from We Were Soldiers (2002) and Rambo (2008) to Black Hawk Down (2001) and Fury (2014). Although there have been some decent efforts, I am yet to see a film that equals let alone surpasses the beginning 25 minutes, the final battle in the fictional French town of Ramelle and everything in between.<br/><br/>The film follows the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the salient characters of which including Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), the affable yet authoritative leader; Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the platoon's second in command; Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), a stylishly ultra- accurate, cross kissing sniper from the bible belt; Private Reiben (Edward Burns), an incendiary man from Brooklyn; Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), a Jew who relishes informing German captives of his heritage and T4 Grade Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies), a very timid man who proves wholly unsuited to war. The men's mission is to locate and send home Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) on the compassionate orders of Chief of Staff George Marshall, who has been informed that Ryan's three brothers have all died in combat, their mother receiving the three telegrams simultaneously.<br/><br/>'You wanna explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?' says the argumentative Private Reiben. He addresses what I'm sure many viewers were wondering – is this premise plausible? Although inspired by and probably keen to emulate Lincoln's Bixby letter, would George Marshall have really possessed such compassion during a state of total war? It's interesting to note that screenwriter Robert Rodat developed the idea after reading a monument in Putney Corners, New Hampshire that listed the names of eight brothers who died during the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Unlike Brad Pitt in the recent Fury, Tom Hanks gives the performance of an everyday man, a middle-class secondary school teacher thrust into an extraordinary situation. Hank's character Captain Miller reminds you of what is now the unthinkable idea of conscription, reminds you of how civilians with little or no prior interest, ability or training in the army were mobilised to kill and conquer. There's not much to be found outside of Captain Miller in terms of characterisation however, Miller's men are quite flat and unremarkable, apart from Private Jackson, whose ultra-accuracy is displayed with a stylish flair that's out of character in a film whose violence is appropriately ugly. Jackson is also a good ol' boy, a self-righteous bible spouting stock character who was recently emulated by Shia LaBeouf as 'Boyd 'Bible' Swan' in Fury.<br/><br/>What I also found slightly troubling was the construction of the Germans, it was somewhat crude. Of the countless German troops we see in the film, the only one that is given any depth, 'Steamboat Willie' (Joerg Stadler), is shown to be a horribly callous backstabber; although, considering the context of total war, some may argue that he was just a soldier doing his duty. The narrative arcs of 'Willie' and Upham (the coward of the platoon) intertwine, climaxing in a scene that I think is ethically dubious.<br/><br/>Despite both narrative and character development being somewhat thinly drawn, they're not that bad and, crucially, not the centre of the film. The film's great accomplishment lies in its seminal depiction of warfare. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is to be commended for his raw, grisly aesthetic and his perfectly judged use of erratic camera movement, a style that has been messily emulated to nausea-inducing effect far too many times.<br/><br/>Like many others have, I could praise endlessly the new level of gripping realist cinema that Ryan introduced to viewers; however almost all of this commendation is being delivered by people who have never experienced battle. How do we know what a battle truly looks and feels like? The majority of what I witnessed seemed realistic to me, but I can't offer solid corroboration as I stepped foot on Omaha Beach 70 years too late. Surely the ultimate endorsement and affirmation for Saving Private Ryan's authenticity is from the people who have experienced war.<br/><br/>Written in the Florida Times Union on 15th August 1998 was an account of D-Day veterans 'enduring' Saving Private Ryan. This included Bill Faust, 78, who was accompanied in the theatre by only one other as the rest of his North Florida D-Day veterans' group walked out - 'I should have never gone to see that damn movie,' Faust said, 'In my mind, most of the details of D-Day were gone; all this did was bring them back it's better to keep them tucked away where they don't bother you.'<br/><br/>The article continues – 'Vietnam veteran Ed Kelly, 57, left before the opening scene was over - ""I just couldn't handle it"" Kelly said. ""The kid holding his guts; I had seen that in Vietnam. That was it for me. I got up and walked out. It was the closest thing to the horrors of real combat that I have ever seen.'<br/><br/>There was also Jerry Markham, 79, who walked out of the theatre 'impressed and depressed, amazed but saddened by the realism of the sights and sounds, especially the instant deaths after the landing craft ramps were lowered.' Markham was a Navy chief petty officer on a demolitions team on D-Day and saw his commanding officer die this way - 'That scene broke me up... that was how it happened. Bodies were flying everywhere I wouldn't recommend it for young children, but anyone 14, 15 or older should see it they should start learning about how horrible war is.' <br/><br/>I think all of this speaks volumes for Saving Private Ryan's credibility.<br/><br/>90%<br/><br/>(for the full travel article, please visit www.hawkensian.com)"

","Great war movie! Saw it listed as a documentary which it is not. Based on a small kernel of truth, 90% of the movie is fiction. (There was no trek across France nor any battles to retrieve Niland - the real Pvt. Ryan.)Don't get me wrong. I am not complaining. But fiction is fiction, usually with a hefty dose of drama. And Ton Hanks' portrayal of the Captain in charge of the group sent to find and bring Ryan back is great. All the supporting cast is also great. The action scenes are superb. I particularly liked the scenes of the armour. (Halftracks, tanks, etc.) However this is still a work of fiction. To call it a documentary does a dis-service to film-makers and servicemen alike."

","Shortly after the invasion of Normandy, a small group of soldiers is ordered to locate and rescue a paratrooper, Private Ryan, whose brothers were all killed in action during the war. This is the story of a group of soldiers who embark on a perilous journey to save the youngest brother of the Ryan family from Iowa. After the U.S. Army find out that all but one brother have perished during the war they order Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, and his squad to locate and bring Private James Francis Ryan, played by Matt Damon, to safety. Miller's group believes in following orders but at what expense. The star-studded cast includes Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Reiben, Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham, Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo, Adam Goldberg as Private Mellish, Barry Pepper as Private Jackson, and Giovanni Ribisi as Medic Wade.<br/><br/>The gunfire from the beach piercing the helmets and bodies of the soldiers on the launches occurs immediately as the launch opens. Descending from the launch, soldiers were drowning while attempting to reach the beach. The scenes move quickly; the film speed and the movement were as if you were in the middle of the action. This movie is filled with action, and Miller's squad has many obstacles to overcome while searching for Ryan, after he became separated from his squad while jumping into France during the invasion. This exhausting journey leaves the soldiers feeling hopeless at times and wanting to give up the search. They are torn between their loyalties to their duty and what they feel is right. <br/><br/>After receiving some information on a possible location for Ryan, the squad is walking through a field. Every footstep is heard despite the conversations of the soldiers. Reiben was complaining about the mission and asking the captain how he complains. Miller reminds Reiben of the chain-of-command and procedures. Miller listens to the conversations and interjects at time reminding his men about duty. The soldiers come upon a small town, hearing gunfire in the distance and mortar rounds; they approach the dilapidated building, cautiously watching for German soldiers. A family in one of the buildings wants the soldiers to take his children with them; Miller informs his men they cannot take the children. All the while Upham is translating to the parents they cannot take the children. Caparzo, disobeying his captain, takes a small girl from her father in an attempt to assist with getting her to safety.<br/><br/>Next, you see Caparzo laying in the street bleeding at the hands of a German sniper. The girl runs to her father and begins to yell at him and slapping him in his face. Caparzo is trying to get up, he removes a letter from his vest, and Wade adamantly instructed Caparzo to stay still. After several minutes the Jackson, the American sharp shooter, focused in on the German sniper and put a bullet straight through the scope of a sniper's rifle killing him with one shot. Caparzo was dead; Wade took the blood soaked letter from Caparzo. <br/><br/>The squad continues on, still searching for Ryan, they cross the path of German soldiers in a pasture, loaded with gunfire. Each side is firing upon one another; Wade is hit, once the fire ceases the squad run to Wade's aid. Their struggle with stopping the bleeding is hopeless Wade calls for his mama. He is undoubtedly frightened but the efforts of the men to alleviate his pain fails. The squad reaches the one German soldier that survived the shoot-out and start assaulting him and at the insistence of Upham, Captain Miller declares the soldier a POW.

","Loved this movie. Great acting and a great story. A powerful and realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. Spielberg does an amazing job with this movie. Although there is a lot of blood and guts, it makes it more real. Tom Hanks is one of today's great actors. He did an amazing job in the movie. The start of the movie is hard to watch at times. However it makes it so real and puts you in the place of the soldiers. The special affects and sound make the movie seem more real too. Saving Private Ryan goes beyond technical dazzlement to put a new, indelibly terrible face on war. It makes you realize what they went though for our freedom."
"hall895","9","1","2","6 July 2014"," Real heroes in the real hell of war
","If it is possible to make a majestic film about a hellish war Steven Spielberg has done so. With Saving Private Ryan Spielberg beautifully blends the arts of filmmaking and storytelling. With such an accomplished director at the helm it is no surprise that this is such a technically proficient film, that it looks so spectacular, so real. But this film is so much more than the stunning, often horrifying, visuals. This is a film with a magnificent, inspiring story. And Spielberg tells that story so well, taking you through the emotional wringer. Tom Hanks leads an outstanding cast, Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is breathtaking, John Williams provides a powerful and at times haunting score. And credit must also go to screenwriter Robert Rodat whose story is so incredibly compelling. So many people contributing so brilliantly to an absolutely fascinating film. Everyone did their part and Spielberg put all the pieces together perfectly.<br/><br/>The film begins on D-Day with the Normandy invasion which of course could be an entire film in and of itself. This sequence is unrelenting, Spielberg sparing nothing in his depiction of the inconceivable violence on Omaha Beach. Never has any film so brutally illustrated that war is indeed hell. Thousands of men bravely face what for so many must seem to be a certain death. As the bodies fall and blood turns the sea red Captain John Miller continues to push his company forward. They make a critical breakthrough but at such cost. Miller, and we, look down at the carnage below on the beach. So many men lay there, having made the ultimate sacrifice. The camera focuses in on one of the dead, on his backpack we see the name: S. Ryan. And we know that this film, even as it tells the tale of a conflict which engulfed the whole world, is going to tell a very personal story.<br/><br/>The Ryan we see lying on the beach is one of three Ryan brothers killed in action. A fourth Ryan brother, James, is missing in action having parachuted behind German lines. From Washington comes a very unusual, but very clear order. Captain John Miller is to find James Ryan. And send him home. Miller assembles a small unit from his company. Eight men will go out into the French countryside, still occupied by Germans mind you, to find and save Private Ryan. Eight men will risk their lives to save one. Suffice to say not all of the eight are particularly happy with this assignment. But orders are orders and off the men go, into the great unknown. No simple mission this. Danger lurks at every turn. Spielberg ratchets up the tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat. You care so much about these men because Spielberg, certainly with a great assist from screenwriter Rodat, has done such a fine job of allowing you to know them. These characters come fully formed. You feel you know them, really understand them, almost from the moment you first meet them. So many different personalities in the group. Credit of course must go to the actors portraying the squad, the performers bring these soldiers brilliantly to life. Hanks is the star, the leader, and he is excellent. But the other actors match him stride for stride. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi and Jeremy Davies...none put a foot wrong. An amazing cast which does justice to an amazing story.<br/><br/>It is the story which really sets this film apart. It is a film about war but really it is a film about one man. But maybe that one man is not Private Ryan. Ryan plays his part but is this story really about Captain Miller? An ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation. A leader of men, doing his duty. Doing whatever is necessary to get his men, and himself, home. Hanks does such a terrific job portraying this man who remains an enigma even to his own men. Sometimes you get the sense he is an enigma to himself. He has lost the sense of who he is, or at least who he used to be. War will do that to you. The worldwide conflict is ultimately fought by individual men. And Spielberg allows you to get to know some of these men. Ryan and Miller. And Horvath, Reiben, Jackson, Mellish, Caparzo, Wade and Upham. Each has his own story to tell. And seeing each of their stories play out takes us back to the film's opening, to Omaha Beach. So many men died there. No film can tell every one of their stories. But with this film Spielberg has honored them all. A film of staggering scope and awesome power but with a personal touch. That Saving Private Ryan did not win the Best Picture Oscar is sad, quite frankly absurd. But honoring the film is not really important. Honoring the men who died so that we may be free is what really matters. And this film does just that."

"rsweet68","10","1","2","19 June 2014"," Perfect Period Piece
","Film Review of Saving Private Ryan<br/><br/>The film Saving Private Ryan (1998) is a masterful period piece on the life of a select group of American soldiers during and shortly after the Normandy invasion in World War II. The film's plot is based on a small force of soldiers assigned to go behind enemy lines to find and bring home a young soldier whose family has lost all of their other sons to the war effort. Their interpersonal conflicts, thoughts, and physical efforts to fulfill this duty provide a gripping emotional and action packed film. The theme revolves around the sacrifices of men during war to accomplish difficult if not seemingly impossible assignments and goals. The viewer of this film experiences the personal point of view of the main character Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) during this battle and assignment. We see a range of emotional and physical acts of courage, strength, and fear that each soldier exhibits as he battles toward the front lines. Since the majority of viewers did not take part in this war, the film brings to light many of the horrors of war along with the exceptional responses humans are capable of producing during such times. The men that fought this fight had to be overwhelmed and horrified to watch their comrades die as well as for the majority experiencing killing for the first time. Spielberg's directing and the acting of the main actors relay the realism, emotions, and fears of war to the audience. Director Steven Spielberg creates an exciting adventure film with the use of different cameras, angles, and points of view. The use of the flashback point of view of Pt. Ryan (Matt Damon) from the initial scene in the cemetery throughout the film is a pivotal technique for continuity and emotional impact. The sound effects and surround sound evoke a strong and emotional response by adding realism. The lead characters Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Pt. Reiben (Edward Burns), Pt. Jackson (Barry Pepper), Pt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) all delivered believable performances with examples of the varying personalities any group under extremely trying circumstances would exhibit. Captain Miller is the lead character commanding his team through many difficult obstacles. This team had not only enemies to fight but at times each other. The interplay between the characters adds interest and depth to this film again revealing the theme of sacrifice as each character struggles with the amount of sacrifice he is willing to make to complete the assignment of saving Pt Ryan. Tom Hanks again progresses in his acting depth by taking on an intensely dramatic role. His performance is an excellent mix of intensity, frustration, and caring that will mark this piece as one of his best thus far. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a fictional piece but based on true events from WWII where three sons in one family were killed within a one week period. The United States war department then sent a group of soldiers to try and find a fourth son before he too was killed. Post WWII, the Fighting Sullivans (1944) was another film in a similar theme based on the true story of five brothers all dying when their battleship the U.S. Juneau sank (www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq72-1.htm) The director and actors brought realism to this story and the entire film. Spielberg and Hanks along with the rest of the cast draw on skill and emotions to reveal the core of human strength in times of sacrifice and war in Saving Private Ryan. While the film is long, almost three hours, it is well worth the viewing and highly recommended."
"RossRivero99","10","1","2","14 June 2014"," Tom Hanks' best performance
","Steven Spielberg's saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made of the emotional impact and the excellent shooting scenes. The most emotional scene is the very beginning because of D-Day and the massive amount of casualties of war. The movie stars Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller who unfortunately did not win an Oscar for this movie when he really should have won, director Steven Spielberg has crafted his best movie since his first Oscar winning turn since his 1993 holocaust movie Schindler's List. Also in the movie there were a lot of other good performances from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel. This movie goes on a par with war film classics such as Black Hawk Down, Patton, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Devil's Brigade, and 633 Squadron. Another reason why this movie was great is because the shooting scenes looked so realistic, This is a triumph that is the best movie of 1998."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence, a soldier's-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent, gory, visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable, bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets, limbs blown off, entrails spilling out, and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And, when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach, the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" unbearable.<br/><br/>It's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), a hero and survivor of the Omaha Beach battle, is chosen to lead the team of eight men whose goal is, in Miller's words, like finding ""a needle in a stack of needles."" His hand- picked team includes six men who have served with him throughout the war. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. These are a cast of characters who are unforgettable, and the film takes the time to flesh them out, and let the audience interact with them in their journey to find Ryan.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a powerful experience. I'm sure a lot of people will weep during it. Spielberg knows how to make audiences weep. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.<br/><br/>The film's central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movie's shocking and unforgettable images, ""Saving Private Ryan"" offers a singular motion picture experience."
"OllieSuave-007","7","1","2","7 November 2013"," Powerful, gruesome war-torn story.
","This is a powerful and dark film about a group of U.S. soldiers going behind enemy lines to try to locate a missing paratrooper, whose brothers have been killed in action.<br/><br/>This film explicitly depicts the horror and consequences of war: bloodshed, fallen comrades, fierce battles and destroyed cities. Steven Spielberg's direction made this a fast-paced movie with nonstop action and suspense and superb acting, helped by an eerie music score by John Williams. As in other war movies, just the parts where the two opposing sides hunt and battle each other to the death are heart-pounding.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that are too long and complex to summarize all in one review. However, I can say that this movie is not for everybody, as many might get disturbed with the explicit and graphic war-violence scenes. Those who don't find the violence and enjoys high drama, action and a story based on a historical context will find this an entertaining feature.<br/><br/>Grade B"

","Spielberg succeeds in crafting an intriguing narrative, combined with incredible performances and confronting but impressive battle sequences. Also Hanz Zimmer provides an amazing score to accompany an already magnificent masterpiece.Tom Hank' Oscar nomination was warranted, and he benefited significantly from the excellent supporting cast members particularly Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly emotional performance by Vin Diesel. The film is a harrowing exploration of the nature of warfare, the devastation and death that it can cause. Saving Private Ryan is a wonderful companion to HBO series Band Of Brothers, and its critical and financial success is testament to its quality."

","Erwin Rommel is hardly the one to blame for mistakes made by the Nazi's in the assumption that Normandy would be to blame for the landing there rather than at the Pas de Calais; that was the one thing that Ike Eisenhower and the command staff should receive great credit for all they did to deceive Hitler. Rommel is still characterized as the one of two geniuses in the Wehrmacht (the other being von Runstedt and his development of the Blitzkreig which was so successful in France and the beginnings of the fatal mistake of invading the Soviet Union. In fact, Rommel was convinced that just as in the Salerno invasion, the troops would come ashore in Normandy, and in so believing, he vastly made the invasion more deadly by increasing Normandy Beach hazards and in flooding the landing spots for airborne/glider landings. And this is a great film in spite of the fact that Tom Hanks simply has to play the very role of the great Hero, General Norman Cota, the eldest American on Omaha Beach and the leader of the breakout with such brave leadership and by using the rarely used Bangalore torpedoes to shatter the second strand of barbed wire and leading the troops to great valor with his leadership. My only regret about the film was the failure to credit General Cota somehow in the breakthrough to the murderous machine gun fire."

","Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg To the question ""What is your favorite movie or what movie you have seen many times?"" The first movie, title which comes up to my mind is Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. The movie won 5 Oskar. It is the best movie about Second World War which was shooting by American Cinematography. I saw SPR (Saving Private Ryan) on TV. The cable TV which we had back home was translating a lot of International movies. American movies are one of the best, the whole world knows about American movies. Big budgets, filming skills and actors are best in America. By those criteria SPR caught my attention and dipped me into the atmosphere of bloody war. The film is about American soldiers' encounter with German forces at the coast line during the first day of D-Day. American army organized with Allies a massive landing on the Normandy beach (North France). Also thousands of paratroopers landed into deep into center of France. The story begins with scene where Private Ryan shown as already old man, who is walking with his family at soldiers' cemetery. Ryan came to honor the memory to the significant person of his life, the person who saved his life, the price which was the dead life of whole rescue group. The interesting part begins after first scene. The picture quickly changes from silent soldiers' cemetery, where the grass is green; sky is blue, and people wearing bright colored cloth to the Normandy beach. In 1944th before year of victory, France was still occupied and controlled by German-Nazi army. Germans built a massive defensive line along all France beach territory. Defenders set up a big number of bunkers and fences on the beach. All that picture of war was presented in high quality. Massacre begins with lending American troops to the beach where Germans starts to shoot them. American forces loses thousands of people under the machine-gun fire during the first hours of landing on Omaha beach that how was named that sector. The main actors are identified at the moment when camera showing American troopers sailing to the beach and that entire scene follows Captain Miller's squad."

The decision to split the map at the International Date line wasn't officially made until the National Geographic Society decreed it in 1988.When the soldiers are at the seawall during the D-Day scene Miller explains to Horvath that Dog 1 exit is to the west. Right after that, the soldier behind Miller with the BAR leans up on him and shouts ""they're killing us because we don't have chance and that ain't fair"". When he is saying ""chance"" the camera changes angles and the soldier who was yelling is facing the seawall and not even talking, even though ""and that ain't fair"" is still being said"

","I'm not quite sure how it has taken me almost 15 years to watch Saving Private Ryan. Somehow I guess I just never got round to it. Well I finally did and was left with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>Far more experienced movie critics and war experts than me have extolled the opening scene. So there's little more that I can add. It's power to shock and sadden surpasses almost anything I've seen before it and for that alone the film has earned its place in movie history.<br/><br/>Of course the downside is that if it surpassed so much before it, then it inevitably also surpassed the 100 or so minutes that followed it. I'll forgive that though. Ultimately in the story of the Normandy beach landings, the landings were the beginning and so although it's not perfect from a movie perspective, it's the only way to tell it. I did though find much of the rest of SPR remarkably standard. Yes the acting was excellent. However the characters were distinct caricatures. The bitter Jew, the loyal lieutenant, the brash New Yorker and the good guy medic. They were all finely portrayed but their characters brought nothing new to the screen. It was only Jeremy Davies' interpreter who could have come from superior war films such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket (or even the vastly different but more cerebral The Thin Red Line, which SPR overshadowed).<br/><br/>My other issue is the portrayal of those damn Germans. Inglourious Bastards revels in it's over the top portrait of just about every German during WWII being Satan's sidekick. However that film has its tongue firmly in cheek. SPR does not and the German soldier who is let free by Tom Hanks' super hero captain (""he'll be picked up soon enough""), and then returns as the face of the enemy is pure Hollywood cliché.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, SPR was a fine film. The opening is shocking and the remainder is thoroughly enjoyable. The caricatures which prevented it from matching the greats also offer a large degree of comfort. They allow us to feel like we know all these characters and emphasise with them immediately, with little effort. Spielberg paints by numbers in the last battle scene though, it being all too predictable to fully believe any battle in any war ever quite happened like that. It's for this reason that in the context of the great war films (or the few I've seen to date), I'd say it falls a little short."

","This is a perfect film, for those who want to watch a war/action film that shows the reality of war during world war 2. An easy to follow, but still interesting plot leads no viewers confused or bored throughout. The director was able to capture the violence and brutality of the film in the first 15 min of the film, and is able to continue those themes. Tom Hanks' performance adds the the realism of the characters, making them seem more like real people rather than Hollywood action heroes, but adding in an theme of unity/band between the squad. Overall it is a film great for understanding the horrors of war, and for its action. However the plot does seem quite linear and is not very complex."
"ShibanPD","Null","1","2","12 November 2012"," Saving Private Ryan
","A war film unparalleled in almost every respect, Saving Private Ryan is framed by a present-day story about an elderly man visiting a military cemetery with his family. He reaches a nondescript gravestone and falls to his knees, uncontrollably weeping. Within this frame of reference is another set of bookends: two unforgettable battle sequences. Like its epic World War II film predecessors—The Longest Day and A Bridge Too Far—Saving Private Ryan features a long list of key and supporting actors, including: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, and Bryan Cranston. Also like its predecessors, the featured actors, who may or may not have served, do justice to the material and pay tribute, with earnest portrayals, to the men who helped make their comfortable American lifestyles possible. The first battle, at Omaha Beech during the landings at Normandy, is staggeringly realistic in its brutal recreation of June 6, 1944. The omnipresence of Spielberg's documentary-style camera assures us that the relentless intensity of that violent confrontation does not escape our attention, even if no single viewpoint could have witnessed the totality of the carnage. Back in the States, a woman in a government office, typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action, notices what appears to be a discrepancy, but reveals itself as the premise of the plot: a soldier named James Ryan has lost all three of his brothers in battle. The order to find Ryan and secure his safe return home falls to Captain John Miller (Hanks) who, along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing, embark on a rescue mission, the value of which they question every step of the way. Writer Robert Rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development, philosophy, and humor into the action-oriented middle. Much of it succeeds; some of it rings false. The more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action, like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church, or the one on the steps. Easily the most heart-wrenching (and gut-wrenching) scene finds Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) downed by gunfire, surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance. He asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling, and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver. They beg him to tell them how to fix him. Resigned to his fate, he just asks for more morphine. When we finally meet up with Private Ryan (Damon), he refuses to abandon ""the only brothers he has left."" There is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions, but it seems obvious what has to happen: Miller and his men will assist Ryan's squad in securing the bridge before sending Ryan home. The development of Ryan's character is, to say the least, disappointing. I have two brothers of my own, and I find it hard to believe that a man, even after two years of displacement, would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers, and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers (and the only one we witness) is frivolous, emotionless, and unfunny. I also find Upham's cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend, as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption. In the end, what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary. The emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn, sympathetic characters that we have come to know and love—without whom we can't bear to endure; these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own. Therein lies the successful failure of Saving Private Ryan: whether intentional or not, the non-commanding presence of its fictional characters, paralleled by John Williams' brilliantly simplistic three-note theme, leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet, commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war. When Captain Miller tells Private Ryan to ""earn this,"" in a sense, he is asking us to live our lives in a way that will earn the price paid by those bands of brothers who sacrificed it all."

","War films have been made earlier and will be made till eternity. But 'Saving Private Ryan' will have the image of what Gandhi has today (Irony intended.). This has set a standard so high that I think it would nearly be Impossible to have a portrayal better than this, especially the first 30 minute scene. Now this first part is what the world recognized thoroughly and it deserves that. But the second and the major part of the story is equally amazing. The film captures the journey of a group of 8 people who set out to find out another of their comrade named- ""James Ryan."". They have to travel all the way to him just to deliver the message that all his brothers are dead and that he is relieved from duty. During their journey they encounter snipers, moral dilemmas etc. the idea of 8 people putting their lives at stake for just one person, is an intriguing story and to supplement that you will see a hell lot of action. This is a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>Spielberg is a man who does things with huge perfection. There are many ways to see this film. One might see it as a nice action film in which people are assigned a task and they accomplish it by fighting a lot of people. It's the simplest way to put it. But the other way to see it is in a question format. First the question arises as to why 8 people were sent on a near suicide mission to find just one person. Why can't let the war finish. And if he is alive, let him be relieved. But then here comes morality. The superficial answer to the question is that the mother who has already lost 3 of her sons and so her only son should not be risked. So in a way we are taking quantity to be the major factor in here. The analytical reason to send them on such a mission is left to the viewer to decide on his own. Some might say that it is just a form of duty. Correct. Some will say that loss of 4 compared with loss of 1 or 2 is greater. OK. Some might think that a person who has lost his three brothers is more eligible to leave the war than any other, because his grief is higher. OK. So in a way this first question is a direct check on how you view rules of lives or your perception towards human decisions. I would say this is a perfect question and portrayed in the best ways. Second question is direct and is asked by the team people themselves. They are perfectly right in their thinking. Are their lives not as important as any other one who is fighting? People who watched carefully from the starting and thought about the first question nicely, they will be counter attacked by this phase of the film. Isn't it intriguing, to have included the viewer so closely in a film? During this second phase, the team is under a lot of emotional turmoil. They want to abandon the mission. From this moment the third question starts. Which is – 'is doing the duty and obeying orders so important that you put your lives at risk?' While most will say to this question that they are doing the duty for the country. But keeping myself in their positions, I feel too much agitated about the objective of the mission. Why should I risk my life for this purpose? None of them were reluctant in doing their duty for the country but the objective of this mission stirred them. Next we come across a very emotional moment when Tom hanks says that he is doing this so that he completes the mission and can go home peacefully. He says this line with so much emotion that you will forget everything about the three questions and look for Ryan yourself.<br/><br/>This film has everything for people of all ages. It also has light humor at appropriate places. The beauty of the war films is that you have a funny moment and just after that you come across a heartbroken statement. After watching the film you will definitely get convinced that war changes people. One other scene that I will never forget is the authentic knife fight between a US officer and a German officer. That fight depicts what a person behaves in his last moments of death. Also I felt sad over the two strange people fighting and killing so ruthlessly just on some orders.<br/><br/>Also I would like to explore the message of the film in detail. Tom hanks in his last moment says to Ryan – 'Earn it.' These two words alone have a lot of depth. The inner meaning of the word is that the life is wonderful. One should make good use of it.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Earn your Life."" VERDICT: ""A must watch."""

","This movie is just amazing, in a general sense. The effects, story, sound, everything. One of my favorite movies ever made. However, this movie is definitely not for everyone. The gore and violence is extremely present, and may disturb some viewers. Also, the ending is very emotional, as are most deaths in this film. The whole overtone of the movie is also extremely dreary and bleak. A very good film, though not for everyone. But, if you can handle it, it is guaranteed to be one of the best movies you have ever seen. This movie is right up there with other great films, like The Shawshank redemption, The godfather, and Apocalypse Now"

Tom Hanks played the leader role in his group and you can literally see his respect and care he has for his comrades as well as his leadership. Tom Hanks isn't the only star of the film. Every actor was immaculate and perfect. Usually in war and action films, parts can look fake when people are shot or blown up but I could not see one fault in this area.<br/><br/>There is nothing bad about this film; it really is that good. It is simply amazing<br/><br/>Just watch it and you'll agree."

","Saving Private Ryan (1998) Director – Steven Spielberg Cinematographer – Janusz Kaminski Writer – Robert Rodat Editor – Michael Kahn <br/><br/>Favorite quote – ""Captain Miller: James, earn this... earn it."" Saving Private Ryan is an epic war film set during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. It is a film noted for its graphic and realistic portrayal of war. Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic high intensity tour de force following Captain John Miller (protagonist) and his team depicting the Omaha Beach Assault on June 6, 1944. It later follows Capt. John Miller and his hand-picked team of seven other soldiers including one newcomer who have served with him throughout the war as they search for a paratrooper, Pvt. First Class James Ryan, who is the last surviving brother of four servicemen.<br/><br/>Saving Private James Ryan and bringing him home is Capt. Miller's new mission and his ticket to be home with his family. Capt. Miller faces several group of opposing enemies (Germans) and loses his couple of soldiers on the way to find Pvt. Ryan. The squad finally finds Pvt. Ryan on the outskirts of Ramelle. Pvt. Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, and their mission to bring him home. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not feel it is fair to go home looking at the small band whose duty it was to defend a bridge and destroy an approaching German mechanized unit. Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available. Germans arrive in force with more than 50 men supported by armor. In spite of inflicting heavy German casualties most of the Capt. Miller's men are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Capt. Miller is shot and morally wounded. He is about to be bombed by a tiger tank when an American P-51 Mustang (tank destroyer) flies over and destroys the tank followed by more P-51s and advancing American infantry. Pvt. Ryan stays with his Captain as he dies and says his last words.<br/><br/>The film ends with the present day Ryan, now a World-War II veteran standing at Capt. Miller's grave with his family. He asks his wife and confirms that he is a good man and he has led a good life and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Capt. Miller and his team.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan symbolizes the courageous, tough and commanding persona of an Armed Force Officer and in this case, it's Capt. Miller's. His will and determination to accomplish his mission is unquestionable. He loses his life fighting for the assigned mission. From the very beginning of rattling gun fires and missiles at Omaha Beach to the very end of his life at the Ramelle Bridge, Capt. John Miller always proves to be the brave and loyal soldier of his force. <br/><br/>Review by – Mayank Bhattacharya"

"azmosis95","9","1","2","25 April 2012"," I felt compelled to review this film.
","Usually, I don't take the time to review films, because it's pretty pointless trying to argue with all the fools who gave this film a bad rating, but this time I really think it needs some backing up. I've watched some pretty violent, gory films before but this was the first one where I actually felt sick. Not because it was so unnecessary, or because it was overdone, but because it was so damn real. The opening scene was so intense and realistic, it explains everything about war that can't be learned just through reading books, studying history or ever looking at old photos. The way the sound muffles to show the audience shell shock, and people lying in the background screaming for their mothers. It's a bit overwhelming, but better that than completely fake. What I really want to point out is that in order for the audience to want the main characters to succeed, there needs to be some purpose to the film, hence the storyline of a small group of soldiers searching for the last of four sons. Otherwise it wouldn't have the emotion or engagement of the audience that was intended. Also, when people complain about it being unrealistic, yes the story is fiction, but how do you know something like that never did happen? Maybe there was one German they let live, who returned later to kill their comrades. Maybe they did send a tank through a small alley. I'd like to point out that the film is in the eyes of American soldiers. It's meant to portray how they saw the war, how the enemy looked in their eyes. Basically, if you didn't want to see any of the slight exaggerations or sympathy to the Americans, go watch a documentary on war, not an incredibly realistic movie."

","Spielberg directed this epic war film in 1998. It stars Tom Hanks as Capitan John Miller, Matt Damon as Private James Ryan. Ryan is only surviving son of mother and government decide to call him back. They give this mission to John Miller and his companions. Then the chase begins.<br/><br/>Before watching it I heard many positive reviews about this movie. When I watched it I said: ""Yeah, they are right"". I have seen many films about war, but this is definitely something extraordinary. This is probably the most innovative war film of all time. It has great cultural impact. Spielberg created famous game Medal of Honor after this. Then it influenced some films like Black Hawk Down and s. After 13-14 years this film still have its effect on people.<br/><br/>At Oscars film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Bes Picture and Director. It won Best Director for Spielberg, but it lost BP to Shakespeare in Love. Everyone was shocked. This is probably the greatest Oscar upset of modern times and of course, another Spielberg snub.<br/><br/>Watch and Enjoy!!!!!"
"Steffi_P","7","1","2","27 February 2012"," ""The goddamn rules just walked off""
","Since the popularising of pacifism in the 1960s, the war movie has largely existed only to convey anti-militarist sentiment. But by 1998 there hadn't been a major decent one of those for years, and it was time for another makeover. Saving Private Ryan harks back to the genre's peak in the late 40s and early 50s, when war movies were exciting pictures about heroism and unquestionable moral reasoning. However, the intervening time in cinematic and social development can't be ignored, and so this time around combat must be realistically hellish, and there has to be some kind of philosophical questioning going on.<br/><br/>This is all very well, but Saving Private Ryan is also very much part of the modern era's blockbuster strand, and it seems a conflict between brutal realism and cornball simplicity. In between the battle scenes there is some woefully clichéd dialogue and dramatically flat moments. Characters like Upham are just lazily-written stereotypes, and the point-making about the perils of showing mercy to the Germans is heavy-handed. Then there's the John Williams score, which is just like so many other overblown and slightly smug-sounding John Williams scores. You wouldn't think a musical score could be condescending, but this one is.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg won his second Oscar for Saving Private Ryan. As with Schindler's List, the frequency and arbitrariness of the killing soon makes us desensitised to it, and immerses us in a world where randomised death is a constant threat. And Spielberg clearly knows how to balance this. For example, about halfway through the battle we see Hanks and his men gradually making some headway. The troops aren't dropping like flies anymore, but the sheer brutality of the previous ten minutes means we never forget the danger the men are in. But the trouble is Spielberg occasionally resorts to techniques like slow-motion and sound distortion, putting the experience upon us in a way that feels obviously artificial, as oppose to letting the images draw us in. And he makes a basic error, I feel, in showing a few point-of-view shots from the German gun positions. Surely the whole point of this scene (and the movie in general) is keeping us with the US troops and never being objective, and yet Spielberg violates his own premise.<br/><br/>And yet this is overall a well-made piece and there remains much to like. Despite the weaknesses in the screenplay's minutiae, its odyssey structure gives it a powerful sweep and makes up for the deficits in characterisation. The picture gains resonance is it goes along, and to my mind the later battle sequence at Ramille with its eerie sound effects and man-versus-tank dynamics, is superior to the opening one. Saving Private Ryan is not without its flaws, but it is enough to reinvigorate a genre that was starting to flag."
"jan-anthony-m","10","1","2","29 November 2011"," Nothing short of Awesome
","You could see all the effort that was put into this movie. As amazing a movie it is, it wouldn't be nearly half as good without the technical decisions that were put into this movie. From the deep emotions and feelings, to the action packed battle scenes, every part was beautifully depicted with Spielberg's technical skills.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the opening invasion scene left viewers entranced, and possibly with their mouths wide open. The fast cuts, character actions, camera movements, and camera placement all contributed to portraying the horrific details of war. Blood was everywhere, bombs were going off in every direction, bullets whizzed past everyone. Special effects were A+ everywhere. Switching from shots of units to shots of near-death individuals, the film made sure viewers knew exactly what was happening.<br/><br/>After the rifles have cooled down a bit towards the middle of the film, Spielberg started to employ calmer camera shots and movements. Shots were slower but nevertheless effective. One may never even notice the cuts, as the shots are fluid and 'invisible'. This shows Spielberg is still taking consideration into these shots but is avoiding anything unnecessary. From low angles to close ups, the viewer involuntarily receives the messages Spielberg wants to convey.<br/><br/>Almost the whole film was actually a flashback, which the viewer learns towards the end. The low angle shot of Pvt Ryan(Matt Damon) beautifully dissolves into a low angle shot of Grandpa Ryan. (not his grandpa) This ties everything together; the old man in the very beginning was actually Ryan who visited the grave of Cpt Miller(Tom Hanks) and had a flashback of the war, which was followed by him coming back to the present. How Spielberg made the actual film in this manner provided such a stronger impact on the viewer towards the end than if it wasn't a flashback at all."
"dcorbie12","9","1","2","29 November 2011"," This movie is a great display of human nature
","Yes, Saving Private Ryan (1998) by Steven Spielberg is a war film but it can be seen as much more than that. Throughout the film, Spielberg placed a great emphasis on the emotional and psychological effects that a war can place on soldiers. Captain Miller's platoon is put through several situations that cause them to lose loved ones and throw morals out the window as their mentality about life changes. Their grueling lives are shown to be an example of the real aspects of war and let people around the world think differently.<br/><br/>As the soldiers are placed on Normandy beach, they have a hatred for the German soldiers that can be seen throughout the battlefield. Some soldiers yelled ""Don't shoot, Let them Burn"" while others shot the ""enemy"" point blank even when the Germans surrendered. No mercy was given. The soldiers lost their human nature and became angry killing machines. Their hatred blinded them from seeing that the Germans were human beings also who were, in some cases, ordered to be on the battlefield. Just as American soldiers were drafted into the war.<br/><br/>In a later scene where Private Wade dies, the effects of the war are seen taking a toll on the soldier. Several soldiers hit, torture, and ridicule the German soldier for killing one of their beloved members. Imagine watching one of your good friend dying in front of you. That moment will have a great impact on you since you will be living with that memory forever. These soldiers had to face this moment so rage overcomes them to hurt the German soldier. Even when the German desperately tries to relate to the Americans by singing American songs and chanting ""F--- Hitler"" and the captain lets him go, some of the soldiers still want revenge. The hardship of the war is psychologically affecting them. Their hatred begins to build and build to the point where the soldiers yell back and forth while holding the other at gun point. The tension just keeps rising.<br/><br/>The last battle scene showed a great representation of the effects of the war and showed a change in some of the characters attitude. After the frustration of losing two soldiers, Private Reiben was livid when Private Ryan didn't want to leave his post. Edward Burns (Reiben) gave an excellent performance of this frustration that his character later turned into a brotherhood. He began to let go of the hatred to fight side by side with Ryan as did the other soldiers to successfully protect the bridge. <br/><br/>When Corporal Upham shoots the German soldier, who was let free from the Wade scene, was a special moment in the last battle scene. I think that Upham was a representation of innocence being deteriorated by war. Throughout the film, Upham was the morally right character who believed in doing things the right way. He had a special innocence during the war. But after seeing the soldier shoot the captain, that innocence is gone. At this point, he begins to see the life of war for what it really is. Upham gains a war mentality and kills the German soldier. With no regrets.<br/><br/>This film was a medium to let viewers get a peek of the lives of soldiers in wars. But I also feel that this film ask important questions like, When considering the amount of deaths, is war really the answer?"
"diesel2410","10","1","2","22 November 2011"," Unbelievable
","What a breathtaking film. <br/><br/>You honestly know exactly what these soldiers are feeling, it's unbelievable. I've never sat through a 3-hour movie without being bored. Well, this was the first time I was not bored. Whenever there wasn't war action, there was emotionally touching moments that grabbed your attention even more. Just...wow. Also, most of the battle scenes were incredibly accurate. The first scene, ""D-Day"" was EXTREMELY accurate that my old history teacher let us watch it for an accurate depiction. After doing the research, almost the whole 20 minute scene was historically accurate. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, but it's well worth the 3 hours. One of my favorite movies of all time.

","First off, I absolutely loved this movie the first time I saw it, and I still love it. The first hour of the movie is about as real of a depiction of war as Hollywood can get, and to this day I have not seen a more realistic and justifiably gruesome and wrenching depiction of war. Probably one of the most intense moments of the movie is not when the actual fighting is happening, but when the letters are being written to the families of the deceased soldiers, and the subsequent visit to the Ryan farm. The last hour or so of the movie was a little over the top for me, considering how Spielberg had made the first hour of combat seem so believable, but I digress. The soundtrack is excellent, and the style of filming is vintage Spielberg. The length of the movie a nearly three hours may discourage some of the viewers, but this one is definitely worth it."

While in real life an individual named private Ryan did not exist, the director makes you feel everything that the troops are feeling through use of sight and sound. This film in my opinion is a classic that all generations must witness. This movie is not for children however due to graphic content.

"jpaskorz","Null","1","2","28 October 2011"," Mastepiece
","Steven Spielberg has created another masterpiece along with his famous Schindler's List. It can speak for itself with all the Academy Awards it won such as Best Director, and multiple nominations like Tom Hanks for Best Actor. This movie released in 1998 is ahead of its time. After watching it, I considered it to be an instant American classic. <br/><br/>The movie starts off in modern day with a family walking with their elderly veteran of World War II in a Memorial Cemetery. They follow him to a grave labeled Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) where he breaks down and begins to cry. The story then flashes back to 1994 following Tom Hanks as he storms Normandy Beach on D-Day. <br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that reals you in right away in the first 30 minutes, then Saving Private Ryan is that movie. The first half hour of this movie are the U.S troops storming Omaha Beach in Normandy, and I believe this is the best war action sequence of all time. It is shockingly intense as it portrays the horrific realism of war at its finest. It really makes your stomach weak when it gives Tom Hanks point of view where he sees men literally trying to survive the onslaught American Soldiers. After the first 30 minutes, the story then goes on to tell how Captain John H. Miller and seven other men must search for a paratrooper, James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of 4 who served in the U.S. Army. The opening Omaha Beach scene reveals the death of the other 3 brothers who were killed in action. <br/><br/>The morale of all these men are at an all-time low after watching their fellow soldiers being slaughtered on Omaha beach. To make things even harder for them, they are now chosen to go on a dreadful mission that increases the chances of losing their lives. The possibility of finding Private James Francis Ryan is almost impossible or as Miller says, it's like finding ""a needle in a stack of needles"". All of the men have seen combat before except one, Upham, who is just a translator. They all have an internal conflict of why they have to put their lives on the line to save someone they don't even know is even alive. <br/><br/>The movie is based off a flashback of a World War II veteran. The movie has the ability to suck you and make you feel as if you are in the battle yourself because of its realism due to sound and special effects of machine guns, grenades, army tanks, and explosions. What makes the movie so intense that there is no music throughout the story. Music is usually used to set the tone of a scene or hint things to the viewer. Adding no music to the story gives the viewer a hellish and gloom feeling for the characters. The only music is nondiegetic and is played before and after the flashback of James Francis Ryan. It is a brutal movie, yet that is what makes it so satisfying. <br/><br/>This movie would not be what it is if the lead role was not performed by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks has the credentials after winning multiple academies for Best Actor in Philadelphia and Forest Gump and was nominated for Best Actor in this movie. He plays the role of a humble captain leading seven men on a nearly impossible mission. He does an amazing job displaying fear with his actions such as shaky hands before battle, and then shows great poise during battle. He still keeps in mind that the only way back to his wife is to find Private Ryan. The supporting cast does their job to create an epic movie, but do not nearly do as well as job as Tom Hanks. Edward Burns' Reiben, who appears to be one of Miller's best men in the film who uses pessimistic humor to cover up his doubts of the mission at hand. Jeremy Davies who plays as Upham, creates a character who will make you scream at his cowardice, but also makes it extremely believable and sympathetic because of the gruesomeness of war he witnesses. The climax of the movie is when Matt Damon, Private Ryan, is found. He plays his role very well as you feel compassion for the soldier after he hears the loss of his close brothers. There was only one little problem with the movie the movie although it still does not make the outcome any different about how I feel. When the men discover that Private James Francis Ryan was still alive, Private Ryan refuses to go home because it's unfair to the others. My grandfather was in the Korean War which was not even close to being as bad as World War II, and he left with no hesitation. My good friend told me his grandfather laughed at that scene because he said no man wanted to be there. If you talk to any war veteran they would say they would leave in a heartbeat. Especially in Private Ryan's case, he is the only remaining child in his family which should be motivation enough. However, one could depict it as commitment to military service or patriotism. <br/><br/>Usually when I watch an American war film, it is either an action film of heroism or of tragedy. This movie contains both and that is what makes it unique and compelling to watch. The plot of this film is amazing because of gripping realism. I still cannot describe the outstanding intensity of the battle scenes throughout the movie thanks to the Direction of Steven Spielberg. As the men travel through Europe, you may ask yourself throughout the movie, ""Is one man's life worth the lives of eight others"". The movie is a must see for audiences of age 17 and older."

","This film deserves the title of film. It is not just a movie. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of instilling historical accuracy. He made it a priority and it paid off. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that will stand the test of time. I could show this to someone who knew nothing of world war 2 and they would be quickly caught up on the things that happened. The characters portrayed the actual feelings of soldiers during the time. Most soldiers were scared and unsure. Most war movies portray fearless and unquestioning soldiers, which is not accurate. After the Sullivan brothers this type of situation was more common. This is informative yet interesting. It is not dry like most other informative pieces. This is also addresses the fact that most veterans are still affected by the war."

","This is one of the greatest war movies I have ever seen. I feel they did a really good job portraying the emotions of the people. The opening scene was amazing with how realistic he got it to be, with them throwing up in the boat and getting shot before they got off the boat. I like how they made the towns look old and made replicas and what not of the tanks and weapons they used. I also like how when they finally found private ryan he wouldn't leave his squad behind and that he would stay there and fight the enemy. I was really surprised in the end when cpt. Miller died because it was one of those things you don't expect to happen."

","I found this movie to be enjoyable even though there are some historical inaccuracies. I feel that this movie does an incredible job of portraying the landing at Omaha. Even though the portrayal is not exactly how it happened, it gives the audience a glimpse of what it was like to be storming the beach. I felt that Spielberg did a good job in the way that he showed the explosions. In a lot of movies when a bomb goes off its just a big fireball. When bombs and artillery hit things in this movie debris actually falls and it looks a little more realistic. Another thing that a lot of war movies get wrong is that they show people die automatically after being shot. In this movie not everyone dies instantaneously after being shot, which in my eyes is more war-like. Another aspect I thought this movie did right was the amount of ammunition. You always see guys in movies shoot constantly without reloading or running out of ammo. For example, when the one German soldier comes up the stairs a hand to hand battle ensues because the two Americans were out of ammo. You can pick any movie apart if you look for errors. The big picture is what counts and this movie is accurate in the way it depicts war for the most part."

","I liked this movie a lot. I was really into it because of how action packed it was. Also it was very realistic. Now that i have seen this movie i have a better idea of how the war was, and what kind of bad things happened. I liked how it portrayed the soldiers being scared and nerves. I also thought found it kind of interesting that the main character Tom Hanks dies at the end of the movie. I did not see that coming. I also like the story line itself. I liked how they had to go find private ryan. The movie changed my moods a lot because of how realistic it was. At some points in the movie i wanted to cry. Now that i have seen this movie i understand why some people that served in the war did not want to see this movie, or had to walk out during it. Most of the movie was very accurate. I think this is a good movie to show to people if you're trying to show them how the war was, and some of the horrible things that happened in it. This movie was great and i rated it ten stars. I would love to watch it again."

","Saving Private Ryan is an incredibly good movie. Not only was it historically accurate, it was very entertaining. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon performed very well. The accuracy during the opening scene when Normandy was attacked was very well shot. Most movies I've seen are inaccurate because so many things go the way of the heroes. Saving Private Ryan took me by surprise because it shows the constant struggle, both physically, mentally, emotionally etc. Event though the story might not have happened as far as soldiers saving Private Ryan, it is a very good story and can be thought of as a great movie in my opinion. Saving Private Ryan will be added to my collection of my all-time favorites! Tom Hanks has got me interested in World War Two"

","This movie was an awesome representation of D-Day and supplemental missions. I thought that the although 'fake' mission to save Private Ryan was also fairly accurate. People do not realize that war was a terrible place to be and that many people did not die as quickly and peacefully as other movies depict. I also must commend the director for portraying the character of Upham. Spielberg created a character that everyone absolutely hated. The screenplay as well as cinematic feel of the movie were better than any other movie to date in my opinion. The inaccuracies of the movie do not take away from the story and are all just minor things that most people overlook. The major flaws are not even that big of a deal, just things with emblems and the such. All in all, this movie shows a fairly accurate portrayal of WWII."

","I thought that Saving Private Ryan was a well put together movie. It is very realistic to everyone that watches it, but especially to the War Veterans. This is one of those movies that will hit you emotionally, but at the same time you will want to watch it over and over again. The actors did a really great job, and Steven Spielberg did his part in directing this really great movie too. Anyone who reads this review should try to watch this movie, even though it was made in 1998 you would think that it was made just a few years ago or earlier, That's how great this movie actually is. I will never get bored watching this movie, and I give full respect for every person that has ever served in war, because it takes a lot of strength and courage to do what these men and women did, and still do today."
"faith_rapp","9","1","2","25 October 2011"," Saving Private Ryan Review
","This film deserves historical recognition. Private Ryan's story is loosely based on the story of the Niland brothers. The Niland brothers all went into the war, and only two of the four survived. When our guys landed on the beach, Steven Spielburg did an excellent job at making it realistic. He didn't have all of our guys ready to fight and kill the Germans; he showed that some or the soldiers wouldn't have been able to handle it. He showed their fear. He also did a very good job of making us not like the translator. I liked how Speilburg ran the story line of actually going out and saving Private Ryan. This way, the audience got a chance to connect with the characters, and it gave the death of Wade in particular a lot more of an impact. Like all war movies, they got stuff wrong. Some of the weapons fired more than they would have been capable of the time period, or blew up before they got hit. I think Tom Hanks did an incredible job of playing his role, and that the audience was able to pick up on that. Also, the ending was a complete blind side. I thought for sure the old guy in the beginning was Captain Miller because of how they introduced him, and to find out that it was actually Private Ryan who survived caught me completely off guard. I also thought that it was ironic that the soldier who wanted to leave the mission was the only one out of the eight to survive. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about how combat on D-Day actually went. Saving Private Ryan had to be one of my favorite war movies of all time."
"michael_stoltzfus","9","1","2","25 October 2011"," Saving Private Ryan Summary
","I thought that this movie was a great change of pace. The DDay scene was a great depiction of what actually happened on that day. It showed how the soldiers acted, and most of the people today would be very surprised to see that. I thought searching for Private Ryan was a great story line. You got to know the characters and really understand what soldiers felt when they went into battle. Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies because of its real life action scenes. They actually have to reload in most movies it seems like no one is reloading and no one misses. Saving Private Ryan shows them running out of ammo, missing close shots, and throwing your helmet because that is the first thing that comes to mind. That is why i think that Saving Private Ryan is such a good movie."

","This movie was really great, and really showed how it was back then during that war. The characters really did not over exaggerate any part that they had. If I wouldn't of know this was a movie I would think that this would be some clips from that war. Steven Spielberg did an awesome job. I would watch this movie again if I could. Definitely a great war movie. The place they shot it at looked so real. Tom Hanks did an awesome job as well, he worked with the other soldiers. My favorite part would probably be when they found Private Ryan. He really stood up about himself and his other soldier friends. He obviously did not want to go anywhere."
"amanpreet_somal","Null","1","2","11 October 2011"," An emotional eye opener!
","Before beginning with this review I must say this movie is Tom Hanks BEST acting role out of all of all his many different roles he has played. As the movie progresses it show the bonds of brotherhood that are made with soldiers during a very dark period. As this movie continues, you (the viewer) also get caught up with these bonds and you almost feel like you belong while watching this spectacular movie. I must praise Steven Spielberg for his directing in this movie, as the bonds between the soldiers of war continues you are able to feel the pain, suffering and emotions that soldiers go through as they take their last breaths. Although this movie is based on a dark period of time, this movie becomes an eye opener to the general public of how painful and cruel wars can be. Although we cannot ever fully understand the pain and suffering soldiers go through in a war I believe that this film is the closest representation of the suffering and pain in a war that can ever be expressed in a movie. This is a very amazing and emotional movie which WILL leave you in tears."

","Well, in most of the reviews written about this movie, you can find one thing in common i.e the first 30 minutes of war scene depiction. No doubt that is one of the best ever war depictions ever made. We've never been to any war to vouch for something as real. But the first few minutes of the movie looks like straight from the battleground. A sheer raw terror is unleashed. <br/><br/>The story is all about saving one person whose all three brothers are dead. According to a policy of the US government, the lone survivor of the family should be saved. The whole movie shows the efforts of the U.S troops to find out the person. <br/><br/>There is some amount of banality in the movie.

That being said, I still loved this movie.<br/><br/>For one it was shot perfectly, the scenes that don't involve fighting are nice and still, and the scenes that have fighting have just a little shaky cam, not too much to make me angry and dizzy. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are great, as well as the rest of the cast. THe production value is very hight, every explosion is great, and most importanly, I was never bored.<br/><br/>Every thing kept my interest, the fighting, the struggles of the crew, by the end, I actually wished it had been a little longer, and that is the sign of a very good flick."

So the general orders Cpt Miller and his men to find him. There were some scenes that really made me cry. like when the medic died. And there were other scenes that warmed me like when Appam (he's the shy translator) was giving a cigarette to the German that killed Wayne the medic.

"mnpollio","Null","1","2","1 August 2011"," Great opening sequence, then downhill into overrated territory
","Following the WW2 D-Day Normandy Beach landing, a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks are dispatched on a glorified public relations stunt to locate and retrieve the title private from the front lines.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg can be a great filmmaker, but one must beware of his ""serious"" efforts designed to win over his detractors, film critics and Oscar voters. These ""serious"" films can run from the masterful like The Color Purple or Schindler's List (despite a few missteps in its final moments) to overrated misfires (The Empire of the Sun). SPR falls squarely in the overrated, mediocre category. Oscar voters actually made the correct decision in passing it over for the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>The opening moments - depicting the Normandy landing - are impressive. Unfortunately, the film loses that momentum the moment its story kicks in. For one thing, no one is rooting for a mission that takes these men into danger for what is basically a rather asinine publicity stunt. While it is true that the U.S. Armed Forces did attempt to return home men whose siblings had all died serving their country to avoid wiping out an entire generation of a family, this was done by sending word to that soldier's unit of his planned extraction and then doing so at a convenient moment. Entire platoons were never sent on glorified rescue missions for low-level serviceman that placed large numbers of people at unnecessary risk. So the plot is largely preposterous.<br/><br/>While there are a number of great war films that can get away with presenting types in place of three-dimensional characters, this film is not one of them. There is very little camaraderie among these men and they largely blur together. We know them less as individuals than by the types they are presented as - and none of them are truly able to break out of these constrictions. For instance, we identify them solely as the second in command, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the newbie coward, the medic, the sniper, the jerk.<br/><br/>Incredibly for Spielberg, who usually features rich cinematography, this film is ugly to even look at. Everything is filmed in shades of gray, washed-out blue and dirt colors, often using a jittery hand-held camera for a ""you are there"" feel that functions more to generate either a headache or motion sickness rather than any sort of authenticity.<br/><br/>Once the men start off on their mission, the story repeats the same steps over and over again. One of the men will reveal something minor about themselves (i.e., a personality trait) and then be brutally killed in the next scene in the most drawn-out agonizing way possible. Then the men will trudge forth, another man will reveal something, and then be eviscerated in the following scene. One could almost do a Lawrence Welk to this - ""And a one-a, and a two-a and BLAM!"" The predictability of the action becomes wearisome and the only suspense lies in figuring what manner of unspeakable demise will pop up next. Will it be a bloody gunshot wound or will someone be blasted apart with Spielberg uncharacteristically allowing the gore and body parts to drench the jitter-cam? This predictable nature also allows to realize exactly where the film is headed.<br/><br/>For instance, if the film remains true to clichés, then once the surviving men meet Private Ryan, we anticipate that he will be a sunny all-American young man impossible to hate. We also anticipate that he will be a stand-up guy that will refuse to abandon the other members of his squadron in their hour of need, so that the surviving members of his rescue mission will be suitably impressed enough to stay to fight with them. When the diminished rescue party does reach him and be turns out to be Matt Damon, drawing out his biggest aw-shucks grin and practically oozing middle-American likability, you know the film has no surprise anywhere on its repertoire.<br/><br/>The majority of the supporting cast could change their roles and no one would notice so little impact are they allowed to make and so few are the facets to their respective characters. Two exceptions that stand out (and not in a good way) are Jeremy Davies' absolute descent into pure ham with his breakdown on the stairs and Edward Burns' unintended utter obnoxiousness throughout the course of the film. Tom Hanks is likable as usual, but he is playing...Tom Hanks. Only this time, with a slight quiver to his hand to key us in on the toll this war is taking on him.<br/><br/>By the time the film rolls into its final moments, it has been an exhausting, unpleasant viewing experience - or something misguided people like to pretend is ""powerful"". Anyone with an iota of sense knows that ""war is hell"", but that does not mean we want to pay to have it inflicted on us for nearly 3 hours without break. I think I finally had enough at the climax when one of the men held on to a grenade too long and literally blew apart - with all of the gore that implies. I stayed to the foregone conclusion, but I think I had shut off from that moment on.<br/><br/>And a foregone conclusion it is since Spielberg rather strangely opens the film with the elderly living Ryan visiting Arlington cemetery and then closes it again with him in another one of his clumsy codas. I have no idea what to say when Ryan turns to his family and wonders if the men's sacrifice was all worth it. However, I do know that this film, despite its most ardent admirers should not be considered one the great war films ever made. For all of its patriotism and attempts at realism, for all its brutality and in-your-face approach, its story and characters are just not worth that amount of consideration."
"ryan-craven","10","1","2","6 June 2011"," A powerful,emotional and uncompromising war epic.
","The first half an hour of Saving Private Ryan is pure cinematic brilliance. Bullets whoosh past, soldiers search through the blood drenched sea bed for their broken limb, cry for their mums as their guts squeeze out of their stomach. It's scarily realistic, mentally scarring and utterly compelling. Although the rest of the film doesn't reach the dizzy heights the first 20 minutes managed to, it comes damn near close.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks once again shows his charisma, versatility and range,in the role of Capt.Miller assuring us still that he is one of the best a-list actors around. The supporting cast more than match him, the pick of the bunch being Tom Sizemore as a reliable Sergeant. <br/><br/>Spielberg's ambition and emotionally resonant directing makes sure that this film hits all the right footnotes, from unflinching battle scenes to emotional speeches. The only thing that holds this back is the script's nack of sneaking slightly into sentiment, especially in the prologue and the epilogue. But that is just a minor bum note in an ultimately groundbreaking, powerful war movie classic."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","2","1 June 2011"," ""Where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?""
","Truly a war film for the ages. The battles are long, bloody, and intense. In between, each scene is loaded with tension and suspense. In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible. It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.<br/><br/>The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.<br/><br/>One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me. Incidentally, it didn't make sense to the story's characters either, and as they discuss and find the value in the issue, the story works in its own bizarre way.<br/><br/>Additionally, the scene in the middle of the film (where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity) struck me as dumb and unnecessary. The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything. Music is a little overly-sentimental at times, but good in other parts.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 5/5)"

","Steven Spielberg's biggest hit to date is the epic war film, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film follows around eight men in World War II, saving one soldier, whose three brothers were killed, and is the only brother alive. The film has powerful scenes of war and drama that teaches us the horror and drama of the war. Only Steven Spielberg, and his brilliant cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, & Matt Damon, can bring an amazing motion picture that takes a deep step closer and closer until the film has its reaching point. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances of his whole career, Edward Burns was pretty impressive for his role, and Matt Damon had the shortest scenes in the whole movie, but those were good scenes. Steven Spielberg always delivers fine directing in all of his movie, but this one takes the cake. Everything about this movie, from the incredible cinematography, the intense film editing, to the explosive sound, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was one heck of a thrill. Though the war scenes were long and graphic, that does not stop the film's power. This film happens to be one of Spielberg's best movies yet. Also, the movie felt like a moving bio-diary of the many soldiers losing their lives in World War II. The movie felt personal, moving, emotional, and there are so many things to say about this movie, that I don't have time to say it all. This movie will always be a piece of history to me. Steven Spielberg really knows how to make a dramatic, well-acted war movie with a heart. ""Saving Private Ryan"", in my review, ""Emotionally powerful, and completely excellent."""
"dabatl","10","1","2","2 May 2011"," Epic in Every Sense
","Seeing this movie at home does not do it justice. I remember being speechless and overcome with emotion at the end of the Omaha Beach landing. It was such a spectacle to see on the big screen at the cinema that I went to watch it on back-to-back nights. Spielberg does a fantastic job of putting you right in the middle of one of the most remembered and heroic days in American history. Those who do not have an appreciation for our fighting forces and the freedom they have provided us with will undoubtedly change their tune after the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is truly one of the best movies of the past 25 years. At the time, I did not think Tom Hanks could pull off the leading role in this movie. I was dead wrong. Hanks' brings a human element to the movie, which makes it work. Cast anyone else in the role of Captain Miller and I doubt the movie would have succeeded the way it did.<br/><br/>I am not one to shed a tear during movies, but this one made me cry several times. Can you, as parents, imagine what it would be like to find out you lost a loved one during wartime? Well, Spielberg shows that when Ryan's mother crumbles to the ground at the sight of a priest coming to her door. What about the older James Francis Ryan dropping to his knees at the sight of Private Miller's grave? Asking his wife if he lived up to what Miller and his crew did for him? This is emotional stuff and at the very core of being a good human being. One who looks out and cares for others.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast of this movie is fantastic. Each brings something different to the table and it works because Spielberg allows you to engage and relate with each character. Between battle sequences, you learn a little about each character, where they are from and who they are. This is what film making is about and there is none better than Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this movie, but I won't. I would suggest that everyone watch this movie and become more enlightened about the horrors of war, how it affects those within it and how these warriors share a common bond, ultimately making them brothers in arms."

He's also known today as one of the most wealthiest filmmakers in the world.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is just an amazing actor. The kind that REALLY puts his soul towards his character/role and plays towards perfection. He's known for 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', 'The Green Mile', 'Apollo 13', 'Sleepless in Seattle', and 'Big'.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is by far one of the best war films I've seen, as well as one of Spielberg's best. It features outstanding acting, terrific cinematography, a powerful storyline, and of course, Captivating direction.<br/><br/>Hanks doesn't disappoint as Captain John Miller. He plays the character with determination, fear, and dedication. One of the BEST performances I've seen from him. Matt Damon is great too, in his brief, yet convincing role. Edward Burns and the rest of the soldiers are simply terrific.<br/><br/>Well-done cinematography is experienced throughout the film.

","Every casual movie fan knows the notorious first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and rightfully so. This introduction is just absolutely breath-taking, World War II has never been so close and in your face. However, a thing that's regularly ignored is that the other 120 minutes are really just as good. The characters are all pretty compelling, even Vin Diesel's performance is very convincing. You really manage to get to know all these people throughout the second act and you can sympathize with all of them, which in a way is kind of a bummer when they start dying on us. Screenwriter Robert Rodat puts in a whole bunch of war movie clichés (the inevitable emotional highlight!), but let's be honest, who doesn't love war movie clichés? I wouldn't say this is the definitive World War II movie because there's no such thing, but it does provide some really interesting angles."
"nEoFILM","9","1","2","14 March 2011"," Groundbreaker mired in slop
","Regarded as one of the best war films ever made, it certainly qualifies. The opening twenty minutes are still as breathtaking, shocking and disturbing realistic as they were back in 1998. It is hard to imagine that it has now been over twelve years since Saving Private Ryan broke the mold of World War II film making.<br/><br/>Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Director for Spielberg, Best Cinematography, and Sound, which was astonishing, even by today's standards, it failed to win Best Picture, losing out to Shakespeare In Love. Shakespeare In Love! Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but easily forgettable compared to Ryan, only proving yet again that if you touch upon the British monarchy you get Oscars.<br/><br/>The film is a fictional account of four brothers, all serving in the U.S. Army, three of which were killed in action on or around the D-Day landings. The fourth, James Ryan played by Matt Damon is somewhere in Europe, and Tom Hanks with his platoon are sent to bring him home, to spare his mother anymore heartache.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who was also snubbed at the 1998 Oscars for his perfect performance as Captain Miller, the everyman who was losing himself in the horrors of war, underplayed his role perfectly. He is believable on every level, emotionally, physically and has a sense of subtly with makes him of Hollywood's greats.<br/><br/>The action is visceral, gritty and horrifying. But never played for crass effect. Scenes of soldiers intestines spilling out, limbs flying a sunder and brutal killing left, right and centre are recreated for one purpose. To truly demonstrate the horrors of war, and to change our perceptions of the global conflict which had almost become a joke, a setting for gung- ho action films, where the Yanks reign supreme and single-handedly win the war.<br/><br/>This shows troops crying, hurting and making decisions which should not be made under any moral circumstances, but you understand why, whether you agree or not. There is no doubt that Spielberg is not innocent of making an American film, but it is about as even-handed as you might expect, with the exception of Tora! Tora! Tora! or The Longest Day.<br/><br/>So, the action is first-rate, graphic and perfectly toned to recreate to horror of the last century's greatest and most of destructive conflicts. But that's only half the story.<br/><br/>The other half is the talking, reminiscing and the almost sepia tone is more than a little cloying. The U.S. General's monologues, which seem to consist almost entirely of Lincoln quotations are overly sentimental, erring on the side of sloppy patriotism rather than Jingoism, which is hardly a bad thing but it isn't good either.<br/><br/>The civilian scenes, such as Mrs Ryan, washing a plate as she sees the car drive down to road to inform her of her sons deaths are so sentimental that they jar against the realism of the war scenes. It's not so much contrast as it is as extreme as black and white.<br/><br/>The action is obviously interspersed, as all war films are, with rest stops and moments of talking, pondering etc., but the scenes drag on too long and disrupt the tone of the film. On the other hand, the direction is brilliant when explaining the situations during and around the action, but Spielberg seemed to think that we needed these sloppy and often boring moments, such as The Church, and the outside the cafe in Ramelle, to express the emotional torment of the characters, but I think that these scenes are so boring and pointless that I' can hardly remember them, as my attention drifts off during them! But I do have an understanding of the soldiers, and this was achieved, quite adorably without these scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film of two halves if ever there was one. The battle scenes and the journey through war-torn France are brilliant, gritty and educational, but the scenes of American sentimentality are in danger of derailing the whole film. Many feel that is the best war film of all time. I do not agree, favouring Black Hawk Down over this, but I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that Blank Hawk Down owes a debt to Saving Private Ryan, by opening the door to the gritty war dramas of the naughties and to the style itself.<br/><br/>This film is on of the most important contributions to cinema ever, and has done so much to finally show to true nature of WWII and war in general. But even though I would rate this 10/10 if it was just for the war scenes, the slop just gets in the way and devalues what should have been perfection."
"ti_ffy","10","1","2","27 February 2011"," Powerful. (SPOILERS!)
","While ""Saving Private Ryan"" may not be 100% accurate to the events of World War II, but we must remember it is a fictional movie that is based within real events and it isn't a documentary. I believe that it is an incredible film. There are so many powerful moments and brilliant performances from nearly every member of the cast.<br/><br/>Giovanni Ribisi is the stand out to me with a powerhouse performance as Medic Irwin Wade, and also the most underrated performance in the movie. Every line he uttered, and every facial expression he gave during his time on screen was met with meaning and sincerity. Without a word you could tell what he was feeling. There are several stand-out moments, such as when the men were resting in a church, Wade is re-writing a letter that was covered in the blood of fallen soldier Adrian Caparzo (brilliantly portrayed by Vin Diesel), in which he had written to his parents. Wade begins talking about his mother, and tears glaze his eyes. Later, Ribisi has me reaching for a tissue as his character suffers several gunshots and calls for his mother.<br/><br/>I think everyone should give this movie a chance. It may not be for you, but if you enjoy war movies, this one is definitely a recommendation from me."

","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie of all time, it beats apocalypse now by a long shot. I've seen this movie dozens of times now and the opening battle scene on Omaha Beach never ceases to amaze me. The realistic war scenes are gory and violent, but that's exactly what our great WW2 hero's had to go through.<br/><br/>The acting was great all the way around by all the actors, especially by Tom Hanks. I've seen other war movies but none have compared to this, so why are there some idiots out there who say it's overrated? They obviously are jealous they don't have the talent to create a masterful war film like this.<br/><br/>And by the way, I still don't understand why the Academy Awards didn't give this best picture in 1999, the voters to me were obviously paid off by the Shakespeare in Love producers."
"philiphulvey","9","1","2","22 February 2011"," Realistically great but grim!
","This has got to be one of the best movies ever made! If its not my favorite, then its definitely one of them! From the introductory D-Day scene to the final battle in Ramelle, Spielberg does a fantastic job making the viewers feel like they're in the soldiers' shoes. The horror these men have to encounter throughout the film's battles is something that has definitely changed the war movie genre for good, as for the audiences viewing it, making it a model for its genre.<br/><br/>Even though it may occasionally seem patriotic (frequent when it comes to WW2 movies, right?), Saving Private Ryan portrays human beings as being fragile and not necessarily persuaded by the cause they're fighting for. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), for instance, only goes on with this mission that his men consider suicidal because he's fed up with this whole manslaughter and just wants to go home.<br/><br/>The only problem I'd give to this movie would be that the German soldier who grimly kills private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) is the same one the unit encountered and nearly executed while taking control of the radar site. The fact that the same guys had to run coincidently into the same soldier again, out of the 100 or so other Germans in the battle, was kinda dumb, but that little problem was not enough to ruin the movie by a long shot!<br/><br/>I can't believe this movie didn't get the Academy Award for best picture, but it definitely earned its 5 others for directing, photography, editing, sound and sound effects!<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film for about everything in it, from the acting and morality to the incredibly realistic special effects."

"MrGKB","9","1","2","15 February 2011"," One of Spielberg's crowning achievements...
","...""Saving Private Ryan"" is likely to remain in my Top 10 Favorite War Movies for a long, long time. I'm taking the time to post this edited version of a review I wrote back when I first saw the film (opening night, 1998) not because I think anyone on this site will care (or even read it), but because I feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site. I watched the film again a few days ago (probably at least my twentieth viewing), and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent one.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is a film about honor, at its core, and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask. Director Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants, and raise questions for which there are no confident answers, if indeed there ever have been any at all.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is symmetric, opening and closing in a Normandy military cemetery, where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade. Book-ended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questions.<br/><br/>I say the film is about honor, and it is. What else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor? And in the process of doing so, the most difficult of all choices must be made--whether to sacrifice one's own life that others might live, or make ""the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country."" Spielberg's exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and, in keeping with the general tenor of the film--terrifying, numbing, disorienting, and possessed of a great sorrow--he never provides sophistic or glib answers. He leaves us at film's end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense, with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questions.<br/><br/>Where is the honor in war? What is the relative value of a man's life? On a personal level, is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering? Other films have tackled these questions in the past, but rarely had such visceral impact. A sniper's duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe; a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective ""sticky bomb"": an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement. Critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded, bloodthirsty audience, but they miss the point. Spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic ""Grand Guignol"" that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message: killing people, especially ones that are trying to kill you, is a brutish, messy business, and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelled.<br/><br/>After an opening 25-minute barrage that sets the tone, Spielberg and Rodat's story begins to unfold. Capt. John Miller (Tom ""Forrest Gump"" Hanks) must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a Private James Francis Ryan (Matt ""Good Will Hunting"" Damon), the sole surviving brother of four. Ryan is somewhere behind enemy lines, a trooper of the scattered 101st Airborne Division, who had dropped the night before the invasion. It is D+3 and Miller has orders from General George Marshall to bring Ryan out of the raging Normandy battle, to be returned to the safety of his motherland and his family. And so we set off on a trek through hell, a journey that will leave most of its participants dead.<br/><br/>Each man in the squad is an archetype, and a symbol. Pvt.Caparzo (Vin ""Pitch Black"" Diesel) is Innocence, The Child. Wade, the medic (Giovanni ""SubUrbia"" Ribisi), is Mercy, The Angel. Mellish, a Jewish soldier (Adam ""Dazed and Confused"" Goldberg), and Jackson, the prayerful sharpshooter (Barry ""61*"" Pepper), embody twin motivations of Retribution and Righteousness, the Hammer and the Sword, while Sgt. Horvath (Tom ""Natural Born Killers"" Sizemore) and Capt. Miller serve as Fortitude and Conscience, dual engines of strength and courage that keep the small patrol on its fated course.<br/><br/>These are the ones who perish--each slain in ascending order of significance within the simple tapestry of the plot--the human qualities that are inevitably stripped from a man as he confronts the implacable juggernaut of war. The only ones to survive the charnelhouse are Pvt. Rieben (Ed ""The Brothers McMullen"" Burns), the Witness, Chance (""I was born lucky, Captain!""), and tag-along interpreter Cpl. Upham (Jeremy ""Spanking the Monkey"" Davies), the Everyman audience surrogate, the Fool. Ultimately, it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the film.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is not a comfortable film experience. Overly sensitive film-goers will probably be overwhelmed by it; if they can make it through the Omaha beach sequence, they'll do okay. For the rest of us, it's a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received. Personally, I was a bit surprised that it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture over ""Shakespeare in Love,"" especially since Spielberg got the nod for Best Director. Such are the whims of the Academy. Never mind. It takes nothing away from the raw power of ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>Addendum: one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual. The stuttery, bleached-out quality of the film (primarily in the battle sequences) is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation. It's not a tremendous flaw, but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself."
"blazesnakes9","10","1","2","9 January 2011"," The mission is a Man: A Epic War Movie.
","At the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, US soldiers embark on the Ohama Beach in France of D-Day 1944. As the hatches of the U-boats open, hails of gunfire ricochets and hits the metal and soldiers. Many jump off the boat and into the water while the gunfire pierce through the water. Blood filled the ocean with dead soldiers dying. Loud screaming is heard as Captain John H. Miller arrives at the hellish beach with his eyes wide open. As he looks around him, soldiers are seen screaming and some are holding their lives on with fear while some finds out that their arms are shot off. Epic, pure epic. Saving Private Ryan is not a roller-coaster of action, it's triumph. It's a movie where you salute those who fought in Normandy on D-Day in World War II. Steven Spielberg delivers us the horrors, shock and amazement and triumph of World-War II since Schindler's List. I was amaze at what he brought to us. The sheer horror and amazement of World-War II is never forgotten. I have this movie on VHS, the Double Videocassette on DreamWorks, that shows the feature movie and the special edition of the movie. I also felt emotionally driven at the end when the older Private Ryan is seen looking at John H. Miller's cross and grave. He asks his wife if he was a good man and live a good life. After she answers Yes, the camera shows Ryan and his family family in the background. With triumph, he salute Miller's grave as the camera zooms in to shows the description of the grave. The last shot shows the American flag waving the sky. The film fades out. THAT is triumph and showing that American soldiers will never be forgotten. All in all, Saving Private Ryan is a epic war film that will never be forgotten and will be a war movie. ★★★★ 4 stars."

It makes it powerful.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was one the best actors of the 90's. He capped the decade off with one the strongest performances of his career. He shows here why he is Spielberg's favorite actor. He has lots of talent around him. Most notably Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, a must-be guy in war movies. But others like Matt Damon, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore leave the mark too.<br/><br/>War movies are good when they seem realistic. This one for sure is. A classic and a must-see in war genre.

"dunmore_ego","10","1","2","1 January 2011"," A Spielberg fantasy done horribly right.
","What if the United States Military actually possessed a shred of decency and humanity? Shyeh! What if.<br/><br/>In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the people who type the ""Sorry Your Son's Dead"" letters for the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die notice that three letters are addressed to the Ryan family of Anytown USA. Seems three brothers have been killed in the name of assuaging the small-penis insecurities of the American government. There is one more Ryan boy presumably still alive, and the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die now send America's Favorite Son, Tom Hanks, to snatch the last Ryan from the belly of the beast, intending to send him home honorably. Shyeh! What if.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the war movie by which all other war movies will be measured - not for its implausible premise (written by Robert Rodat) and typical propagandistic slant, but for its revolutionary depiction of battle scenes, more brutal than any ever committed to film. Visceral. Nightmarish. Incendiary. Words cannot do justice to the ferocious spectacle and gutshock aftertaste of the opening Normandy invasion.<br/><br/>We meet the Yanks stepping onto the beach at Omaha, the sea more blood than brine, in a frontal assault on the Normandy coast that is going horribly wrong, as the German fortifications on the shoreline mow them down ruthlessly. Steel crossbeam obstacles called ""hedgehogs"" stick nefariously up from the sand in the low tide; planted to mutilate the undersides of boats as they attain the shore - if the tide had kept the hedgehogs hidden underwater - now they ironically provide the only cover for the American troops in a searing firestorm.<br/><br/>During this blood and bone tempest we meet Captain John Hiller (Tom Hanks) trying to stay alive yet move his troops closer to the German machine gun nests and take them out. We are in the crucified heart of the battle, blood on the camera lens, rain dirt muddying the view, machine gun rounds slamming and pinging past like fireballs, gray-green desaturated filmstock and a kind of lens flare sheen around the film edges; internal body parts, severed limbs, ear-numbing explosions; a grimy, hellish, embracing maelstrom of frenzied death.<br/><br/>Spielberg and longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski capture what has never been captured in depictions of battle - desperation, futility, the overwhelming randomness of slugs whizzing by and claiming lives, medics wasting morphine stabs on dying soldiers; confusion and screaming, bodily fluids and exit wounds, intestines mixing with mud - simply the most authentic Cinematic War we have ever seen.<br/><br/>Hiller's mission to Save Private Ryan is painted as a spark of humanity illuminating the gross inhumanity of war. YET. The high command's decision to send a son home to his grieving mother can only be for one reason - not moral, ethical or humane - to make a future politician look golden.<br/><br/>Hiller's ragtag squad consists of Tom Sizemore (scrappy adjutant) Edward Burns (cynic looker), Giovanni Ribisi (the doc), Barry Pepper (holy sharpshooter), Adam Goldberg (resident Jew), Vin Diesel (goombah muscle), and Jeremy Davies (scaredy cat Upham). And each man is created whole, as we discover whenever ""characterization"" sets in during quiet time.<br/><br/>Captain Hiller feels every bladed inch of the Shakespeare axiom, ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"" (Henry IV). He is the victim of one bad decision after anther, not all his fault, but for his shoulders alone to bear. Each man who dies under his command takes him ""one step farther from home."" <br/><br/>When Hiller's troop finds private James Ryan - he is Matt Damon, acting the hell out of the Concerned Face chapter of the Acting for Male Models handbook.<br/><br/>To climax the movie - another skin-searing battle sequence. Spielberg is now just having the time of his life: his crew have the formula down and we are once again struck speechless by the construction of the on screen blitzkrieg that makes all other skirmishes on film look like Monty Python's Batley Townswomens' Guild Battle of Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Chilling - as Goldberg's Jew struggles with a German and is stabbed slowly, deliberately; regretful - as Davies's scaredy-cat Upham could've stopped the stabbing if he had just had the guts to run up a stairway instead of tearfully ascending in fear; twisted - as Pepper's holy sharpshooter prays while he snipes that his lord keep his hand steady and his eye keen, ""You are my tower, you are my shield"" (which should be a morbid contradiction for Christians, that they will instead find reassuring - that ""god"" is supposedly on their side); disturbing - when Ribisi's doc is mortally wounded and he stutters instructions on how to ""operate"" on him, even as his liver is mutilated and the last of the morphine is stabbed into his leg as he expires; amusing - as Sizemore is shot and is madder at his gun jamming than at being shot; ultimately tragic - as Hiller's dying words to Ryan convey his confidence in the unproven worth of humankind, and a simultaneous indictment that Ryan could never hope to live up to: ""Earn this!... Earn it."" <br/><br/>For closure, a general narrates a letter written by the People Who Send Sons Off To Die, to Ryan's mother on how the army is soooo generous for sending James Ryan home, misusing Lincoln's words about her other sons being sacrificed on the ""altar of freedom"" and making our flesh crawl with platitudes, euphemisms and shallow commiserations.<br/><br/>Just think, if Franklin Delano Roosevelt had kept his promise of keeping America out of foreign wars, instead of antagonizing Japan and then entering WWII, he could have saved not only private Ryan, but also the whole godforsaken American army, navy and air force.<br/><br/>But that would entail America actually possessing a shred of decency and humanity.<br/><br/>Shyeh! What if."

The first 20 minutes alone earned Spielberg the Oscar for best director, they are realistic, you can see and really infiltrate the horror of D Day, you can feel the despair, anger, madness and courage of the American soldiers. But what I loved the most was the fight of the principal characters for staying human and earn the right to go home after killing a lot of people, bad guys, but still people. It keeps you at the edge of your sit, wondering if they are gonna be able to find Ryan, and when they do, if they are gonna win the battle at Ramelle. The only negative thing I gotta say about this movie, is that I expected that a principal character would die and surprise! Tom Hanks dies.<br/><br/>Going back to the beginning, the first 20 minutes left my jaw on the floor.

But the episodic plotting is naggingly formulaic, and the coda in a graveyard tips this nearly great film into unfortunate mawkishness.

","Many know Steven Spielberg as one of the most impressive and great film directors. He was the one who brought us Jaws, E.T., Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones movies, and Schindler's List( which I unfortunately haven't had the pleasure of seeing yet). However, Spielberg hasn't made such an emotionally empowering epic in all his life that is Saving Private Ryan. SPR is about eight soldiers who are sent into German territory in World War 2 to find and return home a Private Ryan who's three brothers were killed in combat. Everyone is great here, but the one person who stands out the most is none other than Tom Hanks. Once again, Mr.Hanks plays an Oscar-worthy performance as a troubled American army captain who just wants to return home to his wife. This film successfully captures the brutality and horror of war through up close and shaky, hand-held cameras. You really feel like you're in the battle evading gun fire and witnessing people losing limbs and dieing horrible deaths. In the end, I give kudos to Steven Spielberg for delivering us a gripping and brutal film that has to be one of, if not the best, WWII movies of all time."
"Aaron1375","Null","1","2","30 June 2010"," I enjoyed this war movie for the most part, but after the initial invasion of Normandy scene it falters a bit.
","This movie was like no other the first twenty or so minutes. It took you right into the heart of war like no other movie had done before. The action was tense, the carnage was in your face, and the blood flowed freely. Then the movie added a rather sad excuse for a plot and the rest of the movie suffers because of this. Not to say it was not a good movie from the moment they get the plot on, but it just feels cheapened by the whole, ""lets rescue this one dude"" scenario. Most of the rest of the film is the troops searching from place to place with a few skirmishes here and there. An interesting subplot though involves one of the American soldiers calling for the release of a Nazi that the rest wanted to kill. I found how that played out to be very intriguing. It made for one of the tenses scenes in the movie in my eyes as the one guy was trying to drive the knife in another and you just knew the other guy was going to come in and turn the tide. The cast is excellent as Tom Hanks is at his best here, I can believe he did not get an Oscar for this one and he did get one for ""Forrest Gump"". The only member of the cast I did not care for all that much is Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan, he just did not have a 1940's look to him, or like someone who had been in combat for a while like Hanks' troop. Still, overall this is a very good picture and while I never saw ""Shakespere in Love"" I am still certain this film got robbed. Granted my score is not the best, but that is my level of enjoyment for the film. As a whole it most certainly merited some awards. Change the plot a bit though after the invasion scene and I think this one could have even been a ten to me, a person who really is not all into war movies."
"terry_rocks85-1","7","1","2","26 October 2009"," Excellent Execution...Beautiful Sound
","I read about how some people loved the movie and how some hated it. For those who didn't like it, well it is a movie. It is an effort to replicate the happenings of a long time ago when neither of us was around. Luckily, we do have a few directors who try to get real at such things – they try; some succeed, some make a fool of themselves and some go beyond what the people of then could understand and depict a story they feel is true, complete and powerful enough to support reason.<br/><br/>SPR is a beautiful movie. Yes, it does get a little slow and I did feel that Steven did try forcing out emotions a little in some scenes but that's me – I hate any person who portrays army generals or commanders- I can never understand why do they have to be the wisest of the lot. I'd prefer a more humane leader – some who'd be conflicted, guilty and in the spur of the moment resolve to send in a team, maybe of expendable soldiers to bring out a last son.<br/><br/>So leaving the movie aside, I'd comment on the technicalities. Sound – brilliant. I was way too small when this movie hit the theatres so I saw it at home on my Philips Dolby Surround and it hit me boom, bang & centre. It was piercing, jarring, ambient and well placed. As for the music, John Williams could've done better – it sounded very expected war hero symphony – So far I've not quite found a soundtrack that could outmatch James Horner in Apocalypto; if you find onelet me know.<br/><br/>Cinematography is beautiful. I've not seen a movie look like this. Very well set up and the reduced tones help bring out the sunlight and the serenity. You can see destruction and beauty side by side. The color disappears when it rain, appears in the mornings, the nights are darker so that distant firing can be made out. In all it was very well taught of.<br/><br/>Direction, well I am not going to criticize the man who made Schindler's and Jaws. Steven is the God of film making and he knows it. He has shown it. He moves with the camera, talks through his actors and is super fast at execution – you can feel the spontaneous takes in every scene. Still far from being Kubrick but I doubt there'd be anyone greater.<br/><br/>P.S: Please do not make another Indiana Jones movie. You totally are spoiling what you've earned you know. That goes from me, Stan, Kyle & Eric.<br/><br/>My vote for SPR – 8 / 10."
"Philby-3","7","1","2","12 September 2009"," A visual experience 10 years later
","I saw this when it was first released in 1998 and wrote a review which for some reason never got posted. 500 films later, and seeing Tarantino's very idiosyncratic war movie, ""Inglourious Barsterds"" I was reminded of this one, where the story is played absolutely straight in a way to give the average American patriot goosebumps. Yet the rescuing of Sergeant Ryan (Matt Damon) is actually a cynical effort by the High Command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy. Spielberg's battle scenes are really something – ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach – the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.<br/><br/>Perhaps comparing this blockbuster with Tarantino is not fair, Both films entertain in there own way – Spielberg, who gives us splendid visuals, is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and Tarantino does things his own way and doesn't care who he offends (though he does not make light of atrocity). Has the second world war movie run its course? Even if the answer is ""yes"" we have not seen the end of war movies in general. As long as there are wars there will be movies about them. ""Ryan"" at least tells a coherent story, and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting. Tarantino, on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism, but he does have fun getting there. Spielberg is more hard work, but ""Ryan"" has to be one of his better films."

It really has a forties feel to it and it's really intense. From storming the beach in Normandy to the final battle. It's was good, but don't be fooled. The story itself; didn't actually happen. It was a fictional story mixed into a REAL event. We don't see this much. Titanic anybody?

There's a lot of good battle scenes along the way. It might not be good for the faint of heart. I read that they actually used real amputees for when people got their legs blown off. So, be warned.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is a great film. Stephen Spielberg directing. Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamonti and Vin Diesel were in the mix.

","at the beginning of the movie it starts out on the beaches of normandy, and the action and battle scenarios there are very violent but gnarly at the same time. The movie is very fast paced, with many epic gunfights, but there are also times when the actors show very passionate emotion which gives the story more feeling to go along with the constant killing. the men in the platoon sent to rescue pvt. ryan are goofy fellahs themselves and joke around with each other all the time so there is also some comedyish parts in Saving Private Ryan. the soundtrack to this movie is epic it is well directed and the acting was muy bueno (good) the end of the movie was well done with the fadeout back to the present time and his face changing from young to old!"

","The film was generally very impressive. I liked the accuracy of the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms. The sets were very impressive, and looked just like France did in 1944, even though things were all blown up and so on. The most impressive part to me was not the main actors like Tom Hanks, but the extra's, the random actors who played random soldiers, whether they be dying on the beaches or fighting in the battlefield, or even just laying on the ground, dead. I was impressed by the actors abilities to portray the soldiers ""FUBAR"" attitudes, and then, if needed, portray a death with great realism. The amazing scenes to me are the scenes with any speech, just pictures, like the images of the blood running down the beach, or the dead bodies laying in the bunkers and beachhead, or the scenes of the towns, blown apart and in ruins."

","this movie was an American classic. this is the first time i have seen this movie and i just want to say that it is much better than expected. i have seen many war movies before like band of brothers and Patton and this movie goes right up there with them. the part that i really enjoyed was when they stormed the German radio bunker and they took a German prisoner. the captain then made a controversial choice to let the man go free. later in the final segment of the film we see the same released prisoner fighting against them. i was really surprised when we saw him again because one of the terms of release was that he would turn himself over to the next American unit he saw i thought he would.i also enjoyed that throughout the whole film the captains hand is quivering i think this is a physical manifestation of his mental breakdown. i don't think he ever saw himself becoming a soldier and he is stricken with the grief of all the lives he has cost."

","This movie is one that depicts the environment that a soldier in ww2 would live in. It is a great movie. The way that all of the characters acted throughout the film was, in my eyes, perfect. Each had a large dislike for what they were doing but also, had an urge to do it. They all have small flaws in their character. For instance, Captain Miller has a shaky hand, probably caused by his life in the military and the stress put on by it. Also, it shows how most soldiers are tough, but also have a side that shows the true feelings of their character. Like before some of the men die, they are talking to their mom, or family members. Also, most of the men are smokers and it shows that it is brought on by the war because Upum claims that before he left for the army he never smoked, but he says this with a cigarette in his mouth.In conclusion, this movie is top 5 war movies of all time and should be watched by all."
"piketom1","10","1","2","17 March 2009"," Film Review
","This is a very sad movie. It makes me think about what the war was about and weather or not war is worth the cost that is always paid. How would a mother feel if she had to receive a letter telling her that her son was killed in action? In the letters in the movie is was said that the people who died honorably to protect the freedom of this country. Does that justify young men being send into battle and killed? This movie does an excellent job of posing that question. It does seem to make the argument that it is not worth it. In the film the reason for the Captain wanting to go save Pvt Ryan is so he can go home to his wife. The other point this movie makes about war is that all of the soldiers, even the enemies, are all human. This is evident in the whole movie. The Germans are seen to be evil when they are fighting, but when they surrender they seem like every other character in the movie."
"ethan-hinch-1","10","1","2","17 March 2009"," Spoiler! He Dies! They do not save private Ryan! Fail!
","This movie was at first not rated, because of its gore and violent themes. Some countries refused to show it, because they did not agree with the extreme graphic violence. But Steven Spelburg did not back down, and stood up for what he believed in. He though that the only way to truly portray this movie was to have it include gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. This was the only way to get through to the audience how horrible a conflict World War II was, and why we should do everything possible to make sure it never happens again. Because if it does happen again, we will have to experience Saving Private Ryan firsthand, something none of us want to do. But I digress. The movie is extremely moving, and we can identify with these soldiers who are thrust into conflict without necessarily wanting to. They all have distinctive personalities, and are very original. The battle scenes really opened my eyes to how World War II was like, and the true level of the combat that took place during the war."

","Saving private Ryan was a great representation of the events that occurred during D-day. Some scenes were hard to watch with the realization that events shown in the movie did occur in real life. I would like to have seen more in the movie about other events in the war. I thought that the characters in the movie showed much development on how they felt about the mission they are on. I thought that John Miller's role showed leadership and courage even in times of chaos. Private Ryan showed great courage and pride as he refused to leave the battle field when his services were no longer required. I thought that Upham showed fear at the end and was a disappointment as he failed to help his comrades. Upham didn't understand the horrors of war and therefore could not accept that he had to kill a prisoner in order to keep him from returning to the military even though it didn't seem like the right thing to do."

With all the gore, dialog, action and emotion that only thing it needed was the smell. The camera angles did a great job showing what the soldiers had to do to survive. The view of the aftermath showed how terrible war was. The movie took time to show everything, even the things we didn't want to see. The only problem I had with the movie was the dialog between battles. I thought that some parts just didn't work and were to long. The dialog before and after the battles showed a lot of emotion, but between the battles were poorly showed. I Lost interest during parts of the movie because of the dialog. The movie was still good even with some poor dialog because it made up for it with it's intense action. I would recommend this movie to someone, but I wouldn't call it excellent."

I liked the character Up-um because I can see this happening to someone that has not been out on the field of the war.

This has everything a great movie needs with action, a good plot, and a care for the characters in the movie. Also the movie has great picture and sound making you feel like your really there along with the other troops fighting to save the world from evil. Another important thing the movie does is it tries to stay close to a believable battle, and does not try to amp up the action by adding things that were not there before. Finally the movie makes great stride in allowing the viewer to connect its hero's in the past, to its hero's of today by showing in the beginning of the movie a character that is seen in the movie later in his life. With all these features working together in one great movie, it is hard not to want to watch it again and again, which can sometimes be hard with a movie of this length."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" was Steven Spielberg's tribute to the men who fought for freedom in the second world war. The film begins with the D-Day landing before moving on to a mission with the express purpose of retrieving a private whose three brothers have recently fallen in combat.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on a similar case involving four brothers by the name of Niland. However, Robert Rodat's screenplay also uses Ryan to represent the unknown individuals that these soldiers risked (and often lost) their lives for. The script is occasionally clumsy in its attempts at profundity but not enough to be a major distraction.<br/><br/>The cast is a varied and well-assembled lot. Tom Hanks secured the film's only Oscar nomination in the acting categories but the entire cast upholds a high standard of workmanship. Even actors whom I usually don't care for, such as Edward Burns and Vin Diesel, deliver performances that fit in seamlessly with their peers and their surroundings. As a result, I have to credit the casting director with finding the right actors for the right parts.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction won him his second Oscar in that category and is everything that you would expect from him. The first twenty or so minutes in particular (the D-Day landing) is riveting while Spielberg continually shows himself capable of handling all situations and settings with aplomb. Of course, this wouldn't be a Spielberg film without a John Williams score. Williams contributes a fine score here, if not quite reaching the same lofty heights as his very best work.<br/><br/>All things considered, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is quite an achievement. It boggles the mind that ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat this for the Best Picture Oscar. Surely that is a snub to go down in history along with the likes of ""Raging Bull"" & ""Apocalypse Now""."

Its compelling and rich and full of emotion and drama, it grips the viewer with significant empathetic features that only Spielberg could pass. As a youngster (when I first viewed this, and I still am compared to most on here I presume) the first bullet to bullet packed minutes captured my mind and didn't let go. <br/><br/>It's the first thing that ever made me actually think about war in another light.

"theycallmemrglass","9","1","2","17 November 2008"," 10 years later, still has impact and still unrivalled
","When I first saw this on the big screen, my senses were literally violently shaken, my heart pounded with fear and adrenaline within the first 5 minutes. No other war film made me feel like I was in it and feel the real horror that war is. It comes sudden and when it does, its relentless, leaving you breathless. On second viewing, 10 years later on a small screen, the shock element has of course slightly diminished but the impact and dare I say it, adrenaline rush is still there.<br/><br/>I have since seen several war films which have used Spielberg's ground- breaking first person perspective war film tools such as Thin Red line, Band of brothers, Letters from Iwa Jima, Flags of our Fathers etc (in fact most of these. apart from Thin Red Line, were produced by Spielberg). But none has bettered the astounding execution of brutal warfare as Saving Private Ryan. I now view it as the greatest action war movie of all time. The mission to save Private Ryan is a riveting one as the 8 protagonist soldiers undertake detour missions to reach their goal. The soldiers are depicted as flawed, sometimes confused, sometimes disillusioned, brave, frightened, cowardly, rational, irrational...all the elements of chaos that war brings and burdens the soldiers minds including their captains. <br/><br/>The squad comprises a typical range of characters, perhaps some stereotypical in war films but all played wonderfully, not over the top, not caricatured but like real people that we may know. Hanks as ever superbly holds the film together as he leads his squad into the chaos. My favourite character though is the clumsy, bumbling interpreter who has limited combat skills and struggles to be brave, a role wonderfully played by Jeremy Davies who later perfects those delightful hesitant mannerisms as Daniel Faraday in the Lost TV series). <br/><br/>The most conflicting question being raised throughout the film and by each soldier was the worthiness of risking many lives (or indeed wasting valuable resources) to save one soldier who may or may not be alive. This really is the main theme, posing a great moral dilemma.<br/><br/>Some complain that there is absolutely no reference to other allies involvement but why is that necessary? Every ally had their own missions. I am British yet I do not make any qualms. Britain has made their own war films with British only protagonists. America can do the same. They did fight too regardless of the fact they entered into it late but they did fight. And no ally won the war by themselves. The Allies as a whole won the war.<br/><br/>But I digress. This movie can be classed as simply a great action packed war film but it is layered with moral conflicts, incredibly brutal realism and fine performances all round. A magnificent achievement that has yet to be bettered 10 years on."

"fred-houpt","10","1","2","26 March 2008"," Spielberg revisits WW2 with heroic honors
","1993 saw the premier of ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg's bracing and emotionally scorching story about Oskar Schindler. 1998 he re-visits World War 2 and produces an equally powerful story about the saving of one man's life in the midst of post D-day battles. It is an appropriate temptation to compare his two seminal WW2 films, both such very powerful dramatic stories. Both concern themselves with salvation, with Schindler on the large scale and Ryan just one man. In the process of saving the many Jews he did Schindler was also somewhat successful in redeeming the moribund humanity within him. Tom Hanks' character in Ryan (Cpt. John Miller) does not need personal redemption or salvation because he is a good man who does not shirk from the weight of difficult missions and onerous responsibilities. However, in the midst of what appears to be an utterly mad task by his crew, we do wonder if any of them are transformed in a positive way? We know from the opening moments of the film that Private Ryan himself lived the remainder of his life with doubt as to whether the risk to save him and the cost to the small band of soldiers was worth the price paid? Carrying the survivors guilt heavily upon his shoulders, Ryan greatly struggles to lift the doubts as he confronts Miller's grave. It is a question that Spielberg leaves in an ambiguous state, left for the viewer to contemplate.<br/><br/>As a drama I found the script believable, even if within the confines of a very important battle it stretches credibility to imagine that it could have happened. I do not know if it is in whole or partially based on a true story. I just had to accept that it might have happened even if far fetched. Spielberg has almost no peer as a story teller in film. I am reminded of the moment in the film where Miller thinks he has found the correct Pvt Ryan, proceeds to tell the hapless soldier the bad news, sits and watches him take the news with a wincing pain and then finds out he has the wrong man. The emotional roller coaster is incredibly wrenching to watch and think about. The actors handle it superbly and to Spielberg's credit, once the point has been made the scene moves on, with the story lurching forward to the point, the finding of Ryan.<br/><br/>The special effects have been the subject of much praise. I'd have to say that the opening sequence is about as shocking and gruesome a depiction of war in it's ferocious misery as you can imagine. It sets the tone for what is to come; much close at hand battles and a lot of people dying. As the great Civil War Union General Sherman was known to have said: ""You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it."" and ""There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all Hell."" These sentiments overhang the entire movie and limit the usual tendency of Spielberg to drift into sentimentality. We are given enough of an immersion into the gore of war and all that remains is hell.<br/><br/>The movie wants to focus on Tom Hanks and from some points of view it does. However, I think that this is the obvious reaction. You watch this film a few times and you begin to notice how many fascinating and well developed characters come to life. There is so much room in this film to be inclusive and generous with character development and Spielberg takes full advantage. Even the German soldier that Miller saves (another soul saved at the least opportune time, in the most surprising of circumstances) remains much more than a cipher. He returns to duty and the duty is to kill Allied soldiers. Was Miller a dreamy fool, a morally rigid person? Why did he let the soldier go free when the battle had cost him a very valuable soldier in his unit? What is Spielberg saying here? Why save this man's life and also save Pvt Ryan's life? It is left unexplained and even as that characters resolution comes, we are left scratching our heads, wondering what to make of it. I think that ambiguity is appropriate for the madness of the battle. When in extreme moments of great stress, people often reach decisions that they would never consider if posed in a quiet moment. All of this sits firmly within the overall question that hangs over the film. Should Pvt Ryan be saved and at what cost? Should the German soldier not be saved and why shouldn't he have been taken prisoner to be given over to authorities later on? In one his strongest and finest roles, surrounded by outstanding actors who all deliver 100%, given a huge landscape full of boffo special effects, Tom Hanks carries an important film forward into a tragic but believable ending. War is the great leveler and who survives and who dies is an imponderable question. Coming away from this emotionally draining film, we do wonder. A classic, worthy of all it's awards. Stick around for the credits as John Williams ends the movie with a very stirring choral piece."
"rabada","10","1","2","3 March 2008"," To Judge or Not to Judge
","This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen depicting the moral dilemmas man struggles with during wartime. I have seen this film about 10 times and it still impacts me in the same way. The bonds of brotherhood run deep, but seems to be squad deep. The squad led by Captain John H. Miller, played by Tom Hanks, struggles with the question of ""Why do they have to risk their lives to save the life of one man."" This struggle continues to become more painful with the loss of each man killed in the ""line of duty."" Miller's statement, ""I just know that every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel."" Give a glimpse into the emotional toll war has on the human mind and soul. This struggle seems to overshadow the deeper struggle Cpl. Timothy P. Upham has with the right the rest of the squad has with being judge, jury and executioner when dealing with a lone German soldier after being taken prisoner. After ""befriending"" Upham he wins freedom from execution, but this in turn comes back as a haunting reminder of the possible consequences of mercy in wartime. I found the scenes revolving around the return of the German soldier and his disregard for the men who offered freedom instead of execution to cause me to think about how I would have reacted. Upham's struggle with fear was painful to watch, but more painful was the realization of what his inaction had caused. The transformation of the man, from compassionate, concerned human being to judge, jury, and executioner. As the German soldier reminds him that they are friends and again pleads for his life, Upham asks him ""What is my name?"" After he answers Upham kills him. What went through Upham's mind? I can't help but wonder if he would have spared his life if he had not remembered? By remembering his name does the German soldier make a statement about his disregard for the gift of freedom he had received? I cannot help but wonder how I would react when presented with the same dilemma. To judge or not to judge, the choice to take human life or not, using rational means to justify one actions. The struggle to maintain ones humanity during war must be one of the greatest struggles man endures. So what do we do with the scripture in Matthew that says, ""Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."" ?????"

Also, moving scenes like, George Marshal reading Abe Lincoln's letter helped add to the drama of this film. Another excellent part of this movie was John William's dramatic and chilling soundtrack. Songs like ""Hymn to The Fallen"" left me in tears. Also, sensational acting by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns was another major factor in this film's success.

","""Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much, my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is I get back to her, and how I'll ever be able to, tell about days like today. Ahh, Ryan. I don't know anything about Ryan, I don't care. The man means nothing to me; he's just a name. But if, you know, if going to finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well then, then that's my mission""<br/><br/>I am sure other reviewers who have reviewed 'Saving Private Ryan' (SPR) have rated it as the ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg used all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.<br/><br/>Greatest things about SPR are first of all the sensational, highly awarded and celebrated camera work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too. That's what makes the film such a thrilling, vivid and incredible experience.It puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to ""out there"" and puts him/her go through this hell and every nightmarish detail that's part of it. Other marvelous thing is a good story, little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have. That's what keeps the movie interesting all the way.<br/><br/>SPR is just outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours). <br/><br/>Also one of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. A brilliant innovation is the color reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.<br/><br/>The storyline is a real strength and the characters & acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad. But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one life. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered ""brothers"" in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, ""Steamboat Willie"" humanizes the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.<br/><br/>Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. Another historical inaccuracy people have noticed is the Church tower in Ramelle which, according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but I don't think it will detract from the film. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context. Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words: ""James... earn this. Earn it."" <br/><br/>The question this film poses is: Is it truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person???? This is the same question which Private Reiben asks to Hanks. The whole dialog go like this: <br/><br/>Pvt.Reiben: ""You want to explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?""<br/><br/>Capt.Miller: ""Anyone wanna answer that?""<br/><br/>Medic Wade: ""Hey, Reiben think about the poor bas***d's mother."" <br/><br/>Pvt. Reiben: ""Hey, Wade, I got a mother, you got a mother, the sarge has got a mother. S**t, I'll bet that even the Captain's got a mother........ Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have got mothers""<br/><br/>You have a great weekend!!!!!!!"

","Well this movie is one of the least movies which succeeded in describing the Brutality of World War II from both sides The Axis forces & the Alliance forces, thought Hitler was really magnificent in making a Real Strong Defence Bases in Normandy & in all the countries whom he entered.<br/><br/>But there is only something which I think it is not realistic, it is the story of the movie. I do not think that in this war & people are dying everywhere, I - Alliance Forces - would risk the lives of a good party like John Miller's party to save one soldier behind the enemy lines - not any enemy, it is the Hitler forces - though there were millions who might be saved in the Airborn event.<br/><br/>It may be taken from a real story, in fact I do not know, but overall It's an excellent movie I recommend it for anyone who wants to see the World War II realistic...<br/><br/>Thank you very much..."
"RitchieRitch69","9","1","2","5 September 2006"," A Brilliant Film...
","Saving Private Ryan starring Tom Hanks and an all-star cast was one of the best war films I've ever come across. It's mixture of violence, gore, drama and brotherhood between the 8-man unit was a different view of World War 2. Most war films just get stuck into random violence and don't take the time to explore the lives and views of the soldiers fighting for their country and their allies. With Private Ryan (Matt Damon) loses his three brothers in other parts of the world, Miller's (Hank's) unit must track him down to bring him back home.<br/><br/>Almost immediately Carpozo (Vin Diesel) is killed and the mission takes an ominous turn. After a false alarm, the team finally finds Ryan but not before their medic Wade is killed whilst trying to capture a German machine gun battery.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, after a large battle, most of the squad is annihalated and Hanks is hit by two German bullets which, in the end, terminate his life. But his mission was accomplished, Ryan survived, along with Upham and Mellish.<br/><br/>A great war film and a must see for any War film-loving fan."
"Miazole","10","1","2","19 July 2006"," Best Movie Ever
","I think that the Academy was drunk when the voted Shakespere in Love Best Picture over this masterpiece. This movie was my favorite movie for many reasons. First of all, this is a lot better than The Thin Red Line. Saving Private Ryan had great acting from pretty much everyone. Tom Hanks should have won Best Actor for this film. His performance was excellent. He plays Captain John H. Miller. He acts strong in front of his squad to set an example for them, and he hides his emotions from them. He makes brave and stupid decisions during war, but his performance was great. Tom Sizemore did a great job in this movie along with Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, and pretty much everyone else. Paul Giamatti had a cameo in this movie. Cpt. Miller and his squad must go behind enemy lines to rescue paratrooper James Ryan, who's three brothers died in combat. In my opinion, this is Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement, and Tom Hank's best performance. I give everyone my highest recommendation, though the violence may scare people away. No doubt my favorite movie of all time."
"hasan323","10","1","2","29 June 2006"," Good Performance, Accurate History & Very Gruesome
","Saving Private Ryan has one of the best performances by all characters, while still signifying war as a bloody, gruesome and meaningless battle.<br/><br/>The movie, unlike many other war movies (The Great Raid), or even (Pearl Harbor), Saving Private Ryan follows a group of soldiers, on a mission to save Private Ryan. The fighting scenes are very accurate, and very gruesome. Saving Private Ryan is not one that drags on, but one that you enjoy the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes. Tom Hanks has done a great performance, as well as all the others. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest master pieces."

","I have seen many World War II films, many of them very well written and acted out, but few measure up to the class of Saving Private Ryan. The film's gore, language, among other vulgarities are extremely well represented, but it is the end that got me.<br/><br/>During the final scenes of the movie, when Hanks and his men have fought a hard and difficult battle, Hanks' character John Miller has been mortally wounded and dies in the arms of one of his soldiers; incidentally, the man he and his squad rescued, James Ryan. Ryan returns to the grave of his superior officer years later, salutes, and the legacy of a heroic soldier remains, though he has been dead for decades. A film that made me weep like never before. A nine out of 10 in my book."
"golem3","9","1","2","6 June 2006"," wonderful recount of an experience in war
","Possibly, Spielberg's seminal work. I don't think that there have been any of his movies worth watching since Saving Private Ryan. This film was made at a time when Spielberg had great ideas, and knew how to utilize the camera without selling out completely to Hollywood standards. Nevertheless, Saving Private Ryan is very much Hollywood, but that being said, it's a very eloquent rendition of that.<br/><br/>If you remember anything about war movies, it's the anti-war ones that make a difference and are the ones remembered. I firmly believe that Saving Private Ryan is up with the best of that genre: namely Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays his role marvelously. He is forced to act as a liaison between his crew's demands with the orders given to him, and it is certainly isn't an easy task. This movie is probably one the most accurate vignettes of the American World War II experience yet made.<br/><br/>RATING: 9/10 <br/><br/>""Please tell me that I am a good man, and that I have lived a good life""  Private Ryan"

","While i think that Saving Private Ryan is a great movie i really have a problem with the scene featuring the German prisoner they capture at the machine gun site,surely soldiers in that position(already gone thru some awful combat just getting into the country) who had just lost one of their members to the enemy would""nt be dicking around taking prisoners,and although it might show US soldiers in a bad light i think that scene would have been more accurate if they had just killed him on the spot(although i realise that would interfere with the part that German soldier plays later on in the movie).Other than that a terrific film and that opening scene of the landing has to be one of the greatest pieces of film making of all time."

","This film is a heartbreaker, because 53,000,000 men died - all over the world - to prevent that deadly stunning Omaha Beach battle. Yet, came The Korean War; the attempted invasion of Cuba; The Vietnamese War; The Gulf War; The Somalian War (we turned-tail and ran); that mess in Afghanistan (which has never been conquered); and now the fiasco in Iraq, the cradle of civilization as we know it. There's a tale making the rounds that our president was upset because ""they tried to shoot my Daddy"", he wanted to get Sadam. Hmmmm.....how many times do you think we've tried to do that? Doesn't assassination go with leadership?<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" should have been a graphic lesson that all wars are useless bravado AND ""hell""- except for those who win ! - because it is inhumane for one sovereign country to attempt to dictate to another. An anonymous commentator wrote ""let's hope that this is the last war."" Have they been living in a vacuum for a couple of generations, or perhaps too young to have experienced the horror of wartime? Perhaps WW 2 was supposed to be ""the war to end all wars,"" but that completely dismisses man's inhumanity toward man. Some races just don't like other races, as we are seeing in Iraq - and they all are from the same race ! If you can read between the lines of the headlines today, the next war will be over the lack of water or a specific religion.....or some belligerents idiot will launch an atomic weapon that will destroy life as we know it. If that is going to happen, please let me know when so I can get right under it.<br/><br/>No one has mentioned watching ""Into the Breach"", which depicts the basic training-period the actors were forced to go through.....just like regular ""grunts"". One of the actors stated he would not do that again. All of them hated it, but all of their roles were greater for having experienced it.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is near perfect in all ways, acting through direction through casting through cinematography through realism. My opinion is that Tom Hanks underplayed his role to make a point that ordinary men usually get the biggest responsibility in battle. It's ""the grunts"" who do the fighting - the bigwigs are behind in a safe area: ""Blackhawk Down"" serves as a perfect example. Sizemore WAS the seasoned warrior, and played his role superbly. Barry Pepper (in an entirely different role than in ""The Green Mile"") gave us a believable soldier who took his fighting seriously, but asserting ""The Lord in My Shepherd"". Masterful. Matt Damon was brilliant, as he is in all of his roles; his statement ""these are the only brothers I have left"" was a natural turning to those who had become his brothers. ""Upham"" made me cry, because I understood his cowardice - he didn't try to hide it - it was palpable. Quite frankly, I didn't recognize Ted Danson, quite a star in his day, in the film. Spielberg knew what he was doing, and did it.<br/><br/>The most specific demonstration in this movie is how different the fighters in ""Saving Private Ryan"" are from modern-day fighters: ""Jarhead"" will show you that. Recruiting our youngest men to become killers is criminal - except, some of them have no other route to make their way in our world.<br/><br/>We needed this movie - to remind us that we are on the way to a collision with the rest of the world. Brits decried they were not part of this battle - they were up at another beach, being killed just as brutally. All of the countries involved made the same sacrifice. Our Memorial Day honors all of those who lost their lives for freedom. If we are looking for movies to merely demonstrate what a great sound-system we have, that's pitiful.<br/><br/>Until another ones comes along, ""Saving Private Ryan"" IS the best war-picture we've had - everyone should see it."

","The opening to this film provides, perhaps, the most gut-wrenching battle scenes ever filmed. The sounds of bullets whizzing through the air and screams of the wounded and dying coupled with an occasional, momentary respite from the cacophonous din of battle, while underwater, had me trying to crawl over the back of my theater seat just trying to get away. <br/><br/>The story line is adequate but, for me, the real value was the historical glimpse into what my father's generation faced during the European campaigns of WWII.

","As well as praise,this film also received a lot of criticism at the time of it's release because of it's pro-American view.so what... This IS an American financed film,made BY American's,FOR American audience's with American actor's and the beach landing on Omagh were done BY American servicemen. I can't see why SPR should be snubbed at because of this,It wasn't the first and won't be the last war film to be made from an American point of view.<br/><br/>""Saving private Ryan"" is an excellent war film and deserve's it's billing as one of the top 10 war movie of all time.<br/><br/>The opening Omagh beach landing scene's are horrifically realistic,showing the viewer as best a film can what it must of been like for those men on that fatal morning in June 1944. When them landing craft ramps went down all hell broke loss and the US Rangers were just cannon fodder for the German's up above in their machine gun bunker's. A lot as been said about the miss-leading of the Normandy beach landing scene in the beginning of SPR,Some Viewer's of the film say that the overload operation lead by the British,Canadian AND American's were not as blood thirsty as has portrayed in this film. Yes this true,It is a fact that only 1 out of every 7 allied soldiers actually fired a weapon on D-Day. But Omagh was as chilling as it is seen in SPR.<br/><br/>After the first 30 minutes of one of the most graphically violent battle scenes ever witnessed on screen the film moves onto it it's main story.8 soldiers lead by capt Miller on a mission to find a private in the 101st airborne division lost somewhere in Normandy so that he can return him home to his mother after the US top brass as learned that three of her sons have just been killed in combat.A bit of a PR mission so to say. Through the mission the GI's tell us of their views of the war and the mission they are on(whats the point of risking eight lives to save one?) Some are killed in combat along the way as they meet German opposition raising the pointless of the mission with anger among the men.Till they eventually find pvt Ryan who as hooked up with another platoon that are defending a bridge that the Germans want for their counter attack.<br/><br/>All this lead's to a grand finale battle between the American GI's and the battle hardened waffen SS inside a bombed out Normandy village.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in SPR are authentic enough ,first on Omagh after a pinned down onslaught the rangers make easy pray of the German troops,This is because the German regiment's along the Normandy coast were mainly made up of eastern European conscripts captured from German occupied territory in the east and forced to fight by the Nazi's in German divisions.Hitler thought the main landing zone for the allies would most likely be Calias.So the front line worriment were stationed there. But in the final battle scene in this film the GI's faced much more resilient opposition in the form of the SS who we see give the American's a real fight.(The GI's are only saved from being wiped by the SS thanks to an air attack on the German line by P51's)<br/><br/>All in all ""saving private Ryan"" is an excellent movie if you like bloody all out war battle scene's.The director Steven Spielberg brings the killing scenes right up close to the camera.The script is OK but can be a bit sentimentally at time's(trying to reason war through the eye's of Spielberg..in dialogue from the characters by the way)but this isn't enough of a problem to spoil the film."

","Everything in this film is perfect. It's hard to criticise this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role of Captain John Miller, a Ranger in the American Army sent behind enemy lines with a small band of soldiers, each unique in their own way, to retrieve a private from the 101st airborne who's 3 brothers had been killed in the previous weeks.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is an amazing insight into the ""soldiers war"" with heart gripping scenes such as the opening landing on Omaha beach. It leaves you feeling overwhelmed and humble. One of the superb things about this film is that it manages to create a sort of relationship between you and the individual soldiers.<br/><br/>This is by far one of Hank's best films yet, and a true masterpiece from Spielburg. You will not be disappointed with this. The camera work is outstanding, with shots seen through the eyes of a moving soldier. Every directorial aspect of this film draws out the horror and suffering experienced by so many young men during the War.<br/><br/>There is none of the cliché ""American Hero"" bravado you tend to see too often in Hollywood.

"Mr_PCM","9","1","2","8 December 2005"," The best war film ever
","Possibly the best war movie ever, both in terms of story and visuals. No other war film has managed to convey the constant hell that was World War II whilst at the same time illustrating the bonds of comradeship between soldiers quite so effectively and movingly. The film manages to be realistically graphic in its depiction of war and its associated death and injuries, without being gratuitous with the claret. No punches are pulled.<br/><br/>The story opens with the D-Day landings on Omaha beach, filmed with brutal realism, and then moves on to the mission of eight men who go behind enemy lines to rescue one man. Each of the men begin to question their orders, their place in the war, and the cost to their humanity.<br/><br/>The film won countless awards for its realism and its harrowing story, including Steven Spielberg garnering the Best Director Oscar. At the same time however it never tries to present itself as historical fact, rather a historical scenario with a fictional story placed on top. The main mission may be fictional, but the sub-plots (such as the importance of defending the bridge) are definitely based on fact. Tom Hanks is superb as Captain Miller, the man assigned to lead the retrieval unit sent behind enemy lines. Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel all provide competent performances as brothers-in-arms, and Tom Sizemore is (unusually) the rather understated Sergeant. The men form a strong bond (a bond between men which would Spielberg would explore further with his Band of Brothers mini-series) whilst undergoing a dehumanization process with regards to their enemy. Matt Damon has little more than a cameo as the eponymous Ryan. The film is both moving and gripping, and the 150-minute running time is barely felt, such is the intensity the subject matter is dealt with. Further, such was the impact of the film that several scenes (in particular the storming of Normandy beach) were almost shot-for-shot recreated in the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The apparent waste of resources on this rescue mission (a waste which is highlighted and questioned by the soldiers in the chosen unit) is not only a poignant story but also serves to highlight the sheer frustration of the waste and pointlessness of war in general. Together with Schindler's list, Steven Spielberg has created two films which are probably the finest monument to the Second World War and its atrocities of modern times, and with these also cements his place as the finest director of his generation."
"army91","9","1","2","2 December 2005"," Another Incredible Addition to Spielberg's Library of the Best
","As a large fan of war movies, I can easily say that this is the most realistic war movie I have ever seen. The sequences of battle, though gruesome, convey the horrors and intensity of combat surrounding World War II. Though the story is fictional, the invasion of Normandy was depicted accurately and powerfully in great detail. Mechanical and historical accuracy is evident most of the time. In the movie, Private James Ryan is a paratrooper during World War II. During the invasion, he is mislaunched and lands near a small French village. He has three brothers who are also fighting in the war that have been killed in action. When the commanders of the army realize this, they order a rescue unit to retrieve Ryan and bring him home so that his mother does not have to receive word that all of her sons have died in combat. The leader of this unit is Captain John Miller (portrayed by Tom Hanks.) The performances by him and the rest of the people he commands is outstanding and the drama of the war is not underdone or overdone. For those people who negatively criticize this move due to its gore should realize that World War II was like that and the facts are being shown as they are. They have not been tampered with which is an excellent thing. Spielberg combined his past experience with superb acting, special effects and history to create an incredible tapestry of absolute cinematic brilliance. Easily the finest war movie ever created."

","Not that many films have actually been realistic in showing the how utterly disturbing and horrific experience that war is. ""We Were Soldiers"" was utter propaganda nonsense, as was ""Black Hawk Down"" which solely focused on violence. ""Windtalkers"" and ""Tears of the Sun"" weren't great either. They didn't try and focus on how utterly disturbing and disgusting the war was, no; they tried to create action-films to be viewed purely as popcorn entertainment and on some levels they succeeded. But Saving Private Ryan was a bar above the rest; a disgusting, realistic, beautiful attempt to show how horrible the war was, also showing as an entertaining movie too. When it's Spielberg, you know it's business.<br/><br/>After a stomach-churningly horrific opening 20 minutes, in which limbs are torn and guts are spread across the beach, the film gets right to the point. With one of my favourite actors, Vin Diesel, in the team, they set off after orders to find James Ryan (Matt Damon) as per instructions given to them by an army base. This disturbingly realistic film really shows what hell war is. Not just in the fight scenes (after the first one on the beaches of Normandy they are infrequent) but what depths men have to go in war to complete the task given to them (i.e. trudging on in all conditions) and it realistically portrays the madness of it all. Only Platoon and Apocalypse Now have had anywhere near the effect.<br/><br/>Horribly graphic and Tear-jerkingly beautiful, Steven Spielberg creates another timeless masterpiece that will assure that the full 161 minutes stay in the memory for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Overall: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)"

The fact that they made a profound statement and didn't go that route speaks well of this movie project.<br/><br/>Anyone who desires to serve their country by going into combat should watch this one. The ideal of ""Glory of Battle"" would quickly be dispelled. Real warfare is gross, sickening, chaotic, disgusting, tragic. It must be a last resort, and one's motivation should be a very deep sense of commitment to the cause of democracy.

","Is it my excess of cynicism or my tradition of dislike for anything Spielberg (or are they the same thing?) that leads me to wonder why there's so much hype about Saving Private Ryan?<br/><br/>Sure the battle scenes are grippingly shot, but not more so than Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' was more than a few years back, and more annoyingly for all the MTV camera tricks, like strobing and tacky colors out of old Life magazines. Sure the sets and scenes are done up perfectly, with lots of expert consultants on hand, just as in Schindler's List, which seems to be the WWII partner movie to this one. (Must be another one on the way; Stone had three on Vietnam.) And sure the cast delivers up solid performances, led by Tom Hanks who breaks as far out of his light comic mold as his very respectable talents allow.<br/><br/>But you can't forget it's Spielberg. The assault on Normandy is the meat of the story, just as the concentration camps were in 'Schindler.' But again, Spielberg can't just tell it. He make a sandwich, wrapping the meat with his specialty: white bread. As in 'Schindler', present-day survivors -- in modern color -- visit the graves of the dead who so bravely gave, or at least risked, their lives that others might live. In case your head is impervious to Spielberg's hammer, the deal is that the living owe it to the dead to prove they deserve the gifts of life and liberty.<br/><br/>Get it? We owe it (BANG) to the greatest generation to be ""good people"" (BANG). That's right, because (BANG) we are Private Ryan! (BANG BANG BANG)<br/><br/>Of course Spielberg being Spielberg, he leaves us with a reassurance rather than a challenge. Based on his wife's affidavit and his family's all-American good looks, our avatar turns out to be well-deserving.<br/><br/>And so are we all, everyone! Now we can sink back into our smug torpor."

","This was a great film, however, I think the message of the film was to try and relay the waste and horror of war. This message was clouded by the typical Hollywood ending. To have a Panzer Division obliterated almost instantly by a couple of P-51's and to have dozens of German ground troops surrendering to the nerdy translator was very unrealistic, and typically American. The film would have served a better purpose if Hollywood had not insisted that the calvary once again saved the day. Had Ryan been captured at the end to become a prisoner of war would have allowed the film to maintain the Old Ryan/Young Ryan plot without all of the last minute heroics which made a very powerful film somewhat cheaper."

","hmm, Steven Spielberg was as phenomenal as usual with the directing of this epic milestone, Tom Hanks's performance was as intriguing as it can get, all the characters had their separate uniqueness. Captain John Miller, played by Hanks is a retired school teacher who struggles to accept the reality he and his men are in, even though he hides his true emotions from his group, he afterwards shows his feelings towards the mission, Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) plays one of the most important parts in this film, he's the captain's closest friend and companion, his respect towards the captain is more than acceptable, Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) is the desperate soldier who shows his frustration and anger towards the mission, and another guy, Private Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the silent and confident sniper, his character is to me the best in the film, part of it is because of how he praises The Lord while blowing the Germans away. It all gives the viewer a sense of belief. The story characterizes the true monstrosity and utter horror that is war. Especially WW2, until i saw this did i realize the importance of knowing what our heroes went through every day then, something to admire. Plot, Cast, (only minus was the apparently non-existent allies) but nevertheless, great film. The large content gives the viewer an overwhelming view of reality and how gruesome people can be during war time, its an emotional film and definitely one to remember. 10/10."

","Saving private Ryan is according to me one of the most realistic war-movies ever made. In the beginning of the movie we see an old veteran visiting the graves of the people who lost their lives in an effort to save Ryan. In this movie we see the madness of war and the traumas which people carry all their lives with them. In this movie a group American soldiers get the mission to save Ryan because in his family already some brothers fell on the battlefield and the code wants that the last brother must be saved. This movie shows actually the madness about the fact that more people have to die for saving one life. The beginning of the movie is very realistic when the Americans reach Omaha Beach and i think that in that time it was like that because thousands of soldiers did not even have the chance to reach the beach but after a long battle the German defence breaks which meant the beginning of the Liberation. The Germans expected that the Allies should cross the Canal so the most troops were stationed over there which coursed weak points in the German defence at Omaha Beach. The actors like Tom Hanks delivered a very realistic movie about the madness of war which some personalities create in this world, even today. A 9 out of 10 they deserve for sure."

Steamboat Willie had his life spared and rejoined the German Army...was he supposed to say ""Sorry, I promised the Americans I would sit out the rest of the war"". The sniper shot Carpazzo....was he not supposed to shoot an enemy?

It explores the fellowship of men banding together to save one private so that they (""can go home to (their wives)""), and the brutal obstacles they encounter, in the unpredictable situation of war. We witness an unforgettable, impeccable account of the most notorious siege in war history, ""D-Day"" in such personal, graphic, and unflinching detail that we find ourselves aboard the ships, swimming to the bloody shores, in the scorn of relentless battle. The direction throughout the film is superb: sincere, unapologetic, and poignant, as Spielberg takes us on a historical journey through the plights of these heroic men, and we witness every horror, every tragedy, and every act of courage which comprises the uncertain, the most fatal of situations, war. We are compelled by these soldiers' personal stories: their desires to someday return home and tell of their heroism to their grandchildren, to live happy, complete lives after this dangerous task. We are emerged into battle as the Americans and Germans are desperate and unrelenting in witnessing the others' demise, as this is the constant case of war. The ruins of the towns and its horrified citizens crying for mercy cause us to shudder with graveness and sympathy, as we encounter the unfortunate cost of war. The music is hearty and reverent, the sounds of the trumpets saluting those heroes, survived and fallen, and victims of war; from the brutal plights of battle, to the starking realization of survival being the only hope, to the grim deliverance to a mother a notice that her child has fallen in war; it is beautiful, passionate, and reinforces a theme of elegy prevalent throughout the film. This is one somber, reflective, and honest account of the last great war, and it is touching, engaging, and uncompromising in its infallible homage to a time of sacrifice and the men who comprise that honor.

I remember seeing The Longest Day in Germany in 1963, in a German theater, funny thing was the audience cheered at the wrong times. The paratroopers landing in St Mere Eglise, for example, were cheered when they were being slaughtered.

What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once.<br/><br/>The opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience.

It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.<br/><br/>Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.<br/><br/>The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan.

The cost is very high but they achieved their goal and have made the beach behind them safe.<br/><br/>I must admit I never truly accepted the argument of whether or not it was right for the men to risk their lives to save Private Ryan. They were given an order (by General Marshall no less) and it must be carried out. If they weren't fighting the Germans to reach Ryan they would just have been fighting and risking their necks somewhere else in France.<br/><br/>I can't think of another film that manages to bring the true horror and destruction of war right into your face. From the opening twenty minutes of the film right to the final battle the audience is never given a chance to rest or catch their breath.<br/><br/>Great performances by several actors including Tom Hanks, it is a film that will surely be highlighted when Tom Hanks receives a lifetime achievement award near the end of his career.

","Ever since I was 12, I've read hundreds of books, seen dozens of movies and did almost anything that has to do with the second world-war. For me, this period of time which changed the world forgood has also changed my life and my view on the world as it is today. <br/><br/>Almost 4 years into my WWII obsession, I heard about this project from the same director who made Shindler's list. Then the first screenshots... M1 carabines, MP40's and Tiger-tanks... I couldn't wait. <br/><br/>Sitting there, in the pitch-dark, The movie starts with the absolutely great sound's from the orchestra lead by John Williams. Seeing the old man walking towards the huge graveyard, with his family on the background, with obviously increasing emotions, the camera hides behind one of the graves, not revealing the name on it. Fade out.<br/><br/>What came next is almost indescribable. A group of extremely nervous American soldiers are standing in a landing-vessel, bouncing on the waves, a last walkthrough of the tactics&objectives and then the words no-one wanted to hear: 30 SECONDS!! CLEAR THE RAMPS! <br/><br/>Never ever had I experienced such an intense scene. I seriously totally forgot I was in a cinema. I felt like I was flying above the beach like a ghost. Absolutely uncomparable to any other scene I had ever seen.<br/><br/>If I go on like this, describing all scenes, i would need 225 web-pages and 2 weeks to write it down. Since I lack the time, i'll give a short summary.<br/><br/> From this scene on, Spielberg lets us join the march of some survivors, who are send by High command to find the youngest of 4 brothers, 3 of which died. He must and will return safely to his mother. We follow these soldiers, move with them and inside them. Encountering only some Germans (which, after Omaha itself, are all Waffen-SS which is weird, since the main force of the Waffen-SS did not join the fight until several days later). As the search for Ryan continues, so does the search for the answer to the question of questions... why do we fight? Spielberg brilliantly links the search for that answer to the actual deeds of all the individual soldiers. He shows, better than any director before, that soldiers are not blindly-orders-following-men, but individuals who are thrown into a war and fight it their own unique way. <br/><br/>After a both sad and hilarious mistake, they finally manage to find Ryan.. who turns out to be unwilling to return home until he completed the task he and his team were supposed to do with the few remnants of his battlegroup. That task is to defend a small bridge in a small town -the only remaining bridge in the area- until reinforcements have arrived. Captain Miller is forced to stay and help until this objective is reached.<br/><br/>The final battle that follows is again a masterpiece. Spielberg obviously wanted to reach the highest level of historical accuracy. Everything, from the socks they wear up to the tanks they fight, is historically correct (I must note that the Tiger-tanks are not real ones, but are in fact T-34 (russian) tanks converted to tigers- only the running gear gives this away, but hey, there are no real Tigers which move available up to today, so still great job). This final battle again shows the true horrors of war: all but 3 or 4 die.<br/><br/>Alltogether, the mixture of hand-held cameras and static ones, the moving characters, the music, the brilliant storyline and the breathtaking action made this movie one worth of viewing 25 times up to today -and more often to come- for me. Even for those totally uninterested in WWII: Just go and see this one, with theatre-surround of course. You most certainly will never forget it."

Captain John Miller, (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, an American solider situated somewhere in France. The men question their orders, but continue to embark on the mission. As Ryan, becomes nearer, the mission becomes harder, and soon, most of the characters are suddenly killed, including Captain Miller, the name on the grave at the opening sequence of the film!<br/><br/>Although very well acted, and involving a gripping story line, it is fair to say the story should be more realistic as this story is extremely unlikely to happen in the real World War 2."

","A whole family of young men are killed on D-Day bar a front line solider (Private Ryan) who must be pulled back from the battle field for the sake of his poor mother.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a director that I feel is vastly over-rated. While I admit he has produced both classics (in artistic terms) and blockbusters (in commercial terms) is he really that good? Is he really able to rise above the budget, acting, technology or script? Does he believe in anything? Have a grand message for the world other than it is good to be rich and famous? A nice guy, sure, but so is my milkman.<br/><br/>Call me a hard man to please, but I don't believe that Spielberg has put anything really new in the cinema pot and he has dipped in and borrowed plenty: Hitchcock, Scorsese, Kubrick and Kazan have all produced mini-masterpieces from nowhere with no stars or budget to speak of. Spielberg hasn't (although Juggernaut was above average for a TV movie).<br/><br/>As has been said a thousand times before, the opening takes a first hand look at D-day and is quite brilliant, but when it ends the movie droops. It is then a bog-standard war-is-hell product with a lot of extra emoting and men-can-cry to show that we have turned the page. <br/><br/>(Actually we haven't - many European films and B's have explored war from a first hand and more down-and-gritty viewpoint, but the mass audience haven't actually seen those products so they just think they are getting something new.)<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a great actor. He is the first and only modern star to play weak (or even stupid) and improve his box office standing. I praise him for it. No one could be better than him here, really bang on the money. But no one else needs to do much other than mouth words and Ryan (despite being the title role) is a star walk-on. <br/><br/>I am glad I saw this film and I recommend it to you. But I wouldn't want to see it again no matter own it. Money has been well spent and its heart is in the right place, but at the end it wants to get you in a headlock and push emotions down your throat. Further proof - in my book - as to why Spielberg isn't really the master of his own game, just a little above average at it."

I just wished that they would stop following in Speilberg's footsteps, trying to top his film. Because it will never be topped. I am glad that this film was made when it was, because pretty soon there will not be anyone left who was there or even was alive during WWII, this is going to be the same in 100 years or so about September 11th. But not to stray off subject, this film was the most accurate depiction of D-Day I have ever seen. I don't need to go into detail about other reasons why this was great except to say that this is a must see, must own, must worship movie, that will remain timeless."

","`Saving Private Ryan', takes place during WWII, in Europe. At the beginning, an old man (Harrison Young) walks up to a grave, then the movie shifts to the D-day invasion, on June 6, 1944. As men get torn up all around, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) moved his men up the beach. They finally breach it and take the beach after a deadly day. Soon after this bloody battle, Captain Miller (Hanks) receives orders to retrieve Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). They have to find him, because all his other brothers were killed in combat. Thus, the only surviving son rule was in affect. While this is happening, men are questioning why one man is so much more important then them after some of them get torn up. The group of men encounters battles all over the place and search for Ryan (Damon). Finally, they find him and his unit in a city. However, Ryan (Damon) refuses to leave the men in his unit. They end up fighting for control of the city.<br/><br/>
This movie sparked the more modern war movies, which show more emotion then the average action/war flick. Moreover, it does not show explosion after explosion with no plot to go along with it. The viewer sees the human emotion involved in this movie. Viewers see men crying out for their mothers, and see medics trying in vain to save lives. The viewer does not see the `faceless' people of war movies past, rather the viewer sees people, real people with real emotions throughout the film.<br/><br/>
The circumstances for these men weren't ideal. When they where at the town they had to set up the best method for attack. They were low on weapons; Miller (Hanks) shows the men how to make `sticky bombs' with their socks. Later Ryan (Damon) shows Miller (Hanks) how to set off mortars by hand. This shows the planning and improvising that is done in war. Most people would think war is just chaos; however, for the most part it is a well thought out process, which includes chaos."

","WOW!  Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan!  This was one of the most authentically made World War II movies ever made.  Tom Hanks did a fantastic job playing a soldier during WWII who did as he was told, regardless of how he personally felt about the task at hand.  My husband retired after 30 years of Army service and loves to ""critique"" military movies (being a military buff himself).  Even he was hard pressed to find a ""mistake"" in this movie!  The movie takes you from the landing on the beaches to the impossible task of locating a single man, Private Ryan.  In between the search for this man, we are delighted with excellent character development of the company sent out to search for Private Ryan.  We are able to gain a little insight of what it might have been like for men of various backgrounds coming together and united for a single cause.  Their banter, individual histories, prewar occupations, state of residence, & individual thoughts made each character feel so real that by the end of the movie you felt like you knew them - they WERE real.  Movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are wonderful for your adults to watch.  Kids don't appreciate history or really take in the events they are taught in school.  Movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" help to generate interest in history for the young.  For the older population, we simply appreciate (or remember) the time period and feel proud of our spouse or a family member who served during WWII. Warning:  have plenty of tissues by your chair for this movie!"

","To many the story of Saving Private Ryan starts with the landings at Normandy and the incredibly realistic depiction of D-Day June 6,1944,however there is first the subtle and unexpected deliverance of James Ryan to the headstone of Captain John Miller whereby the story is told of a time past when something of what we love was lost forever.The emotional place where this very fine movie goes is to our ability here today to talk to each other as though this was merely a motion picture and not the roll call for our honored dead.Though we are through James Ryans eyes taken back to when Captain Millers company is approaching the beach head at Omaha in one of those Higgins boats we are drawn into perhaps one of the most incredible movie scenes ever done.It is almost to terrible to elaborate,however thats the way it is.I do not feel this was meant to be an anti-war theme however if you want to know what it was like or perhaps what it might be like this is a good film to watch.This is a no-holds barred look at that action.For the record,this landing zone was called Omaha,and I believe it was the most difficult of the 5 landing zones.However we did establish a beach head and as the dates of history will show within 1 year we were to meet with our Allies in Berlin.This is a unforgettable war movie that should not be missed.I will express only a reservation about some of the attempts at a protest position against war.The inability to properly put a prisoner of war permanently out of the action was not I believe worthy and when that big bad Nazi did that deed to kill one of our guys and was not killed as a result was cowardice under action.I think that was pretty bad and in fact cost us because he could of engaged the enemy before the enemy even went any where near the staircase.Some of the emotional purges seem very much over the top but it seems to provide a very convincing ability to convey the deadly seriousness of what we were involved in,when a voice says to Captain Miller,""thats quite a view,""and Miller says ""yes it is,""That is when we get a view of what is forever lost,a sacrifice which on the field at Gettysburg,Pa Abraham Lincoln said that these honored dead should not have died in vain but gave there full measure so that we may increase our devotion and know a new beginning in defense of the republic.The banter is hard to predict but perhaps that was then this is now,however the final battle scene is hard to handle that was a very demanding challenge and boy did things heat up.Excellent war time footing and you dont loose concentration.I actually thought that If I could we would want God to know that we love each other for the bravery,honor,and life that we are being asked to provide so this Private James Ryan might know a future,and his decendents as well.If you had paid attention Jim Ryans family was there, children and all.A job well done Captain Miller,Thank You.To you Rangers of the Omaha Landings,my heart."

","Saving Private Ryan, a film that covers material that has been both harnessed and flauntered, is a rarity.  Ryan, as a jarring, gripping war film manages to address and touch nine of the ten human emotions without losing site of the story.  The film grabs you off the screen, as Tom Hanks plays the captain of a platoon, which, as noble, brave, and righteous as they may be, are nonetheless a band of young men.  Capt. Jon Miller embodies the man whom we all would want to be - a courageous leader of men who has earned the respect of his subordinates - without blurring the fact that he is a man - one with a life outside such a hideous display of humanity. Very rare are movies where we follow a group of people and feel like we have gotten to know each and every one by the end - at least to the degree which the excellent script permits."

","Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in one of the best war films ever made. <br/><br/>Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once. <br/><br/>The opening scene is one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance it has on the film and the effect it will have on people. I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" many times and I always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me. It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.<br/><br/>
Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.<br/><br/>
The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. He continues to produce box office hits along with Tom Hanks and the legendary director Steven Spielberg. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one film to savour over and over."
"markcarlson2222","Null","1","2","12 January 2004"," War Ain't fun
","I've read enough of the comments on this film to know that they run the gamut from praiseworthy to apocriphal to derogatory. I'll go for the first one. I know this film isn't meant to be historically accurate, or even based on an actual event. The only truths are Normandy, the tone of the fighting, the region of the fighting, and the equipment and tactics. There was no real Pvt. James Francis Ryan with three brothers killed. But there was a Nyland family, four boys, three of whom were killed in WWII and one survivor, who was brought home. This is the basis for this movie, but since Nyland's homecoming was less than dramatic, Spielberg needed a bit more punch, And oh, Lordy, did he give it to us! I've seen hundreds of war films, from the sterling 'Gettysburg,' to the appalling 'Pearl Harbor' and all in between. But SPR is a truly realistic film. It does a splendid job of bringing the viewer into the horrible and frightening arena of modern foot combat, with the sounds, sights and fears experienced by the men who slugged it out in the fields, towns and hedgerows of Normandy in 1944. I'm not a veteran, but a lot of my friends are, and not one of them has been able to watch this movie without deep, profound emotions. One Vietnam veteran commented to me, after we walked, our eyes blinking in the bright sunlight outside the theater, ""God, I never thought combat could ever be done on film the way it really was."" He's right, God Rest his soul, now that he's gone to be with his buddies in Valhalla. The only thing missing in this film is the smell and taste, of mud, dirt, gunpowder, blood, sweat and tears. This movie makes you hate the cruel randomness of battle, the men who you've come to like, (Capt. Miller, Pvt. Jackson, Sgt. Horvath), and the ones you hate, (Cpl. Upham, the German who went back to fight) being killed in stunning moments and passing into memory like lightning flashes. The impact of bullets, the CRUMP! of mortars and artillery, the ear-ringing echo of near-misses, are all realistically shown. In a theater, I found myself ducking instinctively from whickering Mauser bullets whining past my head. I left the movie exhausted, emotionally drained, and deeply moved. And with even more respect for what Peter Jennings called 'The Greatest Generation.' Well, done, Spielberg, and well done, GIs."
"slokes","9","1","2","1 January 2004"," ""Quite A View""
","Is ""Saving Private Ryan"" the greatest war movie ever made? I don't think I've seen one better. If there is one better, I don't think I could manage to sit through it, anyway. Though it is intense, violent, and bloody, it is also entertainment, albeit of the profoundest kind. Even those viewers who normally pass up opportunities to be shocked and appalled by on-screen violence should not deny themselves the chance of seeing this great film at least once.<br/><br/>People discussing this picture tend to agree on one thing: The Omaha Beach sequence that starts the story proper is the high point of the picture. I concur. It throws some awful imagery at the viewer, making you feel like you are a part of the landing. As bullets rip into the innards of men around you, you almost feel like you are in mortal danger. But the sequence works not because of the bloodiness, but because of the pacing. Despite the objections of some, director Stephen Spielberg doesn't push your face in gore unrelievedly, but creates a story in this sequence that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Spielberg makes you feel the human cost of the battle in some small way (he never pretends to be capturing all of it) but keeps the camera focused on characters like Tom Hanks's Cpt. Miller and Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Horvath who you feel are going to make it through at least this fight. Much of the carnage is shown in small flashes, or in the corners of the frame. At the risk of trivializing the actual conflict, the result is like a rollercoaster ride, a mighty daunting one that you feel some measure of achievement after you sit through it once, and actually grows more powerful with repeat viewings, which is not as horrible once you have seen it once and gotten a good idea who lives and dies.<br/><br/>The rest of the film can only pale in comparison, and is often unfairly dismissed for losing some of the momentum of Omaha. But how could any director, however great, sustain such momentum? And who would want to?<br/><br/>Instead, the film goes into a section that I think is even more affecting, when we see the typing pool where female clerks rattle out pro forma letters from ""Joes"" who speak in male voices about how each casualty was the finest and best soldier they ever had the privilege of serving with. Then one woman notices her letter is addressed to the same mother as another she just finished typing, and the central plot is set in motion. Three brothers have been killed in action, it turns out, and a fourth is missing in action and must be found. Harve Presnell as George C. Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recites from memory a letter sent by Abraham Lincoln nearly a century ago, in the process giving one of the most powerful performances in a movie full of them, and then we get a sequence that visually quotes Norman Rockwell as Mrs. Ryan wordlessly gets word of `the sacrifice she has laid on the altar of freedom.' Watching her collapse on her porch as the priest emerges from the black sedan is not easily done with dry eyes, because we understand by then how commonplace this sort of thing was.<br/><br/>There are moments of humor in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" too, much of it from Tom Hanks' central performance. His laconic comment when a German on a loudspeaker announces ""the Statue of Liberty is kaput"" is priceless, and even as the body count mounts, there is a sense of this somehow being made endurable by the company of Miller and his men. Hanks keeps his schtick in harness most of the time, but when he does allow for some jocularity, we are actually grateful.<br/><br/>The film slips a couple of times, but not in any major way. The biggest misstep for me was when Miller goes off and cries after losing one man. It's the one episode of actorly indulgence in a film that otherwise steers clear of such theatrics, though it may work for others.<br/><br/>Even the final battle for the town of Remmel, though fictional, is done in a realistic and committed way. Some of the most violent and gruesome moments occur here, and they are all the more difficult to endure because we now know the soldiers fighting and dying in a way we didn't at Omaha.<br/><br/>The music by John Williams and the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski are simply brilliant, neither calling your attention as they serve their scenes in an efficient manner. The sound, the editing, all are of a high order and will no doubt inspire moviemakers for generations to come.<br/><br/>People who say `Saving Private Ryan' is not war but Hollywood are right, but miss the point. This is an example of Hollywood getting it right, and creating something enduring. I will always be thankful I managed to sit through ""Ryan"" once, because it made me want to see it again. Give this film the same chance, and I bet you will agree."

For accuracy, blood, violence and length they are unmatched as far as my experience can say. The beach landing, the assault on the radar site, the heart pounding final battle, all of them are superb portraits of both combat itself and the men involved. All very intense and bloody. If you love movie battles then this is the film you've been waiting for. <br/><br/>Some might call this film porn for action junkies but it is more than that. Beautifully shot and orchestrated, Saving Private Ryan is ultimately a tale of the men in combat rather than the combat itself. Unlike a lot of war movies, in Saving Private Ryan you actually care about the characters and don't just look at them as bullet catchers. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: This film should be in everyone who calls themselves a movie fan's collection.

"bjones","9","1","2","22 July 2003"," Claimed Reality Is Flawed But Film Is Still Worth It
","As I am a thirty year military professional many people have asked my opinion of the film. This is it in a nutshell:<br/><br/>The Weapons:<br/><br/>The thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticeable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.<br/><br/>The Sniper:<br/><br/>The sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.<br/><br/>The Uniforms:<br/><br/>The field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticeably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.<br/><br/>The Battle Scenes:<br/><br/>Every one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less ""gory"" than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.<br/><br/>The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompson's was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.<br/><br/>The Characters:<br/><br/>This is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the ""war"". These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the Green Berets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch ""They Were Expendable"". To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.<br/><br/>The Plot:<br/><br/>I could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.<br/><br/>What I did like:<br/><br/>The cinematography was superb. The sound was great. It was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire I have heard on film to date. Still, this wasn't consistent throughout. The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people. Real war is much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing."

Does Spielberg really think that there were no blacks or latinos in the war? Every soldier is white caucasian. Tom Hanks is good but this is not his best film. Tom Sizemore I feel is the top actor in this movie. He is incredibly intense, almost like he has been involved in a war in his life.

","Not Steven Spielberg's best film by a long shot (ET or Schindler's List anyone?) but certainly his most graphic, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much summed up by its tagline ""The Mission is a Man"". The film is simple, almost to the point of frustration and possibly Spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film (war is, um... bad). However what it amounts to is poor storytelling. Coming from Spielberg, a man who prides himself for storytelling, this is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the everyman, again, as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country. Matt Damon plays Private Ryan, the young soldier that Hanks and his crew have been sent to find. Beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes, Private Ryan is an uneven work. What people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with, what I guess, brutal violence. Oliver Stone managed this better in Platoon (even the brilliant opening scene in Private Ryan does not compare to the scene in Platoon where the soldiers burn down the Vietnamese village).<br/><br/>That said, SVP still features decent performances from Matt Damon and Tom Hanks with excellent support coming from Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from Vin Diesel, in a small role as an Italian-American soldier. The direction is also solid as is the script. However mundanity and Spielberg's safety net, sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the Spielberg cannon."

With Tom Hanks as the main character it gave me a sense of everything was going to be all right, he did an outstanding job for his part.

","This has to be the most realistic war film ever.   Everything about this movie is good,the natural acting, the realistic battles (especially the sound of bullets whistling by), and especially the storyline.  Of course there are a few flaws, no movie is perfect, but they're just minor.  The story here is really deep and straightfoward, 8 men> were sent to find one private Ryan.  On the way they became skeptical and start asking themselves whether that risking their life for one man is the ""decent"" thing to do. Unlike BLack Hawk Down, also a good war movie, you have a sense of connection with the individuals in the movie, the characters build up pretty well. And sometime you feel for them, you understand their situation, and their state of mind.   I really don't understand why many people complain about how Steven Spieldberg didn't show other Ally Forces in the movie.  The movie is about 8 American men trying to bring another man home.  That's why it's call Saving Private Ryan.    This isn't a documentary movie about everything that happen involving every nations during WWII starting from 1939-1945.  Otherwise it be called The World At War or something like that. So stop complaining."

In this film, single Panzer tanks just go wandering around the countryside at will, till they bump in to something.<br/><br/>This film is formulaic in extremis - every scene you've seen before, only better.  You know the scene from a hundred films where a character is in the thick of tumultuous action, then ducks under water and it all goes silent, repeated 3-4 times?  Well yes, that's here, only when the guy pops up all we get is a few popping and spluttering machine guns.  The sound throughout this film is the worst ever in any war movie.  Even the crumbiest soap operas today  have the background hum in group scenes, bars, etc.  Not here, you mostly just here the character in focus, the troop of soldiers standing around are silent.  The claim to reality made by some must be down to ten dollars worth of offal spread around the bodies.<br/><br/>Even dialogue is without any conviction - people did use the f-word then of course but not in the repetitive way which has become the fashion now.  In fact, the french referred to GIs as 'La Beetch' after the phrase which all GIs used all day long - ""Son of a bitch"".

It makes me like and appreciate this film even more and I have watched it again and own on tape and DVD.<br/><br/>This is without doubt one of the best war films ever produced and it benefits from the polarity of war' as the scene and humanity' as the theme.  A must watch movie if only for entertainment but we all learn something from these types of movies.  And as the effects in movies get more and more realistic and perhaps over-realistic then we should force our leaders to watch them.  With computer simulation power we might put an end to war?

","Well, According to the rating I've read on this site, No! In my 2 cents though, I would put this film up near the top. As I sit here I can't think of much wrong to write! Steven can REALLY make any kind of plot shine and, in my thoughts, this is his best. At first the Idea of him casting Tom Hanks as the lead in this film didn't thrill me. I'm thinking, this is that guy from ""Seattle"" who fell in love with Meg Ryan! He just didn't strike me as that much of an action Hero. Well, in this roll, Tom didn't have to be an action kind of person 'cuz this is the one of them few films i've seen that doesn't have violence just for the sake of having it there. This film contained at the time of its release some of the most nasty and realistic battle scenes I've ever experienced! And unlike Black Hawk Down, this film has no work up to the landings on June 6th.<br/><br/>Imean you see this person, visiting the cemetary. We're not told his name nor which site he's looking for. What we, the audience realize right away though is that this man was a VETERAN who most likely fought here. In then he stops if front of one grave, and in my opinion, the best scene of the film, french hornsring out a powerful few notes as the camera focuses on the lines and lines of crosses. Then the allied assault starts, with all its fury at Normandy. Well, I can't say any more about that.<br/><br/>So leading a crew of 8 men through swarms of German reinforements, Tom Hanks must find a private who has lost all of his brothers. ""It doesn't make any sense"" is the theme to the whole mission, unlike in other films where the soldiers all never even think about there orders as anything but the most meaningful and heroic things on earth. And of course, why are 8 men being risked for one. The nice thing is that Steven never really answers the question but simply shows the results. I won't spoil the end but I should say this: Don't expect hardly any of the main characters to get out alive!<br/><br/>Totally wonderful film. John's score in this film is the best. I love his music. It's always perfect. The sound is very well done. The camera effects are stellar and I'm sounding silly here but I'm having a hard time finding adjectives that describe what a good film this is. If you don't have this film already, what are waiting for. I'm glad there are people out there who actually care to make films that are REALLY based on history!"

","Saving Private Ryan is easily the best war movie that has ever been made, and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made, period.  It is the only movie I have ever been to that has silenced and stunned a packed theater. I clearly remember that during the first silent moment in the film, after the D-Day invasion scene, that the theater was dead silent.  If I hadn't taken a second to look around and seen the people it would have been impossible to tell that every seat in the theater was filled.<br/><br/>I currently own the movie on DVD and have enjoyed watching it.  It is not the same experience as in the theater, but much better than on VHS.  Many people think that the movie was far to graphic; although, it was very graphic, that is the way war is.  And since Steven Spielberg wanted a realistic movie, that is what he had to do.  The story line of saving one man among the slaughter of the invasion of France was an interesting choice for a plot, but very effective.  It shows that compassion can still prevail, even in the worst of circumstances.<br/><br/>Due to the graphic nature of the movie, people with weak stomachs may want to avoid it (or have someone cover your eyes).

","For those people who feel ""Saving Private Ryan"" was nothing but an excuse to put some gratuitous violence on screen, or feel that the violence was ""over the top,"" I have just three words for you--Read Your History.  Read Stephen Ambrose's book on D-Day (Ambrose just happened to be the historical consultant for the film), and you will learn exactly what bullets, mortars, grenades, etc. actually do to a human being. You'll discover that the violence that television and other movies have fed us for the last 20-30 years is a bunch of c**p.<br/><br/>And for those people who have been involved in war, then watch this film and claim that the violence is excessive and false, then obviously, your experiences in wartime didn't mirror those men who's accounts were used in the book mentioned above and in ""Ryan."" And they don't mirror those memories of countless men who saw this film and left the theater visibly shaken, because their story was finally told the way it should be.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg was not trying to ""Out-Gross"" ""Braveheart.""  He was attempting to open our eyes.  And if he was successful, then maybe those truly gut-wrenching scenes would serve a noble purpose--if not ""An end to war,"" then at least an end to the Romanticism of War.  Which is, at least, a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>So ""Shakespeare In Love"" received the Oscar.  Is it ever going to be referred to as "" A National Monument?""  I doubt it.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" is still getting coverage that refers to it in those terms.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, before criticizing this movie based on its level of violence, try accumulating a little background before making such accusations."

","I've noticed that most of the people who didn't like the film are from outside the United States. That's not unusual, I think; the movie would have more of an emotional appeal to Americans. But using a movie to voice your own rather bigoted attitudes toward a country is hardly becoming. World War II was a defining moment for the United States, and a very emotional one as well. Americans can be justifiably proud of what the United States accomplished during the war, just as Russians and Brits can be proud of what sacrifices were made on their behalf. I don't like chest-thumping jingoism any more than anyone else, but I honestly did not see that here. I saw pride, not arrogance. I saw American soldiers act cowardly, and German soldiers show mercy. Mostly I saw how combat has a debilitating effect on human beings, regardless of how ""noble"" the overall purpose is. World War II began in Europe, it did not begin with or in the United States. Any latent militarism or patriotism caused by the effects of two world wars on American culture ultimately owes its existence to the people responsible for starting those wars in the first place. I don't believe, however, that this movie or Tom Hanks intention in making it was vapid patriotism, anymore than his ""From the Earth to the Moon"" or Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" were. Some patriotism is legitimate -- dying to end fascism and the Holocaust, in my books, rates as legitimate."

"StreamlinedEye","10","1","2","21 March 2004"," Spielberg's Essay on Americanism
","Hidden beneath the spectacular and involving action sequences in this film is Steven Spielberg's vision of just what it means to be an American. For Spielberg, its not just the flag-waving patriotism of the armchair soldier, but the true heroic notion of sacrifice for fellow man. Time and again during the battle scenes, we see his emphasis on the anonymous ""dog face"" who has given his own life to further their cause. Medics die saving the wounded. Others die saving children. And an entire mission is dedicated to save one man.<br/><br/>The contrast is shown in the form of Corporal Upham, the tag-along interpreter, who has not yet learned this notion of sacrifice. His inaction in crucial moments sets him apart from the rest.<br/><br/>Captain John Miller is the ultimate embodiment of Spielberg's theme. He is an uncommonly common man, as plain and unremarkable as his name, but with a steadfast sense of purpose, and humble in his brilliance. His final instruction to Private Ryan is a message to us all.<br/><br/>While touched on in many of Spielberg's other films, this is his most consistent rendering of that belief. A magnificent film which should not be missed."
"Macahol","Null","1","2","26 August 1999"," A Composite of Other War Movies
","Forgive me if I am only restating what many others have already pointed out. I simply don't have time to review all of the previous posts on this movie.<br/><br/>I personally was somewhat disappointed with SPR.  I would agree with others that the initial 25 minutes, sans the cheesy opening with old man Ryan, was one of the more vivid battle scenes I have seen depicted on film.  The invasion sequence definitely gave me a feel for what my grandfather (the son of German immigrants to the US) went through on 6/6/44.  From there the movie goes downhill, IMHO.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Speilberg set out to incorporate segments of other well known war movies into this one.  Scenes in SPR are  reminiscent of:<br/><br/>Forest Gump:<br/><br/>Carpazzo tells the translator not to salute the captain (Hanks) because that only makes him a target for enemy snipers. ( ""Major Dan"" admonishes Gump not to salute him as enemy soldiers may be standing by to ""grease an officer"".<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front:<br/><br/>The night time shelling scenes as the soldiers are making their way over the battlefield at night are similar to what is portrayed in the 1929 classic.<br/><br/>The soldier that picks up his dismembered arm is similar to a scene in a great Japanese film.<br/><br/>The Edith Piaff record that the Translator analyzes is the same record that is discussed in ""the Dirty Dozen"".<br/><br/>Patton:<br/><br/>The discourse between Ted Danson & Hanks (Who else thought that Sam Malone was out of place?) was right out ot George C. Scott's masterpiece.  (i.e. ""Monte"" taking too long to take Caen"".<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket:<br/><br/>The translator sports a yin-yang symbol on his helmet, similar to private Joker's peace symbol.  I don't believe that yin yang became en vogue in the US until well after WWII.<br/><br/>The metallic ""tank"" sounds as the panzers are approaching in the final batle scene are similar to the sound effects in Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>While flying in the helicopter, Joker remarks in FMJ: ""Do you ever kill any women & children?""<br/><br/>A: ""Especially women & children""<br/><br/>Joker: ""How can you justify killing women & children?""<br/><br/>Later, at the end of the movie, Joker finds himself face to face with a young girl that was shooting at his company: the sniper.  In the end, he kills her, but it is no victory for him, only the end of whatever innocence he has left.<br/><br/>The translator protests that the company should let the ""Steamboat Willie"" guy go. (No explanation is provided as to why he stayed around to be captured while the American soldiers were ministering to the fatally wounded Wade).  Later, ""Steamboat Willie"" walks down the stairs past the translator after killing Mellish.  He forgoes a perfect opportunity to kill the cowardly translator, sparing him, ala Androcles and the Lion.  In the end, the translator musters up the courage to confornt several German soldiers, Steamboat Willie among them.  He shoots  Steamboat Willie and orders the others the leave.  This sequence leading to ""innocence lost"" simply is unrealistic and does not do justice to circumstance.  In addition, while Steamboat Willie's initial portrayal of a soldier in ememy hands is initially realistic, he soon becomes a comic book character with his Star Spangled Banner/""F**k Hitler"" routine.<br/><br/>The final battle scene disqualified this movie from any semblance of greatness.  Great war movies convey the total fultility of war.  This film did not end on the empty note that Full Metal Jacket did, but rather the dive bombers showed up just in time and all was well.  Where was Sylvester Stallone?  The Sticky Bombs would have fit right in with any Rambo movie.<br/><br/>I agree with others that the opening and closing sequences were annoyingly sappy, what with the flag and all.  However I would note one thing:  I don't think that  this movie constitutes ""propaganda:"" as some put it. I call it commercialism.   IMHO, this is a movie made by an American director for an American audience.  I feel that this movie does not set out to persuade anyone to view the war from the American perspective as much as it is meant to sell the movie to what an American audience wants to see.  SPR follows the same formula as counltess other movies before it.  Look at the predictable scene where Hanks runs across the wrong Private Ryan.  This is about as consistent with a typical American script as a movie can get.  As long as this sappy humor sells, it will be a staple of the American cinema."
"Yossarian-","4","1","2","16 August 1999"," Good, but by no means the greatest war movie ever (or even of the decade, or the year, for that matter)
","Perhaps having viewed this film at the cinema a couple of weeks after its debut tainted my expectations about 'Saving Private Ryan'. Perhaps the immense amount of hype precluding and following its release built the movie up just a little too much. Whatever the reason, I must admit that I found 'Saving Private Ryan' just a little tedious and pretentious. Don't get me wrong here, there's no genre of movie that I enjoy more than the good old [anti]war. 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'All Quiet on the Western Front', '1918: Westfront', 'Stalingrad' and 'Das Boot' (all German productions) are among my all time favorite movies. I like a good, harsh, realistic war movie. And being a product of the electronic generation I can even sit through 'A Clockwork Orange' without even flinching, so the 'realistic' first 25 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' was just like water off a ducks back, to use the cliche.<br/><br/>What really got to me about this movie was the element of compromise that marred 'Saving Private Ryan'. The introductory shot displaying that oh so wonderful 'stars and stripes' waving in the breeze. Perhaps it was national pride that caused the Second World War? Unforgivable. The return of this shot at the as yet far away conclusion of the film did little to appease my growing sense of ridicule at the film.<br/><br/>However, on a positive note that famous first 25 minutes was a fairly fine piece of cinema. Fast, well coordinated, well coloured (not that I really know what I'm talking about here). But after such a fine beginning Speilburg simply cannot stop the movie slipping downhill from here. I got the impression that 'Saving Private Ryan' was two hours of relative nothing buffered by 20 minutes of pro-Yankee violence at each end. And, I'm sad to say, that is how the war came across. The Germans were still faceless, nameless enemies. Nazi's. The German film 'Stalingrad' (which I believe does the whole war thing far better than this effort) gives an excellent insight into the German side of things.<br/><br/>So, in brief:<br/><br/>* Far too patriotic for a modern day war film<br/><br/>* Emptiness in between introduction and conclusion (totaling 2 hours)<br/><br/>Still was above average though. But 'Saving Private Ryan' is by no means the greatest war film ever. There are many films which do the whole war thing much more sensitively, poetically, chaotically, brutally, realistically, bluntly, subtly. The greatest criticism I have for 'Saving Private Ryan' is that I didn't leave the cinema hating humanity for what it put all those involved in the war through, and showing what humanity was capable of. Which other movies do. It would appear that Spielberg decided against this perhaps for fear of diminishing his American audience, who might not have flocked to his movie in mainstream numbers if it were to put forward any message that suggested that ALL involved in wars are victims, not just the Americans."
"tim_buk2","8","1","2","13 August 1999"," A fine film with a plausible plot.
","Saving Private Ryan is certainly one of the most, if not the most, emotionally shocking films I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). The film successfully recreates a very dark moment in recent history. Spielberg uses the intense opening scenes to promote a calculated audience reaction. He wants to give us, as soon as the film starts, a prolonged taste of what it was like for a soldier, perhaps fresh from cosy US civilisation, to step off a landing craft into the hell and chaos that was Omaha beach. Spielberg achieves this with a cinematographical style drawn from contemporary documentary footage. But for me it were the sound effects that added the final horrific realism to that scene and indeed the whole of the film. The sound of bullets striking metal, water, flesh without the accompanying crack from the far away gun is particularly memorable.  (Now I come to think of it a similar effect was used in John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13).<br/><br/>
The most powerful scene for me, one that gave me a few sleepless nights, was the hand to hand fighting that took place upstairs in the bombed-out house. The wrestling of the two opponents all the while the other wounded soldier is writhing around in the background, the would-be rescuer paralysed by fear, the short, final pleading of the loser is an absolute masterpiece of film making.<br/><br/>
There is a lot of comment to the effect that the plot for the army to jeopardise a squad of men to retrieve an ordinary soldier is implausible. Yes I imagine that it would have been highly unusual but the action was to have a significant propaganda effect back home. I am sure that many bizarre and costly actions have taken place this century in the pursuit of propaganda. The mood of the domestic population is often crucial to the outcome of a foreign war. Look how it affected US operations in Vietnam. And you only have to read about what massive and risky operations are mounted to retrieve a single, downed US pilot in former Yugoslavia recently to be able to imagine that the SPR plot is not totally implausible.<br/><br/>
For all the movie's real power there are, in my view, some faults to the film, curious queries that occurred to me whilst watching that have also been picked up by others. The final scene in the present day war cemetery I found to be misjudged. Supposedly to bring the film full circle, to tie in with the very first scene, I found it to be out of step with the previous two-and-a-half hours.  Also, I found Matt Damon to be miscast  for me he looks too 90's. Ryan should have been played by an actor far less well known. <br/><br/>
I suppose that in the first few days after D-Day, as the Americans spearheaded inland from one of their designated Normandy landing sites, the only other people the Americans came across were soldiers of the German army. The French population having mostly fled beforehand or in hiding and the other Allied troops still pushing ahead from their own landing zones. Having said that, as a Brit.,  it did feel to me as if the film portrayed the Yanks single-handedly liberating France. There aren't many opportunities for the director to incorporate other Allied nationalities into this scenario. Spielberg might have chosen RAF tank-busters but perhaps if he had he might have felt he was making a point about the Limeys showing up late and saving the day after all the hard work had been done.<br/><br/>
Overall it is an excellent movie and gets a 10 rating from me. It is not perfect in every way but it is a film that every state-registered voter should see. It is a glorious tribute to all the men and women who served and fought to preserve the freedom and democracy we know (and take so much for granted) today.<br/><br/>
Lastly, I do find it galling in the extreme that, amongst others, 16 year-olds from Illinois have the arrogance to moan, whinge and complain about this fine film. As the movie is R rated you presumably saw it with your Mom or Dad. I would far rather hear their comments than yours. Keep your comments to Babe 2: Pig in the City."

","This is a very well-made film.  Certainly worth seeing more than once. The combat scenes at the beginning and at the end were eye-opening.  I knew what this movie was going to be about before seeing it, and I knew what to expect, yet the battle scenes were still shocking to see.  However, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was in no way the best movie of 1998--""Life Is Beautiful"" was a superior film, in many ways.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" excelled all other 1998 films on a TECHNICAL level.  If you were to remove the graphic aspect of its battle scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" would be just another war movie. Some people consider this the greatest war movie ever made.  This movie may have the most realistic battle scenes ever shown, but it's not a spectacular movie.  In fact, its plot is rather lame.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" is tied with ""Shakespeare in Love"" for being the most overrated movie of 1998. ""Life Is Beautiful"" clearly told a story about love and triumph without the use of theatrics or of famous actors/actresses.  I can't see why Tom Hanks was praised so highly for his performance in this film; the supporting cast outshone him.  Also, the most hideous thing that was done in ""Saving Private Ryan"" was to use the United States flag at the beginning and at the end of the movie.  That's something that would only be done by someone trying to win an Oscar.  I do commend Spielberg for his direction--overall, he did a really good job in demonstrating that war is hell."

","After looking at some of the other comments, I am relieved to find out that I am not the only person that does not worship this movie. Yes, the D-Day invasion scenes were great and Tom Hanks was up to form, but the middle of the movie was so schmaltzy that I really couldn't get into it. Frankly, I resented the fact that they thought that my emotions could be manipulated by the cliched characters and sentimental dialogue that dominated the middle of the movie. Although my opinion appears to be in the minority, it is reassuring to know that there are a fair number of people who share it. Final analysis: 4/10 Watch first 1/2 hour or so and skip the rest."

","This movie could not have been more violent if it tried.  For this reason I feel a lot of incidents were added for nothing other than the shock value, such as the when the German soldier slowly stabs the American private (which, by the way, was the sickest thing I've ever seen in a movie, done to the character I liked the best!)  I fully understand that war is hell, but I thought it was very unlikely that the German would have gone up the stairs in that way, and end up killing by a knife.  I feel the scene was included (awkwardly) for only the shock value.  Because of this I lost respect for the movie.  The storyline was good and the re-creation of the war was also very good, but because of the above reasons I wouldn't consider it a great movie."

I do not doubt or belittle the fact that SPR was of great emotional worth and moral value to many people, some of whom are far more qualified than I to judge... ... but hell, that little demon inside just wants to be heard. And it says some nasty things. I came into this film wanting to _see_ a film - as opposed to three hours of histrionics and melodrama, dressed up as a serious and worthy discussion of war. Worthy - that's the word. Mr Spielberg wants to be _worthy_. He wants to teach us all about patriotism and freedom and evil and good and The American Way. Frankly it was rather offensive. Not his general intent (which was indeed worthy), but rather the manner in which he set about it (which was not worthy). Emotive scenes of slaughter, stereotyping of good and evil characters, simple resolutions, a gimmick in the form of ""stickybombs"" - all rather fairyfloss, fairytale elements in a supposedly hardcore, realistic film. From a historian's point of view, it spoke loudly of propaganda.<br/><br/>A review of '90s films would be incomplete without Saving Private Ryan, and no doubt it will continue to be hailed as ""the greatest war film of all time"".

We don't have to have a whole series of characters but they could have been mentioned in the dialogue.

Gee, could it be because it was only about Americans??? That was the point...it wasn't supposed to satisfy people from Holland or England or anywhere else...it was meant to show what AMERICANS went through on D-DAY (were there any other countries at Omaha beach..no) and if you ask any American vet who was there, he will say the only thing that was missing for them when they saw it was the real bullets.  By the way, my grandfather was there.  So to this extent and for these reasons, yeh it was very ""nationalistic"", as well it should have been.<br/><br/>2. How could the americans beat the germans in the last battle...well, first of all, they didn't...only the mustangs saved them (and D-Day to the end of the war in general) Secondly, it is possible that it COULD happen with well placed positions and a plan if you know military tactics and anyway...ITS JUST A MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>3.

The AMERICAN army took Omaha Beach; not the British, not the Canadians, and not the French. Yes, every nation I just mentioned sacrificed its young men in the fight against Nazi Germany; they all had casualties on D-Day, we all know that. But wake up people, get a clue.

I take it for what it is supposed to be, a story about men under extreme circumstances trying to serve their country, do their job, and stay alive.  I suggest you all (you know who you are) grow up a little, come back down to earth, and look at SPR for what is supposed to be: ENTERTAINMENT!

","Too much American patriotism?  With all due respect, too bad!  It's an American film, and I see no reason to be apologetic about pride in one's country.  The fact is that the United States was the primary reason why everyone in Europe isn't speaking German and saluting a flag with a swastika on it.  As much as that might tick you off, it's the truth.  Sure the characters could've been Canadian or British, but again, it's an American film.<br/><br/>Too boring after the initial war scene?  Uh, can you say story and character development?  This was not necessarily meant to be an action drama, so if that's what you were looking for, then I can see how you'd be a bit disappointed.  However, each ""boring"" scene DID have a purpose.  The deaths of Wade and Caparzo were important to the underlying ""needs of the many, outweight the needs of the few"" theme.  Otherwise, the end point would have less impact.  I can see how one might feel it seemed slow after the Omaha beach scene, but it's up to the viewer to switch gears at that point and get down to the business of watching a story unfold.  If you want more explosions and blood, watch Platoon or Full Metal Jacket or Hamburger Hill.<br/><br/>Best movie ever?  Pretty close to it, IMO.  I think Spielberg could've spent a little time adding a human face to the German army (as Malick did for the Japanese in Thin Red Line) rather than treating them all like monsters.  But after seeing Schindlers List, I understand his reluctance to do so."

The only thing was that there was smoke on the beach which they couldn't put in the movie because we need to see what's going on.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty young guy (young enough to be drafted), and that movie allowed me to know that I never have to go to combat.

"Syd-14","Null","1","2","14 December 1998"," Devastating
","Devastating film. The landing on Omaha Beach was as realistic as it gets. The sound and the camera angles were superb. Scenes like the inflated dead animals provided a view of war previously unexplored. However, I don´t know how realistic was the freedom given to the German soldier who comes back to haunt the squad and slowly kills Mellish with the knife. That scene was shocking, considering that the other American soldier was slowly drowning in his own blood next to them two, involved in the loudest silence I´ve ever experienced.<br/><br/>Despite a weak plot, I think SPR is an excellent movie, a solid work, and a horrible reminder of the cruelty of war, for those out there who love to WEAR military outfits as a fashion statement and would probably quit three minutes into the battle.<br/><br/>For those who mentioned too much Americanism in the film, sorry. That´s life. As far as I know, this part of the war was an ALL AMERICAN effort, and there´s nothing wrong in saluting once again the flag and the spirit of those who died protecting the freedom Americans enjoy and of which I personally benefited while I lived in the USA. It seems some folks take freedom for granted. I wish you had lived here in Nicaragua during the 80´s. You would understand that spirit much better. If you haven´t experienced lack of freedom -and I´m truly happy for you-   try to refrain from making that type of judgement.<br/><br/>All and all, SPR is one the best attempts ever made to portray the horrors of war as sincerely as possible."

"xxxhisen","Null","1","2","1 December 1998"," why this film is powerful and important
","This is a powerful and important film, first, because it is about salvation or redemption in this world, rather than in heaven.  On the physical level private Ryan gets saved and Captain Miller's squad gets wiped out.  On the figurative level Captain Miller's squad, and everyone in it, is redeemed--saved. Saved, because, in spite of the obstacles--including the squad's own internal dissension--it accomplishes its mission.  But saved most importantly because it has identified a mission that was worth sacrificing for.  At first the squad does not accept the mission as worthwhile.  It comes as a result of a military command from ""top brass"" in distant Washington, D.C.; they don't know Private Ryan, and besides, they have mothers too.  Gradually, and mostly because of the quiet insistence of Captain Miller, they come to accept the mission as their own personal redemption.  They are not going to do it because Washington ordered it. They are going to do it because it is meaningful in their own lives--it is their ticket home; they, along with Ryan, will have earned the right to go home; they will have done their duty.  This personal sense of mission is what the squad finds worthwhile sacrificing for.  It is what keeps the squad together.  It is why they accomplish the mission.  And--for the world is pitiless--it is why all but two die for the mission.<br/><br/>This sense of personal redemption, of having a personal goal or mission in life worth sacrificing for, is the most American theme in the movie.  It is probably why most Americans respond instinctively to the movie.<br/><br/>But Saving Private Ryan is also about art.  It defines art and embodies its definition.  Specifically, the movie defines art as meaningful communication.  Meaningful communication is communication that is meaningful to both sender and receiver, and that occurs in an effective medium.  Within the film's story, the most meaningful communications are the soldiers' letters home.  They are literally from the heart, as they are stained with the soldiers' blood.  Examples of miscommunication or bad communication abound in the movie:  foreign languages, yelling at a deaf soldier, telling the wrong private Ryan that his brothers are dead, not telling a glider pilot that his glider has been armored and is therefore heavier than usual, letters from a national government telling mothers that their sons are dead, even the order coming from Washington.  Meaningful communication can be noisy, but it can also be silent:  the silent cemetery, the unfurled flag, Captain Miller's silences.  Captain Miller is the film's expert communicator--he teaches English composition in civilian life, a pointed fact in the movie.  To the spectator outside the film, the most meaningful communication is the believability of the fact of war--its din, gore, horror.  And, more than anything else, the fact of the sacrifices that soldiers made in that war. Which brings me to the third and final point.  This movie is powerful and important because it portrays the utter desolation of war.  No other movie has affected me the way three scenes in this movie did:  Caparzo's lifeblood streaming out and away from him in the pouring rain; Wade, a medic, begging for more morphine; and Mellish in a life-and-death struggle with a German soldier while an airborne ranger, shot in the throat, is in his own death throes.  Nothing is worse than being a combat soldier.  No one else faces hopelessness and despair like this.<br/><br/>A word to the non-American viewers of this film, some of whom appear to resent its Americanness.  Americans are entitled to portray American experience in their films (and other arts).  Ibsen wrote plays about Norwegian experience, Patrick White wrote about Australia.  That is not to be resented, that is to be respected.  Viewpoints differ.  What else is new?"

It's like as if Spielberg had made that scene just for saying ""hey, see how violent and disgusting I can be?. The rest of the movie might be made for the people who were  born in USA. And since I was born in Uruguay, I didn't like it at all. Because the Americans are always the 'good guys', the only ones who have feelings. Why didn't Steven Spielberg take a look at the Germans? Weren't they afraid too? And what about the last shot of the movie, that American flag?.

"RobinG","10","1","2","18 November 1998"," Stunning Achievement
","I saw Saving Private Ryan 4 times.  The first time, on opening day, I entered the darkened theatre with about 12 other people, most of them my dad's age-W.W.II vets. I went in with no preconceived notions, I read no advance reviews. I began to cry a couple minutes into it, beginning with that sweeping view of the cemetary, all those row upon row of white crosses. I was completely blown away by the battle scenes that followed; the praying, terrified boys in the boats, the machine-gun slaughter and the sound of those gunshots, the blood washing up on shore. My hands had gouges in the palms where my fingernails dug in. I left the theatre that day completely drained, useless. I went back a few days later so I might view the movie with a little more detachment and pick up some finer details. While the opening scenes were still jarring, I was a bit more composed to appreciate the other fine qualities and moments in this film. The characters-perfect in their lightly sketched state,  especially the characters of Jackson the sniper and Wade the medic. The camera work-astonishing, especially in the battle sequences. The memorable little speeches- Wade in the church, talking about his mom. The pilot of the downed plane reliving the crash. Reiben pensively discussing his customers breast size. The death scenes-Wade getting killed and the desperate attempt of his companions to save him. Tom Hanks losing it after that point, his hold on sanity slipping. Mellish stabbed thru the heart, begging for mercy. Months later these things are all very distinct in my mind as is the eerie, screeching whine of that tank lumbering into the rubble-strewn town at the beginning of the final battle. While this was not a perfect film, it came close. I embrace the reaction of four different film audiences as my own. Never in my life have I been to a movie, once, twice or even four times and had entire audiences go deadly silent. In SPR no-one moved, no-one spoke, a great many boys, girls, men and women wept. After the movie ended, people stayed in their seats, stunned.  I have never felt such a universal bonding of emotion that I did during that film.  And that is why Saving Private Ryan is so special.  In this hopeless age, where life is so cheap and the world has become cynical and hardened to death and disaster, it is a relief to know we can still react to atrocities, such as Spielberg showed in this film,  like human beings.<br/><br/>Thanks."

I don't like this movie, although it is very well done from a technical point of view. I don't like because it tries to make war presentable again rather than trying to show how to avoid it.

","This is in response to Tim's complaint about only seeing Americans and Germans depicted in SPR.<br/><br/>The whole premise of this film is to depict the horrors that Captain Miller and his men had to endure before, during and after  they located  Private Ryan, leading to the fundamental question at the end of the film, something about ""earn this"".  You remember don't you?<br/><br/>The D-Day scene opens with a caption June 6, 1944.  Omaha Beach Dog Green Sector.  Although an Allied invasion site,  according to my history books Omaha was an AMERICAN objective that resulted in over 2500 casualties.<br/><br/>Secondly, the mission was to locate an AMERICAN Private.  I doubt that England, Canada, Austrailia or ( fill in the blanks with country of your choice ) would commit troops to locate a lost American.  As far as Russia is concerned, most of them were busy on the Eastern Front.  While the Americans were traipsing through the countryside, they were heading toward areas where they knew Americans may be, i.e.  101st Airborne rallying points, while at the same time trying to avoid armed conflict with the enemy.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if you were insulted by the lack of representation of other Allied troops, but again this film was based on a real  American soldier, ( who was actually  tracked down by an Army Chaplain) not a British, Canadian or Australian."

","Phew, where do you start? A film that shows at last what bullets and bombs do to the human body. A film that shows that war is not about glory and seeing off a few of the enemy before getting home for tea. It makes me wonder how those men stayed sane when they got home, IF they got home. I found the film compelling and very, very disturbing. All too many American blockbuster films show people blazing away and the nasty men meeting their fate,but this one I believe is as close as a film has got to getting anywhere near the truth, if the vets accounts are anything to go by. And if it is, then I'm bloody glad I wasn't 18 in 1944...<br/><br/>The most moving part of the film for me was when the troop attacked some kind of radar installation, on the way to finding Private Ryan. After the attack one chap lies there with bullet holes in his chest, whilst his mates try and help him. Slowly he starts slipping away, and cries out for his mother, and his home. It's a scene that's still with me, weeks after seeing the movie. Another splendid side of the film for me was that there wasn't a clean cut, gung - ho, invincible hero to be seen...just normal, ordinary, and very scared men.<br/><br/>Any flaws? Well, for me personally, the very end was a little too sentimental, but that's the directors trade mark, I suppose. All in all, a terrific, pulsating, horrific and terrifying film from my point of view. I don't think I'll ever look at an old man in quite the same way again."

"dvdkndrk","10","1","2","8 October 1998"," ""Earn this."" That means all of us
","As I have read the many reviews of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I've noticed, particularly from the more ""serious"" publications, that ""serious"" critics insist on separating the bulk of the film from its bookend scenes of Ryan at the Normandy cemetery.  Those scenes, I've read several times, are ""false,"" ""ham-handed,"" or ""manipulative.""  They could not be more wrong.<br/><br/>These scenes, which begin and end with an American flag shining in the sun, illustrate the gap between the generation of men who crossed through Hell on Earth so that the sun would continue to shine on this country and its liberties, and the succeeding generations who, perhaps, have failed to fully appreciate the debt they owe and the honor due those men who defeated Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan.<br/><br/>In the opening, we see an old veteran, walking alone, his wife trailing him, and trailing her, the children and grandchildren.  We see the son, acting more like a tourist, whose emotional distance from his father is shown by the intrusive clicking and winding of his camera.  Yet, we also see the entire family rushing to his side as he collapses in grief, wanting desperately to comfort him in some way.<br/><br/>At the end, we realize that the old man is Ryan, which is perhaps the only flaw in this otherwise magnificent film.  For this conflicts with the implication from the beginning when the camera zooms toward the old man's eyes to what seem to be his memories of Omaha Beach.  If Ryan dropped behind German lines with the 101st Airborne Division, how could he remember what happened on the beach?  After some thought, I figured that Rieben, the one survivor of Omaha Beach in Captain Miller's squad, might well have told Ryan as they made their way back to HQ all that those men who found Ryan went through.<br/><br/>Some critics have been particularly critical of the last scene, with Ryan imploring his wife to reassure him that has, indeed, ""earned"" what Miller's squad did for him.  I think the scene has far more depth than its critics have given it credit for, particularly in light of an earlier scene.<br/><br/>Recall the lull between the Americans' defense preparations in ""Roumel"" and the final street battle with SS troops, when Miller (Tom Hanks) and Ryan (Matt Damon) come to know each other a little better in a conversation that cannot help but be disconcerting to Miller.<br/><br/>Remarking on Miller's teaching occupation, Ryan jokes that he could never be a teacher himself, having driven his teachers crazy.  ""You're just like a thousand kids I've seen,"" Miller says, probably remembering when he said to Sgt. Horvath, ""This Ryan had better cure cancer or invent a longer lasting light bulb.""<br/><br/>That Ryan doesn't seem particularly special is only reinforced when the only clear memory Ryan can dredge from his brain about his brothers is a prank which embarrassed the oldest brother, humiliated a half-naked girl, nearly destroyed the family barn, and shows too clearly that Ryan, for all his incipient nobility in refusing to abandon his brothers in arms, is still a male adolescent for whom the line between humor and cruelty is rather blurred.  This makes Miller's tight grin and diplomatic chuckle all the more poignant.<br/><br/>As the years passed, I would imagine that Ryan would remember that conversation, and as he matured, realized how superficial he must have seemed to the older Miller, who died that Ryan might live.  We can only guess how heavy it would have weighed on Ryan that he could not show Miller the life he had lived since then, and could not finally know whether he had ""earned"" Miller's gift.  I fail to see anything resembling a ""false note"" here.<br/><br/>To the rest of us, the cross with Miller's name, followed by Old Glory in the bright sun speaks to us in two ways.  It illustrates at what a price our freedom and well-being have been bought.  And with the colors absorbed by the sunlight, thus giving the flag a faded look, it places at our feet Miller's charge to Ryan that he ""earn this"" with equal urgency.  Whether we have earned or squandered this legacy is the question that every person watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" should take to heart.<br/><br/>Finally, a personal note. In 1994, My wife, my son and I had the pleasure of meeting a veteran of the 82nd Airborne Div.  When he left for France to participate in the paratrooper reenactment, we shook hands, and I told him how honored I was to have met him.  ""You're a good man, and you have a beautiful family,"" he replied.  Given the source, I cannot remember ever receiving a higher compliment.  A false note? Of course not.  And neither is the ending of ""Saving Private Ryan."""

","This is the only war movie I have ever seen which is able to really show the true fear of the soldiers. No exaggerated heroes, just men. However I have seen something that wasn't right. I'm not sure if it is a goof or that a small part of the movie is missing. I have seen it in The Netherlands and noticed that Tom Hanks only tells his soldiers his past. When they finally find Ryan and decide to stay, there is a small scene in which Ryan tells Tom Hanks about his brothers. Ryan starts this conversation with a question about Tom Hank's wife and her rosegarden (I believe its a rosegarden, but it could as well simply be roses). Tom Hanks does not answer and says that he's going to keep that story to himself. Ryan however does not know anything about his wife....<br/><br/>Even though this continues to raise questions for me as to if it's a goof or simply due to a cut, I love the movie!

No. This was NOT a good war movie. This was once again a Hollywood product designed to feed the American myth of having died for ""the right cause"". The final salute to the Captain at the cemetery fit nicely into this picture - I almost seemed to hear ""The star-spangled banner""!<br/><br/>At the most, this was a movie asking the question why several people had to go rescue one other man. But an anti-war movie? No way! Schindler's List was a movie with many different aspects to think about. Saving Private Ryan still distinguishes between ""Americans"" and ""others"". As if the soldiers on the other side didn't die just as horrible. Ah - but I forgot: you save a German, he'll be back later to kill you, so you better execute him the first time.

","After all the hype it is fair to say that the first 25 minutes are the finest, most brutal depiction of warfare the screen has seen yet. It is also clear that after years of having the ridiculous notion of war as cool thrust down our throats, such a horrifying depiction in a genuinely mainstream picture was needed. However after such a dazzlingly brilliant start, when the story kicks in we find Spielberg merely trotting out the old clichés we've seen so many times before. Again we're told how glorious, noble and almost desirable it is to die for our country, how the Germans were little more than cartoon villains, and most sickeningly, through the character of the young interpreter, how the correct response to the horrors of war is to lose your innocent disbelief that this could happen and join in. What makes this so sad is the fact that in the accurate depiction of the battles Spielberg has already shown how hollow these notions are. Death in war is as empty and disgusting as any other painful, violent death; at the level of the ordinary soldier the Allies were as scared and selfish as the Germans; and surely the reaction of the interpreter, as he lay sobbing on the battlefield, out of his mind with fear, is the most honest and sane reaction to mass slaughter one could have."

(when in actuality their movie probably sucks).""  To these people; PLEASE GROW UP!<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the actual movie. This was one of Spielberg's many great movies.  This film was an excellent war movie.  It served its purpose immensely; to show the viewers the inhumanity and pointlessness of war.  Im really disappointed it didnt win best picture and that SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE crap did.<br/><br/>Many people watch this movie and say ""wow the first 30 minutes showed me what war was really like!"" While this was true, these people ignore many of the other small aspects of the film that help to bring out this theme of wars destructiveness and dehumanization.<br/><br/>Some of these aspects are; 1.Pvt. Jackson saying a prayer every time he is about to shoot someone...2.Caparzo's letter that has to keep getting rewritten because it kept getting blood on it, first Caparzo's, then Wade's, and then Captain Miller's...3.the squad laughing away as they dig through a mountain of dog tags, not realizing that the dead airborne soldier's buddies are staring them down...4.Capt. Miller's tendency to keep zoning out in the midst of battle. He keeps going deaf for a time and in these scenes he sees all the death going on around him and how pointless it is...5.Capt. Miller's shaking hand, showing how scared he is, and how he wants his gardening gloves in his hand, not a gun...6.Capt. Miller saying how he doesn't give a damn about Ryan and then changing his mind once he actually meets the young man and trades stories with him about home...7.Copl. Upham starts out as a dorky, nerdish kid, strict on the so-called ""rules"" and then at the end works up his courage and executes Steamboat Willie realizing that this is what war is really like and not relying on an Emerson quote to try and get him through things...<br/><br/>There is a lot more examples of this, but I think you can get the message. This movie really shows the viewer about what war is really like and how bad it is.  Not just by showing an army storming a beach and getting blown to bits, but also by concentrating on a few individual soldiers and showing how the war is affecting them.  It was truly one of the best movies ever made and really accomplished its purpose well."

All the acting is flawless, except for the scene where the general says ""We have got to get someone to get that boy the hell out of there."" The film begins with the most intense battle sequence I've ever seen in a film at Omaha beach, June 6 1944.  During the invasion, a boy is killed who is the brother of Private James Ryan, who also lost two other brothers. Since James is the only one left a squad of eight soldiers is sent deep into enemy territory lead by Capitian John Miller (Tom Hanks).  Once they find Ryan, he refuses to leave his squad, which is holding one of only two bridges that brach into Poland.  By the end only Ryan, and two of Miller's platoon is left alive.  As I said before, all the acting in this film is exelent, but the best preformance is Edward Burns' preformance as Rieband.

It won't spoil the story for me to write it here. Those who died in war made a sacrifice that obligates us, the survivors and beneficiaries of their sacrifice, to live life to the fullest and make their sacrifice worthy.<br/><br/>This and many other themes are handled well in a superbly acted story whose visual effects are used to show the aspects of war rather than immerse us in 3D graphics chaos from which we learn nothing (as in Black Hawk Down).<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- War movie buffs<br/><br/>-- Action movie buffs, even if you don't normally go for war films, unless the deep thinking and arty aspects are a turn-off<br/><br/>-- Drama / arty types who don't easily get nightmares<br/><br/>I'll give ""Saving Private Ryan"" an 8 out of 10."

","I was told it was worth it to see this movie for the opening battle scenes alone, and that turned out to be an accurate statement. In no other war movie is there anything like the realism and aura in picturing soldiers being peppered, and sometimes hit, by machine gun fire.  From pillboxes on D-Day, no less, with the tensions of an amphibious landing.  The scenes of the wounded throughout this film are also something else, serving as the archetype and forerunner of ""Black Hawk Down.""  Some points in the battle scenes, beginning and later, might be described as real and surreal at the same time, a la Kubrick.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie as well lived up to the good things I had heard about it.  Tom Hanks does extremely well as Captain Miller, the leader of the pack in saving a private behind enemy lines because all of his brothers, fighting elsewhere in WWII, have been killed.  Hanks is very natural and convincing in this role, leadership qualities and personableness, forcefulness and bravery.  The human element works, and we are moved during the film's progress and conclusion.  See this one."

","Steven Spielberg has made a hymn. This movie pays hommage to millions of lives lost in all wars, by the eyes of soldiers that could be just any soldier. The synopsis isn't important: James Ryan, the last of four brothers will be bailed out of war so that he can return home before he dies. A division is assigned the mission of finding him and bringing him back. But it won't be that easy. It's just that simple, without spoilers. The real juice in this movie is first of all a masterful depiction of war as it was: a stupid carnage that took thousands of lives. And the opening sequence proves what I'm talking about: those must be the most haunting 30 minutes of 90's cinema. The movie's also a great study of how Man reacts when everything has cessed to make sense around him. This movie is not an easy experience. It's a thrill ride, but I'm not talking popcorn: everyone should see it, for his own sake. This movie opens our eyes. And we'll never look at war the same way again.

Although I was in<br/><br/>Vietnam during the war, and although I did come close to being ""blown<br/><br/>up"" over there,  I was not a combat soldier but with an air force<br/><br/>intelligence unit that was located just across the dirt road from the<br/><br/>U.S. Marines.

That this opening twenty minutes is the most harrowing and realistic depiction of the D-Day landings yet seen shouldn't be in doubt, although hopefully I'll never be in a position where I can make such a judgement based on personal experience.<br/><br/>This film says a lot with comparatively few words. The actions of the men speak for themselves, and its to the credit of the cast  including Hanks, whose acting ability I'm usually amongst the first to question  that their honest and understated performances are pretty much perfect.<br/><br/>It's said that Spielberg over-relies on playing with the emotions of his audience, but when a movie succeeds in making you feel humble, you know you've been experiencing a master filmmaker at the top of his game."

","Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, is set in the second World War. The story begins with the American soldiers storming Omaha beach, and hundreds of casualties result. Within the first half-an-hour, there is much blood shed and violence, in order to capture the authenticity of the actual D-Day invasion. It's obvious Spielberg went to great lengths to capture this accuracy, with a sense of documentary-like filming and incredible special effects. Capt. John Miller (Hanks) leads his men into the horrendous battle of Omaha beach, and loses many of his men. After many advances up the beach, and penetrating the German base, they take their prisoners, and what's left of their patrol, and return to headquarters. This is where Miller receives his orders to retrieve Private Ryan (Matt Damon), dropped somewhere in Normandy, and bring him home to safety. Ryan has been chosen to come home due to his three older brothers all dying in the war. Sparing Ryan's mother of the grief of losing all four of her sons, General Marshall has ordered a mission to save Private Ryan. Miller gathers what's left of his platoon, nine soldiers, and heads out to Normandy to find Ryan. Their trek in search of Ryan is no easy task, to quote Capt. Miller, `It's like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles.' Usually plot driven films evolve around 1 dimensional characters, however these characters are far from that. The characters are deep and emotional, many of them reminiscing of their past home lives, families, and fallen comrades in the war, helping to deepen the plot in return. Many of them insult each other humorously, and help deal with their situation by complaining about it. Once in a while, they reveal their emotions to each other, but mostly bottle it up until they are alone. Their journey is hard and deadly. They first arrive to a decimated French town, and lose Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) who attempts to help a young French girl. The message here is, if you open your heart to someone in war, you will only get hurt. In war, there is only room for killing and death. Further along they come along a German bunker, armed to intercept American patrols. Despite the disagreement of his soldiers, Miller orders an assault, and we lose Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi). With one German Survivor, the men want to execute him, but Miller decides to let him go. To settle his men, Miller reveals his background, that he's an English teacher, and that he doesn't want to kill men he doesn't have to. `Every man I kill, the farther I get from seeing my wife.' Finally, Miller and his men find Private Ryan by accident, they tell him their mission, and despite the grief of his lost brothers, decides to stay with his platoon and continue guarding a bridge. Miller eventually decides to help Ryan's platoon guard the bridge, but afterward he's taking Ryan home. Ryan's entire platoon is killed, and 4 of Miller's men as well. By the end of the battle, Miller is shot. Lying next to a fallen comrade, he pulls Ryan down to him and whispers the most important message of the film: `Earn this.' The end scene is Ryan, older now in present day, visiting the American graves in Normandy. He stands above Miller's grave, with his family, showing him that he's a good man, and that he's tried to earn his gift everyday of his life. The plot contains a melodrama, 8 men searching half a country for 1, plus all the obstacles they must confront, and losing 7 lives in the process. Many of the characters appeal to every emotion possible, sadness, despair, fear, happiness, courage, and grief. There is plenty of extravagant action, and the special effects are outrageous. The moral of the story is that war is hell, it's stupid and violent, and leads only to death. Yet men who are willing to stand by each other, help each other in the face of death, and give it their all will survive and live on. This is one of the greatest films ever made, and even semi-based on a true story, but it was one chaplin who was sent to find the soldier."

Most of them are shown as very determined soldiers, unlike the Rangers, who are all over the map.<br/><br/>As for Americans being proud of helping defeat Nazi Germany:  What is wrong with that?  By the time the US entered the war, 3/4 of the Western war effort had been shouldered by that country, not to mention the colossal undertaking in the East.<br/><br/>As far as serious war movies Americans make of themselves, I can only say that, recently, Americans almost always portray themselves in a negative fashion.  The ""Hollywood"" that folks love to bash is notoriously anti-American (these last 30 years).  Don't believe me?  Watch Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Born on The Forth of July, Hamburger Hill, The Thin Red Line, etc.  If you think there is much flag waving in those films, you're very much mistaken.  Some of them were very good, however.  It is charming to listen to foreigners equate ""Hollywood"" with ""America"".<br/><br/>If prejudice against Americans precludes you from enjoying American films, then don't watch them.  If you do, however, I suggest you review the movie, not its country of origin."
"JuguAbraham","6","1","2","26 November 2001"," A very ordinary melodramatic war film
","I guess I am one of the few who do not sing praises about this film. I am a great admirer of Steven Spielberg's early works--especially his small, great film ""Duel"". The later works of Spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences, not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives. It is sad that Terrence Mallick's intelligent film ""The Thin Red Line"" on the same war lost out to this melodramatic, ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money. A few shots of the old Spielberg did surface briefly when the film captured the first rain drops and the boots of soldiers getting wet.<br/><br/>Hollywood has made better war films than this one. The little known ""Castle Keep"" was one such film. Spielberg knows what appeals to the average American mind and makes movies that will be lapped up without giving the average moviegoer any reason to reflect or think. He has begun to play on emotions and is no longer reaching out to thinking viewers. He is aware that this will not make the box-office jingle. Most people do go to movies to relax, not to be wiser. Mallick, on the other hand, makes movies the way he wants them made forcing his viewers to think. Mallick will slowly be recognized as a master filmmaker in the US by adults as time goes by, while Spielberg will continue to appeal to the juvenile minds of adults, who love action and emote easily. The difference was evident, when the Berlin International Film Festival recognized Mallick's film with top honor and the Academy Awards bestowed its top honors on Spielberg in the same year. Viva la difference!"

","I admit I haven't seen the Thin Red Line that others rave about. Personally, I thought this was the best war film I've seen, but that's comparing it to mostly old WW2 movies starring John Wayne and the like.  I won't go into details of how this is good because so many people say it so much better.  The realism of battle, the pain, the desperation of men who know they are dying, the suddenness of death . . .all of that was just fantastic.<br/><br/>However, this is not a perfect movie.  The characters are undeveloped and two dimensional (Giovanni Ribisi came the closest to giving his character more dimension in his one tiny little moment in a bombed out church), though that didn't bother me.  The emphasis was really on the battle scenes.  Tom Sizemore, although we know next to nothing about his character, also gave a performance of some depth.  Tom Hanks character, who was supposed to be so secretive, was the only one we learn about, and that wasn't that interesting.  However, I don't think it was necessary to know the background of each character in this movie.<br/><br/>The worst character in the movie is Matt Damon's Private Ryan.  He was so blahhhhhh.  <br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is the beginning and end, which begins with an old Private Ryan having a ""flashback"" of things he didn't actually witness (how does that happen ?) and ends witha  typical Speilberg like speech/lesson.  Yawn."

After twenty minutes of the graphic recount of the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, we find out that a Private James Ryan, who is behind enemy lines, has to go home after his three brothers have been killed in combat.  Captain John Miller, Tom Hanks, leads a squad of soldiers to find Ryan. With some of the most graphic battle scenes, this is a film that will haunt you.

","Saving Private Ryan, quite simply, is extremely overrated. Oh, the movie isn't a total wash, in fact, about 1/2 is fantastic, but there's also 1/2 total crap. The battle scene that begins the film is fantanstic, especially since it goes on and on for a full 20 minutes. Without a doubt the highlight of the movie. In addition, the men's journey to find private Ryan is usually quite engaging, and the performances, particularly those of Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, and Tom Sizemore, are excellent. However, all that good stuff is surrounded by weak sentiment and logic that rings completely false. For starters, the scenes of the old Ryan that bookend the film are Spielberg at his most cloying. There's nothing more annoying than a director pulling every trick possible to get tears out of his audience. Besides that, the film is extremely manipulative and is derailed by some ridiculous logic at the end. Despite all this, Saving Private Ryan is still a sometimes engaging film, and is worth seeing. But #26 all time? Please! The Thin Red Line, which was released with much less hype the same year is much better. In fact, after you see this movie, track down the HBO film When Trumpets Fade, an extremely underrated war film from the same time with much less phony emotion."

","Spielberg set out to create a war movie unlike anything ever seen, and he succeeded brilliantly.  The visual style puts you right there on Omaha Beach.  The handheld cameras take away the clean, rehearsed feel that can hurt movies that need to rely on realism.  I could go on all day about the film's first half hour- the D-day invasion... but everything the needs to be said about it has already been said.  Suffice to say that it will leave you gasping for air. The story is fairly simple, but it works.  Mostly, it exists for the purpose of developing each character further.  Each character gets at least one moment to reveal himself, and to say something about the nature of men at war.  It can seem a bit preachy at times, but it fits with the pull no punches, unapolagetic nature of the film. The acting is absolutely brilliant.  A great ensemble with no weak individual performances (except possibly Edward Burns-playing the same wise-ass city boy he does in every movie).  My personal favorite performance is that of Giavonni Ribisi.  He brings very convincing honesty to every line he delivers. Anyway, this is one of those movies that everyone needs to see sometime. It sheds new light on one of the most important events in history, while telling a good story at the same time."

My grandfathers were in WW2 as well.My dad was in the 82nd Airborne and he had sergeants that were in the D-Day drop. They have told me how this is the closest thing and best depiction of what it was like. Who am I to argue. They were there. We weren't. They praised the accuracy of the weapons, the characters, their actions and the combat. Plus it was a damn good story. The next most commented on item was how the army after the Sullivans tragedy was damned if it did and damned if it didn't rescue Private Ryan.Like Schindler list, this movie should be shown in high school history classes as part of their lessons on WW2. Veterans told me they would include The Longest Day and Tora, Tora, Tora in that category as well. Too many people knock it because of it's big budget. I don't understand that. The movie works in every way. I first saw SPR up in Alpena, Michigan where it was filled with mostly older WW2 generation people. Some were veterans. They had their wives with them. When we left there wasn't a sound made. Nobody said a word exiting the theatre. SPR touched the crowd that much. I had a Vietnam vet who I work with say that after he saw the movie he was sad/depressed for about three days afterward. he said Platoon didn't even affect him that way. Isn't that the sign of a great movie of this type? One that reaches out and makes you feel things you never felt or experienced before.One that actually moves you very deeply. I witnessed that personally as people left the theatre. I can only hope that Spielberg makes another war movie. Hopefully, maybe one on the Battle of the Bulge.I can hardly wait for Band of Brothers on HBO this fall. This was the greatest war movie ever made. Definitely a must see.As far as the top five war movies go I would rate them this way. 1.) saving Private Ryan 2.) Cross of Iron 3.) The Longest Day 4.)

"virek213","Null","1","2","11 July 2001"," War is Hell
","I find some of the comments that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is another gung-ho patriotic John Wayne-type propaganda movie just a little bit laughable. This is NOT a John Wayne-type my-country-right-or-wrong tract, and director Steven Spielberg has seen to that.  True, Spielberg never fired a shot in anger--but then neither did the Duke!<br/><br/>The whole idea is that war is Hell.  This is true the moment the characters played by Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and others set foot on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 and encounter massive German resistance in one of the most graphic and violent sequences ever captured on film, one that lasts a good twenty-five minutes.  The film then proceeds on as Hanks and his platoon are assigned to find a Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who has lost three brothers in other theaters of World War II, and who is believed to have parachuted down behind enemy lines before the D-Day invasion.<br/><br/>What Spielberg has done is very much in the tradition of Oliver Stone's PLATOON and Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, though in an obviously less iconoclastic fashion.  He has shown how war can bring out the best and the worst in the men who have to fight it.  Granted Spielberg's setting is World War II while Stone's and Kubrick's were Vietnam, but the feeling is the same.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was well-deserving of the Oscars it received, and, like its two Vietnam counterparts, gave me a greater appreciation for what men who must fight these horrible wars, regardless of nationality, go through.  10/10 rating."

For a group of outnumbered green soldiers to take on a tank column without proper weaponery is not only stupid on their part, but very unrealitstic. Anybody would have run. The real attraction for people seems to be the ""greatest generation"" myth which has popped up recently.

","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>Anyone who has not already seen the film might prefer to watch it before reading this review as, in order to make my point, I must discuss the ending.<br/><br/>Although the film contains one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen, the ultimate message and overall impact of the movie were drowned in a sacharine sea of contrived sentimentality and bathos. The one scene that was, of itself, worth the price of admission was the mesmerizing sequence in which one soldier bayonets another in a way that superbly contrasts the intimacy and immediacy of hand to hand combat with the indiscriminate and impersonal butchery of the Normandy landings, portrayed in the opening scenes. I was fascinated, appalled and riveted to the screen. I shall never forget it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, by comparison, the rest of the film was a cop-out. I had recently watched the movie ""Saviour"" and found it a far more powerful statement about war and its impact on those caught up in it. Spielberg's movie could have been even better. He could have created a film that would haunt audiences for generations. Consider this simple twist -Ryan dies and Captain Miller lives. Now how do we feel about Ryan's decision to remain with his comrades? Was he being noble or foolhardy. What would be the difference? Was the Captain noble to disobey orders, or criminally negligent? If Miller is not conveniently taken care of by Fate, will the army punish him? Will he ultimately believe he did the right thing or will he wrestle forever with guilt? Would it somehow have been worse for Ryan to have escaped unscathed while his mates died? Did Ryan have the right to dictate his own actions? Does any soldier? Should they? Was the army hypocritical to place greater value upon the life of one individual within its ranks? What about parents with only one child to lose? Would their burden somehow be less? To who or to what does a man owe his greatest loyalty? Are there even answers to these questions? Maybe war just is Hell!!!<br/><br/>Maybe, but you'd never know it by Spielberg!"

","After reading the plethora of reviews on this movie I'm amazed at how many people think they are experts on war.<br/><br/>Let's keep in mind that Mr. Spielberg directed the movie - he didn't write it.  He no more claims to be an authority on war than my kids do. He is a magnificent director and he does his job well, which is bringing realism and emotion to the forefront of an otherwise brutal look at war. The people who put the film together are some of the most knowledgeable and experienced veterans and historians in the world today so, let's give them a little credit. For those of you who have never been there; don't comment on credibility or realism unless you've actually seen it or done it and have something to compare it to.  Saving Private Ryan is undoubtedly the closest most people will ever come to being in the war, thank god!<br/><br/>The story is based on the hypothetical scenario of seven U.S. Army Rangers along with a cowardly army corporal/translator from the 29th infantry division who are given the outrageous task of finding a paratrooper (Pvt. Ryan) who was dropped behind enemy lines in Normandy, France during Operation Overlord in WWII.  As the sole surviving son of a midwestern family, the brass decides it would be noble to find him and send him home when they realize that all three of his brothers have been killed in the line of duty within 24 hours of each other and his mother will be receiving all three telegrams at the same time.  The real story lies in the frustration of the soldiers themselves at trying to cope with risking their lives foolishly for the life of one man who is just another soldier to them. The orders seem ridiculous to the Rangers, but as Tom Hanks' character (Capt. John Miller) keeps reminding them; they are soldiers and it's their duty to follow orders - Period!  It is a good portrayal of a scenario that could've very easily happened during the war.  Other things far more ridiculous than that did happen.  Trust me.<br/><br/>The movie is well done and very entertaining if you don't look to find an action movie underneath the story.  It's compelling, moving and the Omaha beach scenes are downright shocking at times.  While the movie makes all efforts to be as historically accurate as possible, please remember that this is not a history lesson or a documentary.  Tom Hanks plays the part of the ""unknown soldier"", a captain of the Rangers second battalion who were the first american units on the beach at Omaha.  The 2d Rangers were also the unit that, despite insurmountable odds, penetrated the german defenses and secured the beachheads for the rest of the Allied units arriving at Omaha on D-Day.  The fact that they played the parts of U.S. Rangers of the second battalion is a true depiction of some of the greatest heroism this country has ever known alone in itself.  It IS a movie about war and true heroism and it IS historically accurate.<br/><br/>For those of you who think there was too much flag waving and blatant patriotism; what is wrong with that?  And those of you who think that the germans were portrayed as being too evil?  This movie is about eight soldiers following orders and doing their jobs above and beyond the call of duty.  It has NOTHING to do with who was the good guy and who was the bad guy.  If you want to see a movie that portrays war from a german soldier's point of view, watch ""All quiet on the western front"" or, better yet, read the book!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in war movies. It IS very accurate historically right down to unit numbers and troop disposition, as well as the general attitude of the soldiers themselves. At least Mr. Spielberg has the common sense to hire some of the best people qualified to make the storyline authoritative, such as Steven Ambrose.  He doesn't take it upon himself to try to re-create history itself.  The effects are astounding and the acting is good.  If you don't like Tom Hanks being portrayed as a patriotic war hero than you definitely won't like this movie.  While he's not John Wayne, Mr. Hanks is definitely America's archetypical hero actor of today.  Don't make the mistake of comparing Private Ryan to Vietnam war flicks. It's a totally different genre that has never been captured so intensely on film.<br/><br/>Not a good movie for the kiddies to watch. Lots of violence and graphic scenes."

American soldiers who've just seen their buddies blown to bits make friends with the enemy?  One of the great strengths of this film is that it's viewed through the eyes of these young men.  When the nervous little translator laughs and talks with the soldiers' German captive, that actually felt realistic, but not negative.  The German was a young man, too, and you almost felt sorry for him when the other soldiers consider shooting him.  The film simealtaneously shows both sides and the viewer realizes the truth: when fighting a war, you're killing not just some faceless shadow.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, it fails and seems to plod on from scene to scene until the big finale when action takes over again.<br/><br/>I admire the fact that it is trying to bring to life an event that so many of us can not imagine.  I, for one can not realise what the men who fought for their country (any country) gave and hopefully never will have to, but this film tries to address the issue.  Successfully too.  That is where the film succeeds.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't identify with any of the characters within Tom Hanks' team.  To me, it seems they are just a large group thrown together so they all can be killed one by one as a kind of sacrificial lamb.  A kind of ""oh it's another battle scene, which one shall we kill off this time"".  In between, the conversations between the characters seems a filler to try and give the individual some personality so you feel for them when (if) they eventually die.  For me personally, I was losing interest and was actually wondering which one would be next. An average film overall but does show that not all aspects of war are about glory.<br/><br/>A once in a lifetime experience.  i.e. I would only recommend you watch it once.  Not the type of film to watch again and again.<br/><br/>To the people writing about only Americans being shown in the war - An American group of soldiers landing with an American infantry sent on a mission by their leader (an American, obviously) to rescue an American soldier from a place where only Americans are based.  It doesn't seem that strange to me.   If I was the leader, I know I wouldn't go to a group of British or French soldiers asking the whereabouts of an American soldier, surely you would go where Americans are based."

","This movie was realistic, but that's about all it had going for it.  Basic plot, basic characters.  Quentin Tarintino on his worst day could produce a more compelling cast of characters to feel for.  I can name off the top of my head a lot of better war movies than Private Ryan.  Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Apocalypse now, etc...."

And since when do you judge a movie in accordance with its special effects? Does that mean Matrix is the best movie ever? (I love the matrix, I am just making a point). In actuality, this movie was VERY boring. Also, the way in which the beach scene was shot was no clever, it was stupid and annoying. If they're going to show the scene, I don't care to be in the shoes of the soldier if I'm not going to be able to see what was going on. If the camera needs to be in 1st person, keep it there. To change around was so unprofessional. That scene was a little entertaining when it wasn't annoying, the gore was cool. But I am a gore enthusiast so it doesn't make sense. The rest of the movie was anti climatic and boring."
"samanito","3","1","2","24 October 2000"," Cheap
","Although this movie cost millions and millions of dollars, Steven Spielberg went for cheap ideas. Yes, this movie is just a heap of tricks and cliches that can appeal to a great bulk of the population, as it evidently did.<br/><br/>Sequences made of shots of guts being spilled, heads blown up intersected with sounds of war and then complete silence can be thought to be a very ""artistic"" and ""intelligent"" way to construct a movie, but in this film it certainly is not the case. The film lacks ideological background, it just plays and replays on the already used reused and recycled ""horrors of war"". Yes we know war is horrible, yes we know war is inhumane. What is Saving Private Ryan portraying that is new? It just plays on emotions that the public readily agrees to have, this movie hardly makes anybody think, its just restating what countless others have already said. The film is not innovative at all, it uses a formula which will guarantee positive public reaction, big bucks, an Academy Award nomination and hopefully an award, as it sadly did.<br/><br/>The film on its formal standpoint is just another postclassical Hollywood movie, a lot of people, big names on screen, special effects, nothing out of the ordinary. Do we see innovative or powerful use in its lighting? No. Editing? No. Camera movements? No. They do look spectacular I must agree with that, but nothing else, they have no concept to fall back on.<br/><br/>This is just one of the hundreds of movies that play on cliches and don't dare to go beyond, they do not dare think."

What people fail to realize is that Spielbergs' movies look so good because of his cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski. So stop heaping all the praise on Spielberg.

"ralphwiggum","6","1","2","28 June 2000"," Most realistic war movie? I don´t think so.
","(This might contain spoilers.)<br/><br/>Call me crazy, but as a movie SPR is not more realistic than, say, the ´poetic´ Thin red line. Especially during the final scenes, it has the feeling of an old John Wayne flick, when our brave heros fight against an evil, much superior but dumb enemy, and in the last moment, when everything seems lost, the cavalry arrives and saves the day. And beside that, who destroyed the french village where this final battle takes place? Apparently not the Americans (of course), but when Paris fell after a six week campaign in 1940, the war in France was over and there was no need for the Germans to destroy villages in the far west. In terms of realism, movies like Das Boot or Hope and Glory, and I am sure, many other films, that I have not seen yet, are superior to SPR. You might refer to it as the most realistic depiction of the day on Omaha Beach, that´s all.<br/><br/>But the first 20 minutes are truly devastating. Utterly brilliant in its choreography. It is not possible to recreate Omaha Beach on the screen, but Spielberg did his (or anyones) best to give the audience a hindsight, what happened to those brave men in that battle. After this first act, the movie goes pretty straight downhill. I didn´t care for the characters. The members of the SPR-Squad are a bunch of stereotypes, representing the most average and archetypical group of American WWII soldiers you can imagine. I believe, this is done by purpose, and a bad idea, because without interesting characters, a movie cannot be that good. Therefore, it has a story, not character driven plot, that drags unfortunately heavily in the middle hour of the movie. Some are irritated by the patriotism and complaining (Where are the British, the French, the Australians, etc.), but hey, this was made by Americans for Americans about Americans, and that´s o.k. In fact, after this and the Korean war, the US-boys might never have been the entirely good ones again. In summary, without the brillant first battle, SPR would be only a mediocre war flick. 6.5/10"
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","2","27 May 2000"," Absolutely among the greatest war films ever made, with just a few unforgivable mistakes.
","As a die-hard Steven Spielberg fan, I find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like Saving Private Ryan anything less than a 10, but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me, mainly because they could have been avoided so easily. For example, whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like Matt Damon (and yes, I realize that he is not a teen himself, but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls) in the role of a private in a World War II film?! Tom Hanks was perfect, but only because he is one of the best actors working right now, and he can do a great job in virtually any role. Furthermore, Ted Danson literally stops the film in its tracks.<br/><br/>
However, Saving Private Ryan, despite these superficial problems, is a truly timeless film, and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of World War II. Besides being hugely entertaining, a lot can be learned from this film. It is a landmark in filmmaking history and should not be missed."

","This has been one of the most controversial films I have seen in 1998, most people agreed that this has been a great movie, but I don´t see it that way, they left behind a valid motive to save Ryan, in a war that is unfair there is no point on saving a single man and risking the life of others that are as same as Ryan, that have the right to leave a war that is not theirs. I have to agree that the movie has one of the best realistic scenes ever, has impressive shots on D-day, but there is no valid argument, no deep thoughts of what every INDIVIDUAL is having (like Thin Red Line, but is unfair and not appropriate to compare both of them), somehow they forget about that everyone is important and not just one special guy, this becomes a selfish way of thinking."
"fondblue","3","1","2","4 May 2000"," Less a Film Than a Flattering, But Pallid Simulation
","With all of Hollywood at his disposal Spielberg has no excuse for his own mediocrity as a film maker.  This ""simulation"" fails for the same reason that it is possible.  Viewers leave the theaters believing that they understand war, what it was like to be there, and that they have seen a ""realistic"" portrait of war.  Saving Private Ryan makes war comfortable and knowable even in its supposed gritty action.  If anything, Spielberg's method suggests a realistic portrayal of what it was like to fantasize about the war while remaining on the homefront... thus in his footage of the landing scene, Spielberg consciously imitates newsreel footage which was viewed back home rather than as it was seen on the beaches.  It is a style of film making which believes that the truth is in the details, but the end result is a lifeless mannequin with no soul or inner truth.  Saving Private Ryan is much like the photographic snapshot, which however more ""realistic"" never conveys the deeper meaning and realism of a painting.  Although perhaps a deserving pat on the back for a generation which faced something truly awful, in the end I believe Speilberg has done veterans a disservice by flattering millions into believing they understand what it was like to be there (or how else could so many non-veterans talk of the ""realism""?"

This is doubtlessly the most historically accurate movie I've ever seen. Even the dialogue is perfectly written, with surprisingly close attention paid to the accuracy of even the mildest, most casual and briefly-dealt-with topics of conversation. The battle scenes are excellent, and the carnage is both realistic and necessary to add to the film's power. And the underscoring, subtle and sparingly used, is truly beautiful.<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN will go down in history. It makes us both understand and appreciate the sacrifices made by our soldiers over 50 years ago.

"drystyx","7","2","7","15 May 2007"," throwback to old war movies
","This is a throwback to old war movies, make no mistake. We have an identifiable group of men (eight of them), who go on a mission. This one is to risk their lives to save one man. Its based upon the story of the Sullivans, a group of brothers who all died, and the Department of Defense decided it was time to act so that not all of a family would perish in war. The Sullivans served together on the same ship (The Indianaplois), and perished. Of course if they had lived, they probably would have just moved to the East coast, had their own ship, go hunting for a giant shark, and made fun of college kids, then get eaten by a shark any way. So these eight soldiers look for Private Ryan, the last of his family, and are to make him return home. Along the way, they suffer casualties. There isn't a lot of new material here. A lot has been made of the gore, but even the old films had gore to equal or outdo this. Old World War Two films didn't hesitate to have men lose their legs when tanks would run over and amputate them, or to be horribly disfigured. So there is nothing new. The action comes in bits and pieces until a big fight in the end. Some of it looks a little too contrived, to be honest, as though the director was aiming at some conclusion with all the little conclusions coming first. True to old time movies, minor characters die first, and also true to old time movies, men from New York and cigarette smokers get a free pass and cannot be killed, so you know some who will survive. Just a little too trite and Hollywood to be recommended, but not a bad movie."

","I personally think this film is not as good as its hyped up to me. Yes it might be realistic, but as a film, I've seen better, with deeper meanings and understandings. I hear people say this is the best war film ever made! In comparison to films such as apocalypse now, full metal jacket, paths of glory, even Platoon there is no contest in my opinion. This film is about the soldiers, and what they had to put up with, which any person will feel for, however the films I have mentioned above have more depth, and discuss more important issues, with greater subtleties (in some cases) and take into account the ""grand scheme of things"". Comparing this film with ""Full Metal Jacket"" also is an example of the difference between a ""Hollywood"" director like Spielberg who directed E.T, Indiana Jones, Jaws and Kubrick who directed A clockwork orange, 2001 and Dr Strangelove. Don't get me wrong i loved Indiana Jones, E.T. and Jaws, but when I compare these films with the Kubrick ones, I see a major difference(with the exception of Shindlers List). However good these films are, they are simple stories, whereas Kubrick tackled bigger issues. Saving Private Ryan is not a simple story, but it asks for sympathy, and rightly so, but that is all it does for me. What I would like to say is that the opening battle scenes are remarkable. I am someone who believes in being only one or two, if that really good films a year. I did not think this was one of them."

"CubsandCulture","1","2","8","18 February 2020"," One of the most overrated films of all time-Shakespeare in Love was robbed of 3 Oscars
","There is a weird mythology concerning Saving Private Ryan (SPR) and Shakespeare in Love (SiL) at the Oscars. The myth has it that during the award season SPR simply cleaned up shop until the Oscars announced that SiL won best picture-somehow!- and it was totally out of left field; so much so that it required explanation. I don't know where this myth comes from but it is entirely revisionist. As a point of fact SiL was as well represented in the award season as SPR was and critically the films actually split the major awards all season. Just to stay with the big 3: Golden Globes split with SPR getting director and drama; SiL won screenplay (as a point of fact SiL never lost screenplay to SPR in any award) and Comedy. At the BAFTAs SiL got film and SPR got director, which was repeated at the Oscars. The guild awards split as well; SiL got the critical SAG awards, the WGA and a few of the other guilds (i.e. costumes). SPR picked up the PGA, DGA and Eddie. It is fair to say that SPR was the ""frontrunner"" because of the DGA but the notion that SiL somehow just won the BP Oscar is utter nonsense. I wouldn't have bet on SPR. In anycase this mythology has annoyed me since about 2003 when I first started to hear it. Undoubtedly this colors my perception of the film but I just rewatched SPR for the first time in a decade and it confirms that it was a terrible film. Not only is SiL getting best picture deserved it should have also won editing, directing and especially cinematography.<br/><br/>Ryan's script is truly atrocious. It is a workman like script combining-badly!-several tropes from WWII movies. Much of the resulting drama feels like warmed over hash of better and more insightful films. I think the script adds some pretty disgusting propagandist elements. Many of the characters that show basic humanity-i.e. Wade, Upham, Carparzo-end up dead or as war criminals but without their crimes being rebuked. These elements seem to embrace total war and giving no quarter as the only proper orientation; the overall film is so badly written it is hard to tell the writer's intent. It is especially stark with Upham. His entire character arch feels *redemptive* for first being naive and second being a coward/shellshocked. It is possible that the writer intended for the arch to be punitive BUT Upham's goodness wasn't established per se but his naivety was . And how Spielberg shoots the key moment-and the music-seems celebratory. When I saw this back in the 90's the most chilling part of the film was watching a group of Americans cheer and clap at their countrymen committing a war crime. War films often struggle with not glorifying war-I think this problem is intractable-but Ryan doesn't even bother to kick against this tendency. The cause was just so let's glorify the fatherland.<br/><br/>(The film also is too US centric and by its very plot overstates the importance of the Normandy operation . The war in Europe was largely won on the back of the USSR)<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Spielberg and his army of techs produced some compelling war battle footage. I don't think much of this film-at all-but the first 50 minutes or so is effective at generating a visceral reaction. But the film never again raises to that intensity and the overall narrative feels anti-climatic as a result. There script is so trope ridden that the unflinching realism feels misplaced. To what end is the director putting his skill? To demonstrate that war is hell? Thanks I got that 10 minutes ago. The whole thing is an artless use of cinematic technique to invoke strong gut emotions...and giving the literal US flag bookends the film absolutely is invoking strong nationalist fervor. There's two P words that come to mind for films that do *that.* I'll spell them out for the defenders of this dreck: propaganda and pornography.<br/><br/>The acting/casting-Hanks aside-is also a major source of annoyance. No one gives a bad performance per se but the characters are all such ciphers that the various stars feel out of place, especially today. I burst out laughing when Nathan Fillion showed up. I couldn't help but think about Merlot when Giamatti got his extended cameo. The cast would have done far better sticking to unknowns like Dunkirk or 1917 did. (Again this is partially the result of time moving on.)<br/><br/>I also must say I loathed the cinematography. The acid washed out look, the shaky cam, the inexplicable blurring of the image all haven't aged well today and even the film's visceral power has dulled.<br/><br/>This is utterly awful film."
"jbspurr","2","2","8","25 February 2018"," One great sequence does not a great or even good movie make
","Saving Private Ryan, features one of the most corrupt moral structures in the history of film. Over the last quarter century, only one movie, also radically overrated, is even more pernicious: Forrest Gump. What do we make of the fact that Tom Hanks is the protagonist in both?<br/><br/>That IMDB members rate it so highly reflects poorly on the judgment of the population of ""serious"" film viewers, given the extraordinary array of wonderful films made over the last century.<br/><br/>The film has one sensational feature: the opening sequence. That is enough to make the film memorable, but it does not make it good. Platoon also has a terrifying jungle version of a battle sequence, if not so extensive, but that is integrated into a much better movie.<br/><br/>The first, and essential problem: the plot is completely fallacious, which is worse than being simply made up. The Allied venture in WWII was far too serious an enterprise for a whole platoon to be sent out on an improbable, indeed fool's, errand across country to ""save"" one person while risking them all in an non-essential enterprise, particularly when modern communications obviated the necessity for any such an action.<br/><br/>Second, though it follows standard practice in representing the American population with a mix of backgrounds for the platoon, other than the sainted Captain Miller, played by Hanks, only one person is identified as having an educated point of view though his role back home is apparently clerical, namely Corporal Upham, the translator, and he is painted from the beginning as the coward.<br/><br/>This fact is made abundantly clear during the utterly unnecessary, indeed unwise, assault on the machine gun installation, which puts the lie to the value of their venture when they ignore it to engage in an action that could undo it altogether. Upham, seized with fear, cowers behind as his buddies take the nest. He joins them in time for the debate over the fate of the surviving German, pictured as a nasty customer. He invokes abstract moral principle, arguing that the German should not be summarily shot (Germans being murdered in cold blood are actually shown in the background in scenes of the mop-up just after the beaches have been secured), and thus they decide to let him go since they cannot take him with them.<br/><br/>Jump to the final series of sequences. Private Ryan is found. The good Captain Miller is shot and killed. By whom? By the nasty German soldier they let go earlier, that's who. About this time, that miserable wretch Upham is further demonstrating his utter lack of character by cringing on the staircase of a building while a fight to the death is being going on between another of his buddies and another evil German, who kills the GI with his knife after an agonizing struggle. Soon he has visually abased himself further by cowering in a ditch. Moments later, he is confronted by the evil German who has killed Miller, and another German soldier. They have been taken prisoner (at least as I remember it). The moment the German recognizes him, Upham shoots him point blank, as if to silence a truth and commit the murder he had forestalled near the beginning of the story. We are left to make sense of that, but no interpretation could be a positive one.<br/><br/>The only real lesson of the movie: rules - morality more generally - do not apply to war. If someone is in the way, take care of him. Kill or be killed. If you don't, you will pay. The good side is good regardless of what it does; also, in this stupid plot, regardless of how senseless it is.<br/><br/>Finally, Saving Private Ryan is the surest realization of the Achilles heel that has dogged Spielberg all of his career: his impulse to the maudlin or safe, accept that here he is dishonest the moment the plot kicks in and continues to be right to the end. He would have been a truly great director but for this fault, which tainted such memorable films as Schindler's List and the endings of Minority Report and AI."

We do not know who this elderly man is. He then looks out toward the sea and then begins the flashback of the D-Day invasion. The next 29 minutes or so is a superb, factual, brutal and graphic account of the American landing on beach, code named ""Omaha"". The loss of life on ""Bloody Omaha"" was enormous and unimaginable. After the break through, we see a soldier collecting some soil in a metal container. Here is where the first mistake occurs. We see that this soldier has other containers with soil samples as well. On one of the containers the word, ""Italy"" is written. Well, my friends, there is no way that this soldier could have been in Italy and then called upon to take part in the Normandy invasion.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, we learn that the elderly man is none other than Private Ryan. Here comes the other big mistake. In the story Private Ryan was parachuted behind enemy lines. He was NOT part of the seaborne D-Day invasion. How could he possibly envision the invasion when he was not there at all. Any flashback involves the person being physically present in any given situation.<br/><br/>Well, there you have it my friends.

I happened to see The Thin Red Line first in the theatre which was a tremendeous experience to me. After that I saw Saving Private Ryan and I thought it was a huge step down from the Terrence Mallick masterpiece about Guadalcanal which I'm afraid was released the worst time possible. I definitely believe that the succes of SPR has something to do with the Oscar winning director Steven Spielberg who's a certain winner every time. But I look at SPR as a way too classical movie with the classic white vs black scenario. Not much more than an easily digestive action film which has great effects and great action but nothing that gets to me like The Thin Red Line did it. Sorry, Spielberg."

","Steven Spielberg's 1998 exercise in Oscar-mongering is a compilation of effects and impressions from all the war movies he's ever seen, decked out with precise instructions about what to think in Robert Rodat's script and how to feel in John Williams's hokey music. There's something here for everybody--war is hell (Sam Fuller), war is father figures (Oliver Stone), war is absurd (David Lean, Stanley Kubrick), war is necessary (John Ford), war is surreal (Francis Coppola), war is exciting (Robert Aldrich), war is upsetting (all of the preceding and Lewis Milestone), war is uplifting (ditto)--and nothing that suggests an independent vision, unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual (the visceral opening sequence, showing Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944) or someone getting graphically shot underwater. The story is about a squad trying to find and send home a private whose three older brothers have already been killed in World War II; it's a mission ordered by General George C. Marshall (backed by the authority of Abraham Lincoln, who's backed in turn by Spielberg) and executed by Tom Hanks, a captain named John instead of Joe. It has a few pretty good action moments (including a climax straight out of the Indiana Jones trilogy), a lot of spilled guts, a few moments of drama that don't seem phony or hollow, some fairly strained period ambiance, and a bit of sentimental morphing that reminds me of Forrest Gump; it also lasts the better part of three hours. With Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Barry Pepper."
"n-27208","5","1","3","26 November 2019"," Intense and realistic but maybe too much.
","I watched the movie: Saving Private Ryan at school for a practical assignment. Saving Private Ryan was an intense movie with very realistic scenarios. The film is directed in an interesting way. The film tried to be well-organized but failed at times because there was a lot of shouting and shooting and all sorts of things that happened at the same time, so I didn't know what to focus on. The way the camera was used was not special but not bad either. I often didn't even know if the good or the bad person died, and because the characters were not introduced well enough, I didn't notice the development of the characters very much either. The film had realistic dialogue at most moments, but sometimes the dialogue was also very detailed, which prevented me from following it very well. The dialogue was also a bit dry at times, but the dialogue was certainly what people could say in real life, and the moments where they talked were my favorite moments of the movie because the fight scenes really didn't do anything to me. The editing of the film was not spectacular but it was fine and not something that annoyed me during the film. The costumes and the decor were both very realistic and good. There was almost no background music, but if it was there, i didn't really notice it. The film was very graphic and i think that was a bit unnecessary at times but I understand that they wanted to make it very realistic. The movie being realistic made it a bit boring to me but the director of the move was certainly very responsible with the historical correctness of the movie and I respect that."

","Let me get this out of the way first, the Omaha beach scene is absolutely fantastic and brilliantly directed, it may be the best individual scene in Steven Spielberg's career. The problem is that it sets the bar too high.
Saving Private Ryan is anything but a bad movie but it's a film that doesn't deserve its run time. Sure we get good interactions and a particular memorable liberation, but I feel it could have been cut. My biggest problem is the ending, not the battle however, but the aftermath
Don't want to get into details, but the film is great and is definitely worth a watch. But it has one thing in common with UP, the beginning completely outshines the rest"

","At first, I didn't know what to expect from this film. But at the end of it.. I was overwhelmed beyond any words.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie is just BEAUTIFUL, yet terrifying. The first 25 minutes were absolutely amazing and we all felt like we were sucked into the movie and found ourselves fighting alongside the soldiers. It was the most realistic and graphic portrayal of war till date. The whole film is filled with action and it keeps us all on the edge of our seats. The sound mixing and the picture itself is amazing.<br/><br/>The acting was just BRILLIANT. The crew is just amazing. Every actor plays his role almost flawlessly. And Tom Hanks was the icing on the cake. I must say that this is his one of his most phenomenal roles ever. <br/><br/>The direction was once again Outstanding. Spielberg really went out of this world in this movie. The way he took the movie is just Breathtaking. The final fight in Ramelle might have been dry if not for Spielberg's direction.<br/><br/>Synopsis: An elderly man and his family visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial. The man walks around the cemetery and, upon seeing a particular grave, he falls to his knees.<br/><br/>We are then thrown into Omaha beach on June 6, 1944, along side American soldiers who are to fight the Germans, led by Capt. John .H.Miller. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. They eventually win the battle but not after losing many men. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with the name ""S. Ryan"" on the back of his pack, is shown.<br/><br/>Then we are taken to Washington D.C, where General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were K.I.A and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams on the same day. He learns that the fourth son, PFC James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is M.I.A somewhere in Normandy. Marshall, after reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter, orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately.<br/><br/>Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company. A Paratrooper in Miller's squad, dies after being shot by a sniper.<br/><br/>Eventually, they locate a Private James Ryan, but soon learn that he is not their man. They find a member of Ryan's regiment who informs them that his drop zone was at Vierville and that his and Ryan's companies had the same rally point. Once they reach it, Miller meets a friend of Ryan's, who reveals that Ryan is defending a strategically important bridge over the Merderet River in the fictional town of Ramelle. On the way to Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralise a German machine gun position, despite the misgivings of his men. A medic from Miller's squad dies. Miller, at a Cartographer's urging, declines to execute a surviving German, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie"", and sets him free on condition that he give himself up as a prisoner of war to the first Allied unit he encounters. A paratrooper declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission, prompting a confrontation with his Sergeant. The argument heats up until Miller defuses the situation by disclosing his background in civilian life, about which the squad had earlier set up a betting pool. The paratrooper then reluctantly decides to stay.<br/><br/>Upon arrival at Ramelle, Miller and the squad come upon a small group of paratroopers, one of whom is Ryan. Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, the mission to bring him home, and that two men had been lost in the quest to find him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not consider it fair to go home, asking Miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay ""with the only brothers he has left."" Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available. Using his own men and the accompanying paratroopers, Miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined town.<br/><br/>The enemy arrives. Although Miller and his squad inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, most of the paratroopers are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Miller is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armoured units which rout the remaining Germans. The cartographer surprises a group of German soldiers as they attempt to retreat. Steamboat Willie, raises his hands in surrender, believing that the cartographer will accept because of their earlier encounter. Having witnessed Captain Miller being shot by Steamboat Willie, The cartographer shoots him and lets the other surviving Germans flee. Miller dies due to the wounds.<br/><br/>It is revealed that the man in the Normandy Memorial is Ryan, and the grave he is standing at is Miller's. The elderly Ryan asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life, and worthy of the sacrifice of Miller and the others. His wife confirms it. Ryan then stands at attention and delivers a salute toward Miller's grave.<br/><br/>Note: I have heavily borrowed some parts of the plot from various other sources.<br/><br/>And finally, There are a few flaws in this movie. However, I will point out the major one. This movie was purely an ""American"" one. One must know that the Allied soldiers also consisted of the British and Russian soldiers. However, the movie ignores them completely.<br/><br/>This is the best war movie till date and it's a must-watch for movie buffs."
"jhnachos","10","1","3","16 March 2017"," The best snub film that isn't a snub film.
","It is hard to show the past especially if someone wasn't there to see it. No matter how many books are made and stories are told you will never get the accurate story. Now a days kids will go to see their Grandpa who has stories to tell them about World War 2. These stories are properly exaggerated and never tell the true story. Saving Private Ryan accomplishes in 30 minutes what Grandpa couldn't tell in his entire life. It is a film that shows what the war was actually like and shows film viewers the true D-Day. That's not the only thing good about the film it manages to keep its plot as interesting as anything else I watch and with its extremely well developed characters make this one of the best films I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Saving Private takes place during World War 2 around the D-Day invasion (obviously). We start off meeting Captain Miller as he commands his squad as they are about the storm the front lines during the D-Day invasion in the most realistic depiction of this event ever to be written or filmed. The first 30 minutes is pretty much exactly what happened during the invasion and is the best part about the film. As you could see the film is called ""Saving Private Ryan"" so you are wondering who is Private Ryan. After the invasion Captain Miller and his squad are ordered to go off and find a Private Ryan and bring him home. After that the squad is left to each other. Each actor flushes out their character to the point that you can understand everything they are feeling. Although the film is lead by the big names like Tom Hanks, Edward Burns and Tom Sizemore less known actors like Adam Goldberg and Barry Pepper find their moments in a film full of greats. The dialogue is also a huge part of the really helps with flushing out all of the characters emotions. I was afraid that the dialogue would just be cheesy and have stuff like people just screaming ""Grenade"" and ""Get down"" but there is so much more that makes everyone in the squad feels like a family. Matt Damon who plays Private Ryan is not in the film for that long, but is so well developed especially in his conversations with Tom Hanks that I thought he was in the film for the whole time. The score by the way is as Superb as I thought it would be. It really drives home how depressing everything was.<br/><br/>Although the dialogue, acting, plot and score are all very well suited for a World War 2 film, the sound and editing are different beasts entirely. Every time there is a gunshot or a tank fire off you feel it like you were standing next to it during the time that it happened. I have never heard a more realistic War World 2 film ever. The sound is a huge part of this film and does a lot to make this movie feel like a World War 2 movie. <br/><br/>Another thing that Saving Private Ryan succeeded in was cinematography. If there was a movie that I would think was the blueprint of great cinematography, this is it. It has everything that makes a movie great, amazing shots, great editing and fantastic screenplay. I could talk more about the film, but the 11 Oscar nominations including for Set decoration and makeup make this film what some call, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all Saving Private Ryan is the type of film that inspires young filmmakers like me to dream big and believe that anything possible. I have never been so driven to make and study films and although it seems like I am just praising an overrated World War 2 movie, I am actually praising one of the great masterpieces of film and giving it justice since it didn't win best motion picture (Fuck Shakespeare in Love). Overall if want to witness master cinematography, direction, acting, editing and especially sound, then this should be the first movie you watch."

"edacenimanoy","10","1","3","1 March 2017"," Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men set out on a bold mission to save a young Private Ryan.
","If you need an action filled movie based off of something that really did happen in history, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is your best bet. Actors such as Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are casted in the movie. Tom Hanks playing Captain Miller and Matt Damon playing Private Ryan. Even though the story may not be based on a totally true story, it's battle scenes action make it seem real. In the Steven Spielberg movie, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" shows scenes from D-Day that no other movie can compare to.<br/><br/>It's opening scene with D-Day is gruesome, disturbing, but awesome. It gives the audience an idea of what the battle was actually like. Spielberg's ability to bring us from different locations in the battle was amazing. We started off with the men on top of the boats then we see the men struggling to get up the beach, people dying everywhere. We see the explosions of bombs and the sounds of machine guns tearing up the beach. When all seemed lost and impossible, they make their way up the beach, leaving most of their dead comrades on the beach. Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks, takes control and leads his men up the beach. Blood dyes the ocean. The opening scene of D-Day on the beach costed 12 million dollars. Shot on the beach of Ireland, this scene proved to be a hook in the beginning of the movie. In addition to this vivid opening scene, there are also many small battles that reenact the battle scenes that took place in open fields and in the rubble of the street of Germany. The constant action keeps us thrilled wondering what happens next. The feeling of a sniper waiting to pull the trigger leaves all of us viewers at the edge of our seat often waiting, cringing if he is going to shoot. We can also feel the internal struggles and pain that the soldiers are facing. Some examples are losing a comrade or deciding whether to advance or not, knowing that enemies lay ahead. Their personal value is questioned later on when 12 men are ordered to save one soldier who is supposed to be withdrawn from war. The plot and the action is so vivid and realistic.<br/><br/>The movie was said to be extremely realistic. Rumor had it, the Department of Veteran Affairs had to set up a hot line for veterans with Post Dramatic Stress because the movie reminded them of the traumatic experience they went through.<br/><br/>So if you want a movie with great scenes, Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is for you. Even if you don't like action, it is based on a partially true story with realistic scenes from World War II. ""Saving Private Ryan"" can get emotional and will make you realize how sad it is for the veterans. This movie surfaces the struggles that the veterans in World War II had to face and what it takes to overcome a dark time in history."
"bikrommukherjee","10","1","3","15 February 2017"," Earned this
","From DreamWorks & Paramount Pictures here comes 'Saving Private Ryan' which is directed by Steven Spielberg & written by Robert Rodat & with the great director it has great actors like Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns & Tom Sizemon.<br/><br/>During the embankment on D-DAY Ryan family loses their three sons OSS decides to pull back Private James Ryan for his family's sake but he is the biggest mystery, so this mission is handed to Captain Miller & his privates.<br/><br/>I know you might complain that its about American soldiers but the fact is even if it's about American or Indian life of soldier is very difficult especially in their psychological levels & they made every possible sacrifice for defending us. Honestly I don't have any clue about WWII because I studied more of Indian History but thanks to Medal Of Honor : Frontline video game actually it covers first 2 levels of 1st act (your finest hour & into the breach) which helps to understand events of D- DAY & the 1st level (seaside stormway) of 2nd act helped me to understand whole 3 acts of the movie. Coming to main parts of the movie 1st which is action it is best, filled with gore, it is realistic especially while making strategies the way of taking tanks down or destroying Nazi bunkers & it has suspense... A tension about things going worst & 2nd it has good emotional deliverance it has strong effects & meanings, if you ask me what is my fav scene my answer is when the Privates take the tags of the other dead soldiers to take out their frustration to find Ryan they make jokes on those tags & other soldiers were marching & looking with a grin after that Miller takes situation seriously & shouts the situation & Ryan's deaf friend gives answers about asked questions... It truly shows how tuff is the life of veteran is... & There are many plus Background score by John Williams which gave high rise of symbolism & feeling but not only these it really has bust out laughter moments too. Coming to the characters Captain Miller which is portrayed by the Tom Hanks & he truly an incredible actor, as Miller he was secretive he doesn't tells anyone about his personal life, Matt Damon as Ryan played a pretty badass character otherwise I was thinking he was in the process of KIA & these people are going to save him but his in his entry scene I was like ""holy crap that's Bourne's maternal grandpa."" He was efficient all the way & another character which I really liked is Corporal Upham played by Jeremy Davis was great, the way his character proceeds further was really interesting. At last the cinematography, it done very well it - it really drove me into the year 1944... Camera work, lighting & sound effects really drove me into battlefield & as a director Spielberg is really FUBAR I appreciate it like the camera work which is so authentic to WWII it has that edgy style he explained the bond of the soldiers - it starts with official acquittance, they become friends, they become brothers & soon because absence of your family they become your family then anyone of them dies it leaves a traumatic scar for rest of life. Being honest I haven't found a single negative in this movie.<br/><br/>For Saving Private Ryan I'm going with all in & I recommend it to everyone because it is a really heart touching movie."

","Despite me giving this movie a 10/10(which I totally think it deserves by the way), and it being in my opinion one of the best war movies in recent times if not of all time. I couldn't take Tom Hanks that seriously, I mean his acting was great, one of his best movies he has ever acted in. I couldn't take him seriously because he is the voice of Woody from Toy Story. I kept picturing Woody in the situations Tom Hanks were talking through, which slightly annoyed me. This is more of a nitpick as a person who has only seen all 3 Toy Story Movies before Saving Private Ryan. But I couldn't let that ruin the whole movie and I appreciated its very indulging yet graphic scenes and it really gave me an idea of what it was really like to be in WWII and what it was like to be a survivor of this immensely devastating War."
"PartialMovieViewer","9","1","3","18 May 2016"," Very Good Movie - NEWS Flash...It's a Movie...Not History
","So this movie is ONLY 250 out of 250? Once again I have to wake myself up and realize that tastes are subjective and very, very dated. I can come to terms with that reality but I just don't understand why some really useless garbage gets rated higher than this flick. Is this a pro-war movie? Well, 'yes', if you are an idiot. Are there historical flaws in this production? Really? You are upset about that? I guess you don't know where the library is. Now I know that there are many of my fellow reviewers who just don't give out tensor even nineslike me. I am a ratings trampI admit it. I hand out tens and nines like candy. Why? Because I can. And if you still see yourself as some kind of 'movie snob', good work, just don't tell me...I can only laugh so many times in a day. Also try not to stick your silly little pinky out in my presence, I might just snap it off at the knuckle. Phew, no worriesI am over it. All kidding aside, I will admit (with regret I guess) I am not one for smothering myself in self-love just-because-I-can-sit and watch a stupid movie, and then voice an opinion. A turnip can do thatOMG. And not being a turnip or any other kind of vegetable, I have made myself my own perfect Segway to voice my view. First: This movie is just a movie – not history. Second: ""Saving Private Ryan"", although vaguely based on fact, is a product of Hollyweirdland, starring Hollyweirdos; directed by a Hollyweirdo. Note to reader: These folks often discard history and spin stories to their liking, increasing box-office cash-flow. Three: One of the best movies made, and this is from a whiner. Now it just so happens, the person directing this movie (Seven Spielberg) is probably one of the best out there. I like most of his stuff and some, I do notbut anything he doesit is always top quality. The camera work and acting are all pretty spectacular as well. The most talked about part of the movie is the harrowing display of carnage experienced by those just before hitting the beach. To think of the courage it took for a person to step around and over the mangled bodies of friends, you were just talking to, and at the same time, dodge ricocheting bullets. Accurate or not, fear and dread is brilliantly captured on film. To think of what each of these men were thinking, anticipating the worst and still, they carried on. That is unquestioned bravery. And then I see a review questioning the absence of British accents, really? And they mark the movie down for that? OK, to each his own, but I suggest you open a book son, and see where the Brits landed and where the US landed in Normandy. Better yet, take a trip to New Orleans and visit the World War Two National Museum in New Orleans. There you can talk to some actual survivorsnot actors. If you wish getting your history first hand, make the trip these people are getting old. And please remember, we were trying to win a war – a pretty serious one at that –there was no time for tinkle-dances of spineless multiculturalism. OK, I am recovered. This movie is one-of-a-kind. I think what Mr. Spielberg did is a great thing. ""Saving Ryan"" also has a cast that is beyond reproach. I really like Tom Hanks. The guy is an 'Oscar Magnet'. If a producer is craving success, put Mr. Hanks in a scene full of blow-up dolls – nomination for sure. I guess Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Ted Danson and Vin Diesel are included in the castbut who are they? I kid. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen. I have watched movies once and through they were stupendous but never bothered to watch them again – this one – I can watch many times over."

You wouldn't have known who was shooting at your or what was going on.

"lucasversantvoort","7","1","3","6 May 2015"," Way too formulaic in its depiction of the horrors of war
","Throughout film history, there's been a constant fascination with war. As new documentaries on the two great World Wars appear every year, so do films on similar events. From All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) to the recently released Fury (2014), Hollywood's interest in depicting war shows no signs of slowing down. Spielberg's 1998 epic Saving Private Ryan fits in a long line of war epics attempting to depict the horrors of war in a realistic manner. SPR does this exceptionally wellfor the duration of roughly 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The film starts with an old man visiting the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family. He stops at a specific gravestone and collapses in tears. The camera focuses on his eyes and the film flashes back to D-Day with a depiction of the Omaha Beach landing that has to be seen to be believed. This prolonged sequence is the film's and Spielberg's crowning achievement. After the allied forces break through, the film cuts back to events on American soil. At the War Department of the United States it becomes apparent that three of four sons of the Ryan family have been killed. The mother is about to receive this tragic news in the form of three letters being sent simultaneously. A General has this brought to his attention and – remembering how Abraham Lincoln offered his heartfelt condolences to a mother in similar circumstances – orders his officers to find the remaining son (Matt Damon), who's somewhere in Normandy, and bring him home. Enter Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) who, having just survived the beach landing, is given the mission, gathers a small group of soldiers and – with some reservations about the importance of the mission when juxtaposed with the big picture – they all head further into Normandy in search of a single soldier.<br/><br/>The extensive Omaha Beach sequence is the single reason why anyone's still talking about this film. The amount of planning required for this scene must have been incredible and yet the entire scene still feels 'unplanned' and appropriately chaotic. It wouldn't be a stretch to name this sequence the reason the film's been showered with Academy Awards. Other aspects like acting and especially the cinematography and production design are also praiseworthy, but that's pretty much where it ends for me.<br/><br/>I find the rest of the film to be something of a mixed bag. It chronicles Miller and co's search for Private Ryan and all the hardships they endure along the way. The main problem I have with the rest of the film is that it feels contrived. The Omaha Beach sequence is at once the film's saving grace and the reason the rest of the film pales by comparison. Not that the rest of the film has nothing to offer dramatically, it does, but it all feels too calculated, too contrived and convenient as opposed to the radical and chaotic opening scene. For instance, you expect the soldiers to bond over the course of their journey before some of them die and how this is all supposed to elicit our sympathy. You see this coming long before it happens and it's thus not as impactful as it should be. And what about the oh-so dramatic pause right before the sniper in the tower is shot by a tank's cannon, designed so that we can symbolically say goodbye; Miller's clichéd reference to his wife gardening with his gloves (all that's missing are the images of white-picket fences); Ryan's two-minute monologue – supposed to elicit our sympathy – which comes across as incredibly awkward; the fact that Miller is shot by the same German whom he showed mercy to several scenes ago and that it's the bookish Upham (of all people) who 'earns his stripes' by conveniently killing him; old Ryan saluting Miller's grave while trumpets hum patriotically in the background; the fact that the filmmakers did the oh-so (for lack of a better word) 'American' thing by bookending the film with shots of the American flag softly lit by the afternoon sun, etc, etc. All these scenes and more reveal a script purposefully crafted to the point of dramatic perfectionand that's not a compliment. Why does the Omaha Beach sequence still amaze after all these years? Because it represents the horrors of war in purely visual terms. There is no dramatic logic, only chaos; bodies and limbs flying everywhere, soldiers whimpering and screaming. There are no allied soldiers and Nazis, just people trying to survive. The rest of the film with all its carefully calculated drama doesn't come within a country mile of effectively conveying the same sense of horror."

The D-Day landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever. It is unforgettable. The movie is bookended with heart stopping war action. The final battle is just as epic. The hand to hand fight with Private Mellish is devastating. The goal doesn't have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which Spielberg often likes to inject. The only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing."

","You may be thinking ""oh damn, just another over patriotic American being well...patriotic"" but no, that's not why I'm here.<br/><br/>CONCERNING 'OVER PATRIOTISM':<br/><br/>If you're not from America then yes I see where you're coming from if you say the movie is 'too American'. Well, it IS an American war movie, so expect patriotism. <br/><br/>As I go through the list of reviews for this movie, almost ALL of the reviews from people who say they're from the US, boast about how great they think the movie is. On the other hand, people from other countries (mainly European) boast that it's too American. For example, the movie starts with the waving American flag and ends with it. It also only shows American soldiers, totally excluding British and Canadian soldiers. Well, the story is about American soldiers looking for, well, an American soldier. So you can expect to see mainly US army men.<br/><br/>And yes I do also understand manly other Allied countries played important roles in WWII. Of course the US could not have fought this war alone. At the same time, you should allow the movie to be patriotic. Sorry if Europeans are offended but I have to say it: if it weren't for the United States, Europe would have had a much different fate. So in a sense, you could say that America saved Europe. <br/><br/>So please let it be patriotic. The US gave a lot for this war, even in a continent it wasn't in. Europe wasn't even where a majority of American soldiers fought and died. It was the Pacific, against Japan.<br/><br/>CONCERNING THE MOVIE ITSELF:<br/><br/>Well now that I've got that done, I may as well talk about the movie quality itself. Let me just tell you I thought it was great. The first moments on D-Day at Omaha Beach were gritty, realistic, and tense.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie wasn't as great, just soldiers looking for Ryan.<br/><br/>The ending I thought was good and very emotional. 8/10"

I read through the various 1- star reviews and I have to laugh at the inaccuracies in the reviews as they try to point out inaccuracies or cliché in the movie. I know it is hip and cool to think you are a film snob and all of that but let's get a few things straight.<br/><br/>One reviewer mentioned the Omaha Beach scene was unrealistic because at the rate the characters were getting killed, the 1st and 29 Divisions would have been wiped out and unable to continue the war. Well first of all the entire 1st and 29th didn't participate in the first wave, the 16 Regimental Combat Team of the 1st and the 116th RCT of the 29th did, and they were both combat ineffective after the first 10 minutes of the landing.<br/><br/>Other complaints mention the entire landing was depicted in 20 minutes when it took several hours to break out from the beach. Um, it is a movie you know? Not a real-time depiction.<br/><br/>The movie only shows Americans because Americans were the only soldiers landing at Omaha Beach. The British and Canadians were miles away. I never understand this criticism. The movie is an American movie about an American unit that landed on a beach assigned to Americans. Sorry we can't include every other nation in the Allies. This movie isn't about that. As far as I know, Americans made up the 2nd Rangers and 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>To those that complain the Germans were portrayed as bumbling idiots, the Germans made a lot of mistakes in Normandy. They failed to commit their armored reserves in time. They staffed the Atlantic Wall with inexperienced conscripts that were either older or younger than they should have been. Hitler wasn't even made aware of the invasion right away. Even after the breakout the Germans were still convinced the real invasion would be a Calais.<br/><br/>Another reviewer complained that the American army would have simply contacted Ryan's unit and ordered the CO to send him home. That would have been impossible for weeks as the Airborne were scattered all over Normandy with no real communication with each other, much less an organized chain of command. Mixed units roaming the countryside was the norm for several days after the landing.<br/><br/>Others complain that a squad-sized group could wander around occupied France without being discovered. How is that implausible? Remember the Airborne were mis-dropped all over the region. Small squads moving around undetected was the norm.<br/><br/>Radar wasn't a secret in WWII.<br/><br/>The P-51 did provide close air-support, even though calling it a ""tank buster"" is a stretch. The P-47 is more fitting for that role. But hey, they don't look as cool. Its a movie after all. But to the reviewer below that says P-51s were never used for ground support - you are completely wrong.<br/><br/>A lot of people claim the movie demonizes the Germans. I am not sure I see that. The Germans fight hard for their country. I don't see where in this film they do anything remotely ""evil"". They kill the Americans when they get the chance. Wasn't that their job? Weren't they defending their country? It doesn't even really mention Nazis at all. Can someone please point out how the movie shows the Germans as evil? The movie is from an American perspective. Of course the American soldiers are going to think the Germans are evil.<br/><br/>I also have to laugh at the people who say the dialog wasn't real because people didn't curse then. Right. Soldiers in WWII didn't say the ""f"" word. Um, OK.<br/><br/>Pick on the dialog all you want, but seriously most of you are reaching at straws. The movie is about as realistic as you can get and still remain a movie."

","According to many people, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films ever made. They are absolutely correct. This film won several Oscars and it deserved them.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a perfect example of a film that accurately captures the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The film opens with an impressive recreation of the battle on Omaha Beach. The scene wastes no time in showing us just how horrifying and chaotic the battle really was.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot focuses on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), a young paratrooper who landed somewhere behind enemy lines. He has three brothers who were all killed in action, and the military decides he should get sent home. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) is chosen to lead the search for the young private. <br/><br/>The film is simply brilliant. The acting's excellent,the story is well written, and it manages to brilliantly depict how horrifying and tragic war can be."
"kenjha","7","1","3","9 April 2010"," The Neverending Story
","There is probably an exciting 90-minute movie lurking inside this never ending war epic about the search for a soldier. However, in an attempt to make a war movie to end all war movies, Spielberg did not leave anything on the cutting room floor, releasing the film with a running time of 17 hours or so. The much-admired battle scene depicting the Normandy landing is well done but what's the point of having it go on for 20 minutes, with gratuitous shots of severed limbs and guts literally spilling out? OK, war is hell, but many other films have made this point far more eloquently and succinctly. The acting is pretty good, although the characters are all war movie stereotypes."
"gcd70","8","1","3","23 March 2010"," Powerfully Numbing
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is everything you expect it to be and more. I left the cinema totally numb after this experience, not knowing how I really felt about the movie. All I was thinking was why? Do we really need a another movie about the atrocities of war? Perhaps I just don't want to know the truth or see the reality of this horror that mankind seems determined to continually perpetuate. The heart of man is evil continually. Even more frightening than this is the fact that the powers of the world who have set their minds to war and murder to maintain control would not even think twice after viewing this film.<br/><br/>For Spielberg this film was evidently a lot more than just a revelation of World War II. This was a message from son to father, a call for approval from a boy to his dad. The fact that Arnold Spielberg was overcome with emotion may indicate that his boy did good this time. Steven is as masterfully in control of this film as he was with ""Schindler's List"". I still feel the earlier film is his dramatic best, yet it is difficult to fault ""Private Ryan"" in its execution. It is only its concept that I am still battling with.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays yet another all American, this time the captain who is ordered to take a small band of men to find Ryan. His performance was strong, yet I was not truly blown away as I expected to be. Perhaps I have come to expect too much of the great Mr. Hanks. The support cast are also intense, and include Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg and Barry Pepper. Special mention goes to Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Horvath, Jeremy Davies as the timid Corporal Upham and Matt Damon, credible as the last of the Ryan brothers. Ted Danson and Dennis Farina drop in as senior officers.<br/><br/>Spielberg has again teamed with ""Schindler's"" cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and the results are astounding. The opening sequence is particularly breathtaking. John Williams is of course the only choice for original score. In this impacting picture, I barely noticed his composition. That probably indicates how good it was. Art direction and set decoration are both awesome.<br/><br/>The enormity of the film cannot be denied, neither I suppose can its importance. With all my reservations, it is one of the first - if not the first - movies not to gloss over World War II. It is for this reason I must recommend all those who can handle it go and see it; and it is also why I find it so hard to mark this film down.<br/><br/>Sunday, December 13, 1998 - Bairnsdale Cinemas<br/><br/>There are two ways to look at ""Saving Private Ryan"". Technicallly and philosophically. Let me address both briefly.<br/><br/>Technically the film has few faults. Certainly, cinematography, sound effects and sets are all astounding. You cannot be anything but blown away by the opening sequence. Spielberg shows again he is a master craftsman, able to bring any vision from within his imagination to the silver screen. He takes this simple story of an unusual rescue mission in the middle of World War II, and turns it into an unforgettable movie experience. Tom Hanks is amazing as Captain Miller, playing with perfect understatement the weary commanding officer who must lead his band of eight men in search of Private Ryan. In impressive support is Tom Sizemore, fantastic as the tough sarge who backs Miller all the way. An excellent support cast back these two compellingly.<br/><br/>Philosophically, I have argued before that this film was brilliant yet unnecessary; that we have seen enough graphic anti-war films and that this was one too many. On second viewing, it is very hard to keep this argument up. Even if we have seen a dozen films such as this, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is still a very important film. Why? It shows us the horror that war is. The waste, the destruction and the total futility of the whole thing. Why do we keep destroying each other like this? What is wrong with us? I still argue that ""Schindler's List"" was a more important film, and perhaps a better one. This film rates right up there though.<br/><br/>Saturday, January 8, 2000 - Video"
"amraampk","10","1","3","17 March 2010"," just only for saving private Ryan
","With its cast , story , visual effects , production and direction saving private Ryan is an excellent experience to watch. The film starts in present United States than enters in its main plot of 1944 France at the occasion of d-day. Here Tom hanks along with his juniors including Tom Sizemore, Edward burns, Berry Pepper , Vin Diesel , and Giovnanni Ribsi are assigned to a task seek out Pfc James Francis Ryan and relieve him off the duty to send him home. The reason here is that he is only surviving son of widow who already lost her older sons in this war. As a gesture of humanity and sympathy , Chief of Army staff General George.C.Marshall himself ordered the search and transfer of private Ryan back to homeland. When Tom Hanks and his fellow comrades begin their search for their objective they had to go through hell on some places , in it they lost some of their own few men. The most compelling scene was the death of Giovanni Ribsi , the way he acted in that scene was so much disturbing but also showed his remarkable skill to portray the dying man. After a hectic long tense journey into the heart of France they spotted Pfc Ryan played here by Matt Damon ,told him the gruesome news of his bros death, but he refuses to leave , he believes that his fellow officers are also sons of other people ,they are also his brothers in arms, why he is only one to be left out of here. Then the team decided to stay but inside Capt Miller (Tom Hanks) had made a pledge not to let Pfc Ryan(Damon) to be harmed and left alone in harms way. Being a war movie lover i am very impressed by this film, if you are , you ll also be moved , its 3 hr long but very very good in the making and contains a strong plot. One of the best war movie of all time perhaps that 's why it finished with 5 Oscars although Thin Red Line was also competing against it with a huge inventory of cast & crew."

"sddavis63","7","1","3","4 December 2009"," Great Battle Scenes And A Thought Provoking Consideration Of The Value Of A Human Life
","Surely this movie presents some of the most believable, most graphic and most gruesome scenes of war ever shown on film. The opening depiction of the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day and the closing battle as American soldiers desperately try to hold a strategically key bridge against a German attack are brilliantly and soberingly portrayed, and if there was nothing else in this movie worth watching, those battle scenes in and of themselves are a powerful lesson about the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The battle scenes serve as an envelope around the main story - the search for Private James Ryan. As the movie begins we learn that Ryan's three brothers have all been killed in battle, and he's the only one of his mother's sons left. Gen. George Marshall (quoting from an eloquent letter written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who lost 5 sons in the Civil War) orders Ryan found so that he could be returned home before being killed himself, and a squad under Capt. Mitchell (Tom Hanks) is assigned to the task. Believability is a bit of an issue here. I doubt that in the middle of a great war soldiers would be taken away from battle and assigned to this task. Having said that, the very lack of believability gives the search for Ryan it's meaning, and serves as the movie's moral or philosophical purpose. The constant question before the viewer is: how many lives are we willing to sacrifice to save one? There's no answer to that question, but it remains front and centre as even the soldiers assigned to find Ryan increasingly resent the assignment and question its value. The constant challenge I found myself faced with was how I would have felt if I were assigned to find a soldier in such circumstances so that he could be sent home while I stayed to fight a war - and possibly die? Thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Still, I didn't think this reached the heights of greatness that some have given it. Thought-provoking it may have been, but between the great battle scenes there were also long stretches with little happening, and overall the movie was too long at more than an hour and a half. It's a movie that's certainly worth watching - but only once. I wouldn't want to see it again. 7/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","3","17 November 2009"," an utterly commendable and harrowing portrait of the nature of war and one of the most important films of the 20th century
","From the opening notes of John Williams' somber and tear-jerking music score, followed by an old man wandering sadly through a World War II cemetery, and then to the deservedly infamous twenty-minute recreation of the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, and straight through to the end of the picture, it's adamantly clear that Steven Spielberg's epic masterpiece ""Saving Private Ryan"" is not just another war film on the shelves in the history of cinema. Coupled with Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"", this is perhaps the single greatest cinematic take on the nature of war ever made.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, ""Saving Private Ryan"" stars Tom Hanks as a World War II squad captain who is given the treacherous assignment to take seven other soldiers and go behind enemy lines in search of a missing paratrooper named Ryan whose brothers have been killed in action. And as noble as a mission as that sounds, the reaction from the soldiers is exactly what it would be in real life: we'll obey our orders, but is one man worth risking the lives of eight? That's the spirit of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and that's the spirit of war itself. Gone are the days where war was portrayed as like some kind of an end-of-season tournament and when soldiers were portrayed as being like a rowdy and pretentious baseball team on their great skirmish. Instead of glamorizing violence and giving us all-American heroes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" depicts war as what it is: a harrowing, traumatizing, unforgettably bad, soul-corrupting experience. The effect war and violence has on people is personified perfectly in a line given by Hanks about halfway through the film: ""For every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel."" The movie opens up with a twenty-minute battle sequence of which the likes have never been on the screen. We don't just see people being shot to death, we see explosions that send mutilated bodies flinging through the air, we see soldiers lying on the ground mortally wounded, spending their last breaths crying for their mothers and wanting to go home, and the Atlantic shoreline becomes red with blood. There is nothing glamorous or exciting about a scene like this. Rather, the reaction the audience gives is hung jaws, wide eyes, and a new appreciation for what our soldiers did in the call of duty and how lucky any of them were to live to see home again.<br/><br/>Another strength of the movie is that it does not only depict war as being horrifying, but it also makes neither heroes out of its protagonists or personifications of evil out of the enemy. As I mentioned earlier, the soldiers led by Tom Hanks are not cheerful, joke-throwing boys. They are cynical, rundown, exhausted, and pessimistic who spend a great deal of their time not charging out into enemy fire and dying in the blaze of glory, but cowering behind rubble. And that's the exact same of the German soldiers portrayed in the film. After all, they were drafted into a war as well. If it were not for the war, these men killing each other may have otherwise been best friends. In a way, the movie is not about the mission to rescue Private Ryan who is neither seen nor heard until well into the movie's running time, but about the very experience of trying to survive just one day through a war.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is not only a technical triumph, but an intellectual one as well. Apart from showing us what war is really like and the effect it really has one people and nations, the movie creates three-dimensional human beings out of its characters, the story is very well-constructed, the dialogue by screenwriter Robert Rodat is first-class, and the acting, of course, top-notch. The combination of these elements gives us a representation of war that we can believe. Now when people think of war, they think of men lying on the ground dying and not grinning heroes dodging bullets as if life or death is merely a video game and they can try again if they fail the first time.<br/><br/>This is one of Steven Spielberg's very best films. It ranks up with films such as ""Jaws"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", and ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial"" as some of the greatest and most important films ever made. Now ""Saving Private Ryan"" may be too gritty and vulgar for the tastes of some people, but I think it should be required viewing for anybody going into the service or even thinking of the like. Because war is not a baseball game. And it's not something anybody wants to experience more than once, if at all."
"screenman","9","1","3","27 May 2009"," Welcome To Hell
","I have never understood Hollywood's love affair with Tom Hanks. He's no more than ordinary both in appearance and as an actor. Perhaps that's what they like; the stamp of the common man. Well for me, he's a turn-off. Him, Costner and Cage; I can't help taking points away when any of 'em show up.<br/><br/>All that said; this movie opens pretty quickly into the most spellbindingly visceral battle sequence ever shown on film. It really is a tour-de-force. The withering German machine-gun fire wiping out man after man before they've even set foot ashore is terrible and shocking to behold. Truly those weapons made flesh all but obsolete in battle. I am not a Spielberg fan either. His delight in maudlin sentimentality - or 'schamltz' as it's called - knows no boundaries. Neither does his childish irony. But when it comes to large set-piece special effects, he has no master. The few minutes of beach landing are alone worth the price of the DVD. It's as close as you can get to the real thing and still leave the cinema alive. I'm told that a group of vets got to see this movie at a private showing and gave this sequence a standing ovation. You can't say fairer than that.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the story moves on, with Hanks and his remaining squad looking to find Private Ryan, who is the only surviving son in a family stricken by war. And here Mr Spielberg falls into his usual routine of hokey irony. There's a suddenly collapsing wall that reveals Germans on the other side. There's a German humanely allowed by Hanks to simply wander free, only to re-emerge as his assassin, there's a case of mistaken identity that's milked for every silly little nuance imaginable. And there's a lot more. Like I said; it's often childish.<br/><br/>There are other interesting and engaging conflicts, though they pale in comparison with that full-on intro. There are excellent set-pieces, authentic gunfire, and believable slaughter. Editing, lighting and all of the other technical issues are right up to the standard you expect from Big Stevie. Yet most of the second 2 hours fail to answer that hellishly vivid beach landing. It's a measure of how strong the one is, and how weak the other. We are left with a slow, flagging, and largely forgettable odyssey.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for that opening assault. That's where my 9 stars have gone. The rest is simply in at the price, with Spielberg's juvenility and Hanks's irritating voice for good measure.<br/><br/>I would like to see a movie about WW1 treated with the same ruthless candour. The casualties of Omaha and The Somme scarcely withstand comparison."
"jovidude24","10","1","3","21 April 2009"," Best Movie I've ever Seen
","Never in my life have I ever seen a more beautifully written film. I've watched this film 20 times over and it still touches my heart. I always look for violence in a movie, because I believe it shows reality and this movie does just that with it's gut wrenching brutality. I tell people who haven't seen that they need to watch it A.S.A.P. Not just because of the violence, I'm not like that, but by the completely accurate point of view of the soldiers during and even after the war.<br/><br/>I am one of those people that is impossible to make cry, and folks this movie made me bawl my eyes out. The ending Tom Hanks scene is so stunning and heart-wrenchingly sad that I couldn't bear it, yet I still watched the ending. That scene is also surprising considering that the beginning threw me of guard with the old man in the opening scene, I thought he was Tom Hanks. (Sorry for the spoilers) Also, Giovanni Ribisi must be credited for his character's emotional role especially in the church seen when he talks about his mother.<br/><br/>Now to the violence, people I was 13 when I saw this film. Do your self a favor if you are a parent, if your child is under 13 do not let them watch it. There are even worse violent movies such as ""The Thing."" But the difference in this movie is that what happens to the soldiers more than likely really happened to them, mostly the beginning on Omaha Beach. I, personally, think the violence was completely necessary because we needed to show what our soldiers fought for and what they gave in order for us to live on as the ruling country of the world. God-bless America and it's men.<br/><br/>The language in the film is quite foul, but hey what would you be saying if you were being shot at by 20-cals? I also think the swears were necessary. Why? Well, I believe that swears bring out emotion and how you feel about situations you are in. I mean don't get me wrong if your child swears, by all means put soap in his mouth or whatever you do. But in movies, swears give us an understanding about the stand-point of the characters. It's also pretty funny to boot. The jokes in this are hilarious.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you are looking for the greatest movie ever made, watch this. Because I don't think I'll ever find a movie close to being as good as this. Thanks to Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and thanks mostly to those who gave their lives to keep us standing strong with the freedom we have rightfully earned. You will not be forgotten, ever."

"doctorwaffle","9","1","3","17 March 2009"," One of the Best WWII Movies
","Simply put, this is a flawless war movie. Spielberg created a set that looks like the actual French battlefield of World War II. The beginning of the movie shows the Allied invasion of Normandy Beach on D-Day, and it is very hard to watch. Men die and are reduced to gory heaps in the first seconds of battle. People who are expecting a Chuck Norris war movie with a few US soldiers killing hundreds of comical Nazis are going to be surprised. The film has a fantastic ensemble cast - up there with films such as Heat and Tombstone. All supporting actors are given believable characters. No one appears to utter a one-liner and is never seen again. Movie buffs will find themselves saying, ""Hey, I know that guy!"", but it never detracts from the immersion. This is a heavily pro-American film. It makes little effort to characterize the German soldiers, but none is needed. Overall, this is my favorite film from 1998, and one of my favorite war movies."
"jamietit1994","5","1","3","11 November 2008"," Very overrated
","Visually this film was brilliant, especially the first scenes on D-day. It was probably the most graphic and visually impressive war movie I've seen, but a great war movie isn't made by how good (or in a way not so good) it looks. The acting in this film was pretty mediocre and i was only interested when people were shooting each other! The script was terrible with cheesy characters and back stories that really wasn't very interesting. The plot was poor as well it may have been based on a true mission in world war 2, but it wasn't as good as it could've been if they had just simply based it on a famous battle in Normandy. This could've of been a brilliant film but it fell on some very important hurdles."
"Craig87-1","6","1","3","1 October 2008"," A Spectacular Movie
","Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man. The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles."" Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two. If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie."
"theodoremartin","6","1","3","27 September 2008"," A Moving and Riveting Film
","""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg. Vin Diesel). The film opens with the harrowing D-Day landings, following Captain Miller and his men. The unit is given the mission of finding and getting Private James Ryan out of the war. His 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make. A lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him. There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war. However, a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over. One is a conversation in which Miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally. The movie does not glorify war, but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality. Though there a more violent films out there, such as We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition), ""Saving Private Ryan"" definitely does not gloss over anything. This is a profoundly moving movie, and one that I have seen more than once. Every viewing is moving. It is simply a great story, well-acted, well-directed and engrossing."
"stephanielynn_87","10","1","3","30 June 2008"," Outstanding scenes
","In every aspect of this film, from the writing by Robert Rodat to the production of every scene, there is mastery. Saving Private Ryan has multiple WWII scenes that although not all historically correct, all outstanding. I watched this movie with my fiancÃ© and we both were extremely impressed with the whole movie. The opening 27 min. Omaha Beach scene proved well awarded the best opening scene as well as the whole movie with the 5 Oscars, 50 something other awards won and another 50 something nominations for various awards. The story line of a mission to save a fellow comrade is one that hits so close to home for many families these days and it really gives them hope that if there loved one is still over in Iraq, they might too be saved. From the actors like Tom Hanks and sexy Matt Damon, to the small details in every scene (or big like the 40,000 gallons of fake blood for the opening scene), it was just a mind blowing movie that really makes you appreciate everyone fighting for our freedom."
"I_Love_Spielberg","10","1","3","21 May 2008"," Hard to watch, yet so true.
","Steven Spielberg goes back to WWII with this film, which is about a group of soldiers who risk their lives in action to save one: Private James Francis Ryan. The scenery in the invasion sequences are so horrific, that it's shocking to think that this stuff actually happens. Which it does. I couldn't watch it without flinching, crying, and being afraid of things like that.<br/><br/>I pray that there won't be a WWIII, because all war is hell. I don't even support the war in Iraq. I want our troops out of there. They don't deserve to have their insides blown out, regardless of what the war is about. It's also why I don't play war video games. I don't think that war is a thing to be glorified in games. I think that it's a horrible thing that should have never existed.<br/><br/>So, to finish, I would like to thank Steven Spielberg for opening my eyes to war and how war should not be glorified, it should be looked down upon."

","My grandpa actually landed on Normandy and told me all about it. He landed on Fox Red sector. He told me the true face of war until I literally saw it flash before my eyes. The opening D-Day scene is horrific but detailed in a great manner of graphic violence and gore. Unless you are not one of them (as I can) who can handle such strong intensity, this movie is not for you. It is a great movie and shows that there is nothing that should be glorified about war. Saving Private Ryan shows how 8 men will risk their lives for 1 after Private James Ryans brothers, Peter, Sean, and Daniel have been killed in action and Captain John H. Miller from the 2nd Rangers battalion and his squad is sent to find James and send him home before he is KIA along with the rest of his brothers. I give it a 10 out of 10 for a great story line and it even loosely is based on the true story of the Niland Brothers. It has won over 5 academy awards and on over 150 10 best lists. This movie is great for a WWII movie collection."

","This is by far best WWII movie i have ever seen and in general on of the best movies. It is thrilling emotional funny and shows all the folly and tragedy of war. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie there are scenes of intense realistic combat. This movie is truly a work of art. Everything about it is real. The bloodshed, the style of guns, the talk,the gore, absolutely everything. Except for the storyline, which i won't go into, everything about this movie is 100% realistic and accurate. Not once in the movie did I say to myself ""that wouldn't happen in real life."" The action scenes are incredible. You'll see classic WWII weapons being used like the BAR, M1 Garand, classic bayonets etc. The violence is so real and that often you will wonder whether or not the actors are actually dead. This movie shows all forms of combat. Guns, flamethrowers, sniping, tanks, planes, and of course several sequences of up close and personal/bloody.<br/><br/>The scenery may very well be the best in annyyy movie I've seen, not just war movies. While watching I was shocked to think how much time was devoted to this. Crumbling buildings, destroyed tanks, dead cows, cratered land; everything. Every step of the movie you will be thinking that they went back in time to those areas, because it will be so hard to believe that most of it was filmed in a studio.<br/><br/>This movie won a deserving Oscar for cinematography, and for good reason. I can only surmise how many camera's were used in making this film. Because of professional cinematography, the action doubles. Everything is done so well. Explosions are shown from several angles at such a fast pace that you'll once again think that this must actually be happening.<br/><br/>The acting is great in this movie. Most of the soldiers act like typical grunts who enjoy seeing a German killed, while show true sympathy and sorrow if/when any of their comrades die or during a breakdown when all the fighting gets to them.<br/><br/>To cut this review short, because there are about a dozen other topics to touch upon this incredible movie, this is a true classic, great drama, terrific directing and keeps you involved and not bored during this 2hour and 35 minute movie."

If only I got to see it with surround sound and HD, I watched it at home on my bad television, but I want to let everybody know the special effects in this movie surpass many movies from present day. Sound is top notch, acting is brilliant, the camaraderie seen between the men makes it seem like a real battle field. Everything about this movie is so real. It's as if you were on the battlefield yourself. <br/><br/>This movie is not like any other war movie where the story starts off with the troop at home, then getting deployed, then mindless scenes of battle followed by a predictable finish.<br/><br/>This movie started powerful to the deployment of the troops on Omaha Beach all the way to the end. This movie had great action, internal conflicts, a plot to find Private Ryan, a story going on back in the United States. Everything connects in this great piece. This movie is just breathtaking. I keep repeating it, but when the movie was over, I was sad it was over, and I would definitely see it ten more times to witness the sheer brilliance of Steven Spielberg and everybody else who contributed to this movie."

","Saving Private Ryan is not just the best war film ever put to movie screens. It is also one of the best movies of all time. The movie begins with an almost documentary type invasion of Normandy on D-Day. This is so realistic and so well done, you would almost think Spielberg and company had a time machine and filmed it the day it happen. The action is so intense and so amazing, you would think the movie would falter after this. But then again, it doesn't. This movie real story is about Captain John Miller leading a platoon of men to go save Private Ryan. He must save Private Ryan, because he is the only remaining son of a woman stateside. This seems ironic, because all these men must risk their lives for one mother's only living son. And as the squad is led through some dangerous turf, they don't know how much they will have to eventually risk to save one man. A wonderful told epic that just shows how much one life can really be worth."

","I guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us, it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film. The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing! Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell-shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service. That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan. His other brothers having all recently perished in combat, leaving him the only remaining son.<br/><br/>The movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan. You go through the movie hoping that Hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shot.<br/><br/>What made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story!

"preposterous","9","1","3","30 January 2005"," excellent war film with occasionally poor dialogue
","In terms of verisimilitude to an actual battlefield, Saving Private Ryan is without a peer in the history of film. I go back to the 1910s, Birth of a Nation, which had some panoramic battle scenes, and to Platoon, which had some credible scenes, to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now (which is the closest challenger for realism), Black Hawk Down, The Big Parade (wonderfully realistic early silent film of WW One), and many others. None of those takes so much effort and genius in recreating a probable past, in terms of recreating the war torn battlefields/villages in the most minute detail. The first 20 minutes of this film are a landmark by which all other war films will eventually be measured.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the emotional anchor for this film, giving us a portrayal that is sensitive yet firm. He's not of the blood and guts John Wayne tradition. His character is a thoughtful man who finds himself in a position to, in his view, do some good in the world by managing this apocalypse on earth in such a way that it actually saves lives.<br/><br/>Spielberg's consistent attention to visual detail and style is what sets SPR apart. The images are grainy, and rely on blues, greens, grays, and browns, with scarcely any red or yellow. He creates battlefield scenery with precision, accuracy, and depth of field. Wonderful work.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, set against this, is a dialogue which can be passively entertaining at times. The urgent conversations in the battlefield are most effective. However, some of the more heavy conversations which take place during the lulls are so poorly thought out, I can scarcely believe any professional screenwriter could have been associated with them. This is a recurrent problem.<br/><br/>Finally, I guess it couldn't be avoided that a film like this would attempt to advance allied propaganda. Genreally, the film tries to stay away from that, and I give it credit, but at other times the propaganda asserts itself in a subtle way which detracts from the overall effect. Most Americans and Western Europeans are numb to this, but I notice it and it disappoints me, although I will reckon that this film does not lose itself in propaganda. It's just an overtone."

The combat scenes are the best i have seen in any World War II movie, especially the amazing opening scene on the beaches of Normandy. They are full of exciting and grisly action and speed along the three-hour runtime. Ryan is also packed with a great cast who all give excellent performances especially Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Jeremy Davies. Heck, even Vin Diesel was good. Yes i said Vin Diesel. Maybe he just gets bad scripts lately.<br/><br/>The only things keeping this from being the best war movie ever is it's sappy storyline and one-sidedness. Nobody is saying the Nazis are saints, but their foot soldiers were there for the exact same reasons the American foot soldiers were. Their stupid leaders sent them there.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is still one of the best war movies of all time.

This film had no proper storyline and plot, as it was a load of Hollywood Hype that tried to come across as deep and dramatic, but in actual fact, was shallow and disappointing. What was the point of all those soldiers dying in Combat, only to find/save one soldier, and that when they found him, he didn't want to come back home with them. Yes, this film had its dramatic scenes, like at the beginning of the film when old Private Ryan was crying at his friends gravestone, but even the way that scene was portrayed, I found it was corny and melodramatic.

"sadpanic","Null","1","3","21 January 2004"," Ryan is a cheap play for easy money
","Since I spent three years of my life doing military service during the Vietnam period, I'm not going to excuse myself for criticizing Saving Private Ryan for being cheap mystification in the pursuit of easy money: (1)pulling cash from the pockets of persons from generation of the War nearing the end of their lives in a world they don't identify with very easily and a long way away from their early memories, or (2) doping the younger generations with the illusion that one can passively flip around in time and space, or onto the Normandy beaches, like a minor god by way of images and popcorn for under $10.  But, where's the beef, it feels good?: don't read any further if that's what comes to mind.<br/><br/>The generations born after 1945 need to start thinking themselves past World War II into the world where they actually live, and stop trying to zap through virtual reality (with $ magic) to a sweet past of handsome heroes who woo virgins at soda-shop counters.  The film `The Longest Day' was the war generation imagining what they had lived, for better or for worse, but there was actual experience linked to what was put up in the images. Ironically enough, the screen heroes_ people like Ronald Reagan _ did their war in Hollywood where the only real danger was perhaps falling off a bar stool.  The war generation itself however was capable of a more critical look at their own times: for example Norman Mailer's, `The Naked and the Dead', or Joseph Heller's `Catch 22', or Leon Uris's `Battle Cry', or Irwin Shaw's `The Young Lions', to name some of the most widely read (and seen) material.  In comparison, `Saving Private Ryan' is a big step backward because it feeds completely upon a too apparent Manichaean conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil for a mostly postwar born audience who's closest contact with the War was in an Army Surplus store, or in family stories, second or third hand.  In short, Saving Private Ryan doesn't make the world around us any clearer, it feeds on our worst fears and illusions.  It would be helpful to know what experience of war, say during the Vietnam War period, Steven Spielberg depended upon to empathize with a soldier facing actual battle.<br/><br/>I admit that, as a soldier, I didn't face real battle myself, but I did go through some very tough military training and I had a near fatal accident working as professional deep-sea diver.  Thinking of people I know who did face battle, from my father's generation (including my father) and of people I knew who fought in Vietnam, I think it is only respectful to say that it's simply not possible to imagine your way into what a soldier goes through in battle, as regards the raw fear at the threat to one's survival, or the controlled madness one feels toward an enemy.  Most soldiers I know who fought have told me that going into battle they experienced themselves as another personality who listens to nothing else, sees nothing else except what could matter for survival.  They were surprised to find such a self inside their own skins.<br/><br/>Primitive brain memories we confront when our survival is in question are short lived, happily enough, and well trained soldiers are taught when and when not to allow themselves to slip into this instinctive set of gears which are the ones we normally learn to repress in order to live in society. Some men are haunted for the rest of their lives with horrible dreams or memories they never manage to put behind them.  Most war tried soldiers return to civilian life and reintegrate society without apparent difficulties, but what is most striking about such men I find (including my father) is that they usually refuse to talk about themselves in actual battle situations, and I think it's because they have made a deal with themselves, for their own mental health, to keep to themselves experiences that are so subjective and buried in their nerves that they cannot be transmitted in words to anyone who has not experienced a similar `heart of darkness.'  Likewise, real soldiers in battle know too that, should they die, it will very probably be alone and hours before anyone even notices, and that there will be no long camera shots zooming in over the violin music to pick up their immortal last gasping words.<br/><br/>To Saving Private Ryan viewers who marveled at the Omaha Beach landing scenes at the beginning of the film, they've been robbed if they really think they can get up that sandy ramp in a padded seat in a darkened movie theater.   To get some realism into the experience, people would need to stay awake for three or four days in a rolling ship smelling fear and vomit, have their minds wiped clear about how the story ends, experience the awful smell of black powder mixed with perspiration, have no idea where they're really going, or what's awaiting them and, last but not least, experience what hellish noise bombs, and shells and machine guns really make as cold seawater runs into their boots.  There are certainly some important films yet to make about World War II for us who were born after, films about a postwar world that's not a pure catastrophe for example, but Saving Private Ryan just isn't one of them.  However, Mr. Spielberg may have some very deep personal experience with soldiering we need to hear more about.  I'm all ears."

","There must be a certain element, a certain unspoken magic when a particular film gets heaped with such a volume of praise and emotion from its teary eyed and awe-struck audiences. Saving private ryan has, over the years, been one of those films. The peculiar thing is that it doesn't deserve much praise or much of an investment of emotion.<br/><br/>Yes the famous omaha beach sequence is impressive. Limbs are blown off, and men hold in their innards while crying for their mothers, etc. Guess what kiddies, has war ever suggested to be otherwise? Is this one scene enough to pass off the rest of the 2 and a half hours of the film? The answer is no. Just because one scene is technically brilliant, does not mean that somehow the entire film has justifiably earned the right to be called one of the greatest war films of all time. But again and again, whenever i hear this film being discussed, the only scene that comes up is the first 25 minute invasion sequence.<br/><br/>The rest of this film was personally to me, a total wasted opportunity. For one thing, how was it possible for hanks and his 1950's ww2 cliched troupe, to casually stroll through a french field? This early into d-day,  the bocage areas around france were still full of threatening german units, long from being reduced. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>The biggest failure of this film was, predictably, its childish portrayal of german troops. Again and again, i cringed at how pathetically inept they acted. That last battle scene was something straight out of a sgt. rock comic. Wave after wave of germans just run into fire, not taking defensive positions until about 2/3 of them are lying dead in the normandy sun. Somehow hanks and his buddies always seemingly dance their way out of oncoming bullets. The machine gunner in the tiger was seemingly to high on hashish to fire at the americans. There is also no way in hell a sticky bomb would take the treads off of a tiger. And why the hell did all the german troops have shaved heads??? Not from the photos i've seen.<br/><br/>But i did love the moral message of the film, and perhaps this is why the american public who loved this film so willingly gave spielberg their hearts. It doesn't matter that this film consisted of a script so simplistic, that it could have been written by a high school sophomore working on a ww2 final essay. Makes no difference. The message we all wanna hear is, America is good, everyone else is bad. We don't do bad things, noooo sirry. We only get into wars to stop tyranny.

The scene with the collapsing wall and the German soldiers with the ensuing Mexican stand off is nail biting. Similarly, the final battle sequence is deftly choreographed. Some fine character scenes linger in the mind, as when the soldiers listen to Edith Piaf while waiting for the Germans. However, if this is war as Hell/absurd/confusing it is also war as boys own adventure. Where are the politics? Historical context? Are we really expected to believe that in a huge theatre of war a group of soldiers would be allowed to wander around in search of one man? Compare Ryan to The Thin Red Line. You want to consider what Malick might have to say about war with his use of rich images that linger in the mind long after the end of the film. With Spielberg I was left largely with the memory of the opening and closing scenes."

","I must admit, the first twenty minutes, (discounting the first scene in the cemetary), were mindblowing.  The handheld visuals gave a sense of realism, and was true, honest filmaking. Spielberg should have stopped there. After the Normandy scene, we are introduced to the characters that will guide the audience on its long trip to nowhere.  I hesitate to call them characters, as they are cardboard cutouts designed to fool the audience into believing there was any depth to them.  They didn't fool me.  They are a bunch of stereotypes, thrown together in a group, and sent on a quest. Unfortunately, Robert Rodat lacked the storytelling skills to make the film anything more than a failure with astounding visuals.<br/><br/>It seemed as though he threw random scenes together and decided to call it a script. I've heard this film be referred to, interestingly enough, as both a pro-war film, and an anti-war film.  The reason there is such confusion, is because neither Robert Rodat, nor Steven Spielberg could make up their minds.  The first twenty minutes seem to say one thing, where as the last twenty say another.  In between, everything is just drivel. Because of the conflict in ideas, (and for numerous other reasons), the film lacked focus.  It had no sense of itself, and was not well-realized at all. It was put in all directions and no directions at once<br/><br/>>Saving Private Ryan, apart from being a failure, was also an insult to my intelligence.  It was so sugar-coated, it made me sick.  A movie like this should go down hard, and leave a bitter taste in your mouth afterwards. However, Spielberg, for some reason, felt the need to apologize for the film's graphic depictments of battle with an ending that tried to hard to explain itself.  Spielberg may as well have run up in front of the screen at the end of the movie, and said, ""In case you didn't understand the other two-and-a-half hours of this film, allow to me to explain what just happened..."""

"Sadies","4","1","3","1 October 1999"," A good Hollywood movie; but not such a great War movie
","The first half hour of this movie blew me away.  I couldn't comprehend how a movie could put so much realism.<br/><br/>It wasn't until the conflict of ""Saving Private Ryan"" that I became a little disappointed; because at this point, we move out of Europe to a little town called Tinstletown.<br/><br/>
The problem I have with this movie is that people accept this movie as a documentation.  Is this a true war story?  I think its more of a true patriotic idealistic propaganda.  So here's the lay out: hundred and thousands of men go to war to ""save their country;"" this part is good.  Yet out of a midst of war, would the government really save a soldier for the spite of the mother?  3 of her sons die; but it's supposed to be ok because they ""laid their lives down for their country (at least this is supposed to be the theme of the movie).""  So what's wrong with the forth son; he's doing the same.  It contradicts the theme.  Secondly, what about every other soldier; they all have mothers, families, & pregnant wives, too.  It just doesn't happen that way.  Thirdly, one woman wouldn't recognize that 3 brothers died out of thousands of deaths she's writing up; and she wouldn't ask a man to save the 4th son with him executing it.  ""Ryan"" welcome to Hollywood.<br/><br/>The movie as a movie is good.  It is excellent.  But its nothing more or nothing truer than what actually did happen to these soldiers in war.  I've noticed many people I've discussed this movie to, take this movie so literally that it makes me agitated.  Sometimes the only way we like to deal with war is to believe some of the things we see; that it was good to save Ryan by killing the enemy, that war means so much patriotism.  But this is just one aspect; it isn't the embodiment of war.  There are too many other things that war has to tell.  (Oliver Stone made a trilogy based on 3 different sides/aspects about war).<br/><br/>I know some men who fought in war.  They watched the movie shocked by the first half hour, they were literally sweating.  The next moment they were thinking and remembering their time in war.  They all thought the storyline was a bit dreamy.  And the response I got was this: ""I don't recall anyone who was like Tom Hanks.  We were all Matt Damon's, who didn't know between right from wrong.""<br/><br/>I mean at the end of the movie when old Private Ryan goes ""was it worth it?"" The camera starts showing his loving wife, his children and grand children (by the way . . . what was up with the big chested triplets?) and of course the audience is going to be all teary eyed ""yes it was worth it.""  Come on 10 other individuals could have been alive if it weren't for him, but I forgot, we need patriotism in these movies. I'd suggest anyone to read books on war, by people who've been there, like Tim O'Brien, because those books actually make you think.<br/><br/>
As a Hollywood movie, I give this movie 9/10; But as a true war movie, I give this 6/10; the first half hour ""10/10"""
"Dr. Don-2","3","1","3","26 September 1999"," More Spielberg melodrama. Yawn.
","Sorry, but I don't like being manipulated and constantly being told what to feel, and Spielberg ALWAYS does this in his ""serious"" films.  He should stick to light-hearted adventure stories, at which he is very good.<br/><br/>The opening and closing cemetery scenes were heavy-handed.  The subject matter doesn't need flag-waving, Steven, we get the point without you rubbing our faces in it.<br/><br/>The opening battle scene is very well done, except it's voyeuristic and even pornographic.  I saw the reaction of the kids in the front row and they were getting off on the blood and gore, just like in a video game.  I think Malick's filming of the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line was much more effective -- it puts you in the midst of the grass, fire, smoke, concussive explosions and total chaos and is quite unnerving.  Should've gotten the Best Cinematography Oscar.<br/><br/>I cringed at Hanks' line ""Earn this"".  Again, Spielberg seems to think we can't get such insights on our own without them being crammed down our throats.  It's insulting.  To have Hanks speak that line implies an insult to Damon's character, too.<br/><br/>The line,""Tell me I was a good man"" is just awful script-writing. Groan.<br/><br/>Let's see, how can I put this without giving away the plot and therefore having this review banned?  Okay, I thought it was really sophomoric to have the German POW that ""X"" (a main American character who shall remain unnamed) turned loose be the one to kill ""X"" in the end -- the odds against such a turn of events actually happening were quite overwhelming.  To put that in the script was an ""in your face"" attempt at irony, right out of a bad film school project.<br/><br/>I was mostly disappointed with what could have been a fine film if the director had not done what he always does -- practice overkill and leave nothing to the imagination, underestimating his audience, and propagandizing.<br/><br/>I also think it's offensive to make a ""Good Yanks, Bad Krauts"" film.  My uncles who fought against the German army knew better.  This war, contrary to those who want to rewrite history to make it pretty, was about property, not saving the Jews nor stopping fascism (except when fascism threatened other people's property).  Nazism was tolerated and even approved of in Britain, France and the U. S. before Hitler invaded France, and Britain and the U. S. turned away Jewish refugees from Hitlerism even after the start of the war.  The Americans didn't enter the war to stop Hitler, they made huge profits from it till 1941, and only entered it when the Japanese made it impossible for them to stay out of it.  This film's ideology pretends otherwise.<br/><br/>Malick's film is much more accurate and, therefore, much less popular. Based faithfully on the novel by James Jones (who fought in Guadalcanal), it doesn't use war as a way to make people feel good, it tells the truth about war and those who fight in it, not disparagingly but realistically.  I care about its characters, because they are believable, not caricatures like those in Private Ryan.  The Thin Red Line is all the more uplifting because of its realism, and more enduring.<br/><br/>For those, by the way, who keep writing that we who prefer The Thin Red Line are ""pseudo-intellectual"", I think they really mean that they themselves are anti-intellectual, a popular stance in the U.

","Spielberg's WW2 epic has often been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made, but unfortunately an awful script hampered the brilliant performances, superb direction and the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed. A scripted was riddled with clichés and American jingoism from the start that completely marred the film and did not move me at all. It was also the most blatant attempt at Oscar begging in the history of cinema, so much so that it would have been far subtler for the entire cast and crew to spend the entire running time on their knees and plead with the Academy to give them the awards! Hank's ""I don't know anything about Ryan speech"" had Best Actor Nomination Clip written all over it. Damon's ""I'm trying to picture my brothers"" talk was his bid to make up for last year's disappointment for ""Good Will Hunting"". The jerky photography, which was little, more than a strain on the eyes, wrapped up Best Cinematography Oscar. The fact that the film lost out on the big night to ""Shakespeare in Love"" (itself ludicrously over awarded) gave Speilberg his comeuppance. The characters to were stereotyped and cardboard and spoke utterly contrived dialogue. There's ALWAYS a religious one, Jew, an Italian, and a New Yorker, a tough sergeant and a rookie. Even Hanks (who really should think of going back to comedy films) played himself as the nice paternal figure. The film also gave out the message that the Americans won the war. There was not a single other allied soldier in the film. Not a problem on its own as Omaha was an all American landing spot, but what was unforgivable was that General Montgomery was slammed as ""overrated"". That was totally uncalled for and completely out of place in the situation. SPR was merely Speilberg exercising his greatest flaw that of recycling the same concept over and over again. SPR was in the same vain as ""Amistad"" and ""Schlindler's List"": that of showing the world the pain and suffering that a particular group of people went through and getting acclaim for it. The concept is wearing rather thin now Steven."

True - the first half hour is a brilliantly harrowing piece of cinema, which managed to brutally show the ugliness of war better than any film beforehand.

"arnoldko","4","1","3","27 February 1999"," Not worth watching.
","This is a typical Spielberg movie.  The basis is formed by a layer of american chauvinism, on which lies cheap, californian intellectualism, and the top is formed by multi-million dollars of special effects.  The movie is pretentious and hollow, and commercial in the way that it pushes a couple of the buttons of turn-of-the-century american obsessions: family values, fear of the chaos of life and violence.  It's quite understanding therefore that so many americans regard it as a good movie, as it strengthens emotions already there, instead of disrupting the mind, as any art should (in my opinion). As a war movie, it's mediocre.  The agony of war is captured much better in films like Full Metal Jacket, Stalingrad and Das Boot. The sad thing is that it is the nationalism that is promoted in this movie (the whole movie is framed by a waving flag) that is so often the cause of wars."
"Tet-5","5","1","3","7 February 1999"," A disappointment
","In lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious, as a time and a place where (mostly good-looking) young men can prove how brave they are. SPR would be different, so I expected. In this movie Spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific, not heroic.<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie really was shattering. People who still believe war is an exciting event for young would-be heroes (think: Tom Cruise in Top Gun) should be obligated to watch the Omaha Beach landing-scenes. Because it really makes you experience that war is hell, a sickening, horrible hell.<br/><br/>Of course you can't fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the Omaha Beach landing. To make a good movie, you need more, like good actors, a capable crew, convincing special effects and, the most important, an interesting story. Well, no one will dispute the fact that SPR technically is a masterpiece. The camerawork, the special effects, the sound, they are all overwhelmingly good.<br/><br/>In spite of all these plusses, I really was disappointed by at least two hours of SPR. Because it missed the most important thing a movie needs: an interesting story! The characters weren't convincing. I don't blame the actors for that, they all did a good job. It was the script that I blame, I never forgot I was watching a movie with made-up characters. When a movie is really good, I tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me, that I start to symphatize deeply with them. This never happened while I was watching SPR. I never felt anything more for Captain Miller and his men then I felt for all the other, anonymous soldiers you see in this movie. And the story, the search for Private Ryan, even bored me sometimes. There were just a few scenes, like the one in which the men were reading the name-tags of the fallen soldiers, that were really compelling.<br/><br/>Three things about SPR I really disliked. First there is the way the German soldier known as ""Steamboat Willie"" was portrayed. Why is the only German we got to know a little bit such an awkward, silly guy? I'm pretty sure lots of German soldiers were ordinary men who didn't want this war any more then anyone else did. They must have been just as afraid as the American soldiers, they must have felt the same pain and horror. But that's not the way if feels like in SPR. The overall feeling you get is ""Americans are good"" and ""Germans are bad"". Second, there is the fight for the bridge. This kind of stuff, the brave heroes who, against all odds, succeed in defeating the enemy, well, this has been done so many times before. This kind of cliche was exactly what I expected SPR to avoid. Third, there is the 'point of view'. You are made to believe that the Omaha Beach-scenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard. Then, in the last scene, you learn that this man never set foot on Omaha Beach. I felt manipulated in a negative way!<br/><br/>It was very hard for me to grade SPR. Technically, it's an absolute 10. The Omaha Beach-scene was extremely good, and I think it's a real homage to the veterans who were there. But there were too many things I did not like. I decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10."

","I think it is absurd that this movie receives such high praise. I admit that the 20 min scene of the battle at Omaha Beach is a technical tour de force, however the rest of the movie suffers from mushy appeals to our sense of national pride and does not effectively construct thorough character studies.  I believe it pales in comparison to The Thin Red Line, a movie which I believe has not received its due respect.  I think it is unfortunate for Malick that the timing of this movie forces such absurd comparison to Saving Private Ryan."

","A number of reviewers and people I have spoken to have described this film as the greatest war film ever.  It is far from this.  Whilst I will concede that this film contains some of the most brutal and compelling war scenes I have witnessed in any film it is underpinned by a weak storyline and laughable script.<br/><br/>Spielberg's camera direction is stunning and once again proves that he is a master of white-knuckle, tense action sequences but as is all too often the case with his flawed genius he feels the need to drown us in corny, unbelievable sentiment.<br/><br/>The sheer, graphic horror of warfare is captured with thrilling camera work and editing and seemed to send many stomachs churning amongst fellow cinema goers.  However inbetween the brutal and gory warfare we were expected to swallow sentiment of a level that upset my stomach far more.<br/><br/>The scene where Hanks 'opens up' to the troops had me retching uncontrollably.<br/><br/>Worse still was the nationalistic theme of the film.  Spielberg had his ""Isn't the USA great"" hat on and he was wearing it proud.<br/><br/>In summary this film though touched by genius was too long, too sickly-sentimental, too USA glorifying and on the whole too poorly written to ever be a film worthy of the superlatives that so many have bestowed upon it.<br/><br/>Worth a look though."
"B.S.Wise","4","1","3","15 January 1999"," FOR WAR CONSIDERATION
","January 15, 1999 - Stephen Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN seems the stuff of greatness:  it elevates cinematic realism to new heights, is a catalyst for passionate discourse on World War II, emboldens new respect for our veterans, and gives Spielberg an early lock on all things Oscar. Conversely, Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE garners equal parts praise, equal parts derision, and is called the product of an expatriate flower-child who's clearly lost his mind.  Four days after seeing Malick's film, I am haunted, not by horrible images of war, but something far deeper and beguiling.  Seeking truth, I see ""Ryan"" again, feeling diplomatic and ready to accept each film as two sides of the same coin  - SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the Id, flesh, machination, mission, answer and nostalgic history, to THE THIN RED LINE's conscience, spirit, garden, journey, question, and utopian vision.<br/><br/>Right out the gate, Spielberg is onto something big when he stages the battle of Omaha Beach.  Consider that he arrives on location with only five pages of script for the entire invasion of Normandy, then gets busy in his sandbox, re-shooting and fine-tuning the gore until an immaculate vision of carnage is rendered - mostly thanks to Janusz Kaminski stripped lenses and newsreel cinematography.  Reading the U.S. Army's technocratic account of D-Day, one is spirited to learn there is a real-life rifle company that lands at Dog Green amidst slaughter and confusion, blows a gap in a mine-field, fights its way to the top of a bluff, and cleans out a machine-gun nest.  This incursion actually takes several grueling hours, not twenty minutes - that this should be surprising is testament to the power of  Spielberg's false realism.<br/><br/>That Spielberg didn't just tell the whole story of D-Day is a bit of a shame.  I suppose he didn't want to remake THE LONGEST DAY (1962), with its ham-and-cheese heroics.  I kind of wish he had.  Instead, he opts for something more sentimental and personal in scope, but sadly, his vision suffers for it.  The very moment Tom Hanks' ""Captain Miller"" looks back at a beach littered with corpses (body parts curiously absent) the film loses its well-crafted, objectivity. That the eviscerating horrors of the battle still weigh on the mind is no excuse for the parade of stock characters, inappropriate comic relief, and desperate pastiche that follow.<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is no rip-off of THE THIN RED LINE, more so, an inversion. ""Red Line's"" single, gripping battle scene is bordered by metaphysical yearning, while ""Ryan"" bookends its uneasy spirituality with two scenes of sensational combat. ""Red Line"" features the hypnotic and ferocious presence of a green jungle, where ""Ryan's"" palate is leached of all color, save mud, gun-metal and brick. ""Red Line"" poses unanswerable queries into the nature of human existence, while ""Ryan"" asks the rhetorical question, ""am I a good man?""<br/><br/>All attempts at anticipating Malick's opus would be denied, for up to the second of his film's release, he still worked on it.  Here is a man who will never play by Hollywood's rules.  Consider that Malick spends twenty years in hiding, is begged out of retirement by a pair of iconoclastic producers (Robert Michael Geisler and John Roberdeau), spends many more years adapting James Jones' novel in secrecy, fires his producers, arrives on location in the wildernesses of Australia and the Solomon Islands with a small army, ditches his script, shoots 1,000,000 feet of 70mm film over a six-month period - most exclusively in evening and early morning light - cuts the film at eight hours, and lastly, writes a haunting, poetic narration to bind the final, three-hour cut.<br/><br/>Those not hypnotized by Malick's vision are finding this film infuriating, though.  A common complaint is that the film lacks a central hero to rally behind; but such is the film's belief that there exists a collective unconscious shared by all, and all men are somehow the same.  The physical similarities between Privates ""Witt"" (Jim Cazeviel) and ""Bell"" (Ben Chaplin) emphasize this point.  Both men carry with them memories of a great love, be it sensual wife, or primal paradise; both pass through war never to return to this love.  In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN you hear about a soldier's mental island, where one must go in battle to remain sane; but in THE THIN RED LINE, you experience this, and you mourn its passing.<br/><br/>In the end, THE THIN RED LINE is about World War II as much as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is about Death, the dark, senseless way one is mutilated through war.  THE THIN RED LINE is about Life, light, and its fragile presence in all living things.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I must address which film and which director will carry home more Oscars?  The Academy faced a similar conundrum in 1978 when considering COMING HOME vs. THE DEER HUNTER for Best Picture. (This was the same year Malick made Days of Heaven, then disappeared). The war in Vietnam, long a taboo subject, was then recognized in mainstream cinema but, who had the supreme vision, Hal Ashby or Michael Cimino?  The question is superfluous for neither film is about the war so much as the disintegration of the American psyche.  Ultimately, The Academy chose THE DEER HUNTER with its deeply layered character studies over the cloying, P.C. sentimentality of COMING HOME.  I am hoping that today's voters are of a similar sensibility. Therefore, I most humbly suggest to the esteemed members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for your consideration, for Best Picture THE THIN RED LINE - not because it is the better representation of war, because it is the greater realization of life.<br/><br/>*****"
"lefty-11","5","1","3","10 January 1999"," in spite of memorable combat scenes, liberal sentiment cheapens collective tragedy
","Smug liberal Spielberg toggles back and forth between documentary style violence and sentimental reflections between soldiers: the Captain is revealed to be an English Lit teacher in civilian life who can instruct the novice writer character and others with idealised rhetoric about both the unique contribution each can make to the mission as well as their ability to choose at will a vision/memory of ""the good life"" back home worth fighting for: this emphasis upon individual freedom detracts from shared debate among the men about both the worthiness of the mission to save one guy, and the larger reasons for American involvement in the war. This deflates any anti- war sentiment in the film. Significantly, Ryan is the sole survivor who must, alone in the cemetery (predictably, his accompanying family are as silent as his fallen comrades), decide/hope he was ""a good man"" worthy of their sacrifice. In this emotional lynchpin of the movie, Spielberg suggestively cuts to Old Glory flapping in the wind: the link drawn between liberal pluralism/individual choice and the symbol of America remains an insidious and powerful ideological moment, equalled only by the title character in ""Schindler's List"" who had the power to choose who would live or die. Consistently in his historical revisionist pieces, Spielberg suggests this is the only kind of freedom worth fighting for, with no awareness of how it merely compounds the tragedy."

If someone needed the bloody and gory opening sequence about D-Day to realize that war is hell, then this person has never thought about war in the first place. Of course war is a horrible experience, but it's amazing how many people needed Mr. Spielberg to tell them. And Spielberg does not solely concentrate on the horrors of war. Like so many other American war films, be it WWII or Vietnam, the heroic suffering is always endured by the brave innocent American side. The fact that the opposing side might also not have enjoyed the fighting is always overlooked.<br/><br/>The much praised historical accuracy, for me, does not rate this movie above others--if I want to know facts about WWII, I'll look them up in a history book, and not buy a movie ticket.<br/><br/>What additionally annoyed me was the bad directing. The lame attempt at a bit of comic relief with the wrong Private James Ryan was totally out of place in a serious war film. Tom Hanks got another chance to play the perfect American mainstream man, and Spielberg did not bother to properly develop his character into a three-dimensional person with highs and lows.

","Prior to seeing this film, I had heard only positive feedback.  I went into it expecting great things.  And I guess, yes, it was a good film.  The action sequences are awesome--very realistic.  The fighting scenes are incredibly moving and (as far as I can tell, I wasn't there) authentic. But, geez, what was with the beginning and the end?  It would have been a great film without those shmaltzy sequences.  Do we really need the director to SHOW us just how much of an impact Captain John had on Private Ryan? Can't anything be left to the imagination?<br/><br/>This film reminds me of Forrest Gump in its (blatant) manipulation of the viewing public.  My plea to directors is let us watch and judge the merits of the characters, don't tell us he's everyman, so then we will melt, cry and react emotionally!  We are smarter than you think.  Really!  We will get it without the affectations and overt pulls at the heartstrings.  What ever happened to subtlety in film?  I am sorry for those of you who think this is the best film you've ever seen.

","Anyone else have dreams about Omaha Beach after watching this movie? While I say the movie is too real, I do have one comment on the authenticity. If Tom Hank's character was in the first wave onto Omaha, he, and the rest of the cast probably would've been killed, too. Gosh, how's that for an entertaining thought? I remember feeling like I got hit by an 88 after the first 20 minutes. And then you get to see lingering individual death scenes after almost every sequence (the slow knife death in the house fight was senseless). I am a history major, but I don't like accurate history movies (a lot of history is depressing). I'll read about it. So, I guess I am not the target audience for this movie; I do like some war movies (Big Red One, Blackhawk Down, Platoon). I'll give Steven Spielberg credit for honoring the memory of World War II vets in demonstrating the horror and frustration they went through, but I can only watch that once. When you watch someone die in The Longest Day, you think ""oh no, there goes Sal Mineo""; with Ryan, you know that was a real person who just flopped out of his landing craft and drowned. I'm sure that is what war is really like, I just don't want to eat popcorn in front of it."

","*NO SPOILERS* As I look at my hodge-podge,of a movie collection I see a growing appreciation of WWI movies and war movies in general including: Wings, All Quiet of the Western Front, Paths of Glory, Sergeant York, Hell's Angels, La Grande Illusion, Ace's High, Lawrence of Arabia, The Blue Max, Gallipoli, War Horse. Plus, and I won't torture you anymore by listing another 25 or so WWII, 6 Vietnam War, 7 Revolutionary War, 5 Civil War and 5 Iraqi War period films. Right now I'm contemplating a 4 pack of war movies(""Von Ryan's Express"", ""12 O'Clock High"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""The Blue Max"") I just picked up, and also a used ""Flyboys"" on Blu-Ray Disc. After watching the four pack, I was prompted to write a review of ""The Blue Max""(1965) because I was so impressed with how it stood the test of time, with good action sequences in the sky(the ones on the ground were nice and spicy with Ursula Andress at her sexiest), and all that WITHOUT CGI. Of all the movies made about WWI with great flying sequences, which you might be able to count on one hand, I found ""The Blue Max"" a pleasant surprise. I later re-watched ""Flyboys"" to listen to the added commentary track provided by the Director and Producer, giving background details of the filming, but what was really the nice bonus was the historical details of the Lafayette Escadrille, a wholly American squadron flying, and fighting for the French against the Germans, just prior to the US officially entering WWI. It's fun revisiting these older movies which are being reissued with supplements, including commentary soundtracks- featuring the Directors and/or Script Writers, Cinematographers, Production Designers, Producers, and sometimes even the actors and critics(but who cares what they think). I've been adding Blu-Ray offerings of my favorite movies to get all the ""extras"" which I find informative and interesting. Now to the subject of this review, ""Saving Private Ryan""- a Steven Spielberg masterpiece. I gave it a 10(which I use very sparingly), and was so impressed I would have given an 11 if I could. For me, Ryan was only the second movie I immediately watched a second time(unfortunately I didn't see it on the big screen), the other being Glory, Denzel's acting tour de force about a black regiment in the Civil War(I was glad to have caught this on the big screen). All that said, Ryan has become the standard by which I judge a great movie of any genre. I think the crime of the century was ""Shakespeare in Love""(I actually liked it) winning the Academy Award for Best Picture over Ryan."

But it's far from being just a Boys Own action movie - indeed, anything but. Far from a derring do tale of nobility and victory thru' moral superiority, it's an enormously ambitious, triumphantly realised and utterly believable portrayal of men in all their variety and complexity struggling above all for survival, but motivated also both by the immense power of comradeship and a genuine if barely understood or articulated belief in the righteousness of a cause. A truly majestic piece of work, an immense example of film doing what only film can do, and a worthy salute to the everyday heroes it depicts. If Saving Private Ryan doesn't deserve 10/10, I really don't know what does."

","Saving Private Ryan is the World War II story of a group of American soldiers who just after the invasion of Omaha Beach, France, are sent to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and escort him home after all three of James Ryan's brothers are all killed in action, leaving him as the Ryan family's only living son. The movie opens with an older James Ryan visiting the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, where he falls to his knees when he arrives at the headstone of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) as he is overtaken by the grief of remembering what Captain Miller and his fellow soldiers did for him. As the camera focuses on the grief in James Ryan's eyes, we are taken back in time to the story of Captain Miller and his fellow soldiers' actions in saving Private Ryan. The opening shot (establishment shot) of the movie shows the Omaha beaches with Captain Miller and his crew inside a Higgins boat just off the shore ready to make their landing. As the door to the Higgins boat opens we are taken on a twenty-five-minute ride through the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of Captain Miller, other soldiers, and even through the eyes of machine gun operating German soldiers. In this scene, our visual and aural senses are shocked with the horrific sights and sounds of war. In what is surely the most graphic, gory and violent war scene I have ever witnessed, viewers are exposed to the sounds of bullets whistling past our heads as hunks of flesh are being blown off our soldiers, bodies being ripped in half by machine gun rounds, which we can hear bouncing off the ground, and limbs being blown off and bodies being vaporized as bombs explode on the beach. This barrage continues until the landing zone is secure, at which time we are presented with the remnants of the battle, which includes hundreds of dead bodies washed up on the beach and many more strewn about the sand, which is now soaked with blood. To maximize the effect of the horror of this scene, and others throughout the movie, the filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, uses a mix of visual techniques to intensify battle scenes, such as the use of hand held cameras to create volatile movements. He also effectively uses sound effects, transitions, and leitmotifs to enhance the emotional elements of the film. In the opening scene at the cemetery, while an older James Ryan is on his knees and the camera is tightly focused on his agonizing eyes, Spielberg transitions to the establishment shot by dissolving this facial shot. This transition technique sets the tone for the rest of the movie and is used anytime there is deep reflection and strong emotional situations occur. Another technique he employs to evoke an emotional response is the use of leitmotif. During the film there are several instances when soldiers are about to succumb to their injuries and they produce a written note they request be sent to their families. This passing of the note is extremely powerful in that is shows each soldier was aware of their vulnerability and potential death. Throughout the movie, this passing of the note is repeated multiple times as members of Captain Miller's group are killed in various battles as they race to find Private Ryan. This is repeated all the way to the end of the movie when Captain Miller is killed in the final battle scene and his note is taken by one of the members of his group. Now, as the movie ends, the viewer is transitioned back to the cemetery where Ryan is on his knees and staring at the cross of Miller as the words of his letter are being read aloud by a narrator. This circling back to the cemetery brings about a sense of finality to the movie and draws a strong emotional response from the audience. Lastly, in addition to the sound effects used in the war scenes, like the sound of bullets hitting flesh, Spielberg uses other sound effects that have a profound effect on the movie. These include the use of typewriter keys being struck by the secretaries of the Army who were writing death notices to the families of the fallen soldiers. The sound of the keys striking the paper are very loud and are done using a quick pace to emphasize the number of dead soldiers. In another scene when Captain Miller's group are looking for Ryan they came across a bag of dog tags that had been removed from dead soldiers. After looking at each tag the group would drop them onto a makeshift table, which caused an extremely loud clanging. Both sound effects are well placed and add dimension to the film. In the end, Saving Private Ryan is a movie that not only expresses the horrors and the human cost of war, it also is details the journey of a group of soldiers whose mission it is to save the last living son of the Ryan family. To that end, Spielberg beautifully ties together with sight and sound the very graphic nature of war and the nature of man, who is willing to risk his own life to save that of another. A movie well done, indeed."
"derekjpruett","10","1","4","30 June 2016"," Classic!!!
","This is one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks delivers a phenomenal performance (of course). Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper, and Edward Burns give great support to Hanks. <br/><br/>The story is good and the war scenes are believable and well shot. The majority of action movies are completely unrealistic (the protagonist is invincible and cannot miss his/her target while their enemies die like flies and can't hit their target if it were standing still). Saving Prvt Ryan is much more realistic and most of the ""good guys"" die (unfortunately the ones I liked were the ones that died). <br/><br/>This is more of a drama and adventure movie rather than action as the team has to find Ryan behind enemy lines. Other than D-Day and the final fighting scene, this is more of an action film than most war movies.<br/><br/>Some say that this movie is not historically accurate. I don't think that is such a big deal in determining whether or not a movie is good or not. Saving Private Ryan is a great movie for its action, acting, and story! I still can't believe that it did not receive an academy award for best picture. 10 stars easy"

","In the present day, an elderly World War II veteran and his family visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Normandy, France. The veteran walks around the cemetery and, upon seeing one specific gravestone, collapses to his knees, overwhelmed by emotion.<br/><br/>The film flashes back to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy Invasion, as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. Captain John H. Miller, a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with ""S. Ryan"" inscribed on the back of his uniform, is shown.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C, at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy. Marshall, after reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter, orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately.<br/><br/>Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company— T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Private First Class Richard Reiben, Privates Stanley Mellish, Adrian Caparzo, Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade—and T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer who speaks French and German, loaned from the 29th Infantry Division.

","First off, the acting in the movie was absolutely amazing! I loved how I could feel the emotions pouring out of each of the characters! In addition to that, the D-Day scene was one of the most memorable and realistic scenes I have ever seen in a movie depicting war. In my opinion, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks need to start making movies about both the Vietnam war, as well as, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This would be helpful to both veterans and civilians wanting to have a better understanding of the wars. When Pvt. Jackson got blown up in the tower I felt so demoralized because Miller's men were dying left and right. Making it harder for Pvt. Ryan to be safely extracted from the battle. This movie will always be one of my favorites and it would be amazing to sit behind the scenes and watch as this kind of movie is made. I definitely hope to meet both Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg one day, in order to gain better insight as to what enables them to make such spectacular movies!!"

"quinimdb","10","1","4","29 May 2016"," Saving private Ryan
","You could watch the first scene of this film and think: ""this is a great scene, but why is this necessary?"" But really, this scene lays out the foundation for the rest of the film. The scene shows how fragile life is in war. How a man could die right next to you within a matter of seconds and you may not even notice. It also shows how all hope seems to be crushed by war, showing a man nearly being hit by a bullet and checking his helmet, but only getting shot in the head seconds later. It also shows men trying to revive a man on the ground, and just as they stop the bleeding, the man is shot in the head. The film shows this later in a scene involving Vin Deasel attempting to save a child from a building in the middle of a war zone, only to be shot by a sniper and have that child go back to his parents. It shows how there are no clear good guys and bad guys and how the Americans aren't necessarily any better than the other guys by showing men killing unarmed troops from the other side for, well, no reason. It shows this later in a scene in which the once naive Timothy is spared by a German soldier, and then kills an unarmed soldier who he spared earlier in the film only to have him be put back into circulation and kill more men, showing also how drastically it changes men. It even shows how Captain Miller must find hope in the face of all the horrible things happening around him by muting all the sound and using slow motion, both techniques that are used in a similar situation towards the end of the film as a call back. <br/><br/>After this fantastic scene, however, the men of Captain Miller's squad are called on a mission to save the final son of a mother who has lost her three other sons to this war only recently. The men are obviously confused by why they would need to risk all of their lives to save one man, and the film teeters back and forth on whether this mission is worth it or not. At many points it seems futile, especially after a second soldier is killed off in an incredibly heart wrenching scene in which Miller asks the dying medic what they can do to help him to which he responds with simply ""some morphine would help"". But in many places they seem to find possible hope. A high ranking officer tells Miller ""I have a brother. You get that boy home"". And when they accidentally find the wrong Private Ryan and inform him that his brothers are dead, even after he is told that he is not the guy the were looking for, just the idea of his brothers being dead tears him apart, showing the importance of a single person. Then also when they are loudly searching through dog tags to find a Private Ryan, only to realize that a squadron full of people that fought with those men are walking by. This shows that to them what is a meaningless name could have incredible significance to others. When they do end up getting to Ryan, it turns out he doesn't want to be saved. If he dies he says to tell his mom that he died with the only brothers that he had left. But Miller decides that if they save Private Ryan it might be the only decent thing that they've done in this horrible situation, and then they could truly earn their right to go home. But the victory is a long shot, and many people die in the process, including Miller. But Private Ryan survives, and in Miller's dying breaths he tells Ryan to ""earn this"". Ryan ends up living the rest of his life trying to live up to Captain Miller's command and earn this opportunity to live that many died to give him. So, was it even worth it?<br/><br/>Well, its not black and white, but the film argues yes, to some extent. Many men may have died, and many may have been permanently damaged, both emotionally and physically. And they may not know the good that they have done for the world, but as Private Ryan talks to Miller's grave in his old age, his wife and kids and grand kids lurk behind him, showing that if it weren't for people like Miller, many people today wouldn't exist. For every one man that is saved, many more get the chance to live."
"tylervpesek","10","1","4","22 May 2016"," Perfect.
","Alright, so I probably saw saving private Ryan when I was a little too young. I believe I was 11 years old when I saw it (not in theaters) I begged and begged my parents to finally rent it so I could see it. I remember I saw bits and parts of it when my sister and dad were watching it once and, for some reason, I, even as a kid, was fascinated by WWII. Anyway, they finally caved and went against there better judgment to get me to shut the heck up and we rented it one weekend. Now, the incredible intensity and realism of the violence in this movie is so well done, it left me shocked for a few days afterwards. I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Once that shock wore off I realized what a powerful movie it was and even at a young age the amount of respect I developed for the heroes of WWII was deep. I believe everyone should at least see this movie (and band of brothers) to appreciate the sacrifice that military members, past and present, give to their country's people. The masses watch TV show after TV show of gratuitous violence with glee because it portrays it as a whimsical thing that has little impact on those around it. Which is of course ridiculous. Saving Private Ryan does NOT glorify war or violence, but leaves it for what it is; a devastation to humanity. However once this is realized the respect for the heroes who go through it goes beyond words, which is captured beautifully in the film's soundtrack. We need not forget the heroes of the past. Anyway, on a technical standpoint the film will never be outdone: the sets, the practical effects, the cinematography, everything is perfect to capture the intensity of combat. The acting and script (while some have claimed it used a lot of stereotypes I disagree to an extent, but that is another argument) is all fantastic and Spielberg is at his absolute best. This is one of those films that transcends ""entertainment"" and ""media"" and everything commercial about movies and becomes something a lot more: It is a tribute, and a powerful one at that. Aside from the violence and intensity there are also a few very heartwarming scenes (when they find where Ryan is from the deafened paratrooper and when Ryan tells the captain about his brothers to just name a couple if you didn't believe me) Tom Hanks is at his best as well, I feel his acting was on a different multitasking level in this movie. He is fully consumed by his character. Anyway, perfect and powerful film."

","Directed by Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan is an action drama film that outlines a historical event in a realistic way. The emotion, violence, and realism that this film displays will make you feel as if you are there. The encompassing feelings of loss, grief, and sacrifice are real and this will show you a perspective into the trail events that follow war. This film is about so many things, but the focus is really on the courage and selflessness of the American soldier. <br/><br/>The film opens up with an action packed scene detailing the battle of Normandy. Tom Hanks plays as Captain Miller whom leads his men, members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, through battle in order to secure the landing. During this battle, many soldiers are lost; among these soldiers are two brothers. General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, becomes aware that these two brothers along with a third whom was in New Guinea had all been killed in action. He realizes that their mother would be receiving notice that three of her sons would not be coming home. Therefore, when it is found that there is a forth brother enlisted, Private Ryan played by Matt Damon, the decision was made that he would be found and returned home to his mother immediately.<br/><br/>This prompts Captain Miller, under the orders of the General, to assemble a team of eight soldiers from the 2nd Ranger Battalion to set out on a mission to establish contact with Private Ryan's unit, an element of the 101st Airborne Division. Throughout their mission, they come face to face with battle, sadness, bitterness, and challenges to fight for what they believe in. Captain Miller struggles through emotions and pain, but fights on keeping the moral and determination of the team moving forward with the ultimate goal of going home himself.<br/><br/>Once Private Ryan is finally located, he refuses to leave his men to go home despite the news he just received of his late brothers. He explains that the men by his side are the only brothers he has left and that he will not leave them. This infuriates Miller and his team, but also inspires them. They fight together in an epic battle until reinforcements arrive; unfortunately, not everyone makes it home.<br/><br/>The emotion in this film is undeniable. Sounds are a constant motif in this film from the beginning to the end. During big moments, such as battle, there are many sounds and details around and we are in that moment. The latter is that when there are close ups on characters, Captain Miller for example, we are seeing things in his perspective and hearing his thoughts as though he loses focus. A more recent film that has a similar theme is David Ayer's World War II flick 'Fury', where an army sergeant leads a team of five men to battle in hopes of accomplishing heroic ventures against the odds. The symbolism of the flag shown at the beginning and end of Saving Private Ryan are very relevant to the fact that freedom is not free and that without the men and women who devote themselves with courage and selflessness we could not be where we are today."

","First off, I liked this movie. Spielberg went the distance to create the real pain and terror of war with this panorama of death and bloodshed. The twenty minutes of Normandy footage is the most realistic I have ever seen, They cast real people with lost limbs to show how battles are carnage, not pretty scenery. Also, without making it obvious they showed how the invasion was completely thrown off track with airborne drops way off the intended marks. Simply put, the detail is authentic for every minute throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Certainly, Saving Private Ryan was never intended to be a documentary. The individual plot is, of course, total fiction. Yet the plot is, and never was, the focus of the movie. The focus rather, is the individual honor that comes from deep within the human psyche, the fear and anger that was prevalent through the ranks. This is a movie about us in a way..."

","WWII has been an astoundingly ubiquitous and efficacious event in the movies ever since 1939. Not a year goes by that at least one film concerns itself with the war, it's belligerents, it's soldiers, it's politics or it's innocents. There are many reasons for this, including the death toll, the availability of film technology, the timing and the Nazis themselves, being perfect villains by the power of their twisted ideology. Yet even a superficial look at history will reveal evil taking many shapes causing comparable turmoil in it's wake across the millenniums. Why then are modern audiences (the vast majority of which are generations removed from the conflict) so viscerally affected by WWII specifically?<br/><br/>The events of Saving Private Ryan are intended by military brass to be a moving piece of Army propaganda. The titular Private (Damon) is the youngest of four American farm-boy brothers, all of which were killed in the line of duty. Following the invasion of Normandy, Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his small company are tasked with going behind enemy lines to retrieve Private Ryan and bring him back before his mother at home collects yet another Army telegram. Along for the ride is the gruff Sgt. Harvath (Sizemore), the headstrong Private Reiben (Burns), Sniper Private Jackson (Pepper), Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) and three additional Privates Caparzo (Diesel), ""Fish"" (Goldberg) and Upham (Davies).<br/><br/>The film's ensemble all-male cast does an outstanding job all-around, each having the acting chops and dexterity to expand on their characters in a way that forms naturally from the story and the situations. These men, though duty-bound and ultimately courageous are not the quaint cardboard cut-outs we've seen in sub-par G.I. Joe B-movies. They're human, frail and afraid though still have the gumption and intelligence and moral fortitude to see things through. At the center of the motley crew is Tom Hank's whose unsure Captain Miller does his best given an escalating mess of obstacles from both the defending Nazis and the confusion of the U.S. Army grouping and regrouping after every decisive battle.<br/><br/>Yet Saving Private Ryan doesn't fall into the wry cynicism of The Americanization of Emily (1964) or the bitter fatalism of The Big Red One (1980). It doesn't choose to be quite as reductive as simply saying, ""war is absurdity."" Behind the grime, the rubble and the turmoil stands director Steven Spielberg's patented virtuous humanism, elevating the material to powerful heights. With a delicate but commanding hand, Spielberg fills the screen with moments of hope and nobility largely taking advantage of old- fashioned storytelling and Tom Hank's benevolent credibility. Every moment of affecting drama hits it's mark, reaching a satisfying crescendo that is guaranteed not to leave a dry eye in the theater.<br/><br/>Of course no war drama, as poignant as it might be, can be complete without high-octane action which I'm glad to say Saving Private Ryan delivers big time. To enhance the realism of the various gun-battles and thunderous Army advances, Spielberg doesn't shy away from blood or gore, showing the inhumanity of war in all it's awful, shameful glory. The first battle, a shocking and adrenaline-pumping depiction of D-Day at Omaha Beach is quite frankly one of the best war scenes ever committed to film.<br/><br/>While telling a real, complex and harrowing human story at the center of an inhumane war, Saving Private Ryan cuts through all the propaganda that made WWII the standalone cinematic force it was and arguably still is. Unlike the nationalistic one-reels of Frank Capra or the sinister celluloid works of Joseph Goebbels and company, Saving Private Ryan is a hard-nosed look at war from the perspective of those in the fray. It's exciting, bittersweet, scary, saddening and redemptive all in equal measure thus making Saving Private Ryan one of the best war films ever made."
"olivelovett","10","1","4","23 February 2016"," A Film of Honor and Sacrifice
","Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a film that is illustrated with such magnificent detail that it helps grasp your attention right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the credits start to roll. The hard work and dedication put in by the director, cinematographer, and actors in this film will make you leave the theater completely enthralled with tear-stained cheeks and puffy eyes. This film is set during World War II, particularly the Invasion of Normandy. As four brothers of the Ryan family enter the war their mother receives the news that three of them have died right at the start. Devastated at her loss, she sends orders to have them find her fourth son. This leads into the whole mission of the movie which is to find Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home. Tom Hanks is known for his work in dramas so it was no surprise that he was the perfect fit to play the leading role as Captain John H. Miller. He takes it above and beyond when he allows his voice to tremble and even get this glassy look in his eye as if he was experiencing war first hand. He plays the leader that everyone looks to when they are in desperate need for direction but he also portrays the man whose hands tremble due to the effect of war which makes him that much more fascinating to watch. Another character that catches your eye is that of Private Richard Reiben, played by Edward Burns. Burns' portrays a new new demeanor never seen by him before as he is not known for his acting in epic war dramas but comedies. Throughout the film, he is seen yelling into men's faces and giving off facial expressions that makes him look arrogant but then becomes soft as he realizes he can't do anything else to save Captain Miller. Seeing Burns play such a new role gives him that much more credibility and respect for his acting career. <br/><br/>The credit of this film should go not solely to the actors, but to director Steven Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński who display so many different perspectives and angles that pull the film together. For example, when they show the death of Captain Miller they use an angle that shows who shoots him and him getting shot, pulling together the commotion of war and show his men avenging his death. They also took real footage from what actually happened during WWII and copied almost exactly how they saw it. By knowing that you just witnessed what actually happened in history makes the film that much more alluring than it already is. Considering the film starts off with a very graphic 27-minute battle scene at Omaha Beach, it sets the expectation that the rest of the movie would not be a waste of one's time. The reality of the film is one that needs to be rewarded due to the accuracy of the little details. Some of these details are the boats that replicated the ones used during WWII, the blood they used to completely engulf the water, and the scene which shows soldiers trying to find their severed limbs. Spielberg did not sugarcoat the harsh realities of war but instead used it to capture the audience's attention. Spielberg has definitely outdone himself in this film. It teaches one about American history but also one about honor and sacrifice. Through the agony and the loss, it is a film that will be shown to people for centuries to come."
"jbaur-98503","8","1","4","21 February 2016"," Saving Private Ryan: Spielberg spills more blood than Tarantino has ever seen
","There aren't many film directors as influential and recognizable as Steven Spielberg. He is mostly known for his fun films for almost all ages. Yet, one of his most acclaimed works to date is called one of the most violent, most realistic and grittiest depictions of war in cinema history. This is one of Spielberg's greatest movies.<br/><br/>The film is set in the Normandy during World War II. Three of the four brothers named Ryan have fallen in battle. The military decides it is the best to escort the last brother, James Ryan (played by Matt Damon) back home, so that his family wouldn't lose all of their sons. Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks) is told to guide a group of soldiers (including actors such as Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davis among others) to find Ryan.<br/><br/>The acting in Saving Private Ryan is very amazing. Tom Hanks is, as always, the master of his doings, but we have seen better roles by Tom Hanks a few times. Although he functions more like a McGuffin than an actual character, and has not so much screen time, Matt Damon has one of his best performances ever. The supporting actors Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davis do their job very well too.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this films is among the best I have ever seen. In some scenes, like the famous Omaha Beach scene, at the beginning of the movie, the camera is very shaky, but you can still see what is going on. This adds to the tension of the scene. The visual style is very realistically brutal, as claimed by many historians and survivors of the D-Day battle.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best, if not the best, war movies ever made. Cinematography is flawless, acting is amazing and it is one of these films that truly show how terrible war actually is. This is a very depressing movie, but it also has some uplifting and even funny moments (like when Corporal Upham trips over the typewriter). To sum it up: this is about how far you can get from a movie being ""fubar"". 10/10"
"Trivox","10","1","4","10 February 2016"," The best movie that injures mind
","Recently I decided to watch again ""Saving Private Ryan"" with an intention to describe its general sense within couple paragraphs as a small review. But as soon as I've done it, I realized that my review cannot be as small as I intentionally planned.<br/><br/>I would start with the main statement: this is the most massive movie about war I've ever seen. Notwithstanding it is a little bit too American, in my opinion. The movie impresses with its uncovered realism. Steven Spielberg, thrashing over his battle scenes, tried to make them be more like a news-reel from a battlefront. The close-ups, full of dynamics; a scenery detailed elaboration; a meticulous filling scenes with sound and colour: all these not just impress but stun and literally injure viewer's mind.<br/><br/>The key episode of the first half of the movie is a landing attack on a beach of Normandy. In a first moment as hatches of troop- carrying vessels are open first rows of soldiers are sweeping away by stormly fire of large-calibre rifles. Others (with the imaginary camera- man) start to jump over from both boards of the boat. Several time we are drawn down and up again; as water cover us all sounds are being so muttered and meaningless and we feel ourselves almost safe. But then bullets starts to stitch the water body over and over. And the water turns red... Oh, I shouldn't try to retell what has been already geniusly filmed. These couple of minutes leave viewer completely breathless. And you believe in what you see from start to finish.<br/><br/>And then the battle begins. No, I'm wrong, not the battle but slaughtery. It is shocking. The death is shown with all of its uncovered might. When I meet somewhere in a text or in TV a phrase like ""he went through hell at that war"", even it's not about WW2, but I remain this battle scene from this movie to help my mind understand the phrase better.<br/><br/>Stephen Spielberg said about battle scenes of the movie that he wanted to represent them in a way to diminish tendency of violence embellishment.<br/><br/>The cast is good, very good. Tom Hanks is a great actor and this is his greatest role, in my opinion. Yes, he is playing again his ""mr. Good Guy"" cliché, but it doesn't matter. Sincerely speaking, I do not much like American mentality, which shows most vividly in American stories about war, about American soldiers. And that's why I like Tom Hanks here: he made an image of Cpt. James Miller very close too my idea of what an officer should be. He could play a soviet officer for that story as well; there wouldn't be any dissonance at all. I like image he made very much.<br/><br/>Once again: set design is amazing. You never doubt that this is a war in front of you, not for a moment. The war is every small detail: in every stone, in every building, in everywhere.<br/><br/>But the storyline is not complicated at all. It's not bad, because it is so marvelously represented; even typical American messages in the beginning and in the end are not worsen my general feeling about the movie. I think these messages are even controversial to all other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>My rate: 10/10"
"cutigersfan","9","1","4","11 January 2016"," One of my favorite war movies.... ever

The story is extremely sad but what makes it very sad is because it's true. Most of the things that occurred in the movie actually happened in World War Two. As a person interested in World War Two, I found this movie did an extremely good job depicting life after D-Day. The ending is extremely sad and it actually took my by surprise. I didn't expect that to happen. I expected some of it, but not all of it. In my opinion, this is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, along with 'Schindler's List'.

","After discovering that three of his brothers have been killed in battle, the War Department orders a group of soldiers to ""save"" Private Ryan and send him home to his mother. This act creates a fair amount of conflict, and from there the story really picks up.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, while a fine director, often becomes sentimental and smarmy. This is no exception. But for the most part, the battles are fierce, the wounds are bloody and the death toll is high. Considered by many to be the greatest of all war films, it easily ranks up there in my book.<br/><br/>What I loved most about this film? The casting of Nathan Fillion and Jeremy Davies. Oh my, I can never get enough of those two gentlemen. Beyond that, the realism and the brutality shines through. I appreciate that the Americans executed surrendering Germans (and on one occasion, Czechs) rather than took them prisoner. Is it right? No. But it's realistic."
"john_oneill41","9","1","4","13 March 2010"," One of the best war films ever made
","This depicts the second world war as no other film had before. The first twenty five minutes really drives home the futility and brutality of war as well as the incompetence of the bomber commanders in not clearing the beach a little more.<br/><br/>For me the sign of a good movie is that it seems shorter than it's running time. This movie is nearly tree hours but seems nowhere near that long.<br/><br/>The performances are all very good with fine memorable characters and the only jarring note for me was at the end when the captain tells Ryan to Earn this. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I felt that it put an awful burden on Ryan who would have been haunted by the fact that all these soldiers had died to save him, especially when he didn't want to be saved.<br/><br/>Other than that it is an excellent way to spend a few hours."
"GloreMag","10","1","4","10 February 2010"," Breathtaking and Extraordinary...Ultimate War Depiction
","I read the review on the title page that recommended watching this film with a surround sound system to make watching this film an astounding experience. I took the advice of this reviewer and I thank him, the sound quality was mind-blowing and captivated me for the 162 minute running time. However, this brutally realistic depiction of combat is an astounding experience regardless of surround systems.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of soldiers of the 2nd Ranger Batallion who valiantly agree to tackle a brutal mission where the subject is a young trooper by the name of James Francis Ryan who unknowingly as lost his 3 brothers in combat. After his mother receives the news, the chief of staff of the U.S army orders the Generals to inform Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) that he is to locate Private Ryan and release from his duties in combat in order for him to return safely to his grieving mother.<br/><br/>The film follows the group of soldiers as they go to extraordinary lengths in order to 'Save Private Ryan' which involves the death of two soldier's, the medic Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), along with the massacre of a number of German and French troops. After the soldiers locate their subject, they break the news to him and despite understandably being crippled with grief, Private Ryan displays extreme reluctance to lead his camp which provokes mixed emotions towards him. Firstly, it's easy to appreciate his nobility and his loyalty towards his duties but this is juxtaposed with a feeling of disdain simply because he initially doesn't appreciate the lengths that the soldier's have went to in order to fin him, whilst abandoning their original duties in the army.<br/><br/>Spelberg's direction is awe-inspired and flawless. He masterfully captures the brutality of combat in the 22-minute opening scene where there is blood, guts and gunfire in abundance. Does blood and guts make for a great depiction of war combat? Definitely not, but it's Spielberg's direction which involves extreme close-ups of casualties and of course, the blood and rain onto the camera lens is an effective technique. Spielberg is very impressive as he makes the viewer realise the pain and suffering, the desperation and sometimes futility of hard-fought combat. Contrary to these portrayals, he is equally effective in engaging the audience into positive emotions such as a feeling of triumph when the soldiers under the command of Captain Miller penetrate the German infantry on Omaha beach when it looked clear that the soldiers where in a desperate struggle against the Germans. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is not fantastic, it's not supposed to be. The movie, unlike so many others in the modern-day film industry, does not depend on the acting of the main protagonists in order for it to achieve on a number of levels. The acting, however, is impressive and believable. Believable being the operative word. Hanks and co. are very believable in terms of struggling to overcome adversity in its extremist form and battling the almost overwhelmingly brutal elements of combat. <br/><br/>The film is particularly recognised for its intense opening scene set on the beach of Omaha, Normandy but in my opinion, the movie is entertaining, intense and captivating throughout the duration. It has no spells of boredom, there are no dull and listless sequences of dialogue. The dialogue sustains credibility, humour and purity.<br/><br/>This film won 5 academy awards, it should have won more. It received accolades for direction, obviously and also won for cinematography and sound editing whilst the Best Picture went Shakespeare in Love (sigh).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a masterpiece. An intense and brutal depiction of the elements of war. It does to an extent glorify American soldiers considering that a number of soldiers abandoned their respective duties in order to retrieve an unknown private but it does it in an engrossing manner. The script is solid, which is all it needs to be, the same goes with the acting but the cinematography, editing and effects are astonishing. Truly breathtaking. This is the best Spielberg film I have ever watched (I haven't seen Schindler's List) 10/10! Pure cinematic mastery!"

","Saving private ryan was incredible from the get go, the violence emotion and the acting was perfect. there was funny bits like when the big guy chucks his helmet at a nazi then shoots him with a pistol and when you watch this film you'll notice the same stuff was used in most war games. but why hasn't a Vietnam war film like platoon or apocalypse now not as good as this saving private ryan? .................................................................... The reason is that as i am Australian and i notice when propaganda films are made and saving private ryan made the Nazis look like vicious horrible humans that's not far from what they really where. BUT in a Vietnam war film that's made by Americans (platoon,Apoco now) they make it look like war is bad because the vicious disgusting Americans start stupid wars over nothing but in world war 2 the Americans where the good guys and that's easy to portrait. Now the Americans once again are fighting a war over nothing in iraq and Afghanistan but the Vietnamies didn't have access to nukes but the middle east might. So what im trying to say is Americans can make a person be proud of there country or cry for what has happened but they can't dismiss the past for what actually took place in Vietnam.

Even with the language filtered (which was my only disappointment) this movie is on the verge of the NC-17. Nobody wanted to see what war was like. But Steven Speilburg made them anyway. When I saw this movie, my view of war changed. I had no idea of all the deaths and pain our soldiers went through to make the US a better country to live in. Body parts flying everywhere, a man that had his face blown off, blood spraying in all directions, men trying finding their missing limbs and men lying in their own intestines. And that's just the first 30 minutes in the Omaha beach scene. Like I said, this is a strong and moving film that is not for the weak stomach or for people that don't want to know what war was really like. I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved by the strong story and captivating effects that is ""Saving Private Ryan."""

","I am a big fan of WWII movies and was looking forward to this movie. I had heard so many great things about it. I was very disappointed. The actual photography and special effects were great. The actions of the people involved to make little sense. The opening at Normandy was well done but I didn't understand mixing the humor with the gore. But it was good at showing the brutality. Now the men at the center of the action were experienced soldiers. We see them using their wits in using mirrors to look around corners, not exposing them selves to enemy fire, etc. Everything is fine. Then comes the set up, trying to find the one private in the sea of humanity. Okay, so they look and finally find him. Now the logic seems to completely desert the men and they act so stupid which is a complete 180 from how they acted at the start of the movie. If they had no combat experience that is one thing but to start the movie showing how smart they are, then wind up the way they did just was too much for me.<br/><br/>Okay, I accept the decision to stay and fight for no real good reason because things like that happen. But then they start running out in front of tanks, stand still while tanks point their guns at them, sit on their butts when they run out of ammo, and to not even try to find out where the bridge was in relation to the army? As it turns out if they had not lured the Germans into their ""trap"" their fighters and the whole column would have been up to deal with them without any pointless fighting. Okay well that could have been a stupid decision but to have the men act they didn't have a clue about war, they didn't just go through the brutality of the invasion, was just so contrived it was too much for the suspension of believe normally called for.<br/><br/>I really don't understand why so many people liked it. It seems like the fact that Spielberg directed it gives in an extra 4 points. Obviously I am in the minority here. Maybe I watched too many episodes of ""Combat"" growing up and my expectation were too high."

","Although 'Saving Private Ryan' portrays excellent cinematography and probably a pretty accurate sense of being in a battle in the second World War, the film failed to do anything more. This film was probably made for its battle scenes, which I cannot fault at all and for which this movie does earn some credit for. However, in terms of story and characters, the film fails. Along with the story, the film has too many slow movements; overall, it is too long and tends to drag on. If they had spent as much time on the story as much as they spent on the cinematography, then we would have had a much better film.

I understand that war is brutal and there are lots of fatalities and what not but kill off any soldiers that people immediately grew attached to was just dumb on the directors part.

"kriewall","5","1","4","28 August 2005"," War is hell, so only the typists survive
","Saving Private Ryan is a good movie so far as action scenes and depicting the horror of war is concerned. So far as plot and historical accuracy goes ... well, as it was once said: ""Very few things happen at the right time and the rest do not happen at all. The conscientious historian will correct these defects."" This is a feature that doesn't seem to bother too many people, however.<br/><br/>The whole movie is based on a laughable premise. When Private Ryan's three siblings are killed in the war, Captain Miller is given an assignment to take a squad of men and go find Ryan. Private Ryan is, of course, behind enemy lines and the mission is highly dangerous (suicidal, actually). And here we find our very distant relationship to reality: <br/><br/>""The plot was inspired in part by the true story of Fritz Niland, one of four brothers from New York state who saw action during the war. Two Niland brothers were killed on D-Day, while another was missing in action in Burma and was presumed dead, although he actually survived. Fritz was located in Normandy by an Army chaplain, Reverend Francis Sampson, and taken out of the combat zone."" <br/><br/>So, where a priest managed to do the job singlehandedly in real life, it now takes a squad of battle-hardened soldiers (oh, and a perpetually cringing typist - THAT was a good idea) to be sent to their doom by the loving United States government. The soldiers are, of course, acutely aware of this fact, and they spend no shortage of time dwelling on it for the viewer's pleasure before they finally end up getting killed. Spielberg appears to have a bone to pick with the U.S. Government (and there were, to be sure, bones to be picked), but it would be nice if this one were at least grounded in reality - and if he weren't quite so preachy. For viewers somewhat versed in history and who require a believable plot to enjoy a movie, Saving Private Ryan feels like summer stock in an iron lung. Couple this with Spielberg's typical cheese-ball antics (flashbacks, flash-forwards, women swooning, men swooning!, anything to create an emotional effect with the least possible effort), and you've got yourself some Academy Award-winning eye candy that will forever serve as the gold standard in WWII movies.<br/><br/>(Just as an aside, Tom Hanks apparently recognized the irony behind Saving Private Ryan since he went on to produce a well-done 10-hour HBO mini-series on the 101st Airborne entitled ""Band of Brothers"" which, in contrast, IS actually believable, which might have something to do with the fact that it employs some amount of historical accuracy. You'd be better off watching Band of Brothers, unless you enjoy the feeling of being brainwashed.)"

","This film is brilliant because it trys to get as close to realism as is possible and we need films like this every now and then to show us what went on in a different time . For me its the ending not the start that makes it although that start is unforgettable and brilliant but also devastatingly terrible .But the one thing that I marvel at is that men did that I cannot imagine where guys found the bravery to run up a beach and return fire in the face of that devastating machine gun fire .<br/><br/>The one message that I think the whole movie conveys is one of ordinary men going to war and changing history the way they did for me the whole movie is summed up by Tom Hanks admission that he is a school teacher to put this in perspective think back to your old school teachers can you think of one of them who you would think capable of doing what his character did during this film or what the others did are any of us capable that is questions that this movie asks of us all while at the same time giving us the answers about a small part of war .<br/><br/>Everybody should watch this movie as it is seminal and it does bring home some very stark realities if you don't like it then maybe you should continue to watch old John Wayne movies where the bullets bounced off of people and soldiers on the Allied side ran through enfilading fire without any of them getting hit.<br/><br/>One day I hope Speilburg and Hanks collaborate on either a story on Okinawa , Iwojima American stories or Maybe Kohima a British and Indian story all 3 of these particular battles were all murderous in their own way and also It would bring to light a forgotten war because WWII did not just happen in europe"

","I simply love this movie! It's a masterpiece. Steven Spielberg has proved yet again that he is a genius. Tom Hanks performs an outstanding role in this movie. He's my favourite actor, among the few who won 2 consecutive Oscars. This movie enhances every sensation felt by those brave little soldiers. It's so realistic.<br/><br/>I'm just amazed Hanks didn't win an Oscar 4 his performance, i mean he was just breathtaking. ""With each man i kill, the farther from home i feel"" - this quote leaves me speechless, it's so meaningful. <br/><br/>I like this movie because it's atypical. The main character dies in the end, unlike in most war movies. I think this adds flavour to it."

","OK, I can understand the story can grab your attention, but...<br/><br/>C'mon!!! Do you really want me to believe that the life of that one kid is worth a whole team of dead soldiers?!? And that the President of America himself took care of it! What kind of useless rhetoric, in the worst American B-movie tradition! That is NOT what I expect from a Steven Spielberg's movie. And what about when, after all this absurdity, they meet Pvt. Ryan (at last!), and he refuses to come back, because of ""bla bla bla...""?!? If I wore Tom Hanks' character, I would have shot him at once!!! On the other hand, we must admit that the famous opening scene of Normandy Attack is one of the best of the whole movie history: scaring, rhythmic, impressive, realistic,... this is Spielberg! So, as an overall, I would rate 10 for the opening scene, but 0 for the rest (it would be 3, if it wasn't Spielberg: we can not let him waste his talent like that), so, as an average, I just give 5.<br/><br/>One last suggestion for everybody: rent the DVD, watch the opening scene (maybe even twice, or more...), and then bring it back to the shop."

","This is a masterpiece. I love war movies, but this one beats them all, hands-down. Not just for its graphic, realistic depiction of being in the middle of battle, but also for the incredible characters that are developed, and the quiet, intimate moments, where a soldier's sadness, loneliness, depression, and fear all start to kick in. If you've seen ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Casualties of War"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""We Were Soldiers"", or any other war film, you need to see ""Saving Private Ryan"". It is the war movie by which all others will be judged for a very long time, maybe even forever. There are no words that can do it justice. This is the only movie I can give a ""10"" rating to, because in my mind, it literally is the perfect war movie in every sense. You will not be disappointed."

","I could have made a lot of money from this movie. While watching it with a friend I kept saying ""he is going to die now"" and guess what...he did. Now if only I had made a bet of $10 each time that happened I would have had made enough to cover my movie ticket, the price of the popcorn and drink, plus I would have been able go out to a café afterwards.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting. A group of American soilders must cross the scattered D-day lines to find a soldier whose brothers have all been killed so he can be sent home because the President of the US of A promised that he could.<br/><br/>The them of this movie is obvious. People made sacrifices to keep the world safe during world war II. Do we as a generation live up to those sacrifices. My view is, nope, you bastards took Vietnam away from a pro-American Ho Chi Min and gave it to the French (then Ho Chi Min got angry and kicked your American butts as you deserve). You rounded up the communists in Greece at the end of WWII and had them shot (so of course they had a communist uprising later).<br/><br/>This is a sad pathetic and obvious movie that tries to justify America to Americans.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes up for that is the honesty of the war scenes and truth in the characters (other than Private Ryan who turns out to by some sort of Uber American symbol so we can feel good about him being saved).<br/><br/>Watch it with friends so you can play the Saving Private Ryan drinking game. It works like this, people call out the names of characters they think are going to die. If they do die within 5 minutes everyone drinks, if they don't the person who called out drinks."

","made in 1998 spielberg broke all conventions of war films and a gripping emotional epic was born. It unveils the true horror of what happened on d-day. although if you look under it all, where is Britain, canada, poland etc mentioned once?? as far as i'm concerned this film is totally biased, the war wasn't won single-handedly, but by nations bonding. i am insulted that this film didn't include anyone else but the Americans. they have taken all the credit. fair play it was made in America by Americans but many American films have actors from other nationalitys so why is this an exception?? don't get me wrong, its a good film...in places, but a bit more thought needs to be put into it next time, to avoid upset. i loved the opening sequence though!"
"MacaulayConnor","4","1","4","8 September 2004"," It keeps dropping despite the good comments -SPOILERS
","I didn't like this one. People seem to fall for Spielberg's direction, which is very good with the exception of some big mistakes (see below). But the story is so bad.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>First of all: how can the old man at the beach remember things, he never saw? I mean he did not participate in the landing, how on earth he can remember it so vividly?<br/><br/>Second: Question: In the end: the bridge is set with explosives, a tank is hit by a bomb from a fighter plane and a man is on that bridge directly in front of the tank. What happens to him? According to Spielberg / Rodat: Nothing! The tank is destroyed, the bridge is not, and there is not shrapnel at all - and the man is still in one piece!! Come on, you people, you call THIS realistic?!<br/><br/>Third: Monty-bashing is okay IMO (see MarketGarden), but how come that Hanks, who is just a Captain, is more aware of the general situation than higher ranking officers with all the information they are getting from other troops, planes etc.? I am referring to the scene on the beach, when Hanks is telling us about the importance of this particulare bridge. Which turns out to be very small, nothing pioneers could not build over night. It's not like crossing the Rhine! But Hanks claims, that this bridge is not only vital for the success of D-Day, but the entire war!! This is crap beyond imagination! Thank you Mr. Rodat, you made us all believe that every soldier in every thick of a fight can judge better than a General!<br/><br/>Four: The change of Hanks. He is trying to come out alive, he even tries to save his men's lifes. Wandering around in France he happens to hit a lonely German outpost with a machine gun. Question: What is the right decision? Correct! You run directly into the line of fire... Well, he could have said: ""Men, do you want to walk around it, could be, say, a mile to avoid it...?!"" Soldier: ""No, my script says, I have to die here, so let's run into it!"" Hanks: ""Ah, you are right! And there will be also a German soldier who has to beg for his life, and I have to have mercy on him, so he will be able to run and fight us again later. Hmm, that shows pretty well the evilness of the Germans. Okay, so let's run!""<br/><br/>Five: The change of Hanks. So he has lost a man. Now he's going for it: ""Let's call this bridge !The Alamo!. This is were we will fall back to."" Soldier: ""Hmm, I don't remember exactly: What happened to the defenders of that place in Mexico, uh, Texas...?"" Hanks: ""Uh, any OTHER questions...?""<br/><br/>Six: The final battle. Well though the SS was being an elite troop at the beginning of the war, it was watered down by 1944. But they were fanatics and/or thugs/killers/low-lifes/scum - you get the idea! - from about 16 countries at this time. There were even French, Norwegian, Swedish, Ukrainian soldiers - you name it - in the German army at this time. All in all we can consider them to be very dangerous. Maybe this particulare troop had some veterans from the eastern front. This is an armored infantry, bringing along tanks. And now enter Hanks an Co. They decide to shoot it out and - guess by yourself what happens....<br/><br/>Seven: The characters. Don't get me started on that...<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Spielberg, you are great, but you have to have more patience looking for good scripts. You did cinema history with the opening sequence, but the rest just sucks - due to the script.<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Rodat, maybe the original script was better than this mess, maybe I am doing you wrong. But on the other hand, your next script was ""The patriot"". The one with Gibson, not Seagal...well, you'll keep trying, huh?!<br/><br/>The movie was in the Top 10 (if I remember right), and now it's down on 58. But the users of IMDb comment on it enthusiastically. I guess the the ones who did not like it, did not comment?<br/><br/>Bad, bad writing, good directing, good Hanks 4/10 Macaulay J. Connor"
"jacksflicks","10","1","4","6 April 2004"," Compare this to ""They were Expendable""
","Until I saw ""Private Ryan"" I thought the best film about World War II was John Ford and Robert Montgomery's ""They were Expendable"". Now I can say that ""Private Ryan"" is to the European War what ""Expendable"" was to the Pacific War. They both convey a common message: that sometimes war must be fought, that we not shrink from what needs to be done, that we never forget the sacrifice and, most importantly, that we make ourselves worthy of that sacrifice.<br/><br/>World War II wasn't just something that happened. It was Armageddon, in which the future of the world was at stake. And that's no exaggeration. Those who died in the endeavor gave us the right outcome are, to me, true martyrs, not to religion or patriotism but to humanity itself. I think this is what both Expendable and Private Ryan are reminding us, by dramatizing the message, not preaching it.<br/><br/>Despite the advances in film-making technology that make ""Saving Private Ryan"" a more intense experience than ""They were Expendable,"" both are magnificent films which compliment each other. Both have been given splendid DVD transfers, and it is fascinating to watch them back-to-back to compare how similar events are portrayed in the idioms of two different eras. Spielberg has the advantage of being in an era without the constraints, both technical and political, suffered by Ford. Unlike Ford, Spielberg is free to add, ""And lest we forget  to bring home the meaning of sacrifice  here's an unvarnished look at what really happened to those who didn't come back."""

"Irakli28","2","1","4","5 October 1999"," No matter how important and serious is the problem of the film, nothing will save it if it is made without taste
","This film is a typical example of the wrong conception that the big money and a serious theme make a great art. No matter how important and serious is the problem of the film, nothing will save it if it is made without taste. Spielberg goes on making dull, pretentious, unbearably politically correct films for adults with a teenage level of intellect. Well, there is nothing bad in making naive picture but naivety of Spielberg Films is of a special kind. It seems that the director wants to make something more important than ET or Indiana Jones but, actually these are his best films, because they are what they are __ nice, entertaining films for kids. When Spielberg aspires for something higher he inevitably finishes with a huge, monumental soap.<br/><br/>Unlike Shindlers List that I consider a good educational film for youth, Private Ryan has something that I, citizen of a post-communist (post-totalitarian) country cannot accept. America used to be for us a symbol of democracy, and it is strange that now when there is no Soviet danger anymore, American cinema is becoming more and more conservative and hurrah-patriotic. Of course there is nothing bad in being a patriot of your nation but the latest tendency is obviously aimed at propagating the armed forces, militarism, etc. From this point of view there is not much difference between the Private Rayan and the Independence Day. Spielbergs films doesn't seem to show that much of senselessness of war (as it was advertised), but propagates the bravery of the American soldiers and the wisdom of the American regime, and does this as straightforward and primitive as it can be. The story of the film seems pathetic (even if it is true), and the acting is corresponding, good photography and excellent sound effects cannot save the film. I think it is time for some filmmakers to realize that no matter how important and serious is the problem of film; nothing will save it if it is made without taste."

"slawman","3","1","4","21 August 1999"," Unjustifiable exploitation film masquerading as ""art""
","What if this film had been made exactly as it is seen today by someone other than Steven Spielberg?  What would the critics be saying?  I have a feeling they would be telling the screenwriter to go back to college and learn about dialogue, story thrust, plausibility, and characterization - four things that this awful, exploitive drivel singularly lacked.  I feel they would also be telling the director that if you open a film with 40 minutes of sickening violence that you had better be prepared to justify it later on. The most disheartening thing about all of this is that Spielberg no longer seems to care what his films are saying, only that they make a big enough noise to be ""important"".  Following the unwatchable opening, we get extremely trite symbolism, poor dialogue, and wooden acting in service of a badly presented story, all leading up to another unwatchable sequence, followed by a coda which suggests that all of this unnecessary carnage is a great, noble, and patriotic thing.  In doing this, Spielberg aligns himself with the Nazis that his own ""Schindler's List"" abhorred....remember, the Nazis were the kings of patriotism and nationalism.  The most offensive aspect of this film, then, is its utter pretentiousness.  At least exploitation movies don't pretend to be anything but what they are.  This one, sadly, has delusions of grandeur (and although this criticism can't be levelled at the film itself, Spielberg's utterly arrogant acceptance of his Oscar for best director confirms all of my worst suspicions - compare it to his humble, tearful acceptance of the well-deserved Oscars for ""Schindler's List"").  Since no one around Mr. Spielberg seems to have the courage necessary to tell him when the emperor has no clothes on, the responsibility falls to the critics and audiences.  Let him know you're tired of his version of ""reality""."

","When this first came out, everyone jumped up and danced around about how good it was.  Critics said it was incredibly powerful and it redefinned the war movie.  They claimed it was nothing like those patriotic films right after world war two.  Nor was it like the many excellent films made during the 70s and 80s on Vietnam.  It was so different and so much better.  I completely disagree.  If anything, it is a throwback to all those Gung-Ho films like ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"".  It really makes one want to join the fight and help save Europe.  And it is quite funny.  Not only is there humour when they are marching around looking for Private Ryan (which is acceptable), but you also laugh when people are dying.  That shouldn't happen in a quality war movie. It can in an action movie on the other hand. Another thing, the ending is absolutely ridiculous, like that would happen. I must commend Spielberg for his excellent direction of the landings and the action sequences were staged well, but this is no great film."
"Doc-134","4","1","4","16 April 1999"," A War Movie That Adds Nothing to the War Genre
","One of the great things about seeing a film twice is that it allows you to go back and see the flaws that flew right on past you the first time you saw it. When I first viewed ""Saving Private Ryan"", I enjoyed the film, but at the time I didn't really think about why. I walked out of the screening not really thinking about the film at all. First bad sign! Later on, at home, I began to think about the impact that ""Saving Private Ryan"" had on me. I started to feel as though the film had no impact on me what so ever. Second bad sign! How could this be? How could a film acclaimed by so many as one of the best war films ever made, have no effect on me? So, in a couple of days, I went and watched it again and then everything became clear. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is Steven Spielberg through and through. When I first saw the film, I had thought that Spielberg had risen above the many poor works of his past, but I was dead wrong.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a master at pulling the wool over the eyes over his momentous audience. He made many of us feel that we really needed another epic WWII film, such as what he has created. He has done the same thing with other films such as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Amistad"". While I admire ""Schindler's List"" for its historical merits and its importance of topic, I hardly regard it as the high form of cinematic art that so many have claimed it to be. My opinion of ""Saving Private Ryan"" does not change too much from this.<br/><br/>The film does nothing to add to the war genre. Much of it is a regeneration of older, and much better war films. Not only this, ""Saving Private Ryan"" blatantly contradicts itself. The film is obviously meant to be perceived as an anti-war film. I suspect that Spielberg would not have filmed the opening battle scene in the manner he did, if it wasn't. No doubt, most people will see this as an anti-war film, but is it really? I think not. If a film is to be truly ant-war, then there can be no redeeming qualities of war. This means that war can not be seen as heroic or patriotic. How many times was there a flash of the American flag over the entirety to the screen? I can not remember, but if it was five, then it was five too many. There is an overwhelming question in the film. Was it really worth it to go to the trouble of saving Private Ryan (Matt Damon)? Of course, in light of the fact that the majority of the Hollywood audience is intolerant of ambiguity, they answer this question. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is to be seen as an American hero for the mission that he and his squad accomplished. This does not sound like anti-war to me. In great war films like ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"", there are no heroes that transpire from battle at the end. There are no redeeming qualities illustrated at all. In these films, war is depicted as ugly, inhumane, alienating, and just plain wrong.<br/><br/>The opening battle sequence which lasts for about 30 minutes is wonderful in its brutal realism and its leads us into thinking that we are about to experience a truly harrowing war picture. In fact, this is one of the best sequences that I have seen on film, and the movie is worth seeing just for the one scene. We, the audience really feel as if we are in the midst of this highly violent and bloody battle at Normandy.  The sound quality and the visuals are immaculate. The camera seems to take on a role of its own. It seems to be ducking behind objects to avoid being hit by bullets, just as the rest of the soldiers are. The entire scene is shot with the hand held camera, with jerky, and often disorienting movements, adding to the chaos of the battle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't as well made as this first scene. The battle scene near the end of the film feels like something out of an action movie. It has the same effect as an action sequence from one of the ""Die Hard"" movies in that it thrills us with its fast-paced shootouts and numerous explosions. I found myself not caring who was killed and who wasn't. It felt like cartoon violence. I enjoyed watching the sequence for this reason. It came no where close to having the same impact as the opening battle.<br/><br/>While I recommend seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the technical merit of the opening battle, problems continuously present themselves throughout the rest of the film. It contradicts its anti-war presence. The ending is summed up to nicely. Leaving the end more ambiguous would have been effective at least in terms of provoking thought. My strongest objection to the film is its sinking to the level of an action picture at the climax. This is not something that I wanted in a film of this scale. ""Saving Private Ryan"" leaps to a great start, but ends up not having the endurance to make it to the finish line as a winner. <br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"cofemug","4","1","4","7 April 1999"," Change after 30 minutes.
","I highly recommend seeing this movie at the theatres...then seeing another movie after the first thirty minutes is over.  The first thirty minutes was all of the balls that this movie had.  After the grisly scene, Spielberg castrates this movie.  The movie was too long for its own good.<br/><br/>First, the 20-second intro and finale.  These were the most emotional scenes of the whole movie.  They brought tears to my eyes, seeing all of the soldiers that died in the wars for this country.  That is what the crosses were, and it was in a national cemetary, probably Arlington.  These were two of the three most sad moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Second: the thirty-minute D-day battle.  This was the other emotional moment of the movie.  This is the only time that I disagree in that I thought that the movie was very realistic.  I was depressed by it, and saddened.  Especially when one soldier picks up his arm.  The use of sound, visuals, and effects were outstanding for this portion of the movie.  It depressed me.<br/><br/>Third: the rest of the movie.  It SUCKED.  I was bored to tears, that is why it is depressing.  I sat there, and sat there, and sat there waiting for something intellectual to come up and at least slap me.  No, I do not think that the dilemma of trying to rescue one soldier is intellectual, I think it is STUPID.  It did not show any realities, and I did not want to go along, and it just was pure crap.  This is very superficial, and I felt that I should have probably cared about the people, but I DID NOT.    This ruined the end of the movie because I was so bored, that I did not notice the violence all that much in the last scene, and was only a little moved by the crosses reappearing.<br/><br/>I give this movie a four because it did not try.  It is just as fluffy as ""Shakespeare In Love,"" which also did not deserve to win.  I must highly recommend ""The Thin Red Line"" because it makes you think for yourselves, instead of trying to force you to think ""THERE.  THIS IS BAD.  CRY.  BE HAPPY.  FEEL THIS.""  My response to these movies is ""I'm not stupid, don't insult me.  Let me make my own judgement.""  If you want oscar-calibur movies go see ""Elizabeth,"" or ""The Thin Red Line.""  Also, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is really good."

","Remember the heart-rending scene in ""Titanic"" where the mother is telling a story to her two doomed children in bed as the ship is going down? If Spielberg had made ""Titanic"", we would have been treated to the sight of the mother and children sucking in salt water and slowly drowning. And movie-goers would be saying, ""Well, that's the way it really was! Why pull punches?"" So in ""Saving Private Ryan"", we're subjected to people exploding and being decapitated as a substitute for real drama.<br/><br/>Spielberg personifies the philosophy, ""If you CAN show it, you MUST show it"". Show it he does - the violence, that is. But if you really want to get an idea of why these men were able to rise to heroic levels, or if you want to return to that time in our nation's history and meet those people, get to know and understand those people, this just ain't the movie.<br/><br/>But if you want an incredible amount of action (did any one soldier ever see so much action?) then this is the movie for you. Great special effects, almost all of which were put to use showing how bullets penetrate bodies and rip limbs off.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Go rent ""The Big Red One"", made in 1980. It communicates the horror of war by humanizing the participants. The closing scene showing the soldiers clearing out the remnants of a concentration camp is a miniature masterpiece. And not one person's head has to explode to get us to understand the violence perpetrated by men against men."

"vincentasmuth-869-109803","5","1","5","14 May 2015"," Awful and dated vs. great acting and characters
","I first watched this movie years ago on German television and later in English on DVD and my perception of it changed quite a bid. When I first watched it I was in a phase of looking for moral and bright heroes in movies. This movie has none and it utterly disgusted me. When I watched it again I saw something completely different. I give this movie a rating which is far off from the majority but there are quite a few reasons for it: 1. This is a war movie which wants to show the brutality and maybe(?) senselessness of war in an authentic way. The beginning scene is pretty good at that and is rightfully one of the most famous movie scenes of all times. After that the movie completely falls apart. The Germans just become puppets which can't harm the heroes neither from perfect positions nor with 10-1 odds. Its absurd and worse than any 50s war movie I have ever seen. Even John Rambo would laugh about this. I would call it racism but then again Spielberg made Schindler so I guess despite him hating Nazis (And rightfully so) he doesn't hate all Germans. 2. It really feels dated to me because of 1. Since then band of brothers and letters from Iwojima came out which are much better depictions of WWW and would deserve the rating this movie has. Things like the bullet going through the sniper vision are also extreme 90s cheese. 3. On the other hand the acting is still great from many of the actors. Tom Hanks just delivers. He is the cliché of the good man in a bad war being forced to do what he does but he really nails it. As cringeworthy as this cliché is I would say Hanks does it best. Very good. Dialogue is good and characters act believable in the boundaries of the movie. 4. Action is also pretty decent. If you like stuff blowing up its as good as it gets. 5. My main problem I had watching it the first time still holds up. The movie has insane moral values. The German prisoner they don't shoot is betraying his promise later on and gets killed for that. WTF? Its awful but whatever, he is only one of quite a few Germans they didn't have to kill but did. The enemy in this movie are really not treated like humans. This really is a weakness of the movie but I think most movie viewers don't even recognize that and that is a problem. Letters from Iwojima is so much better. Final thoughts: It really is the Fury of the 1990s but much better acted, with better dialogue and embarrassingly(for Fury) better effects. I still miss more modern stuff like portraying the enemy as humans and the vulnerability of everyone in the war. Ryan only has that in the beach scene although the Germans have no face their either."
"malcolmi","6","1","5","19 September 2009"," Years later, the propaganda emerges more clearly. . .
","I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" in a theatre in its first release, and still watch it five or six times a year, for all sorts of reasons. Eleven years later, I'm starting to know more clearly what I'd like to say about this important film.<br/><br/>First, the mastery of cinematic technique shown by Steven Spielberg and his entire production crew is still exciting, and moving to me. A viewer's sense of being on the Normandy beach, panic-stricken in the thick of the chaotic energy, has not been dissipated by ten years of other films' computer effects and three-second jump cuts. The randomness of events, on the beach and after, is a kind of nightmare in a ruined pastoral landscape, and clarifies each soldier's need to withdraw to a sense of what to do, right now, to stay alive - right up to the moment when the impulse to take care of a friend, or a child, overrules common sense and the discipline of self-preservation. <br/><br/>Second, though, I'm more saddened every year by the myopic focus on American myth-making which Mr Spielberg embraced. He's made a wholly self-centred film about D-Day, and a generation of moviegoers will never know from this movie that the British, Canadian, Australian, and other Allied troops were landing up and down the French coast at the same moment. The Canadians, in fact, advanced considerably farther inland than the Americans that day, under equally heavy fire. Tom Hank's character mentions British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery leading his troops toward Germany; Ted Danson's character says ""That guy's overrated!"" and Hanks's character says ""No argument from me."" That's the total mention of the Allied participation in the invasion, and Montgomery's stature in defeating the Germans in North Africa a year earlier is erased for a whole generation of film goers, even though his excellent leadership in North Africa earned him command of the British troops on June 6th. The omissions, and flip judgments reflect badly on the scriptwriter, and on Mr Spielberg. <br/><br/>Third, the halo of sanctity which this film bestows on the members of the special mission has become cloying. The soldiers of this film seem to me to justify an American myth of charming immaturity, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" dodges completely the documented ways in which American soldiers' unpreparedness during and after the invasion was an acknowledged problem during the last year of the war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge, when American troops collapsed in the face of the German attacks. <br/><br/>I'm realising that, for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" clashes seriously with the historical record, and that in this sense, it's a meretricious fantasy, however grippingly filmed. I'll still watch it, and feel the adrenaline flow on the beach, below the machine-gun nest, and in front of the bridge, but I won't subscribe to the myths."
"kyle-cruse","8","1","5","9 September 2008"," Excellent depiction, but not a perfect film
","I do not see a whole lot of war movies, but ""Saving Private Ryan"" is definitely an exception. This film simply has a fascinating plot and great dialogue between the soldiers. The film tells the story of a group of soldiers who must find private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and send him home to his mother, as she realizes that her three other sons were killed in battle. The rest of the film deals with issues such as deciding whether saving a man's life is worth losing several lives of your own soldiers and to what extent one must be loyal to their given orders. Tom Hanks could have (and probably should have) won an Oscar for his role, as he pulls off each scene amazingly well, as usual. The interactions between him and the soldiers, especially Private Ryan, are perfectly done, proof of Spielberg's excellent directing. What prevents the film from being entirely perfect is the overall lack of scenes with dialogue. So much of the film (at least 60%) is made up of battle scenes. Although the depictions of war are very realistic and well done, they tend to drag on too long. It's the dialogue scenes and the decisions the characters must make that make the film as great as it is, but more of those scenes are needed to keep the audience engaged. Nevertheless, an excellent depiction of war, great direction, and great acting make this a very monumental and interesting film. Definitely worthwhile and important to see.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"Baby_Seal_Clubber","3","1","5","18 July 2005"," Thoughts on the history
","This movie starts and ends with the American flag, this could be a sufficient analysis of the movie really. Its a quite(by Hollywood) well preserved myth that the ""D-day"" has got any real historical meaning. The Thousenths Americans and British that died on the shores of Normandy should of course be remembered. But historical facts should as well be remembered. Spielberg wants to show us how USA fought for freedom against fascist Germany failing to even mention the victories of the soviet-union on the easter front in Stalingrad (a victory that by the way cost about 20 million Russian deaths since they were fighting the majority of the German troops). <br/><br/>A movie about the history is never about the history. Its about the present day. During the making of this film American airplanes where bombing civilians in Jugoslavia. Of course they appointed Milosevic to be ""the new Hitler"" before it all started. A little propaganda is never wrong. Take a good look on the movies about the world war(s) since the 40:s. There is a very distinguished change from time to time. Very much depending on what roll USA wishes to take in the world. Notice as well that there are no black people in the picture. This is because it was forbidden for blacks and whites to be in the same plutone(excuse my spelling) until the 60:s(When they needed black cannon fodder in Vietnam). Thats a could way to fight fascism."
"TxMike","Null","1","5","7 September 1999"," Not only action-packed war movie, it has a very nice personal story.
","The whole movie is the quest for one particular soldier, and the mission to bring him home safely.  The invasion at Normandy begins the movie.  The opening is very hard to watch, not only because of the very graphic violence and mutilation of war, but also the memory of all those who gave up their lives. Once you get past that scene-setting episode, the rest of the movie is much more pleasant to watch.  Tom Hanks, as always, if fine in his role, as are all the supporting roles.  But, who was the last person to see a poorly-done Spielberg film? You owe it to yourself to see Private Ryan, if for no other reason but to remember the ugliness of war."

","The majority of the reviews on here are positive, the overall rating is even 8.5, I don't understand why though.. This movie was a complete waste of time and a complete snooze fest, plot has absolutely no point to it whatsoever, like I get the point of the movie was saving one life should always be important, but they absolutely killed that point and it ended up just being a pointless venture. Another thing is their horrible display of actual history and German people was just awful and not accurate to anything that actually happened, the movie Dead Snow is more accurate to the war than this horrid film, and that's saying something. Tom Hanks and that other guy I can't remember the name of can't save this film from being just a complete waste of time and just plain awful."

","I guess you must have to be an American to really get and love this movie because it's about American soldiers acting typically super-heroic and everything.<br/><br/>The entire movie is based on a platoon of guys who get sent into the deep and dangerous territory behind enemy lines to save the Private Ryan of the title of the film.<br/><br/>Apparently all his brothers have all been killed in the war so the government doesn't want their mother to lose her last son because it would be a huge public relations catastrophe so they send in a group of guys and risk a bunch of lives just to try to get this one specific soldier out.<br/><br/>I liked some of the combat scenes but mostly I was just bored and thought they were too obviously and deliberately trying to pull at heart strings and wave the U.S. flag around."
"JosephLee411","Null","1","6","11 August 2007"," This is such a great movie.
","Starring: Tom Hanks as Captain John H. Miller Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Michael Horvath Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade Jeremy Davies as Corporal Timothy E. Upham Matt Damon as Private James Francis Ryan<br/><br/>Plot: A squadron of troops is told to search for Private James Ryan, the last of four brothers who have all been killed in Normandy. They face numerous odds on the battlefield to find Ryan and get him home.<br/><br/>I knew this movie was critically hailed when I first watched it, but surprisingly I had no real interest in war movies at the time. Sure, it may sound odd but war is depressing, and to watch a movie based on real people getting killed doesn't equal a good time for me. But Spielberg is an excellent filmmaker and the cast is superb, so I finally say down and gave this one a try.<br/><br/>Wow. What a drama this was. It goes to show everyone that war is hell. And if you don't believe that statement, watch the first half-hour, which has been commended for it's graphic, gory realism. You leave that first scene feeling pretty worn out, and then you realize that was just the beginning. That's what Spielberg was going for. He wanted you to know that war is rough for the soldiers. He went for a gritty feel that didn't glorify war like some movies, but presented it in it's destructive glory. He even lowered the colors so as to make it feel gray and bleak. That is a great director for you.<br/><br/>Direction is fine, but if the cast isn't ready to make you care about who gets blown up, then you probably won't. A great cast was selected here. It was mostly Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and everyone else, because they either were new, or had normally played bit parts. Vin Diesel was unknown at the time. But everyone, including Diesel(I know, I'm surprised too) brings it here. They deliver as an ensemble. You feel that they're a bunch of guys thrown together in this platoon, and they really don't like the mission they are on. It's a great job to everyone involved. You get the younger guys showing what they can do, the veterans(Burns, Sizemore) holding everything down and the main stars doing what they do best.<br/><br/>The special effects and score, once again need to get praised. That opening scene would not have been as effective without the gore effects. It's one thing to have guys fall over and acknowledge their dead. It's another to show it in bloody detail. This movie uses gore to it's advantage, and not just as a throw-away device. While other movies are surely guilty of this, this movie is not. Nothing much else needs to be said about John Williams' work on Spielberg films but the score is kind of low-key and haunting here, unlike other previous ones.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan introduced me into the world of war-related film. It was enough to make me have tremendous respect for the genre. It's one of my favorite films and I can't recommend it enough. That's why it gets the rating I gave it. Go see this if you haven't, and be prepared to blown away, although not in the literal sense.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** of *****"
"qormi","8","1","6","3 August 2007"," riveting
","Compared to other WWII movies I've seen, this one stands out. The opening battle of Omaha Beach was intense. It made me feel like I'd been there. The closing battle was also frighteningly realistic. The scene where the platoon's respite is interrupted by the rumbling of tanks was white-knuckle scary. It wasn't entirely free from clichés. The scene where Ryan's mother is told about the news of her sons' deaths was sad, but....a farm in the heartland? It would have been more powerful if she lived on a city block in New York or San Francisco. I didn't like the scene where Matt Damon's character is clutching his ankles and rocking while crying in the midst of battle. I don't think many GI's would do that. It was also far-fetched and inexplicable why the Nazi soldier would descend a staircase and pass a cowering GI with nine yards of machine gun bullets draped over his shoulder without killing him in he midst of a desperate battle. Still, the movie was a triumph."
"DesiBaba","4","1","6","18 January 2000"," Overrated movie. Catch it on TV next year.
","I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was a poorly made movie. There were few parts here and there which were truly touching and realistic, but otherwise I did not enjoy the movie. Spielberg said he made this movie as a tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives, he failed to deliver on that tribute. For the great sacrifice we made for the freedom, this was a half-hearted tribute. Tom Hanks fails to deliver as a captain, he is Tom Hanks all through the movie, not Capt. John Miller. Tom Siezemore and Edward Burns steal the show. Matt Damon had very small role, I don't understand why would he worship just John Miller and not others ? Does not make sense(except Dir wanted to add some emotion that was not build up). I mean the two hardly knew each other, just like the other soldiers.<br/><br/>Also, it was insulting to see soldiers hang out like a bunch of high-school drop outs calling each other ""morons"" and so on. Did that sort of thing happen back in 1944 ? I don't know for sure but it surely does not fit into the scheme of things...<br/><br/>May be I had too high an expectation from the movie, in any case I would give it ** out of *****. No Oscar for Spielberg. Supporting Actor Oscar for Tom Siezemore or Edward Burns or even the frightened kid would be good nominations."
"VerbalKint-2","9","1","7","4 November 1999"," This is the most emotive - and best - war movie ever made.
","I don't normally speak in superlatives, but I honestly have never been more affected by a film than I was with Saving Private Ryan. I was near tears 5 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>As the ramps on the landers dropped and wave after wave of Allied troops were immediately cut down by German machine-gunners, I sat in horrified silence. A single tear rolled down my cheek. That tear was followed by a dozen others. And as the terror continued in front of my unblinking eyes, those dozen were joined by two dozen more. I now understood - or at least had a better understanding of - why I never want to be involved in a war.<br/><br/>Spielberg's re-enactment of D-Day at Omaha Beach stands as one of the single-most brilliant pieces of film ever shot. It also shows cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn to be two of the most inventive minds in their respective fields. Kaminski's shaky, newsreel-style hand-held photography and point-of-view shots and his willingness to use varying quality film stocks, over and under-expose shots and play with film speeds provide the opening battle with a total lack of visual continuity which fits in perfectly with the confusion Spielberg wanted to create. And Kahn's editing progressed the film through that confusion, making a story out of a mess of body parts and beautifully showing the push from the water to the ridge. His brilliant work on Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) temporary deafness moments alone must have taken days, if not weeks.<br/><br/>For proof of the Normandy scene's authenticity, ask the veterans. Many sent Spielberg kudos (check the Trivia link for this movie), and many are known to have suffered horrible flashbacks after seeing this film. That's proof enough for me.<br/><br/>Oh yeah...the rest of the movie was pretty damn good as well. I still wonder how this film ever lost the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare In Love, which will be forgotten in 2 years (if it hasn't been forgotten already).<br/><br/>One final note: All those who complained about the mistaken identity of the old man in the opening scene, you were not being tricked into thinking he was Captain Miller (Tom Hanks). If you were being tricked, Spielberg would've had a shot of Captain Miller's eyes immediately following the extreme close-up of the old man's eyes. Instead, we see the beach, then a couple of shots of the landing craft making their way toward said beach. Wake up, people...this was not meant to fool you. You fooled yourselves.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10, the half mark lost for the lack of representation of other Allied nations (U.K. and Canada, especially) on D-Day, and for Ted Danson."

","Some actions feel forceful and I would have rather had the preparations in England shown on film rather than the final epic tank battle; perhaps the trickery used such as the inflatable tanks and boats to confuse Germans. Nevertheless there were references to England so that should suit Hollywood absolutely fine. I had a re-watch yesterday and half saw the predictability, things such as the Translator who isn't a fighter survives and everyone else dies. If that's what you mean by predictability then I totally agree. I dislike the ""Opening"" and the ""ending"" as it doesn't really function for me, like you i'd rather have the attention to detail and the film time on the Omaha Landings rather than the whole saving and the tanks near the bridge. I'm right in believing that some people have completely disregarded the prologue despite the grand scale of it. That's why it isn't my favourite war film simply because it becomes too Hollywood at some points. On the contrary the realism throughout the movie is perfect; but that's not the best way to go around conveying a message about war or demonstrating the consequences of it. E.g. Dunkirk and Das Boot, it's a war film, there are explosions obviously but no heroics and nor an entire sequence that should have been explored in more depth if one has paid to go and see a War movie. In conclusion it does its job, made money and was realistic. Spielberg is practically the 'King' of Blockbusters, created the summer Blockbuster with Jaws and then trumped it many years later with one of the greatest Hollywood Blockbusters of all time; Jurassic Park. Hands down saving private ryan is an incredible film, but the opening and ending feel like they open and close, twice in a movie; strange choice from Spielberg. And Jackson of course, perhaps my favorite character simply because of the sniping, well he dies. I don't find it more predictable every time I watch, I find it more frustrating!"

Similar to Saving Private Ryan the mission was not the war but the man or delivering something or someone.

The weapons, tactics, and verbiage used is all era appropriate and painstakingly accurate in terms of movie continuity plus the practical effects creat an extremely horrifying experience but this is where the film becomes pro-American with each American death very gory, and portrayed as painful/ suffering while German deaths have zero blood or gore and die with one shot kills or insta kills making a person feel more empathy for a suffering American as opposed to a silent faceless German taking a bullet and dying quick with no pain shown on screen. This creates biased feeling which a historical war movie should avoid, in MY opinion.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is spot on for just being a damn good movie that evokes strong feelings of national pride knowing that men in similar situations risked their lives for freedom and to fight against tyranny.<br/><br/>The camera work is simply untouchable and can withstand any criticism. If anything the camera work should be applauded for its use of shakey cam for its combat sequences.<br/><br/>This movie is more than just a movie, it is the DEFINING war movie of all time despite having biases.<br/><br/>Tom hanks says at the end of the movie ""you've earned it"" and that's how I feel for the awards and accolades this movie has received.<br/><br/>Thanks to all of our service men."

","I remember this was the first movie that i could go see with driving my own car. And i was really hit hard right when walking out of the cinema, as if i got a bit of shellshock from all the fighting.
Yes war is hell and cruel, BUT not each GI was a hero and not every German soldier was an evil nazi monster. must be hard to imagine for Americans that they were just our fathers and grandfathers, most of them conscripted and forced to serve. yet without the option to sit out war in a jail cell. if they refused, they and their families were targets for the Gestapo and to be court martialed or even shot at the spot.
so as my headline says, this movie could have been great, but the extreme one dimensional display of good and bad completely ruined it for me, add the horrifying stabbing scene and thats it for me then.<br/><br/>IF you want to watch a piece of history that has everything this movie could have, but chose not to portray for propaganda purpose, go watch Band of Brothers."

The decisions they made were also well thought out. It is a very serious film without humor.<br/><br/>The script was great because I think the right things were said at the right time. At a certain moment in the movie the captain was hit and he shot with a pistol at a Tiger with one of the bullets it looked like he was detonating the Tiger and everyone thought it was a funny scene.<br/><br/>All the costumes were very well made and fit in well with those times, you don't get the feeling that it was staged.<br/><br/>The set design was cool because it really looked like it was on the battlefield or by the bridge at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There was no background music, I thought that was a good choice, which in my opinion gives even more effect.<br/><br/>In general, I think it's a very good film that really leaves you thinking about the war"

","I remember watching this movie in theaters with my older brothers, I was just 16 years old. I was shocked, scared, and traumatized of the strong opening scene. Spielberg captures the harsh reality of war from begging to end, with the strong sense of patriotism, but with characters that show us that even war can brake the strongest men will when seeing those brothers of arms that we developed closed relationship can be gone in a matter of seconds. The story takes place in the European theater of War. A squad is tasked to recover Pvt.

As a former soldier and medic, the beach landings could not have been more authentic. Hanks drive to wipe out the German radar site, though, was not well done ... because as an 8-man unit tasked with the Ryan mission you would have by-passed that site and continued looking for Ryan.

"julianbogdanov","10","0","1","17 January 2019"," The Movie that Gives Us an Insight to the Brutality of War.
","Saving Private Ryan is a fictional film but has many aspects that are historically correct. The most impactful moments of this movie is the composition, scenery, acting, and direction. Saving Private Ryan is not only a good war movie, it's the best war movie created due to the composition, scenery, acting, and direction. Steven Spielberg's direction in this film is mind blowing as he uses many different aspects of point of view to change how the viewer feels during the movie.
Throughout the movie, 2 brothers are killed on the beach, another one killed somewhere else in the world. The mother of these boys is to receive all three telegrams the same day. Captain John Miller is to take a squadron and save the last Ryan brother and return him to his mother back in the US. The fact they travel for town to town looking for him and always encountering a problem is what war is about. You can't plan for everything, they get caught off guard many times and experience losses. The story is set to give a feeling of no rest. During the film, you can never relax. It is always set to make you feel nervous and worried. This film does an excellent job of showing the true harshness of war and it doesn't hold back on any aspect of just how brutal and terrifying war can be.
The soldiers in this squadron showed great courage and bravery at many points in the film ranging from the beach to the towns occupied by Germans. Many small things in the film mean a lot more once you finish the film. Understanding certain scenes takes a lot more effort to really see what its about. For example, the scene where the soldiers are counting dog tags in front of another group of soldiers walking by. First seeing this scene might not make you think about much, but as soon as Wade says, ""What the hell are you doing? The whole god damn airborne is watching."" Here you can clearly see how Wade notices all these soldiers walking by are seeing the squadron counting dog tags of dead men. There is at least hundreds of dog tags in the pile as well which shows how much this impacted the soldiers as they walked by. Several scenes can impact the viewer in many ways such as when they land on the beach and lots of men are slaughtered as soon as the doors open. It's a very tragic sight to see, but it alters everyone who sees the movie. Also seeing how buildings have been destroyed in the small towns kind of gives you a perspective on how brutal war can be and how innocent lives are impacted by bombs, gunfire, and tanks. Buildings are decimated to the ground and are nothing but rubble in some of the towns.
Moving onto some of the acting, Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor in this film and he has done many movies before with similar roles. In this film, he is a captain of his squadron and plays it off very well. In this film, he seems nervous at many points and does an excellent job of showing this. He has had to act this way before in the movie Captain Phillips. As he was captured in that film, he had to act scared, worried, and shocked at many points. In this movie he is able to accomplish the same task. There are several other famous actors in this film who perform very well such as Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, and Giovanni Ribisi. They all have very important roles in the film and do a fantastic job with it. Their roles range from soldiers to a Medic to Private Ryan.
The only minor flaw I can seem to find in this film is how the viewers can never relax during the film. It always an ambush, or a battle, or a rescue mission the whole time. When the fighting starts, it doesn't seem to end. This could be viewed as a good or bad thing in certain viewer's eyes. Some people might love the action, while others want to have some more back story before a battle commences.
A big theme we see in this movie is sacrifice. Many things are sacrificed to save Private Ryan ranging from soldiers lives, to the extremely dangerous task the soldiers undertake of doing, and to the soldiers who are going deep into German territory. These men sacrifice a regular war to them going behind enemy lines to recover a man they have never met before.
Finally, this film is one of the greatest war movies of all time due to the composition, scenery, acting, and direction. Everything about this film is perfect, which is why the ratings speak for themselves. I find very few people who dislike this movie. For those who think Spielberg had messed up on this film is nowhere close to what the rest of the world thinks. The ratings are extremely high for critic and audience reviews and there is a reason for that."

Hanks carries the film and while Ribisi, Sizemore and Damon's characters are good, many others are not. In particular Jeremy Davies's character Corporal Upham, downright awful. Not only that but action sequences lost to this character's perspective, hindering the film. The action sequences not containing Upham are of quality and the opening and ending moments of elderly Ryan are heartfelt, faltering in the in-between moments.<br/><br/>The scene with the three medics including Ribisi surrounding a wounded soldier's just hilarious. The idea of three men attending to one man who's wounded and not fighting's ludicrous, but then for the wounded guy to get shot more while they're attending to him cracks me up.

"stevenrotherforth","10","0","1","19 October 2017"," I honestly can say I wanted to hug the nearest veteran and say thank you
","Saving Private Ryan <br/><br/>Perhaps Saving Private Ryan's greatest compliment comes from the extraordinary individuals who were actually there on D Day. Many documentaries and articles since the films release tell of the veterans who praise the film for its realism. The praise may not be always positive if that is possible. The film brought back memories for those of the hell that they carry around with them everyday.<br/><br/>One conclusion can be made is that Spielberg crafted a war movie the likes the world had never seen before. The opening thirty minutes of this film are probably the most effective that I have ever witnessed. As a college student at the time of this movies release I wasn't prepared for the audiovisual onslaught that I was about to experience. Naively I believed that I was off to see another gung-ho war movie like the ones Stallone and Arnie regularly churned out. Boy did I get educated that day! I went into the screening with an immature view on the world and left with a deep appreciation for the men and women who gave their lives so I can enjoy the freedoms I take for granted. I honestly can say I wanted to hug the nearest veteran and thank them. Thank them for the world we are able to enjoy today.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan tells the story of a group of men, soldiers who risk their collective lives to save just one. Private James Ryan played by Matt Damon. A young man who has just lost his brothers to the war that surrounds him. The mission is simple. Get him home. No mother should have to lose three sons. The story reminds us of the importance of a single life and our duty to do something with it while we have the chance. Spielberg's film is wonderfully crafted. If it looks impressive it sounds even more so. The immersive experience was new at the time of release. Never had surround sound been so effective. Every bullet, every grain of dirt could be heard and almost felt. If the films production values are stellar then the performances by the cast outshines. Every single performance is Oscar worthy. Especially lead actor Tom Hanks who has never been better. The range he displayed here was exceptional. Both physically and emotionally, Hanks pours everything into the role of Captain Miller. He's no war machine. He's not built for war like the fictional characters of Rambo and Arnie's Commando. He's an ordinary man. A man molded by war. Adapted by it so he can survive and return home to his wife. One of the movies intriguing plot points is the fact that Millers brothers in arms have no clue to his occupation back in the world before war. A reminder to us all that the world was made a better place by real people, not superheroes or fictional one man war machines. Saving Ryan may be a piece of fiction but it is founded on true events. Events that changed the way our world turns. No number of school lectures could have educated me more on the reality of war than the first thirty minutes of this film..."

No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up.

","The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.<br/><br/>And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian. My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?<br/><br/>So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D- Day itself.<br/><br/>Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend."

"The-Sarkologist","4","0","3","23 November 2013"," Depicts the horror and the violence of war
","When most people talk about this movie they usually refer to the violence. The extent of the violence portrayed at the beginning of the movie was enough to attract an R rating, though this was lowered to an MA rating because of the purpose of the violence. When I spoke to people about it they seem to dwell upon this point and even talked about the images that went through their minds when they went to sleep and woke up. The image that went through my mind was that of the soldiers under water getting struck by the bullets.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the landing at Normandy and graphically shows the horror of this beachhead. This part of the movie I thought was the best part because it really draws out the horror, futility, and waste of war. People were getting healed only to be shot and the bloodbath was intense. The impact of this scene was even greater when three brothers, in three different locations, are killed and their mother is due to receive notice of their death on the same day. Thus the decision is made that they must travel into France and rescue Private Joe Ryan, a paratrooper who was misdropped.<br/><br/>The major theme in this movie is the horror of war and this is picked up at the beginning and the whole goal. Mother Ryan is devastated because three of her son's are dead and thus the US army chooses to rescue the forth son because the war has had a great impact on her already and they decide that they need to comfort her by returning to her her only son.<br/><br/>Yet there is a purpose behind this war, and even though we look at the immense waste, especially in the beginning, we are reminded through the rest of the movie that the cause they are fighting for is just. They are fighting an oppressive power that intends to enslave the world and as such they are fighting for a noble cause. Even though the cause may be noble, we are reminded that this war brought about an immense waste of life.<br/><br/>The violence was graphic at the beginning but as the movie draws near to the end the violence becomes more glorified. The scene that comes to mind is when the soldiers on the tank are shot to pieces with the chaingun. This scene, though graphic and probably realistic, is still, to me, glorified.<br/><br/>Purpose is another theme in this movie. The purpose of the mission is to rescue one young man, and throughout the mission they are complaining that they are not helping the war progress. Tom Hanks talks about how when he loses a man he thinks of the thousands of lives that he has saved, but there is an ominous feeling that there is no point to this mission but to save a pathetic little kid; thus it is ironic that when they do find Private Ryan, he refuses to leave his post because they hold one of the only two bridges that Rommel can bring his tanks across to repel the Allied landings.<br/><br/>Salvation is another theme that runs through this movie. Unfortunately it is salvation by works. When Ryan is saved, Hanks says to him, ""earn it,"" suggesting that he must now pay back in good deeds for what Hanks has done for him. Then fifty years later he asks his wife (in front of a large family) if he has been good, to which his wife replies, ""Yes"". This I feel is quite irritating because it suggests that we can earn our salvation, which is not possible. Paying back bad deeds with good is like paying off a loan with a credit card, it simply gets you nowhere. Our sin is so bad and twisted that there is no way we can earn our way into God's good books. Instead we must rely upon what he has done for us, and that is punished his son Jesus instead of us and by trusting this we will be forgiven for what we have done.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan, I think, has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it falls down in a number of places. I found that the end was very disappointing especially when it seemed to be building up to some very thought provoking ends. Steven Spielburg has the potential to make to earth shattering movies, but he seems to always fall back onto Hollywood sensationalism.<br/><br/>(The low rating was on the principle that it won too many Oscars, taking them away from movies that really deserved them.)"
"searchanddestroy-1","Null","0","1","7 November 2013"," A turn in the war movie history, but...
","Yes, this is a great war film, and, as I have already said before, again and again, there will be a BEFORE and AFTER SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, speaking of visual grammar, hard boiled and realistic at the most battle sequences. Any movie made after this feature, any movie around the world: Russian, Korean, British, any movie was inspired by this one. But besides this side PRIVATE RYAN remains very classical in the meaning. You find here the good US soldiers vs the ugly German ones. OK, US troopers saved us, the french, but in war there is not good soldiers and evil ones. The scheme is more complex. I prefer the TV show made several years after PRIVATE RYAN: BAND OF BROTHERS, more accurate in the meaning, where we watch for instance GI's shooting German soldiers who surrender. In PRIVATE RYAN, we don't see this, as far as I remember. Even just after the ""meat chopper"" Utah Beach landing, when only one percent of US troopers reached the ""beach hotel"", I don't remember a sequence where those same soldiers shoot German ones who surrender. And this actually happened. Anyone who survived the Omaha Beach hell would have done the same. And me first!!<br/><br/>Althoug some days after, in the middle of the woodland fights, in the deep Normandy countryside, the same scene would not have been less understandable. In resume, PRIVATE RYAN remains a great film, but I prefer THE VICTORS, a very different movie, yes. But that's the way it is."

","Saving Private Ryan is a film best appreciated by the action scene enthusiast. Flawless detail and fantastic direction- particularly in the notorious opening scene- combine to reach a superb portrayal of World War 2's Normandy landing. Normally, I wouldn't enthuse with action scenes, but in this film they are as simultaneously delicate and brutal as an audience could wish for.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is one dimensional. There is no real storyline. It would not be a spoiler to summarise the plot as; 'boy's brothers die, men go to find him' because that the entire progression of a 3 hour film. Without the acting of Tom Hanks, who just about propels the plot into something worthwhile. But even after Mr Hanks, you are left at the end with the feeling that you have missed a none existent development in a film that could do with one.<br/><br/>Not the film of a motion picture aficionado. Yet a film not to be missed, despite its limitations."

","The production of this movie is epic. It's hard to believe that it was made on 70 million dollars, but that was 15 years ago. <br/><br/>The story is unusual in that US military goes out of its way to extricate a certain private Ryan from the battle field at any cost because his family has lost 3 brothers to war already. It sends in a squad of infantry men into Normandy to find and save private Ryan. <br/><br/>While the intent is noble, the wisdom doesn't make much sense. If Ryan dies, that's only one man, but the entire squadron is under danger of losing their lives in the attempt.<br/><br/>This movie could have been 30 - 60 minutes shorter, and would have been better focused. <br/><br/>Some of the battle ground scenes are the most realistic ever caught on film.<br/><br/>The movie leaves you feeling somewhat empty because of the foolish nature of the war, and a human drama that at its core doesn't make much sense. Like in lifeguard course we learn that if the rescue is too dangerous, it's OK to abandon rescue because one dead person is better than a two dead people. The military's decision in this movie totally goes against this wisdom.<br/><br/>You be the judge of the outcome."

Now my number one problem was the amount of gore. Im fairly strong stomached when it come to violence in movies but this was confronting to say the least. I think that if the movie had what we Australians call M15+ it would have been a much better movie.

","Saving Private Ryan: a monument of a film to the most egregious miss-planning of the second world war by a stupid military leadership who put thousands of men on a hot-beach without any air support or destroyer big-guns covering the landing - Monty/Eisenhower should have been horse whipped for this atrocity!<br/><br/>Of course Spielberg panders to this memorial-to-democracy and shows the beach scene in all its horror - the bloody waves particularly jarring. After the actual reenactment, Spielberg strolls into a fiction where a troop led by Hanks seeks out Private Ryan (parachuted behind German lines and now lost) to return him to his Mom, as his 3 brothers have been recently killed in other theater Allied errors. 'Lets not leave Mom bereft of sons' the word from the highest admin. officer in the Allied force. As an aside, my Grandmother lost all six of her brothers in the First World War, and her only two sons in WW2 with nothing more that a series of belated condolence letters from the DOD.<br/><br/>So, off goes 'Captain' Hanks and his motley crew on their 'highest-echelon priority' army mission - two separate incidents along the way diminish the unit by the time they catch up with 'Private' Ryan (Damon), who in no uncertain terms tells Hanks he has his-mission and will stay with his unit and defend a bridge! In the proper-Army, at this point the Captain would have clapped Ryan in irons for insubordination and returned him unceremoniously to the brig for court marshal - Spielberg permits 'none of this' as Hanks and his, now hapless, unit must face a couple of German Tiger tanks and 15 German foot soldiers equipped with serious hardware - our hero's defend with: machine gun, rifles (a pretty good sniper), sidearms and the makings of 'sticky bombs' - socks filled with explosives and covered with 'convenient' axle grease, so they will 'stick' to tank Armour. (The guys are now fighting sock-less, duh!) The battle commences - as furious as the beach scenes - and all in Hanks unit are killed. Ryan survives without a scratch, of course! Hanks the last to die (down to a sidearm now) as an Allied fighter drops a precision-bomb on the remaining tank that made it to the bridge - directly onto its turret, disabling it.<br/><br/>Truly beyond-belief: precision bombing from WW2 fighters is utter nonsense, and where were these guys during the 'landing on the beach?'; why was Ryan not promptly removed from theater? i.e. why was US Army discipline a turkey shoot after the beach landing? <br/><br/>Then, of course, we are treated to a return to the opening - a decrepit old man (Ryan now, we understand, we thought it was a geriatric Hanks at the beginning?) in a military graveyard (San Diego Pacific overlook, I think?) -- the surest testament to the stupidity of War -- looking for Hank's grave. Ryan asks his wife '... if he was a good man'? Clearly, this miscreant should have been hung or shot back in '44!<br/><br/>Production Notes: <br/><br/>Score inspired by the opening: ""Fanfare for the Common Man"", Aaron Copland which of course quickly descended into John Williams patented nonsense, yet again.<br/><br/>Spielberg, wooden and pandering for cheap emotion as always, other than the action scenes which were probably 'actioned' by Spielberg's tasking of the 10 assistant directors on the piece. <br/><br/>The beach scene (reality, it happened of course) pointless beyond belief and an embarrassment to mankind - what military leader would put men onto a hot-beach without air support or 10"" guns blazing from warships offshore? A monumental blunder! Spielberg has Hanks report on the 35 of his men killed after we have see every one hit, egregious! Surround Foley outstanding, as expected.<br/><br/>Character assassinations: excellent performance from Tom Sizemore (disciplined, got his Blackhawk Down chops here) and Barry Pepper* (sniper); Hanks quite adequate as Captain, but predictably too democratic to survive; Adam Goldberg (first guy to break down) should have been spared from doing the 'Juden' thing to German POW's; Giovanni Ribisi underused as was Paul Giammati & Dennis Farina; Jeremy Davies' character, the last guy you would want around; Ed Burns superfluous, as was Ted Danson; Vin Diesel a joke to his end.<br/><br/>* this role cribbed from Sniper: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108171/ but Pepper's role a template for 'Enemy at the Gates': http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215750/ the grisly dueling-snipers flick.<br/><br/>After a film like this is released to such accolades (sic), why would family-men be put in harms-way ever again?

To me, it was WAY too in your face about it's anti-war message, it's like it was shoved down your throat and most of the movie leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. The violence, however realistic, is gratuitous and for me personally, takes away from the message of the movie. The premise and execution is also to me nothing special, it's everyone's vision of an 'American War Tragedy', it brings nothing special or eloquent to the table for me either. I feel that Hollywood only seems to know how to communicate messages by going way over the top, it's like they don't seem to appreciate the value of subtly or think people can't comprehend the message unless you have a 20 minute scene of soldiers being blown to bits. You don't have to hit someone with a sledgehammer to get their attention, and if that's the audience you are going for then it doesn't speak well of the intellectual value of the movie in the first place. I feel like the masses that will go on and on about how great this movie is are the people who only frequent the usual blockbusters and don't have especially high expectations in the first place.

But if not -and that is my case, I have to admit- you will most likely find it boring and too long. The first thirty minutes of the movie are just a huge display of special effects showing the development of one of the most important battles during the II WW. Yes, it is very well-made but this half an hour doesn't add anything at all to the movie. I am still wondering what is the goal of so much time devoted to that battle- I think the best answer is: an excuse for displaying all the special effects. Once those minutes had finished, I hoped the rest of the movie would be something different, and it looked like that was going to happen, but not for a lot of time. When something interesting was finally going on and there were some interesting dialogs, once again the same: more shooting, more noise and more deaths... Anyway, my vote was a 7: apart from all those long unnecessary scenes, the movie is quite good: some interesting dialogs, as I said, an interesting plot and, above all, some great performances, especially from Tom Hanks."

Then, after living an apparently good life(surrounded as he is by loving family members), not even the title character can justify those sacrifices on his behalf. As for the typist--is everyone insane or just daft? He shoots the German to cover up his cowardice, NOT because he finds his inner Rambo.<br/><br/>Deep? Maybe for a mud puddle.

","Okay, I think there might be something wrong with me, because I'm the only one who seems not to like this movie. But I have my reasons.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie seems a bit contradictory in its message. Is it supposed to be antiwar, or are we supposed to be cheering at the gore? Speaking of gore, they wasted it all in the first battle of the film, which is also the first scene after the prologue scene. No good storyteller does that. Since the most graphic images were at the beginning, most everything else seemed tame in comparison.<br/><br/>Secondly, this really isn't Spielberg's best film at all. It moves very slowly and is full of scenes that try to build characterization but somehow manage to seem sappy. I'll give him and the screenwriter credit for trying, however.<br/><br/>Also, this is possibly John Williams' worst movie score ever. The music is the kind you can find in any war movie--it's sort of cheesy and not at all amazing like many of his other works.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie simply does not move. Maybe it was just me, but it didn't evoke much of an emotional reaction out of me, and I'm normally quite an emotional moviegoer.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks did a very good acting job, and the others did okay.

It really does. I didn't connect on a personal level with any of these major characters. Maybe I wasn't supposed to. Maybe these characters were supposed to be just a metaphor for average joes from all over the USA. You have the Jewish guy, the hick who prays before he shoots, the tough-talking guy from Brooklyn, and the ambiguously ethnic guy (Vin Diesel) to name but a few.

They were truly exciting. At times I expected AHNOLD or someone to join in the fray. This action was compelling, but I think it robbed from the dramatic angle somewhat. The battle to take that bridge at the end was outstanding.<br/><br/>This is a very good film to be sure, and it pays a fine tribute to the Americans who died in WWII. If nothing else, it's a hell of a lot better than The Thin Red Line. That film is AWFUL. It is an insult to those like my grandfather who served in the Pacific.

","The only good thing about this film is the realistic depiction of the landing. Even that, though, comes off as patchy and episodic; you aren't really left with a good sense of what happened. When you consider Cornelius Ryan's book about D-Day, this is the polar opposite: there are no details. One minute you see people being blown up and floating in the water, then people getting their guts blown out on the beach, then the tanks are moving inland.<br/><br/>Actually, to me, this film continues to have a core strength that is very interesting very far into the film. When I saw it, I was realizing that the ending was coming and I didn't hate it yet, and was frankly amazed. But then, all the cheese I expected of the Spielberg/Hanks combo came out with a vengeance in the finale. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a hackneyed stooge. He's lucky that he came up at the same time that the movies were turning into titilation machines. He'd have starved in the '40s. Five minutes of Orson Welles' worst film make his career look like a joke."

","This movie drags and drags and drags and drags. It is too much about the war and the people and does not have enough action in it. I almost fell asleep. In Behind Enemy Lines, Owen Wilson's character is funny and he shoots stuff and the special effects are outstanding. This movie is sort of dark at times on the screen and its hard to see sometimes. The beginning part was too bloody and I don't think that the is appropriate for some people because it grossed me out. Tom Hanks isn't very good in this movie, he seems like he doesn't even care about the movie. I would of cast Owen Wilson in the lead role, and if not, I would of tried to get Dennis Quaid. This movie was dissapointing and boring. See Behind Enemy Lines instead."

Before it lost Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love?<br/><br/>Most people, I think, don't.  So much praise was heaped on this film on its initial release and so much outrage was expressed when it was passed over in favor of Shakespeare in Love, it's hard to enter this movie ""clean"" and with a fresh mind.  It always surprises me when a fellow movie buff calls Ryan ""overrated"", and I can't help but think that they're judging this movie on its reputation rather than its quality.<br/><br/>Yet watch Saving Private Ryan without the critical baggage: this is truly a great film.  The much-discussed, stunning opening- and it is stunning- is followed by a war narrative that's every bit as good as Schindler's List. Anyone with a soul should have a powerful response to this movie, and positive or negative, there is little denying it is a testament to the profundity of cinema."

And I have, at least, as much love for real movies as anyone here or anywhere else. And when I watch something that affects me like this, then it's a real movie. I saw this film twice in theaters and each time I missed the first 5-10 minutes. I missed the man in the beginning and I missed the beginning of the best war footage ever shot(By far. the scenes in Platoon and the helicopter scene in Apocalypse Now cannot even live up to this and those are among the greatest of all films). This film is an absolute Masterpiece. I rented the film when it came out and I've owned for a few years...Very few films have ever had the effect on me that this. It is one of the very best films ever made. It devastates me every time. And I have to say, I have an incredible incredible dislike for people who think they know about films. These arthouse freaks get to me(And I can be an arthouse guy, myself) when they not only dislike a film but when they TRY (But without knowing it fail) to take away from the meaning of the film for the people who were impacted by it. This isn't some dumb sell-out movie. This is not the Linkin Park of movies. Sorry to burst your bubbles wannabe film buffs, but Spielberg is, along with Scorsese, as good as it gets-BOTTOM LINE...If you don't feel the same way about his work, then I apologize because you are really missing out. Spielberg may be the most popular and most amount grossing (Interesting use of words) of all-time but he is a genius and the other geniuses(Scorsese, Kubrick, Coppola, Fellini, Leone, Eastwood, Stone, Lee, etc etc) feel the same way about him. So all you fools who not only dislike Steven's work, but label it as popular nonsense, go tell the directors you admire that one of their great heroes of the cinema is nothing but a joke.

","Devastation - there are many things that can, and will, devastate a person in his or her life. Akin to the devastation of this movie going experience, in a darkened theatre, is the devastation of its lack of power, its lack of damaging, its lack of emotionally caving power, to destroy me, on home video release.<br/><br/>
in a darkened theatre my heart wept for every living man, who had to fight in any war, of any year in the existence of this world. The horror and the hollow<br/><br/>vacuum that my heart was drenched and sucked into, during the first quarter of this film, was unlike anything that had ever become of me. The experience was in fact so upsetting and demanding of my soul, that i repeated it - once again on my own, and once more with a friend. And the beginning, THAT beginning, beat<br/><br/>my heart faster as it crept into the cut, to the past, to the horror, the second viewing, and once again, the third viewing. At this point, this movie was the only movie, and it stuck with me, and moved me so much that it was at this point, the most amazing thing i had ever witnessed.<br/><br/>So why is it no longer even close to meaning as much to me?<br/><br/>in a darkened living room, as it crept into the cut, my heart barely beat a beat faster - at home, in comfort perhaps, this movie did nothing - and became<br/><br/>nothing more than a Spielberg movie, with Tom Hanks trying to save Matt<br/><br/>Damon. <br/><br/>All i could think, was how? How could this be released onto video, into the<br/><br/>comfort of homes, the comfort of bedrooms? Releasing this on video has<br/><br/>destroyed the movie. I only pray that one day, i will own enough equipment, to bring the heart out of the magnetic tape, out of the glossy DVD, bring the pain beyond Tom Hanks face, beyond John Williams music - and once again watch<br/><br/>the ghost of a battle, that terrified and took so many lives, as it once destroyed me, in that darkened theatre."

","No doubt about it, I'm a big fan of ""Saving Private Ryan.""  In my humble opinion, those who don't appreciate this movie are a bit too nit-picky. Some say it is an anti-war movie.  Others call it ""flag waving b@llsh*t."" In truth I don't think the film was trying to be either, although you could feel the respect Spielberg has towards military veterans.  Also, just because the movie doesn't portray everything exactly like it happened doesn't mean it lacks realism.  I believe most people who saw the movie could relate to the characters and their displays of emotion.  You could feel the fear in the battle scenes, the grief when Ryan's mother fell to the porch after seeing the chaplain get out of the car.  You could relate to the homesickness of the troops who had gone months, if not years, away from home fighting a war on foreign soil.  I have never seen another movie that had as large of an emotional impact on me as this one did.  ""The Thin Red Line"" doesn't even come close."

This was able to steal the wars attention.<br/><br/>Anyway, the question is, after all the American war movies that have been coming out, how can you blame 'em for this anti-America, world cop crap.<br/><br/>Some are just action movies in disguise, searching for reason and realism. Others are more serious and want to show us that war sucks. Right. Heard of that before.<br/><br/>So, we're at war, fighting people all over the world. Something that often isn't clear enough is why are we fighting? The characters are heroic but robotic. They sloughter with no questions asked.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan does ask these questions. The characters want to follow the system and obey their orders, but they can't help but question and doubt it. The military isn't a machine which is oiled and fueled. Soldiers are not robots. This is are army and it isn't perfect, but we're doing what we can and we're proud Americans.<br/><br/>Besides this is WWII. The one war where we had support of most of these big European countries, so we don't need to explain to them what we're fighting for.

","I really don't understand some of the issues raised by people after viewing this movie. They seem to bring their own agendas.<br/><br/>Some people ask why no Brits were portrayed.....why should there be? Okay, there were Brits (and Canadians etc) invading France....but what do they have to do with the efforts of an American squad ordered by American superiors  to locate an American paratrooper who was with other American troops so he can be sent back to his American mother who had lost 3 other of her American sons. <br/><br/>If the movie were about Brits fighting on Sword or Juno and some Tommy was lost inland and the Brits needed to find him to send him home to Liverpool or Dymchurch....I wouldn't moan about the film not showing Omaha Beach and Americans not being shown.<br/><br/>Now, yes,there were Hispanic and Black soldiers there. Many blacks steered the landing craft. Spielberg COULD'VE added a black landing craft driver and a hispanic soldier blown to bits...but aren't we all a little tired of tokenism? I know I find the inclusion of a white character in ""black"" movies like DRUMLINE kind of cheap and pandering. Would the inclusion of a Hispanic soldier in the squad made it a better movie? Would the sight of a Hispanic soldier dying on the beach made it a better movie?<br/><br/>And again, would someone please explain the comments about Germans being portrayed as stupid and/or evil? <br/><br/>During the film, we see AMERICAN soldiers:<br/><br/>Gleefully laugh as they shoot Germans attempting to surrender at Normandy<br/><br/>A soldier so frozen with fear that he neglects his fellow soldiers in their time of need<br/><br/>A soldier threatens to desert the squad and disobey his officers<br/><br/>And what do the Germans do that's evil? They shoot Americans (no Brits) and they stab them and Germans manning tanks fire at Americans......that's not evil...that's WAR!<br/><br/>Then people say that after the first half hour,that the movie becomes routine. Well, I don't get that. They are on a quest. Just like in LORD OF THE RINGS. We DID get to know each soldier. Not as much as the soldiers in a mini-series like BAND OF BROTHERS but then, did we really know more about them than the guys in SPR?<br/><br/>If the entire movie were like the first half hour, some of you would be complaining that there wasn't enough quiet character development.<br/><br/>And how could anyone say Tom Hanks is a bad actor?"

","No.  That is all in the opinion of the viewer.  The AFI can hail ""Citizen Kane"" the best movie of all time, but then cast a blind eye towards ""Aliens"" in their 100 Thrillers.  Moral: No one is infallible.<br/><br/>To be blunt, there are good war movies (Das Boot, Apocalypse Now) and there are bad ones (almost anything with John Wayne fits here).  Saving Private Ryan is a good war movie, even great at some points, but once again Spielberg falls into the ""sentimental showman"" trap that frequents his films.  Whether in Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, or Indiana Jones 3, he starts trying to evoke an emotional response by trying too hard.  As they say ""the harder you try, the dumber you look.""<br/><br/>As far as general film quality goes, this movie is superb.  Kaminski's tight camera angles coupled with the color desaturation gives ""Private Ryan"" an almost black-and-white archaic look reminiscent of a WWII documentary.  The characters look gaunt and pale, enhancing the sickening look of the movie.<br/><br/>Is this better than ""Shakespeare in Love""?  Certainly, but not as good as ""Life is Beautiful"".  Unfortunately, ""The Thin Red Line"" does not match up because Malick winds up making just an art film.  Should Hanks have gotten the Oscar?  Yes, compared to ""Forrest Gump"", he is far above that level here.  <br/><br/>Seen one war movie, seen them all.  That's what you should understand before watching this.  There is no difference between ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" compared to this.  They all have the same characters, the same morals, the same conclusions. Bummer.<br/><br/>John Williams: someone give the guy a complementary Oscar.  I have yet to hear a bad composition on his part other than ""Midway"".  In addition, the makeup and production design are far superior to the ""Shakespeare in Love"".<br/><br/>Most compliments go towards the opening 25 minutes of the movie--and it deserves it.  I feel that the final battle should seriously get more credit than it has.  Michael Kahn's editing and the super sound work enhance the fight in an almost ""Wild Bunch"" fashion.  <br/><br/>Overall, very good example of Spielberg in his serious mode despite many flaws in both plot, character, and continuity.  4.5 out of 5.

","Here's something I never quite get. People say that the German are made to look evil in WW II films...and I'll grant you that in some of the older ones they do. But where in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the Germans made to look evil?<br/><br/>Sure, they look formidable and that uniform makes them look scary. But they are hardly portrayed as baby-eating, snarling sub-humans. They kill Americans but that is what war is about. I don't see any scenes of torture or laughing Germans as they gleefully kill our guys.<br/><br/>Also, the plot was based on a real event. There was a brother pulled out because his brothers were lost. It might not have happened exactly as the movie depicts it but hey, that's what movies do...<br/><br/>There is also some confusion as to people thinking that the German who is allowed to leave by Tom Hanks (called Steamboat Willie in the credits) is the same guy who plunges the knife into the GI's chest...it's not. Spielberg regretted not making them look different after he heard that there was the confusion.<br/><br/>The whole point of the movie, to me, is that WE are Private Ryan...that is, we are the ones that so many gave their lives for....we, the generations of Americans then and now who are free today because of their sacrifices. So, like James Ryan, we must ask ourselves each day, what did you do with this freedom...did we do something to ""earn"" it...lead a productive life when so many in the world can't.

He's not the kind of guy who cries for anything, so I figured that I was in for something I might not be able to handle. I went in and sat down, shivering with anticipation. The movie starts with an old man in a military cemetery breaking down at the sight of the hundreds of crosses marking the graves of his fallen comrades. I was already near tears by this point. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the infamous twenty-five minutes of the Omaha Beach landing hit me with the force of a speeding plane crash. To put it mildly, I have seen enough violent movies in my time to say I've been pretty much desensitized to violence, even though the occasional violent, gory scene can still get me on occasion. While watching the beginning of this film, I remember thinking at one point, 'This has to stop. Please God, make it stop.'. The rest of the movie doesn't stray too far from the in-your-face style of the first minutes and when all is said and done, you walk away realizing that Spielberg, no matter what his detractors may say, is indeed a genius. I consider this movie to be the reason I wanted to get back into filmmaking after dropping out of film school. This movie makes its points and makes you question the validity of the senseless slaughter of so many innocent lives in the face of war, no matter what side of the fence you speak of. I never gave the WW2 vets a second thought until I saw this movie. Now I think of them and their hardships, especially around Memorial Day. The cinematography here ranks among the best I have ever seen. John Williams score is phenomenal and if you don't believe me, listen to the very last piece of music played over the end credits. It is an incredible piece that can only be described as beautifully patriotic. All of the performances in this film were spot on, though it did jar me a little to see Ted Danson pop up out of nowhere with a smoking machine gun in hand. I cannot recommend this movie enough, though I'd suggest that anyone unnerved by extremely realistic, and at times sadistic, violence should avoid this because it's pretty upsetting. I can only say that like my friend, I walked out of the theater a sobbing wreck. On my way out, I noticed that there were many vets in the audience.

(SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE won) This movie is very violent, but it is violence that is needed to tell the story and make the story realistic. From the opening battle of Normandy, you feel like you are right there on the beach in the battle.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are outstanding. This is Tom Hanks in his best role since FORREST GUMP as the leader of the platoon assigned to find Private Ryan. One of the performances that was underrated was that of Jeremy Davies who played Corporal Upham who makes a fatal mistake with a German officer that comes back to haunt him. Edward Burns was teriffic as well as Private Reiben, who wonders out loud why risk the lives of several men to save one. Tom Siezmore is equally as brilliant as Tom Hanks' #1 man.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Eight for One<br/><br/>The five-academy award 1998 Steven Spielberg film Saving Private Ryan stars Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), and Sergeant Michael Horvath (Tom Sizemore). The movie begins with World War II D-day invasion of Omaha Beach. As the troops approach the beach in infantry pod boats, they are swept with heavy fire as they struggle to the cover of the hills.  Germans sweep the beach with their machine guns, stopping hundreds of American soldiers in their tracks.  As Captain Miller leads his troops up the hill to clear a path for the second wave, his troops overcome many obstacles. After taking out the snipers and clearing the bunkers, the infantry rests. In the U.S., letters are being sent out by the hundreds to the families of the soldiers lost in previous battles.  It come to the attention of a typist that one mother was about to receive notice of three out of four of her sons were killed in battle. She takes the letters to her superior, and this information immediately makes its way to Washington, D.C. A decision is made to find her last son (Private James Ryan) to relieve him of his duties and to bring him home. Captain John Miller's assignment changes from taking over Omaha Beach to finding Private Ryan and getting him home safely. Angry and confused, eight men set out on this task. The question going through the soldiers' heads is `why are we risking eight for one?' The answer to this question is not simple; orders are orders; and do not question authority.<br/><br/>Along the way, they meet many confrontations of troops, snipers, and bunkers. They stumble across a secret radar bunker. Captain John Miller makes a decision to take the bunker rather than sneak past and go on with the mission. By making this decision, he upsets the crew. `The crew states that this is not our objective!' Captain Miller replied, `Our objective is to win this war!' In doing so, this results in the loss of their team Medic by machine gun fire.  After taking over the secret radar bunker, Captain Miller leads his troops to another battle site where they join ground troops to find the whereabouts of Private James Ryan. They find Private James Ryan at the bridge along with his troops. Ryan is told the news of his three brothers.  Captain Miller orders Ryan to come back with him and his troops. Heartbroken and distraught, Ryan refuses to leave his fellow troops. Captain Miller makes the decision to defend the bridge, then to get Ryan home. Miller's troops prepare themselves for a battle in which they knew could jeopardize the original mission at hand. Fighting begins again with the arrival of German Troops at the bridge. Miller loses his men one by one as the Germans attack. A bullet strikes Miller in the chest, and he falls to ground.  Staring at the sky, Miller sees the U.S. air troops bomb the Germans to win the battle. Turning his head to see Ryan standing before him, he utters his final word: `Earn this!'<br/><br/>The film in my opinion was fantastic. The scene when the boats landed at Omaha beach was extremely gory. The graphics of color, sound effects and the showing of everybody being shot to death was a real as it comes for me. Great movie!!!!"

","Since today is Veteran's Day I decided to review Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg this masterpiece War film contains perhaps the most realistic battle scenes captured on film. You see anyone can do an accurate war film but not many have the courage or patience to create an accurate war scene battle. Now while most war films, especially WWII movies tend to focus on the political side of the war this one focuses on the people who fought the war. Which is why this movie is so great. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with doing a war movie centering on the political side but when you focus on the people it gives the movie more of an impact. Which is perhaps why Vietnam movies make some much have an impact on the audience. My theory is that WWII was such an accomplishment to the United States that Producers tend to focus on the political accomplishment.<br/><br/>

","This movie is not just about the war. It is more about the human values and how different people have different ways of valuing life. All this is set at the backdrop of the world war. Tom Hanks as the captain does not hesitate to kill enemy soldiers for his country. On the other hand, he leads his team to find one man because he believes that this job earns him the right to go home. The war is shown exactly as it is in the battlefield. Some of the scenes are gross but real. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon (as Ryan) deliver extraordinary peformances. The sniper in the team who prays to God before shooting his victim, the corporal who fires only one bullet in the whole movie have their own ways of looking at the war and also on their individual roles in the war. Overall, the movie is excellent. The absolute reality of the war as shown in the movie makes us think if anything good really came out of the whole war!"
"peejmeister86","Null","0","1","20 October 2002"," Possibly the most accurate representation of warfare, ever.
","Right, let's get this out of the way with first. Yes, this film is often sickeningly patriotic and it does not give a fair representation of how the soldiers of other nation's (including Germany) suffered dreadfully in the events of June 1944. Good, now that's settled.<br/><br/>I first saw this film when I was about thirteen, I'd like to make two points before I go on.<br/><br/>1)Before I saw this film I thought war was 'cool'. 2)Before I saw this film I knew little or nothing about the most momentous event of the 20th century.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much, then the ramps went down on the landing craft and the first twenty soldiers were cut to pieces in a hail of bullets, obliterated in an instant. I was appalled, horrified, all the more so because I knew that this had actually happened, I had seen countless movie deaths, in countless ways before, but nothing like this. The sheer ferocity of the opening beach landing is horrendous. You are one of those soldiers on the beach, desperately tying to find cover from the death raining down upon you from above. The maimed, screaming as medics attempt to operate on them in the middle of the most hellish chaos imaginable. Human instinct would be telling those men just to hide, but they had to do more than just stay alive, they had to take that beach at all costs.<br/><br/>This is not just a superb war film, it most definitely is a good drama. The sheer trauma that the common soldier experienced, the fact that young men who had never known death, had to watch their friends slaughtered before their eyes, is skillfully translated. The audience cares about each one of the characters, the death of Wade, the medic, as his friends tried to help him, reduced me to tears - it was so awful. As the search for Ryan progresses the characters begin to develop also. They are ordinary men caught up in the most terrifying events imaginable. Hanks gives an excellent performance, one of the best of his career.<br/><br/>The film is possibly the closest thing to war I have ever seen on screen. It pioneered the use of 'shakey-cam' and the use of washed out colours give the film a terrifyingly gritty and dirty realism that dispels any notion of glorious combat. The very sound, the ominous screeching made by the 60ton Tiger tank approaching the town, a hail of machine gun fire slamming into a human body, makes is horrific. Some have complained about the 'faceless enemy' of the German soldiers. If anything this added to the terror, at the film's finale, I remember upon first seeing it, even though I knew it was just German soldiers approaching, it was frightening - those were ordinary men just a few hundred yards down the street, not monsters, but they would kill you if they found you - I can't begin to explain it properly but this particularly a profound effect upon me.<br/><br/>The film is emotionally and physically draining, at some points you just want it to stop, but you can't take you're eyes off it. It prompted me to find out as much as I could about the Second World War and for this reason I am now studying History A level on Nazi Germany. It is not perfect - no, but because of seeing it I am now eternally grateful and fully aware of the tremendous sacrifice that that generation made for those after."

From the choatic opening sequence of D-Day, to the final skirmish with the German Soldiers have me hooked and interested in the horrors of war. I liked the whole movie but I have to comment again on the beginning and end war sequences. (Not implying the movie in-between is bad at all, it never bores you and it's still good) The beginning sequence was a great performance of acting of the main cast and a lot of extras, working all at the same time. At the end, you got to follow individual soldiers on their fight with the camera following them. The color tainting, and the authentic weaponry and sound effects makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" the best war movie."

","Steven Spielberg. That name should almost be sufficient. This film is a masterpiece when it comes to showing the brutal sides and consequences of war. How much should an individual pay for the freedom of his or her country?   That is an essential question here. The film starts in the present day and ends there as well. The majority of the action takes us back to the days of WW2, where the mouth of a gun made most of the political statements. If you're into war, it doesn't come much better. The casting is excellent. The sound is very realistic and I recommend seing the movie in THX or surround. The length of the movie helps to create the right atmosphere. It doesn't stop, when you think you were just getting started. You should experience this movie rather than listen to what I have to say about it!

"ProperCharlie","9","0","1","21 September 2002"," Shellshock on celluloid
","** Spoiler country ahead **<br/><br/>This film has proved to be one of the more devisive that Spielberg has made and along with Schindler's List, it's certainly the most harrowing.  When I first saw this in the cinema, 95% of the audience couldn't stand up as the credits rolled.  The trauma induced watching the battle scenes seemed to disconnect everyone's brain from their leg muscles.  If you ever want to make anyone realise that war is not a good idea, make them watch this.<br/><br/>Many have said that this film doesn't have a plot.  Rubbish, the plot is that 8 soldiers go off to rescue the last remaining brother of a family so that some high ranking officer doesn't have tell his mother the worst possible news without something positive to add at the end.  Sorry, bit of cynicism there.  It don't care if the plot is true, made up, plausible or a steaming pile of cow dung, it's still a plot.  To me the number of soldiers who died in WWI to gain 100 yards of ground seems totally implausible - but it happened.  In was lots of crazy things happen and sometimes the focus needs to be on the detail rather than the big picture.<br/><br/>I agree, the plot is something to hang this film on.  It's a bit flimsy but it isn't why the film was made.  I think this film, like the gravestones in Normandy, is a monument to the fallen.  It's an attempt to do an honest war film.  No punch pulling.  No batteplans, just individual soldier's stories in one huge story there players within.  To do that well you need a simple story and that's what you've got.  <br/><br/>Now the big controversial bit.  Patriotism.  Yes, it's an American film made by Hollywood with American actors and money.  It's about Americans at war. Maybe everyone should treat it as such.  Das Boot is an excellent German war film about Germans and the number of British war films made in the later half of the 1940's about Brits does not need mentioning.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>The rest of world is starting to view America as a bit schizophrenic.  On one hand very insular and not really wanting to interact with the world; certainly wanting to be safe from the rest of the world's problems.  On the other hand American culture, values, interpretations of history, art, music are everywhere around the world.  Indeed most of the world are a little bit American.  That's fine as far at is goes.  You don't like, you don't eat at McDonald's.  <br/><br/>However when a brilliantly artistic and truthful film that we all want to share in fails to do this and goes all insular and US-patriotic on us, we get a little bit disappointed.  Yes this film tells the truth, but it doesn't tell the whole truth.  It's subtle, but it's rewriting history. That gets people's backs up and leads to tension and arguments.<br/><br/>The association of the universal truths with the US flag and US soldiers seems to be stealing something that we all own for an individual nation. War it a horrible thing, that men can commit the ultimate sacrafice for another man, that fighting brutalises, that the freedom to make this film was won on those beaches and fields; this film has a message for all of us, not just the US.<br/><br/>Films should have an affect on you, they should haunt your thoughts for days afterwards.  Saving Private Ryan still haunts my thoughts over 3 years since I saw it.  Please see it regardless of where you come from."
"MChittum-California","8","0","1","20 September 2002"," Why not an American perspective?
","It seems moviegoers either love or hate this film.  Most Brits look down on it for neglecting the Allies perspective.  Yes, it is a decidedly American film and why not?  Yanks coming ashore at Omaha were not hand in hand with Brits nor did they care.  They were with their buddies and they were there to stay alive and kill Germans...not just Nazis...Germans...the enemy. The five Sullivans were real and their tragic deaths ripped the heart out of most normal Americans at the time, and to this day.  Americans would never again risk that heartache upon a single mother.  Perhaps this did not occur with any British family, making it difficult for the audience to relate to this premise of the film.<br/><br/>Many say the first 25 minutes are excellent and then the film fades to standard.  I believe the original hoopla is generated by the very real special effects.  Few can deny that this film raised the bar for moviegoer battle sensation.  The scene in the village, at the end, where Hanks, et al are awaiting the Panzers and the rubble shakes beneath them still sends chills up my spine.  Hollywood movie?  Sure! American as apple pie!  And Hollywood will continue to make ""Yank"" films because...we will still find those eight Yanks today that will risk their lives to save one."

At the same time it brought the horrors of war and the wonder of film making together at the same time. This is matched with an end battle sequence again that gets the pulses racing and the emotions rising. People have actually complained about the middle segment of the film, claiming it to be clunky, boring and cliche but this is just the unwinding of the plot. The scene where they storm the radar base and capture the German pow is one of the most powerful in the film.

"djo_9897","10","0","1","13 August 2002"," Greatest War Movie - Despite What the Germans Say
","This is a brilliant film.  I have never seen a film that gives a better sense of what it is like to actually be involved in combat, in all its shocking and horrifying reality.  It also is rare that a World War II film comes along that actually shows American soldiers as real people, who sometimes do things they'd rather not talk about under the intense stress of combat.  Take, for example, the American soldiers who shoot the two Germans who are trying to surrender during the D-Day landing.  Or Corporal Upham, who is too scared during the final battle to save one of his comrades from being killed.  Scenes such as these help lend a humanity to the movie so that, while still rooting for the main group of characters, you realize that sometime, during war, men act in a way that they never would during peace.<br/><br/>Now, as for the issue of the portrayal of the Germans during the movie, first of all, I don't see how some people are complaining that they were portrayed as ""stupid"".  I can't think of a single scene in which the German soldiers are shown to be acting stupidly.  Are they shown losing the battle? Yes, they are.  But guess what?  That's what actually happened!  News flash:  The Germans lost the war!  A film that shows brave German soldiers successfully stopping the Americans and British on the beaches and driving them back into the sea would be nothing but a giant work of fiction, because it never happened.  And as for all out German ""friends"" complaining that Germans are always portrayed as the bad guys and evil in World War II films, I have news for you: Germany was the bad guy.  Germany acted in as evil a way as a country can act.  Germany tried to conquer an entire continent because it felt it was it's destiny.  Germany mercilessly butchered millions of Jews and other ""undesirables"" because they weren't ""pure"".  If Germans don't like being portrayed as evil during World War II, then maybe they shouldn't have acted evil during World War II."

","I have seen a lot of war films and I seriously doubt that any will ever show combat better than this Speilberg offering. I dont subscribe to the view that it ignores us brits, as clearly we were not involved in that area. The aside about Montgomery is not particularly fair, even though I do not rate him as a general, he was playing the part dictated by overall strategy. The first time I saw SPR I rather think I held my breath for the entire landing sequence. Certainly, I remember heaving a huge sigh of relief when it was over. If there is a more intense 20 odd minutes of film anywhere in existence I have never seen it. The film loses many points for some really stupid continuity errors but makes it up hands down for the action sequences. The technique used to film on the beach has had its critics in my circle of friends but I really do think it lent great realism to the action. Many parts of the film were a little twee, some tactics used considerably less than competent. I have never been one to let such things stand in the way of good entertainment. Overall, SPR sits on my pedestal of 'best war film' on the basis of its action sequences. Better war films are out there if you want a really good story, historical representation or total accuracy. If you want to see what it was like to be a soldier in WW2 when the lead flew, then see it on the big screen and be prepared to duck. What a shame that Steven Speilberg did not make 'Enemy at the gates'."

If this movie does not give you a punch-in-the-gut feeling after walking out, then you have missed the point. The point is plain and simple, ordinary people did extraordinary things so that we have the right to be free. Some of my generation take these rights for granted. I did. I no longer do.<br/><br/>The rest of this, for the most part, goes into why I disagree with others who did not like this movie. By doing this, I hope that I have also explained why I DO like this movie. I have heard many of the complaints about this movie. I disagree with just about every one of them. I add a disclaimer about this at the end.<br/><br/>I have heard that this movie is not ""anti-war"" enough, that ""The Thin Red Line"" is a much better anti-war movie. This misses the point of the movie. The movie is not essentially anti-war. It is about the sacrifices that others made to give us our freedoms.<br/><br/>I have heard that this movie is too gruesome. I can understand why people say this. But, in order to portray truthfully, the bravery that others made on our behalf, the movie needs to be gorry. I believe that this movie was not so much written for the WWII generation, but for their children, grandchildren, and on down the line. We NEED to understand what others have done.<br/><br/>Some have claimed that the movie, beyond the first 20 minutes, does not have enough action. The movie is not an action epic, beyond the first twenty minutes and is not meant to be. The movie is meant to display that these people were ordinary. This is called character development. The characters are not as developed as some would wish, but I believe Spielberg did this with a purpose. The characters are developed to the point that we know that they are ordinary. We are supposed to see that they are just like us (the generations after WWII), yet they did extraordinary things.<br/><br/>Some have claimed that the characters are too stereotypic. Well, we are a stereotypic society. We have cultures from all over the world, and they all fought in WWII. While many units may have been homogeneous, many were not. There are no African-Americans in the story, and Spielberg did hold true to the realism there as, sadly, African Americans were segregated from fighting with white soldiers.<br/><br/>Some have said that this another example of Americans being jingoistic. Well, we did fight separately from other countries' units. Spielberg did not say that other countries did not fight in the war, but this movie would have been twenty hours long if we chronicled each countries' contributions. Beside that, Spielberg is American, and made a film about the contributions that Americans made. Why others feel that he should make a movie about each countries' contributions is beyond me. If he does, that is his prerogative. If a French director makes a movie about the French resistance, I say, ""Good job,"" not ""What about America?""<br/><br/>Finally, after fighting off attack after attack, I wish to say, that is fine. That is your right, thanks to the bravery of others. I only wish to say that I hope that those who dislike this movie are still able to see the efforts that others made to give us this right.<br/><br/>PS: Thank you Poppop!"

","Saving Private Ryan is simply the best pure filmmaking I've ever encountered in a lifetime in the Biz.  The Normandy sequences use every technique possible to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, and maybe hiding their heads.  Spielberg uses solarization and strobing combined with hand-held shots to put the viewer in the living hell of the invasion.  The story, the characters, rung true. This is the way people were before PC and during WWII. Ethnicities that seem exaggerated, were very much in evidence at that time and Spielberg wasn't about to make a post-modern war picture. This is Sands of Iwo Jima / Guadalcanal Diary but realistically portrayed. It made one think if they would be so brave as to ride those tiny LST's to the beach, knowing what was waiting for them.<br/><br/>For those who wonder why it didn't win Best Picture, I say, wake up! Do you think the Academy is a pure democracy?  Is it not possible that other less talented members are simply jealous of the consistently fine work that has put Steven Spielberg atop his profession?  Academy Awards are simply the product of the likes and dislikes of each member of the Motion Picture Academy - nothing more.  They weren't handed down from Mt.

","Much has been said about the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Here's all you need to know about it; at preview screenings of it, some veterans who survived D-Day had flashbacks of their unimaginable experiences. Some couldn't bring themselves to watch. That being said, anyone who wasn't there on D-Day should see this film so they will have some small idea of what those brave soldiers went through. <br/><br/>After the opening scenes, we get to the plot of the movie, the search for a young man whose brothers have all been killed in the war. A troop of soldiers is sent to bring this young man home. On the way, they question the validity of their mission; why risk a whole group of men to save one? It is a question that has no easy answer, for the characters or the audience.<br/><br/>This is, in my opinion, the greatest movie about the Second World War ever filmed.

","As the opening sequence begins, you cannot help but have a feeling of dread as the date appears on the screen, ""June 6, 1944""<br/><br/>   The opening sequence has got to be one of the best put on film.  The jarring camera movements, the bullets shooting through the water, the absolute chaos of D-day is masterfully captured.  Some people called it uselessly gory, comparing it to ""Glory"" with its battle scenes.  Glory was a great movie, but comparing the Civil War to D-Day isn't the brightest thing to do.<br/><br/>  Once we realize the mission, we hear the men complaining, ""Why is one life worth risking eight of ours"".  I wondered that as well, but you soon understand that it isn't the point.  <br/><br/> The backlash says that the characters are paper thin, and that the story is s--t.  I disagree with both points.  All these characters have depth (with the possible exception of Private Ryan).  The story, while I agree that the screenplay is not oscar-worthy, is actually not told as a plot story, but as a series of events that take place (D-day, the battle at the hill with the machine gunners, the final battle).<br/><br/>  The acting does range, and is not always great.  Hanks does give a good performance, in a role that is not his type (aka. not Forrest Gump).  Edward Burns does give a good performance, but the two best belong to Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies.  Davies' meltdown sequence on the staircase left me reeling.  I saw it in theatres over a year ago, and on video yesterday, and was stunned about how much detail I remember.<br/><br/>  In my opinion, this film is the best of the year (beating A Simple Plan and Elizabeth)."

","As few others have done before him, Steven Spielberg depicts war as the true nightmare that it is. No glamorization here; Sherman's phrase ""war is hell"" seems like a day at the beach compared to what we see in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The only other film I can recall that delineates war to be as horrific as it appears in ""Ryan"" is Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" albeit for different reasons<br/><br/>The cinematography, special effects, sets, and costumes all create a mind-boggling sense of realism. The script is haunting. Phrases just linger in one's mind, such as Captain Miller's rueful observation that every  man he kills takes him a little further away from home.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is just that: direct.

"JVIRT99","7","0","1","7 November 1999"," VERY DISAPPOINTING FILM
","Having viewed all of Steven Speilberg films over the years, I was extremely disappointed in Saving Private Ryan. The first hour of the movie was very intense and unique. The D-Day landing was captured with realism and superb direction. Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore give a very good portrayal of men in combat. As the film progressed, it became stagnant and eventually down right boring. From the time they leave the crash site of the airborne paratroppers....to the ""Ted Danson"" village segment....through the destruction of the heavy machine-gun....right up to meeting Matt Damon as Private Jim Ryan, THE MOVIE BECOMES CONTRIVED, ARTIFICIAL AND PLODDING. In all honesty, I can`t understand what all the fuss is about. At no time did I consider this in any way a patriotic war movie. While Speilberg gives a good directing effort, in no way should this movie be considered in the same class as ""Shindlers List"". I don`t think it builds very good characterizations. By the final battle scenes, I got the impression these actors were only going through the paces. They had lost that 1940`s feel  for the times, that was neatly instilled during the first half of the film. Saving Private Ryan, in my humble opinion, will never rank up there with the greatest war films of all time. Even ""Full Metal Jacket"" with its second half letdown, was a superior motion picture endeavor then Saving Private Ryan. The best war films about 20th. century conflicks ever produced are: THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI; THE LONGEST DAY; THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES; THEY WERE EXPENDABLE; PATHS OF GLORY; BATTLEGROUND; TWELVE O`CLOCK HIGH; FROM HERE TO ETERNITY; PATTON; THE DEER HUNTER; APOCALYPSE NOW; A WALK IN THE SUN; GUALALCANAL DIARY; SAHARA; PORKCHOP HILL; IN WHICH WE SERVE; THE DAWN PATROL(1938); IN HARMS WAY; FULL METAL JACKET; OPERATION:BURMA; DESTINATION TOKYO; SAHARA; 30-SECONDS OVER TOKYO; THE STORY OF G.I. JOE. To many observers most of these films are old, in black & white and just not real enough. In my book, realism should be left to the documentaries and people should use their imagination more....films/movies/motion pictures should be more surrealistic than realistic....and of course, above all, ENTERTAINING. There are probably several more I`m overlooking, but these remain the mainstays in the 20th. century war film genre."

","First of all, I consider this movie a very good war movie.<br/><br/>But, after all, it IS a classic American war movie resembling other classic war movies like Bridge On The River Kwai etc. What disturbed me, is the general view of this movie being an Anti-War-movie. The origin of this categorization is without a doubt the acceptance of Steven Spielberg as a sophisticated director. If another director had created a movie with such realistic scenes as featured in SPR, the movie would probably be seen as violent and war-glorifying. Spielberg does SPR and it is automatically an Anti-War-movie, that `realistically displays the cruelty of war, showing us what never may happen again'. How can it be otherwise? It is a Spielberg movie. In my eyes ridiculous and unfair to the directors who are not as established as Spielberg.<br/><br/>In a movie against war the first thing that should be dropped is Patriotism in order to reflect on war objectively. SPR starts with an American flag waving in the wind. There is hardly more Patriotism possible. An objective movie does not require clichees like the evil Nazi soldier who cold-heartedly shoots American soldiers even after they spared his life. Despite of the indubitable fact that the Nazi regime was one of the most gruesome periods in world history, we also have make the assumption, that in battle all soldiers are the same: Humans fighting for a country.<br/><br/>
By the way, the only movie I have seen that definitely could tell a war story without sticking to just one side was The Thin Red Line. The problem was that Terrence Malick is not Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>So, again, in my eyes a really great movie.

If Spielberg had chosen unknown actors he would have been able to reach emotional chords with the audience that wasn't achieved.  Tom Hanks reaches emotional depth by squinting, Matt Damon by whining. The film's opening blood bath on the beach is a powerful image reinforced by many of the key scenes. But the film becomes bogged down in it's middle with prolonged memoirs and later in a lack lustre climatic battle.<br/><br/>After this film I was left trying to like it but in the end gave up.

I can't help it, its how my mind works.  As soon as I see something that makes me cynical, I start picking the movie apart. This movie had that effect on me.  Realize I'm 29 and have no combat experience.<br/><br/>In the opening battle, I wondered why they would attack a fortified position without any ""softening up"" of said position by either ship-to-shore artillery or at least hand-held heavy weapons.  I assumed this was a realistic representation of what really happened (everyone said it was so realistic).  For whatever reason they didn't have the necessary firepower. So be it.  But then I see, after they've already nearly secured the position (with heavy losses) there is a guy with a rocket-launcher-type weapon. Where the hell was he earlier when the bunker was mowing down everyone?<br/><br/>There were numerous other things that put me into cynic-mode:<br/><br/>1.) the guy that gets hit in the helmet then just stands there and (very predictably) gets shot in the head.  Isnt it a natural reaction to DUCK when you get hit in the head??? 2.) solders shoot surrendering enemies......with friendly troops walking just beyond these enemies.  You tell me--at close range, wouldn't one of these rifle bullets go right thru a person and potentially wound another in the line of fire???  Okay maybe these people were just stupid and lucky they didn't injure any friendly troops. 3.) this movie was supposed to be sooooo in-your-face realistic.  Did anyone else notice how clean and bleached WHITE Pvt. Ryans teeth were?  Oh thats realistic yeah.<br/><br/>I could go on.  Don't get me wrong there were things I liked.  Like the translator that finally hardened to the point where he killed.  But overall I couldnt take the movie seriously.<br/><br/>And Tom Hanks.  He was a pretty poor choice for the role.  However, this may have been Spielburg's intention.  More realistic maybe?<br/><br/>I just watched this movie and Thin Red Line for the first time today (on Direct TV)  I'm probably the only one here that liked TRL better (though admittedly that had its flaws too (can you say, under-powered grenades))<br/><br/>Oh and for people wondering about the battle scenes.

This movie features well drawn-out characters trapped in an incredibly brutal and all-too-real situation: they must survive the greatest hell ever to exist on Earth.<br/><br/>Their mission is to rescue one man, who is the last of his line.  Private Ryan's brothers have all died in combat, and he now has a free ticket home.

As far as plots go, it is a fairly simplistic one, despite the fact that these basic events really did happen.  The film suffers slightly as the ancient morality of ""the other guys are the bad guys"" sets in, making it slightly less horrifying than it could have been.  However, the real reason for seeing this is the experience.  The viewer is AT D-Day and the following chaos, watching as soldiers get their brains blown out before they even have a chance to get out of the landing craft.

I was in a state of shock as was everyone else at the screening I attended.  The two extended battle scenes that open and close the film are, simply, the greatest battle scenes ever recorded on celluloid.  The primary reason is because they show absolutely everything. Blood, body parts, gore, you name it.  This is easily the most violent film I've ever seen.  Can you imagine what the reaction would've been like if this movie came out at the same time ""The Wild Bunch"" did?  I was somewhat surprised that this film sailed through with an ""R"" rating.  The film tells a fairly straightforward story of a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks who are assigned to find and bring back a young soldier whose three brothers have been killed in action.  The characters are sharply and simply drawn, the editing is phenomenal, the cinematography is excellent, and the score is appropriate.  This is Spielberg's fourth WWII movie, and arguably his best film ever.  The only complaint I have about this film is its continued absence on DVD.  Please, please, Mr. Spielberg, get this masterpiece out on DVD real soon."

","I don't see why I even bother adding my comment on this film, there's already, like, 780, or something, but let me just say that Saving Private Ryan should have definately without-a-doubt won best picture of 1998. I mean, who else besides 20-something women REALLY thought Shakespeare was worthy of Best Picture? Come on, people, Saving Private Ryan was the best film in years. I was so sad when seeing the ending of this movie that I was crying. The beginning grabbed you by the heart and wouldn't let you go! I have never seen a war movie better than this. The people saying that all of that violence wasn't necessary had better realize that Saving Private Ryan was only a fraction of how bloody and awful REAL war can be. Speilberg did an excellent job directing this movie, and I felt very sorry that he did not win best picture after all that work. Tom Hanks did an excellent job at his part, and, although the acting was not exactly top-notch, no one in this movie did a bad job at all. Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies, and was ripped off when it came to the Oscars. I don't know how people can hate this movie, say it was bad, or tell me that it was boring. I would watch Saving Private Ryan again any day. Go see this movie!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>**** stars out of ****<br/><br/>-2001Rulz"

","This movie is an instant classic. I loved it, it shows WWII in a very real way. It doesn't mention the atrocities of Hitler because they are already showed in so many movies, instead it show the atrocities of war. The first minutes of the movie are the most stunning that I've ever seen specially because its based on real events. <br/><br/>This movie show the soldiers of both bands ( allies and germans ) as human beings , this is refreshing because most war movies pictures one side as pure evil. and the other side as the good guys, Specially WWII movies but this movie shows that not all german soldiers were jew-hating Hitler-loving killing machines with no soul.  <br/><br/>I liked Shakespeare in Love but I think this movie should've won the oscar. It has everything you want in a movie, good acting, good story and good special effects. The main characters are well-developed and you feel you know them. If you ever cry at movies you will cry.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anyone except children"
"claude-18","Null","0","1","10 August 1999"," An emotional and timely masterwork
","It's easy to see why those who have not yet faced the task of grieving departed ones might see Saving Private Ryan as sappy and feel manipulated by it. There is little doubt that Spielberg wants to impart strong feelings of tragedy and loss in this film - the same authentic tears that surface each day at the Vietnam War Memorial. To my mind he evokes these feelings with as much, if not more intensity than he did in Schindler's List.<br/><br/>
Few directors block a shot to serve feeling, story and characters as well as the mature Spielberg. And in Private Ryan, he scores emotional bullseyes with devasting power. Unlike George Lucas, whose narrative skills have gotten rusty with disuse, Spielberg continues to work hard at his narrative thoughtfulness, economy and authenticity. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg shows his mature pacing and mastery in numerous scenes -  most notably in his shot coverage of the wordless scene in which Private Ryan's mother realizes she's about to be notified about her sons. <br/><br/>Spielberg's model here is not ""Kelly's Heroes"" or other war films, but ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", the late-forties academy award winner that best enshrined and exorcised the post-war experience for WWII vets and families. (Unlike that epic, Private Ryan deserved but was denied the best film Oscar.) <br/><br/>Many cinematic virtues have been attributed to Private Ryan that are to my mind unremarkable. Gritty, realistic action is to be expected from any eight figure 90's battle film. I award Spielberg no points there. Subordinating plot momentum to explore characters episodically is risky, but it's still not a stretch. <br/><br/>What is a stretch, and would be for any director, is achieving the utter respect, reverence and quietude the average viewer  leaves the theater with just fifteen minutes after the sense-numbing climactic battle scenes are over. This is primarily because Private Ryan's opening and closing scenes bracket the cinematic tour de force with a much quieter and still-current personal reality. How many were saved in similar sacrifices? How did my own father or grandfather survive? When we realize what is truly owed, we're all humbled. <br/><br/>The open and pliant soul who has known grief and loss first-hand and who watches this masterwork cannot help but reconsider the sacrifice of a generation of young men - and the connection between those young men on the screen and the very real 75 year old men still walking our streets.<br/><br/>It is this accomplishment, this bridge that Spielberg built between three generations of twentieth century Americans that impresses me. It's a film that had to come when it did - for us living now. Although future generations may benefit from watching Private Ryan, by then the generation portrayed on screen will have passed away. For now, they are still with us and have stories to tell. Private Ryan awakened my gratitude to them.<br/><br/>
Call Private Ryan sappy if you like. I know it left a fingerprint on my heart deeper and more meaningful than ET ever did. For those of you who don't get it, I hope you'll ask your grandparents and listen to their stories while they're still alive. Maybe you'll relate more personally to the material."

","I must admit I watched this with apprehension, as I firmly believe that Tom Hanks should stick to doing comedy (The Burbs, Dragnet) and Spielberg hasn't made film better than Jaws in his whole career.  Anyway, this film is over-rated.  Sure the opening scenes are shocking and brutal.  This is to show what war was really like, apparently.  We all know what war was really like, so who cares?<br/><br/>Spielberg cannot decide whether to make a totally serious war film or a sentimental heart tugging Oscar winner.  So he tries both.  The comedy of the bumbling interpreter is out of place, and the sniper's amazing shot through the sight of another sniper's gun is plain ridiculous.  Even more so, the feelgood ending made me want to vomit.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, Saving Private Ryan seems to be a shameless rip off of the Eastwood/Sutherland/ Savalas classic Kelly's Heroes.  The end scenario is too similar to be coincidence, with the tank ambush, the radio music and the sniper in the bell tower.  I spent the whole 2 and whatever hours thinking 'its Kelly's Heroes, but without the humour or the superb acting!'<br/><br/>While Saving Private Ryan is highly watchable, it is by no means a classic.<br/><br/>Watch Kelly's Heroes instead."

","""Writing an anti war book is like writing an anti glacier book."" -a (sort of) quote from Slaughterhouse 5<br/><br/>Commendable for it's use of realistic ground level shaky camera angles in the beginning and end battle scenes, this film really does bring the horrors of war home. The depiction of the unfair randomness of the conflict, and the gruesome results, are truly superb. On a par with certain scenes in Hamburger Hill and Stalingrad in it's ability to discourage volunteering for military service. I defy anyone to leave the theatre after seeing this film and not feel as though someone has really spoken out to them.<br/><br/>However, this graphic depiction of war does come with a fair amount of Hollywood baggage. Noteworthy scenes include the ones with the present day Private Ryan, Officers back in America and the bit where Hanks says ""saving-Private-Ryan"" which I objected to on general principles. Despite these scenes, this film still has to rank up there with some of the best executed anti war films around. I would personally recommend Stalingrad more strongly if only because it had the same ""shock factor"" and came without the cheese."

I believe we have thousands of them and each of them overtops 'Ryan' in sense of movie, in sense of story behind the screen, in sense of tragedy, courage, brotherhood. . Of course, 'Ryan' is the perfectly tailored flick empowered with technically advanced filming and extra-natural guts-wrenching effects to let you practically feel all the disgust of the slaughter. But this is not what makes war so horrible. Unfortunately, 'Ryan' fails to deliver the message. Among movies about WWII this one definitely belongs to 'B' box; it's flat and one-sided. It's like trying to imagine a holiday looking at the resort ad postcard: bright, colorful, rich, exotic.. but tasteless, something you can not touch, feel, enjoy, remember. What we see in 'Ryan' is true but it's not War."

Oh well, if they want horror, cruelty, and moral vacuum symbolised by the Stars and Stripes that's fine by me.  But it turned what was potentially a worthwhile film into a bit of a farce, although empty headed middle America will appreciate it.  I was never sure about Tom Hanks but now its clear that he's only good at sitting round with his head in a spin.

","My son rented ""Saving Private Ryan"" last night and I watched it even though I had no real interest to do so, because I had heard that Steven Spielberg forgot to include a Black or Hispanic in the movie. If he did his homework he would see that during one of these major invasions, a Black medic was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for treating other wounded soldiers though he himself was constantly being wounded as he kept going from soldier to soldier.One thing, though, in the beginning of the movie while the old man is visiting the grave of his fallen comrade, you can see the real name of a Hispanic soldier by the name of Martinez or Ramirez as I recall, on one of the cross. I guess Steven Spielberg over looked that one. On another note, others have commented about our allies not being in this movie, and I can understand why Spielberg did what he did but, keeping us other Americans out is a disgrace to all those Blacks and Hispanics that fought and died for this great Country of ours. If I was to meet Mr. Movie Maker himself, I would ask him: ""Hey,what happened to us Blacks and Hispanics?"" And if anyone else out there feels that what I'm saying is a crock of s***, well, all I have to say is that I'm a Vietnam Combat Wounded Veteran and a Hispanic at that. I know what combat is and the fear that goes through your mind as you look for the enemy in the jungle, and more when you find him. You find yourself doing things you would never have imagined, and how close you become to other soldiers, whether they are black,red,brown, white or green. I must honestly say,though, that I did enjoy the movie and felt sad when ever a soldier was killed, for I've been there.

Because the film did nothing that couldn't be done in a Play.  Everything that happened in that film could have been reproduced on a stage.

I believe a Best Picture should transcend the material seen on screen.  It should have an emotional impact--it should touch the viewer in a way where it becomes much more than a movie for the viewer.

SIL is a very witty movie well acted.  SPR relies on technical wizardry to bring out the emotions.  Don't get me wrong, the wizardry works in this movie, and boy does it work.  The writing in SPR just wasn't there.  The ""bonding"" was extremely forced.  And the one thing that trivializes the emotional impact is the sentimental ending.

","Firstly, the lionisation of Spielberg must stop.  He hasn't made a ""Classic"" film since Jaws.  And SPR although interesting, is by no means in that category. My main problem with it comes from Spielberg himself.  As a previous user commented, he contradicts himself with his attempt to unglorify war, and yet plaster patriotic and nationalistic symbols all over the screen. The 'war is pointless' theme is a meritable one, but in painting the US soldiers to be victims, there is no thought to the feelings of the ordinary German soldiers, who were surely experiencing the same fears.  They are portrayed as ruthless, cold-blooded and evil.<br/><br/>Also, Spielberg would have us believe that US won the war on their own. Despite traipsing across French countryside for miles, not one British, Canadian, Australian, French (etc) soldier is seen.  The bridge they defended at the end was actually in reality, held by a joint Anglo-American force. Spielberg's reputation is such that historical inaccuracies like these are damaging. As for the opening scene, yes it is involving, spectacular, scary and all the rest.  But the camera techniques have been used before by Kubrick and Peckinpah etc.  He is not a genius."

","OK, so I was obviously not part of WWII, or ANY war for that matter. Even so, I have seen some GREAT war movies in my time that made me feel like I was actually there and going through the emotions and struggles that all soldiers experience in battle.<br/><br/>So why am I calling Saving Private Ryan overrated when it's been touted as the most realistic war movie ever made? It just didn't have the emotion. Sure, it looked grisly on the screen, especially the first 15 minutes. But I never got a sense that I was there...that I was feeling what Tom Hanks was feeling. In fact, I felt as if I were sitting in a movie theater watching a movie. The special effects in the first 15 minutes were also very bad. I cringed at the corniness whenever they had a scene with a downed soldier playing with his innards. It looked more like spaghetti than intestines and was an obvious device for shock value (which did not work one single bit).<br/><br/>The story itself was interesting enough. However, it was very limited, if you think about it. The movie transformed itself from a dramatic war movie to a simple action flick about searching for an ordinary soldier and then taking on an entire German unit with 6 or 7 soldiers. It reminded me more of Rambo than an Oscar-nominated movie.<br/><br/>The two best war movies I have ever seen both came out in the same year. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were REAL war movies. I absolutely fell in love with Platoon when I watched it. I actually felt like I was there in the jungle with Charlie company and I knew all the soldiers in my troop. It was an experience. Saving Private Ryan never really puts you there. Instead, it drags you along and makes you follow a bunch of guys walking around the whole movie looking for this private Ryan guy.<br/><br/>The movie was ""important"" because it was about WWII and because Steven Spielberg was involved. Spielberg has reached the status where he can do no wrong and everything he comes out with is considered a masterpiece. If he were to make a film about origami, everyone would suddenly embrace origami as the greatest lost art of our time and there would be conventions and books and tributes about how great origami is.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is a product of a well-respected director and actor making the best out of their reputations. As a film, it is certainly not the best movie I've seen, and even not the best I've seen last year (Life is Beautiful and Dark City takes the cake on that). It is more of an action flick than a human drama and mroe about making money than it is about war.<br/><br/>While I still enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed it on the same plane as a regular action flick. If put next to a film like Life is Beautiful or Platoon, it certainly takes a back seat."

Of course the movie's highest points are the brilliantly realistic war scenes, especially the Omaha Beach scene but the visuals aren't it's only good parts. The story is quite well thought out and the reactions from the charecters are very realistic, ie. The soldiers aren't too happy about having to risk their lives for one private who no one has even heard of. The charecters are very well developed and you really get to know and love (or hate) each and every one of their personalities individually.

Oft-times, his movies have that epic feel, but they don't seem to have captured Spielberg's passion, do they? While I was watching the famed ""first 20 minutes,"" all I could do was look on at the screen, almost indifferent to the violence.  Maybe it's because I'm growing up in a society obsessed with violence and bloodshed, but I didn't feel like I was there.  I felt like I was watching it 50 years after the fact and it was just very ineffectual to me.  The other WWII movie, ""Life is Beautiful,"" however, was created as a much more intimate film with less violence and affected me much more than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" did.

","I wasn't all that enthusiastic about paying to see this when it first came out, but as a friend lent me a video CD, I took the time to watch it. The result: a major disappointment.<br/><br/>The story is all over the place, not telling a continuous narrative, but a series of escapades that do not remotely further the storyline. Instead they show some ambiguous moralising that simultaneously condemns and celebrates warfare. The story has very little new or original to say beyond the old chestnuts of war being hell and its corruption of humanity.<br/><br/>The acting is also fairly lazy. Tom Hanks seems so lacking in talent that gives the impression that he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Matt Damon and the rest of the cast are so laid-back that I suspect most of them are acting in something else on another sound-stage. The opening beach landing, and most of the violent encounters during the remainder of the film are somewhat ludicrous (people burning to death three feet from water; a sniper being shot by a bullet travelling down his scope into his eye; Mellish's death). It doesn't matter if it's realistic, it still looks bizarre. The production is quite good and suitably colourless, but scenery a good film doth not make.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a poor film, in which high production values fail to hide a feeble script and indifferent acting. But then almost any film could be guaranteed a big US gross and a clutch of Oscars when it's about American soldiers being ""heroic"". It is therefore not surprising that Frank Darabont had his name removed from the script. Had I been in his position, I would have boycotted the damn thing."

He is just not convincing in this role and is made to look very ordinary when compared to the performances of the supporting players whose role in this film has been unfairly ignored. It is a sad day when Ted Danson makes a more convincing Army Captain than Mr Hanks.<br/><br/>This is a good movie but it is not a classic. The battle scenes probably are the most realistic ever filmed but once they are over you are left with a fairly standard war movie with nothing new to say. Sure war is hell but if you have watched any war movie made since Apocalypse Now then surely you know that already. The view of war from the perspective of the common soldier has been done many times before, and in my mind much better in films such as Das Boot, Stalingrad and restoration. I hope that those who are so impressed with Saving Private Ryan take time to check out these films. I would also like to say that as a Brit I did not find the so called nationalistic tone of the film offensive. I don't think that it is an accident that the American Flags are shown to be pale and washed out. I think that this simple image is an  effective way of showing a pride in the American achievements in WWII whilst appreciating the tragic loss of life and perhaps an acknowledgement that atrocities were not just the preserve of the Germans. What I did find offensive was the insulting bookend sections which sledge-hammered the message home. Perhaps if Mr Spielberg reads the negative comments about these sections in the IMDB he might realise that we film goers have more intelligence than he gives us credit for and will stop using such unnecessary sentimental devices in his films. In general this film felt like a roller coaster where the biggest drop is the first one. It's exhilerating as hell at the beginning but then you never quite reach the same hights again and end up coasting to a disappointing end."

Probably not, but it's poorly directed and ambiguous. And regardless of the absurdly jingoistic sentiments of some of my fellow countrymen here (which are not worth responding to), the US flag at the end was tacky and implied American superiority. Even my great-uncle, a proud WWII veteran, agreed that this was unnecessary. Spielberg may have meant to shown the true hell that war is, but he has inadvertently made a pro-war film. American entry in WWII was inevitable and necessary, but it's nothing to celebrate."

","Undoubtedly, the success of this movie in terms of awards and nominations stems from the cliches of the ""let's make everyone aware of the horror of the war"", etc.  Although this may be a very altruistic objective, it does not imply that the movie has a good story or that the script is artistic or even clever.<br/><br/>The story line would have been more suitable for a TV show like Combat or MASH rather than for a full-blown three-hour movie.  It seems that the whole objective of the movie was to depict with extreme realism the Omaha Beach situation and to do so the movie makers had to find some movie plot, regardless of what it might be.  In fact, despite of the absolutely incredible vividness of Omaha Beach, I started to get really bored - Mr Spielberg seemed to exploit that ad infinitum.  Same could be said of the bridge battle.<br/><br/>Following the same political correctness track, the way that Germans are depicted is unfair, at least.  There was a clear intention in the movie to show the soldiers are traitors and sanguinary (e.g., the knife scene), where the Americans where all nice and warm (e.g., the kid, who was a translator, full of love and care).<br/><br/>Overall, I was quite disappointed by this movie.  After watching it, it really made me wonder on what basis Globe/Academy awards are given - may be on the ""technical"" quality of the movie and their PC bent but certainly not on the grounds of its cleverly designed script and plot.<br/><br/>This movie falls miles behind other realistic movies about the war such as Apocalypse Now."
"Tet-5","5","0","1","12 February 1999"," A disappointment
","In lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious, as a time and a place where (mostly good-looking) young men can prove how brave they are. SPR would be different, so I expected. In this movie Spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific, not heroic.<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie really was shattering. People who still believe war is an exciting event for young would-be heroes (think: Tom Cruise in Top Gun) should be obligated to watch the Omaha Beach landing-scenes. Because it really makes you experience that war is hell, a sickening, horrible hell.<br/><br/>Of course you can't fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the Omaha Beach landing. To make a good movie, you need more, like good actors, a capable crew, convincing special effects and, the most important, an interesting story. Well, no one will dispute the fact that SPR technically is a masterpiece. The camerawork, the special effects, the sound, they are all overwhelmingly good.<br/><br/>In spite of all these plusses, I really was disappointed by at least two hours of SPR. Because it missed the most important thing a movie needs: an interesting story! The characters weren't convincing. I don't blame the actors for that, they all did a good job. It was the script that I blame, I never forgot I was watching a movie with made-up characters. When a movie is really good, I tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me, that I start to symphatize deeply with them. This never happened while I was watching SPR. I never felt anything more for Captain Miller and his men then I felt for all the other, anonymous soldiers you see in this movie. And the story, the search for Private Ryan, even bored me sometimes. There were just a few scenes, like the one in which the men were reading the name-tags of the fallen soldiers, that were really compelling.<br/><br/>Three things about SPR I really disliked. First there is the way the German soldier known as ""Steamboat Willie"" was portrayed. Why is the only German we got to know a little bit such an awkward, silly guy? I'm pretty sure lots of German soldiers were ordinary men who didn't want this war any more then anyone else did. They must have been just as afraid as the American soldiers, they must have felt the same pain and horror. But that's not the way it feels like in SPR. The overall feeling you get is ""Americans are good"" and ""Germans are bad"". Second, there is the fight for the bridge. This kind of stuff, the brave heroes who, against all odds, succeed in defeating the enemy, well, this has been done so many times before. This kind of cliché was exactly what I expected SPR to avoid. Third, there is the 'point of view'. You are made to believe that the Omaha Beach-scenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard. Then, in the last scene, you learn that that man never was there. I felt manipulated in a negative way!<br/><br/>It was very hard for me to grade SPR. Technically, it's an absolute 10. The Omaha Beach-scene was extremely good, and I think it's a real homage to the veterans who were there. But there were too many things I did not like. I decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10."

","A poor movie. Spielberg has a limited emotional compass and boxed himself into an impossible corner with the opening carnage. After that, he needed to make a serious movie, of the calibre of All Quiet on the Western Front, or La Grande Illusion, to avoid bathos. As it is, the film meanders hopelessly, unable to decide whether to take itself seriously. It's a shame, since Hanks can act better than here directed, and Spielberg showed in Schindler's List that he can handle a serious theme, with telling economy. For me the truly bathetic scene was when the band of motley misfits decides to do a John Wayne and kill as many Germans as possible. This erodes the impact of the opening scene."

","Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan can perhaps be viewed as the aesthetic masterpiece that all of his previous endeavors in film has been working toward.  Private Ryan, from a purely cinematographic point of view, is an absolute masterpiece, an exploration of the uses of cinematography in a studio film must be applauded for doing so. However, the script leaves something to be desired.  The characters are cardboard cutouts (you know a character is when you can describe him in a few words) and the fact that the theme is practically drilled into our skulls by the book-ending modern day sequences should be insulting to the intelligence of every audience member watching. Spielberg deserves applause for his technique in Saving Private Ryan, but how it got filmed in the first place on the basis of its script is beyond me."

","Let's begin with the ""in your face"" gore. Guts on film don't bother me and I'm sure it was historically accurate. But as a movie, it played out like a predictable horror film after the first few heart-pumping minutes. Who didn't see it coming from a mile away when a guy Tom Hanks is dragging gets blown in half? Pure shock value, not story value.<br/><br/>Also, the film doesn't look good. From scene to scene we endure a barrage of styles--everything from choppy POV (whose?) to grand panoramics. I assume the drastic changes in cinematography are meant to represent character experience, but I found them a major distraction to becoming absorbed in the film.<br/><br/>Characters are poorly defined and even stereotypical: the hothead who doesn't want to follow orders, the 98 lb. weakling who's never shot a gun. We've never seen those before! The only thing that really surprised me was that he didn't find his ""inner strength"" by the end.<br/><br/>The modern-day bookends were quite bothersome as well. This device rarely works because it does nothing more than hinder the audience from being in the moment. I also had a VERY hard time empathizing with the character who appears in those scenes (I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it). We're not given a reason to believe he would feel so strongly later in life, so I simply couldn't share in his drama.<br/><br/>There were certainly some great moments in the film, especially in the final battle sequence--the stabbing death of one of the soldiers, and another shooting at a tank with his pistol in desperation. Overall though, the film just didn't flow and I wasn't drawn in.<br/><br/>I think audiences are confusing what they think was a shockingly realistic war movie with what was actually just plain shocking for a Spielberg movie. For a good war movie, I'll take Platoon anyday."

It's a graphic, powerful, stirring and extremely violent 25 minutes. An unrelenting barrage of gunsmoke, blood and gore. It captures the futility of war through it's no holds barred methods.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Captain John Miller, assigned to find a missing private, by the name of Ryan, whose three brothers had recently been killed. He takes a team with him to find Ryan, and along the way runs into a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film trails off into the American patriotism rigmarole that seems rudimentary in each war film. Saving Private Ryan becomes boring in the middle of the movie, with contrived, blatant 'war is so pointless' and 'this shouldn't be happening' sort of thing.<br/><br/>The finale is very violent and doesn't have as much impact as the opening sequence.

When Tom Hanks says his last words: 'Make sure you're worth it' only the nice lady next to me prevented me from stepping out of the theater. In my opinion, the movie shows the sentimental stuff that is typical of so many American made commercial movies. It was so ridiculous. The Germans outnumbered the enemy but even after 4 years of fierce combat training they weren't able to conquer a piece of land defended by a dozen marines. Instead, they fell like dominoes.<br/><br/>If you didn't like it either for the same reasons, try watching Stalingrad (1993) directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. No false sentiment in that one.<br/><br/>What I quite liked about SPR were the landings on the beach. (And the Germans actually speak German for a change!)

The opening combat scene is probably the most graphic and moving battle scene ever with the final climactic skirmish taking second place. The film also contains some excellent character work which works so well in war films.<br/><br/>However there were a few things for me that stopped this film short of being the best war film. Firstly was the blatant Americaness of the film; there was little or no reference to the Canadian and British troops that took part in the invasion. Also being British I find all the stars-and-stripes patriotism very cliched and tiresome.<br/><br/>The biggest let-down I think was in private Ryan himself. Unlike the majority of the people in the film he seemed to be completely devoid of believable character. I found it disappointing to wait most of the film to see him and find that he had been plucked almost straight from the filmmaker's A-Z of likeable 20-year-olds.<br/><br/>Still, the film was excellent.

","There's no doubt in my mind that 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically one of the best films ever. Janusz Kaminski should be congratulated for his cinematography, especially in the opening sequence. The sound effects are amazing, and I for one was particularly impressed by the part where the sound of raindrops on leaves imitated the sound of guns firing.<br/><br/>It's no understatement to say that Tom Hanks is brilliant. He has proven himself to be the most versatile actor in Hollywood, without exception. If the hype is true that 'Saving Private Ryan' is up against 'The Truman Show' to sweep the Oscars, and Hanks is up against Jim Carrey for Best Actor, then 'Ryan' and Hanks should win hands down.<br/><br/>Yet all the same I felt severely disappointed, maybe even cheated, by the movie. Beneath the main plot, a sort of sub-plot developed in which the audience is given glimpses into the internal emotions and mental turmoil of all involved, especially Captain Miller. At least, that's what I perceived the shaking hand and the ""I'm a schoolteacher"" bit to mean. The audience is sucked into thinking that, regardless of how many die, and whether or not Ryan is saved, this sub-plot is going to lead to Spielberg's big thematic message, his conclusion, his comment, at the end. But that resolution never comes, and there seems to be no point to the film, nothing it's trying to say. While that in itself is not disappointing, as many films have no message, what is frustrating is being led to feel as though a lesson is coming, and then not getting it.<br/><br/>In terms of the violence, I don't think the Omaha beach landing sequence is particularly gruesome, at least no more graphic than the part in the middle where Miller's men apply pressure to a stomach wound, and you feel the victim suffering as he turns white and dies.<br/><br/>And, not being an American but an Australian, there has been a lot made of the so-called Americanism of the film, how no black American soldiers seem to be mentioned, and how the other Allied troops are forgotten about, but I tend to think that's no more than pedanticism, taking a stereotypical swipe at a film where such bias has no glaring impact.<br/><br/>So in short, 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically brilliant, but it still left a very hollow feeling. 8 out of 10."

"Steve-176","Null","0","1","22 November 1998"," New Heights Achieved
","Saving Private Ryan is a terrific cinematic achievement. It's a great combat film, very violent and often relentless, with battle scenes that lift the genre to  new heights. Saving Private Ryan is a classic shoot 'em up film, or should that be shoot 'em off film, one that will always be compared favourably, at least in terms of the fight scenes, to other modern American battle movies like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.<br/><br/>A squad of American infantrymen lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), having somehow survived the carnage of the D day landing on Omaha Beach in Northern France, are given the task of  finding Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles. The Army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brother.<br/><br/>The squad have reservations about this mission, feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich, but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war. These men are battle hardened except for their translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has yet to fire a gun in anger. Along the way two are killed, raising the stakes considerably. Private Ryan, when and if they find him, had better be worth it.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is striking on a number of fronts. Overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops, even before they hit the beach. And that's only the beginning. Throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive. Limbs and intestines are lost and maimed. The horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphically.<br/><br/>Lots of new cinematic ground is broken. For a start the slaughter by Americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable, or at least understandable in this film. I can't remember American soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before, not like they do in Saving Private Ryan. I can see now that the viciousness of the situation, the deaths of comrades, makes a mockery of The Geneva Convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field. These things aren't right of course, but they are understandable.<br/><br/>As such it's salient that this was a Second World War battle movie. It's hard to imagine this sort of  film being made about American soldiers in Vietnam or Iraq for example. It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.<br/><br/>Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films. The multi-ethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad. The wise cracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns), the Jewish American (Adam Goldberg) the solid middle American Sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and the sharp shooting, (and unfortunately bible quoting) Southern boy (Barry Pepper) are hauled out yet again.<br/><br/>Often war films are coming of age movies but Jeremy Davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in Saving Private Ryan who develops and grows, the rest are already established as warriors. Tom Hanks plays the Captain very effectively indeed, with a great deal of restraint, and I would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another Academy Award.<br/><br/>The American Flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in Saving Private Ryan, which is a tad trying for some non Americans, but again this seems irrelevant because Saving Private Ryan is essentially a battle movie, and an exciting one. But of course, the only traitorous individual in sight is a German.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a mistake to expect too much subtlety from Speilberg anyway. Steven Speilberg strengths lie with the visual. He's uncomfortable with character development, conversation and the variance of personalities. Schindler's List, another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with Saving Private Ryan, was devastating for its audience, but that was because of the slaughter, the heartlessness, of the huge massacre that was the holocaust. It was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvas.<br/><br/>The same can be said of Saving Private Ryan. We care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them. This is Spielberg's triumph in Saving Private Ryan and also its weakness. If Spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether Private Ryan was saved of not, then Saving Private Ryan would have been even more magnificent!"

But... ...unfortunately, Spielberg hasn`t got to - or hasn`t wished to - develop the madness of the war in his movie. The mis-organization of the operations could have been deeply developed. The consequences of the ""star wars"" between Patton and Montgomery could have been shown implicating both for part of the useless death of thousands of young men. And the disorientation itself of the soldiers could have been better exploited.<br/><br/>Also, an annoying series of cliches runs during all the movie. The soldier that has feelings and gets killed because of them; the coward changed to a hero in the end of the battle; the guy-to-be-saved-that-should-be-a-moron-but-it`s-not; the arrival of the ""cavalry"" in the very last moment; and, last but not least, the ""America brings back home their children"" motto.

So much for realism.<br/><br/>Nor was there much ""vastness"" to the D-Day assault. Memories of Ryan's book on screen were much more convincing from that viewpoint at least. Omaha was a terrible disaster - and vast as well, and three Allied boats on screen do not really do the trick.<br/><br/>Hanks was excellent, of course, they all were, Sizemore, Damon, who couldn't be drawn into the story, but watching the aftermath a la Schlindler - no, I do not find this kind of story-telling convincing.<br/><br/>Several critics have hailed this movie as Spielberg's best ever, I find it hard to agree - although I wouldn't know which movie to pick in its place - as I do not think Spielberg is a real auteur by any stretch of the imagination, or ever could be. He is imminently successful, but his is the ""big shot"", the opposite of Ingemar Bergman, who says, ""kill your darlings."" He can film, he can see the ""shot"", but he cannot create. Harsh words, and perhaps a bit overdone, but it seems accurate at this moment.<br/><br/>Which is not to say I did not enjoy the movie. Of course I did. It was an excellent movie. Well told, accurate depictions for the most part, astounding acting all around - it just wasn't the ""Saving Private Ryan"" it was cracked up to be. Its reputation bloated it all out of proportion. It is not Spielberg's best movie (though it may be close), it is not - I firmly believe right now - an Academy Award winner either. Which is a shame for Tom Hanks, who has worked so hard, and been such a convincing actor through so many memorable performances. Perhaps his time - his third Oscar - will yet come."

","Saving Private Ryan wasn't really up to its reputation. The movie did have its moments and merits but sadly most of those merits were on the technical side. The effects and the set-ups were great, but that does not tell much of the movie itself... except that a lot of money was burned while doing it. So most of the things that money could buy were done beautifully but the movie didn't really have too much to offer on the other areas.<br/><br/>I left the theatre wondering what on earth were they trying to tell/say to me with that movie. The first half hour of the movie was good enough to stand on its feet, showing the madness of the war. But after that the movie started to stall. There was a lot of useless and over-long scenes that didn't really add anything to the movie. Except maybe a little frustration for the viewer. Length is not a bad thing for a movie, as long as the creators have something to say or to show. In Saving Private Ryan, there seemed not to be.<br/><br/>Technically beautiful, very violent (okay, it's a war movie so maybe it is acceptable) and rather empty movie.

"hypra","Null","0","1","16 October 1998"," Moving but far from profound
","I wonder why the press loves that starting scene of the landing of the allied in the Normandy. The first person camera was shaking so much that I was quite literally thrown out of the scene and this just went on when Miller and his team engaged this german APC or whatever on a green field with flowers. That said, let's continue. The good things about the movie were: The story idea made it possible to blank out any strategical or tactical aspects of war, which either divert the watcher or justifies war itself (lost bla, but saved blabla) ... at least up to a certain point (the value of that bridge was only outlined with ""the one of two remaining intact ones...""). The movie features also very moving graphical effects, by that I mean wounds, lost body parts, outflowing intestines. And also audio effects like the noise of the tanks in the beginning of the German attack on that bridge. I hope you know what I mean. Some nice ideas like the rain drops splashing onto the leaves, making you think that it's like the sound of gunfire, which turns out to be true afterwards. And others which were tragi-comical (soldier takes off his helmet after it luckily deflected a bullet and is promptly...)<br/><br/>But. I don't like the movie. Actually, I hate Spielberg for this ""goddamn"" movie, pardon the term. The very scene, I mean, is when a German and an American soldier fight (attack on bridge) on the first level of one of the houses and the German pulls out his knife and happens to be on top of his ""enemy"". And what then happens must be told in full, as I remember it. The silent whimpering of the soldier as the blade cuts slowly through the fabric of his jacket and then on and on and on and all the time the German whispers: ""Give up, you don't have a chance, it well be easier for you, give up, it be will easier .... Shhh shhh"". Until the blade has fully made its way through chest and heart and the soldier is dead. No bursting out ""you goddamn nazi, I never give up"", no ""ha, ruthless defender of so-called democracy, receive your true punishment"" or whatever. No, two people forced to kill each other and only one can win. THIS scene is still in my mind, all the time and I do hope that it will fade somewhen. But let's cut out that personal stuff of mine ... The movie was great in a way. When those tanks are coming, the little hill behind which the Americans take cover sliding down by the trembling of the ground. Captain Miller pulling a soldier after him at the landing, whose legs are blown away and Miller does not realise it. You really went out of it and were stunned. BUT: The beginning is the weak point in my opinion, the stunning phase happens in the end.<br/><br/>Now on to my general concerns (last paragraph, I swear). I think, war is ""bad"". The ""stupid"" thing about war is that it involves humans and especially the killing of humans. Further on, war is even stranger. Humans kill without any inner motivation, without real hate or anger out of personal reasons (although sister was killed by Germans V2 in London ...). It is so abstract and so unreal. One of the other commenters said, that Full Metal Jacket would score better in showing the futility of war. And that's the point ! Futility, desparation, hopelessness, the lacking of sense and reason ... that is war for me. Concerning humans, there is not a single good thing about war. Lives are simply thrown away, dumped, cannon-fodder.<br/><br/>Open bodies, blown away extremities or injuries like that don't touch me but things like ""soldier A nearly makes it to blabla but just before he reaches it, he's shot"" (remember ""A bridge too far"" when the solider runs for that cylindric box hoping to find ammunition or whatever and there are only hats inside ?) This is war for me. I think, ""Platoon"" is better. I think, ""A bridge too far"" is better. I think, ""The Bridge"" is better. Actually, although all the anti-war-movies I know are inferior in terms of visuals and sound, they all are superior to ""Saving Private Ryan"". The only thing speaking well for all of you is, that good visuals and sounds directly influence unconsciousness..."
"Canaan","Null","0","1","11 October 1998"," What is wrong with SPR...
","First and foremost, this is an awe-inspiring masterpiece of discomfort. Spielberg has succeeded where Stone failed with NATURAL BORN KILLERS - he has made a movie which genuinely affects its audience and serves as an indictment of the cinematic tradition of defying the violent and the warlike, without running the risk of inculcating a cult of violence as cool among the impressionable and the stupid.<br/><br/>SPR moved me to tears within about ten minutes of the opening credits. Wonderful performances from Tom Hanks (a little saccharine actually), Tom Sizemore and - especially - young Giovanni Ribisi.<br/><br/>As in SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg's camera is uncompromising in its gaze, presenting horrific acts of violence and tragedy unblinkingly and without fanfare. Where the earlier film occasionally strayed into manipulative heart-string plucking, however, SPR treads a fine line bordering on hero-worship. To draw comparison with Oliver Stone again, SPR lacks the sense of futility, helplessness and desperation of FULL METAL JACKET.<br/><br/>But then it is a far more didactic enterprise than was JACKET. And in its full-on, vitriolic condemnation of capital-W War,it succeeds admirably. Nausea, tears, exhaustion are all common amongst people leaving a screening. Blase attitudes and take-it-or-leave-it shrugs are not.<br/><br/>Certainly a film which should be seen and pondered upon at length. There is, however, something wrong with Saving Private Ryan....<br/><br/>D-Day 1944, right? Loads of Allied troops dying their way up the beaches of Normandy, right? Mission in the thick of the front line in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, right?<br/><br/>So... WHY DO WE ONLY SEE AMERICANS AND GERMANS? Where are the British soldiers? Where are the Poles, the Czechs, the Dutch? What about the Australians, the Canadians, the Russians? We see a family of three French refugees, but can that really be it? Spielberg seems to be trying to depict WWII as Vietnam but with less greenery and no dope.<br/><br/>Contrary to this film's thesis, WWII was not a war of attrition between the US and the Third Reich. The whole world was involved - hence the first W in WWII. You have to get used to Americocentric conceit in Hollywood movies, but this is one opportunity to present an accurate and unbiased account of the War that has been horribly missed."

Although the film is a little bit too cruel and fleshly, it is a good media to let people think about the reality of a war, a campaign that can ruin millions of lives and souls. The most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed, but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet. Think of it, they are flesh and blood, not the characters in the TV games. Should they be killed just for one or two people's foolish decision? They all have families, they are innocent. I appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal, to save private Ryan and send him home at any cost, he didn't mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fields.<br/><br/>Steven Spielburg has produced a very great movie, different from the other scientific film he had ever made, but it is a most touching film that gives a good lesson to most of the people.

","Like several of the viewers whose comments appear here, I was expecting great things because of all the hype, but was rather disappointed by the film when I actually saw it. True, the opening and closing half hours are very violent, with no holds barred in showing us the horrors of war (but let's face it - is there anyone out there who doesn't realize that war is horrible?)<br/><br/>I think one of the main problems I had with the film was that is was yet another of those nauseating ""America won the war single-handed"" type films (there were no references that I spotted to any other nation's contribution to the D-day landing). I also found the story line rather weak - the idea that a team of men would be dispatched to find one soldier just because his brothers had been killed is hard to swallow. Tragedies such as that must have occurred many times in WW2, and I can't imagine the military would go to those lengths every time it happened.<br/><br/>The script is also rather weak - for most of the middle part of the film, very little happens, and the scenes where the soldiers try to give deep philosophical insight into their feelings about the war just didn't grab me.<br/><br/>Sorry, but it's only a 5 out of 10 for me."

Up to that point all of the horrors of war are exposed for our wretched ""entertainment"".

After how great I had heard SPR was, when I saw it, I was disappointed in the directing, writing and acting. I expected all of those things to be great and found the directing to be pretty good, the writing to be pretty bad and the acting to be mediocre. I'm sorry, but graphic war action which makes us think long and hard about many things is not enough reason for me to love this movie as much as so many other people seem to.

America did not win the war on their own and a bit of recognition for the brave men of EVERY country that died would not have gone amiss. Having the stars and stripes as the opening and ending shot was little more than insulting to these men. Similarly, why were the Germans portrayed as deserving cannon fodder? They were humans too, men fighting for the lives of their friends and family. Why couldn't we see that? Surely the true horror of war is that on both sides we are the same simple men.

An excellent war movie is one with great acting, a great plot, great battle scenes, great direction, great dialog, and likeable characters.

","Yes i enjoyed Saving Private Ryan. Although it was full of Spielberg-esque drama, and not exactly a history lesson here. SPR is very short on the facts that took place during this period in WW2. This movie is basically a story with a plot, that took place during the turning point of WW2. Unlike most war movies, SPR is a movie with fictional characters and the realism of the battle scenes is the only realistic part of SPR. The opening scene was amazing. Better than ""The Longest Day"", which depicts ultra realistic scenes of the infamous D-day invasion of Normandy France. But if your looking for a really great WW2 movie, then purchase A Bridge Too Far. That is by far my favorite WW2 movie of all time. I thought Stephen Spielberg copied the Kubrick method of hand-held camera style filming he used in Full Metal Jacket. It had a documentary feel to it, and Spielberg definatly copied that. But the battle scenes in this film are unmatched, with the excepton of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down...however..*** stars out of 4..well worth the 25 bucks."

If Spielberg likes this effect, I don't.  Not for every single shot in every single battle.<br/><br/>Besides poor camera work, the plot was somewhat thin.  It was a complex plot for a war movie, but it was still lacking.  I would give the screenwriting a ""C"" only because there was some good comic relief.  But the entire movie was so predictable, that the length (over two hours) made the movie languish.  Toward the end, all I wanted was for the men to find Ryan, finish their little war game, and send him home -- so I could go home.<br/><br/>The characters, well, what can we say.  They are stereotypes, what the movie script writers call ""composite"" characters.  The guy who freezes up.  The intellectual.  The guy who's the gung-ho no-frills ground-pounder.

","I saw this movie again last night as a dutch network premiere. I have to say it strengthened my impression after my first viewing some years ago. As war films get, it's one of the best, most realistic and exciting there are. And yet, I don't really understand the big deal that people sometimes make of war films. In my opinion, they shouldn't always by revered as ""important"" films, or be taken with dead-seriousity. After all, no matter how realistic, they are made for entertainment value and little more. This is a movie that has terrific, bloody action, a realistic setting, superb cinematography and production design, well-developed characters, and some emotional moments. But people, is it really anything more than that? It is certainly not a lesson in history. Did private Ryan or captain Miller ever really exist? No. In Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, an obviously superior film, many of the characters shown really did exist. But SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is really just a work of fiction, crafted to manipulate and excite the viewer. I'm not saying that there are major historical innacuracies in it, since I'm not a historian, I'm just saying that it is in no way an extraordinary or transcendental movie experience. It is also far from Spielberg's most accomplished work. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., and JAWS are all clearly on a much higher level, as they all transcend their genres and become something truly extraordinary. PRIVATE RYAN may be a very good war film, but lacks that extra bit of magic to make it truly extraordinary and a masterpiece in ever regard. Like so many war film, it doesn't truly leave an indelible impact on the viewer. And this is a member of the war film genre in every bone of its body. It doesn't surpass films like PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, as the Ultimate War Movie. If you want to see a true masterpiece, a film that is truly unforgettable and extraordinary, don't look for it among the war movies, trust me. See 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. See THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. See RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Those are genuinely extraordinary pictures that transcend the limitations of their genres and bury themselves into your subconscious, never leaving your memories. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, as well as every other war film ever made, can't possibly have that resonance."

","To me, the greatest war movies of all time are those that address the issues of why war is fought to begin with, the psychology of the people who fight it, and human nature in general.  Saving Private Ryan simply does not address any of this.  Spielberg instead packages World War 2 into a neat commercialized container for mass consumption.  The movie, although perhaps more realistic in it's depiction of the violence of war than previous films, has stereotypical and flat characters, little character development, too many stupid one-liners and attempts at humor, and a cliched feel-good ending.  'Saving Private Ryan' is maybe a decent drama, but in no way is it in the upper echelon of war films which ask and attempt to answer the real questions of war.  If you want to see a good war movie which does address the real philisophical issues of war and human nature, and doesn't have a Hollywood-ized happy feel-good ending, go rent 'Platoon' or 'The Thin Red Line'."

The script is flat so the characters are stuck with being either the cocky Jew, the medic who loves his mum, er mom, or the wise guy new Yorker. The scenes in between the action sequences tend to drag, because there's lots of talking, but no one has anything interesting to say. The scene in the church and in the French town near the end seem to last for hours. There's none of the depth of character or analysis of human behaviour that was apparent in Schindler's list. What made that film so shocking was its objectiveness and absence of sentimentality. The same cannot be said for Ryan.<br/><br/> The film has been criticised for only depicting US soldiers in the war, but this is unfair, since its a film about a squad of US soldiers.

He is kneeling by a tombstone in tears with his family around him. At the end of the movie, we return to see Ryan now at what seems to be a different part of the cemetary with his family in the distance. His wife comes over and he says tearfully ""Am I a good man?"" (Referring to the sacrifice others made to save his life). Well, I thought, he should have figured that out by now. Manipulative and cloying, I thought. Then he stands straight, comes to attention, and I think to myself ""Oh, no. Don't salute. It's too obvious. Please don't salute. Don't do it"". He salutes.<br/><br/>The twenty minutes devoted to the Omaha Beach landing are surely the most gruesome, bloodiest twenty minutes ever put on screen. Spielberg captured the horrible reality of war. Bodies are cut in half, limbs are severed, young dying soldiers cry for ""Mama"". This is what is was REALLY like - not a thing was sanitized here. You have to be emotionally dead not to be affected by what those brave men did at that beach, and what they suffered. And by extension, all the men and women who have died in all wars.<br/><br/>
For me, the most devastating scene was the little girl being passed down by her father to the well-meaning soldier, both somehow trying to get her to safety. The soldier is killed, and the little girl scrambles over the rubble to get back to her father. Her father lifts her back up, but she stays an arm's length away, crying uncontrollably, the father trying to draw her to him. She is crying and screaming, and then slaps her father hard in the face. Still crying and yelling at him, she slaps him again. For her, it was the ultimate, unforgiveable sin. For him, he was trying to save her life. But war destroyed this most indestructible bond imaginable between a father and his trusting little girl. This was the greatest horror of the movie."

","I just saw this movie on TV last night, so I missed a lot of the sound effects that I'm sure contributed a great deal to the atmosphere. But based on what I did see, I thought the film had some great things in it, but was still flawed.<br/><br/>Spielberg seemed mainly interested in re-creating the ""feel"" of fighting in WWII, and in many ways he did an excellent job (as far as I can tell, not having been there). The camera work and stunt choreography was often simply astonishing, and I'd like to give a special jaw-drop to the stuntmen who worked on the film. But Spielberg's goal of verisimilitude interfered in some ways with the storyline. I agree with a previous commentator who said that the handheld camera was sometimes distracting and difficult to watch. Having a bunch of extras stroll in front of the lens whenever possible did add to the sense of ""you are there"", but it also made it hard to concentrate on what the main characters were saying. When the screenplay suddenly jumped from cinema verite to heavy symbolism (STOP here if you don't want to learn any details about the plot), with the agonizingly slow death of an American Jewish soldier at the hands of a representative German (while a terror-struck American Goy lies powerless outside), the transition was awkward. (Though such heavyhandedness would have been annoying in almost any film.)<br/><br/>I didn't think the characters were particularly well-drawn--in fact, I couldn't tell them apart much of the time (though I suppose uniforms contribute to that). I got the impression Spielberg didn't want to waste too much time exploring character when he could be terrifying the viewer. In fact, I think some of the film was sadistic, though I'm sure Spielberg would argue that he was simply trying to show the actual horrors of war.<br/><br/>I could have done without the couple of misogynistic anecdotes from some of the soldiers (although probably many soldiers talk like that). One of the previous commentators thought Private Ryan's story about his brothers and a neighborhood girl showed his ""humanity""--I thought it showed that he was an a**hole. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater; I wouldn't want to know how many people laughed at that story. I was grateful for the ""you-disgust-me-but-I'm-trying-not-to-be-obvious-about-it-given-the-difficu lt-situation-we-are-in"" expression on Tom Hanks' character's face when he heard it. (At least, that's how I read it.)<br/><br/>Overall, I think Spielberg took on more than he could chew--he seemed to jump back and forth between epic reenactments and the storyline of his main characters, rather than finding a way to fuse the two into a coherent whole.<br/><br/>I appreciate the war movie recommendations that other commentators made, and would like to add my own: ""Europa, Europa."" But it's really a civilian story, so battlefield fans might not find it so interesting."

","As well as giving a brief review of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, I would also like to give a little bit of the history behind it. Granted, I have not read all 1300+ of the previous reviews that are already here as I begin to type, but I did read one review that I feel I must correct.<br/><br/> Somebody said that the film was loosely based on the Sullivans, who were five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa who all died when their ship, the Juneau, was torpedoed off Guadalcanal in November 1942.  This person was misinformed.  The Sullivans were indeed real men who died in the PTO of the war, and were even mentioned in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (their deaths were the reason that the four Ryan boys were supposedly split up into different units), but the story was in no way based on them.<br/><br/> It is, however, loosely based on the Niland brothers. The real Private Ryan was Sergeant Fritz Niland of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (P.I.R.). He is mentioned in Stephen Ambrose's novel ""Band of Brothers"" as a friend of Donald Malarkey's and Warren ""Skip"" Muck's (played by Scott Grimes and Richard Speight Jr., respectively, in the HBO miniseries.) Shortly after D-Day, Sergeant Niland learned that his brother Bob had been killed. Bob was part of the 82nd Airborne, which was another regiment that jumped behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day. Niland then discovered that another brother, who had been a platoon leader in the 4th Infantry Division, had been killed at Utah Beach. When he returned to his company, a fellow soldier was looking for Niland to tell him that his third and final brother had been killed in the China-Burma-India theater, and that he was supposed to be sent home immediately -- and he was.  No secret search mission. No babysitting bridges. No defying orders. However, like Private Ryan, he did return home to a mother who had recently received death notices for three of her  sons.<br/><br/> There might be some spoilers here, I guess.  Nothing that ruins the ending of the film, though.<br/><br/> Saving Private Ryan's realism is undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to war films (I think ""Band of Brothers"" outdid it, though... then again that came three years later.) The opening D-Day sequence is spectacular, and it really gave the sense of what it was like to be there. Random moments stuck in my head much after the movie had progressed into its search for Ryan (""These're all we've got between us and the Almighty!"" --referring to the cross-steel objects that had been placed on the beach by the Germans in order to rip apart landing crafts on a high tide but actually worked to the advantage of the invading Americans;  Captain Miller's (Hanks) shouting ""tell Shore Party this, tell Shore Party that!"" only to find out that the radio man had a giant hole puncturing his face and that the radio was busted;  one soldier getting shot in the helmet and Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) saying ""Lucky b*****d,"" then the soldier takes off his helmet and is shot in the head; and of course, the terrifying ""Mama!"" screams.) All of these elements, plus the incredible special effects, sounds, realistic-looking beach and amazing costumes make the scene one of the best combat sequences ever filmed.  I really did feel like I was there.<br/><br/> The rest of the movie went downhill. The first time I saw it, I thought the whole movie was fantastic, but on later viewings (the seventh, the eighth... the twelfth, the thirteenth...  yes, that many) I realized I didn't like it as much as I originally thought I did.  Captain Miller and seven men, who are undoubtedly part of the stereotypical combat squad (the hick sharpshooter, the Italian guy, the Jew, the worried guy, the annoying guy everyone hates, the brave Sarge, and the medic who is more concerned about the safety of others than the safety of himself) are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan who has lost three brothers within a week and is to be sent home immediately. Ryan jumped into Normandy with the 506th P.I.R., part of the 101st Airborne (the same Airborne our friends of Easy Company in ""Band of Brothers"" are in), but he's been misdropped and is lost somewhere behind enemy lines... as were about half of the men dropped into Normandy early on D-Day.  Misdrops were everywhere.  Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) calls the mission ""finding a needle in a haystack"" and Miller corrects him, ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.""<br/><br/> The rest of the movie is fantastic in realistically portraying the horrors of war, and the acting is superb by every actor who commits themselves to a role. The actors portray a bunch of World War II Army Rangers as accurately as they can. Much of this is probably thanks to Captain Dale Dye, who put them through a boot camp before the movie began shooting. Dye makes a brief appearance as the War Department Colonel in the beginning of the film (and for ""Band of Brothers,"" which he also helped with to transform actors into soldiers, he had a much larger role as Colonel Robert Sink, and does a great job representing him.) However, as I watched it more and more, the plot grew weak and boring for me. That's something I never thought I'd admit, but I'm admitting it now. I guess I like things of this measure to have actually happened, such as Band of Brothers actually happened... I don't know, it's something about eight guys wondering through all of France to find one guy that begins to disturb me now. I can't put my finger on why. Oh well.  It's still a great film, but simply not the best...<br/><br/> Check out The Thin Red Line for a more philosophical approach and Band of Brothers for a brilliant approach to real events and real characters.<br/><br/> SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - 8/10"

","The first 20-30 mins of war are breath taking, one sits there in wonder as to ""could I have done this?"", or ""what the hell was it like to be there?"", which is where the film for me personally falls down later on, because no matter how undeniably advantageous the presence of the US to allies during the war was, they were'nt the only allies at Dunkirk!! Now admittedly it could be deemed more offensive to have British, Canadian troops etc as guest stars, or bit roles, but I think what nulls this argument is the stars and stripes we are drowned in at the end of the movie!! Now unfortunately comparisons will always be made to the thin red line, if no other reason than because they were released in the same year. There you have an engagement where Americans were the only allies present!!, yet this fact isn't driven down our throats by a flag pole!! The other main gripe is the villian of the feature, the German soldier who we see begging for his life, and who we are made to realise is a human being after all. Quite a moving piece of cinema, which later on is ruined by the reappearance of the said German, all suited up and ready for killing the main characters. ""y'see they should've killed him after all"" a phrase undoubtedly uttered by many people watching, but don't those people hate Germans any way?, wasn't it a bolder move to let us feel sorry for him and leave it at that? Overall an over-hyped film all explosions and fairy tale, from let's face it the most over-hyped director in the world. ""I liked jaws but....."""

","American, overlong, sentimentally contrived, brutally realistic, overrated but still worthy of high praise, `Saving Private Ryan' is a testament to what can be done to highlight moments of a country's history.<br/><br/>Okay I admit I am British-born and I am going to mention the lack of any other nationality in the film, so I shall start with this obvious moot point.<br/><br/>What annoys people is that Tom Hanks' unit never comes across someone of another nation as they move inland and not the superlative and startlingly realized opening. Anyone who knows the slightest bit of history knows that the airborne forces were miss-dropped all over Normandy. Having said that if we British complain so much about the non-representation of our forces in American films why don't we make something equally as jaw-dropping, after all most of the technicians on the film were British? I'll tell you why not. After the release of his film `A Bridge Too Far' in 1977, director Richard Attenborough said he would never make another film whilst participants in the historical event were still alive. Why? Because veterans of the Parachute Regiment complained that they had been made out to be TOO heroic. Hollywood makes `U-571' we make `Enigma', go figure.  We should stop taking pot shots at our American cousins, who did bail us out of the war even if it was late in coming, and make some films to redress the balance.<br/><br/>What rankles the most is the underhand way in that Spielberg comments on Field Marshall Montgomery. So he was egotistical  show me a military leader who isn't but to have two field officers passing judgement?? Come on. The soldiers I spoke to were more bothered about keeping themselves alive than worrying about how they rated their commanders. Most of my family were killed in China, many of my South African relatives fought in Africa and Europe. My grandfather and father's friends included bomber pilots, paras and Chindits, so I understand the need to honour these men. I have visited Pointe Du Hoc and I have full admiration for the Rangers that tackled their objectives. But I digress.<br/><br/>The opening is phenomenal and is being recreated, derisorily, time and again in computer games. Nothing has captured the sense of what it must have been like but this goes some way to accomplishing that. The first time viewed I don't think I breathed out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately after such a visceral experience there is always going to be a comedown, physiologically this is what is going to happen with adrenalin and thus the viewer is unwittingly experiencing what an infantryman might have gone through. The comedown for the audience however, is in the film's pacing.<br/><br/>The mid-section does drag and yes maybe this is to show the lulls between the fighting etc. But if I wanted to experience boredom and nothing I would do nothing. Or I would watch `The Thin Red Line' a truly dull experience. Indeed this lack of pacing is noticeable on repeat viewing.<br/><br/>The characterization is not fully realized for such a running time and many of the characters remain clichéd eg: dependable Sarge, the coward. Nevertheless this does not detract from the film as the casting compensates in their visual appearance. From just their looks we are compelled and can empathize.<br/><br/>The cinematography, editing, and sound are all first rate, as we have come to expect from Spielberg although the shafts of light were unnecessary. The washed out colours added a texture of reality and, with the age of digital film-making, the look of the film is far from the normal sheen of fantasy - an edge of documentary lending itself.<br/><br/>On a technical note, and perhaps superficial, there are a few errors that irritate. Firstly why do they use the mortar shells when they have grenades on their belts, which stay unused? Having practised fire support team drills why does Mellish not carry the spare ammo? The unit has two bazookas and yet they leave one lying around. Lastly continuity should have picked up the fact that Tom Hanks' pistol suffers stoppages twice consecutively when he is firing at the Tiger tank, an impossibility. But these are minor complaints.<br/><br/>
Overall ****/*****  far better than `The Thin Red Line' and on a par with `A Bridge Too Far'."

","Saving Private Ryan is the most over-rated film of the 1990s.  If you were to see the film according to the reviews you'd think it was the best film of all time, which is far from the truth.  The first 30 minutes, for one thing, have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie! While the opening is admittedly the best part of the film in terms of accuracy and its intensity, it simply shouldn't be there.  It appears that the Normandy scene is just there so Stephen Spielberg can tell us what a ""great"" director he is.  While the opening scene may be accurate the ending is right out of the Dirty Dozen in its implauabilty with something like 12 soliders taking out no less then what seems to be 75 nazis!  I will say that I enjoyed the film and it is by no means bad, all I am saying is that the film is not as great as people say.  I believe that in the summer of 1998 critics simply saw who was directing and starring in the film and thought right away it was going to be a 4 star movie which it wasn't. If your looking for a great war film see Glory, Gettysburg, or Spielbergs own Empire of the Sun. I give the film 8 out of 10."

"joegerardi-1","Null","0","1","17 August 2001"," Get over yourselves, negativists!
","Whilst SPR might not be the be-all and end-all war movie, I take great humor in reading most of the negative reviews on this movie. Many have nothing at all to do with the movie per se, but more with people's gripes about how other nations were portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>GET OVER IT!<br/><br/>The movie portrays the efforts of the American Rangers on Omaha Beach. That's O-MA-HA. Not Gold, not Sword, not Juno. That's why there's no portrayal of French, Canadian, or British troops.<br/><br/>It seems to me, that any time there is a movie that shows what the US did in WWII, and doesn't give equal time to the other allied troops, everyone needs to kvetch. What most seem to forget is that the US lost more troops than all the other allied forces combined, that they spent more than all the other counties, (which still have not paid the US back) and were it not for the US's involvement in WWII, all of Europe would today be wearing lederhosen and playing the accordian. This from a country that was not directly affected by the events taking place in Europe<br/><br/>Similarly, I read many reviews taking umbrage with the negative comments directed towards Montgomery.<br/><br/>GET OVER IT!<br/><br/>Monty was a megalomaniac with a serious case of p*n*s envy because he couldn't run the whole show. Patton proved that he could out-battle, out-tactic, and out-run Monty in any theatre of war. Granted, Monty had some success in Africa, but he spent the rest of the war whining to Eisenhower for equal authority, and supplies, which (I believe) Eisenhower gave him to shut him up, at the expense of Patton's troops, who were taking names and kicking butt. What did Monty do? Why Operation Market Garden, of course. An operation that pretty much decimated all the allied forces that took part in it.<br/><br/>Next, I read about so many people finding the middle of the movie boring. Do these commentators forget the adage about war being ""long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror?"" What did you expect, that they fight a gazillion troops all the way to Ryan, and fight their way back out again unscathed? War IS like that. It is NOT like the current action movies out there today, where the hero might get grazed by a bullet and continue to fight, only to get the girl in the end.<br/><br/>I also read about the Germans being demonized in this movie. How quickly they forget Auschwitz; how quickly they forget Dachau. How quickly they forget that as an occupying force, the Germans raped whomever they pleased, shot whomever they pleased. Millions of Germans bought into Hitler's promises. They willingly went to war for him. They tried to conquer the world, and cared not for the innocents they were slaughtering along the way.<br/><br/>So don't whine about it. In this politically-correct, liberal, UN ""Peace-Keeping"" day, we forget that soldiers were encouraged back then to HATE their enemy; to believe him the devil. They called the enemy ""Krauts,"" and ""Nips,"" and ""Eye-Ties,"" so that when the time came to kill them, soldiers were able to do it. Back then we fought until they were defeated. Today, we do it until they say ""I'm sorry,"" and then pay them billions of dollars to rebuild. Finally, remember the scene after the US took the beach: The scene of Americans carelessly shooting surrendering enemy forces. Don't try to say that it was one-sided.<br/><br/>Lastly, I saved the D-Day beachhead for last. Too many people have commented that this was too gory, too long, too dully filmed, and not an accurate depiction of how war really is. To that, I can only offer this: Why then, did so many veterans of that invasion feel the need to walk out of the movie, stating that they couldn't watch it because it was too real? Why did many veterans cry during this scene? As to it being too dully filmed, please check your history: The invasion had been postponed several times because the weather was too rainy, and as late as the day before, it was pouring rain up and down the French coast, and in England as well.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan might not be the best war film ever made, but it is the best war film made TO DATE."

"jpgburnett","Null","0","1","5 August 2001"," A trifle disappointing
","I'm not gonna make a bucket-load of friends with this review, but I'm sorry, Saving Private Ryan left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. (Note:one or two spoilers ahead!)<br/><br/>Firstly, the story is, well, stupid. The American army sends 8 men, under the command of Cpt. Miller (Tom Hanks), to go behind enemy lines is Normandy (just after D-day), to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), as his mother has already received telegrams informing her that her three eldest sons have been killed. A)It's simplistic; B)The army is not that compassionate. I'm sorry, it wouldn't happen, not then, not now.<br/><br/>It's a shame, as the film has loads of qualities, like most Spielberg movies. There are the battle scenes, which are immensely realistic. The beginning 'beach scene' is like watching a documentary, it seems so real and true to reality. In fact, most of the battle scenes are great, they're all very exciting. This is due to the great camera work: hand-held, and  to the effects: the sets are fabulous, the music is absent during battles, for realism, and the scenes are bloody and realistically disturbing. Saving Private Ryan best invokes the chaos of war. Full Metal Jacket evoked war's stupidity, Paths of Glory was about the wastefulness of combat, and Deer Hunter (my favourite war movie) was about it's heartlessness. Bur 'Ryan' creates scenes of madness and chaos, in keeping with the madness of the mission. With the exception of Hanks and Damon, the acting is terrific. Adam Goldberg, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi and Tom Sizemore are great, as is most of the cast.<br/><br/>Yet these qualities are wasted by a lot of drawbacks. I can make my peace with the story, it can be called poetic license, although, the supposingly compassionate American army did send hundreds and thousands of G.I.s to their deaths by making the land on and storm the beaches of Omaha and Utah, which were surrounded by easily-defended but hard-to-attack cliffs, from which the Germans easily massacred the advancing American troops. If they had chosen a duned beach like the English and the Canadians did, the casualties would have half those suffered. But I digress. What I don't like is the reckless clicheing. There's Upham, a detestable character, seen in about every war or adventure film ever. He's wimpy, feeble, and never uses violence. Oh, and his complacent wetness results in the deaths of several of his squad-members. Yet he's a corporal. Let's face it, he wouldn't have gotten past training. Also, the Germans are pictured to be monsters. They are the enemy, only there to be killed or to kill, and they are always more treacherous than the good old trusty G.I.s, who all have hearts of gold, even the aggressive Rieben (Burns), who is another cliche character, by the way. I mean, just look at the German they release, who comes back and cold-bloodedly kills a couple of our goodies, and is made instantly hateable. While watching it, my mum cried 'Kill that b*st*rd German!' I rest my case. Finally, the ending is awfully twee. The death at the end reminds me of every sappy film on earth: the tears, the whispering voice, the brave face, the honorable death. My God, it's like E.T.! I admit it, I laughed! Radio Flyer is less Sappy! As I said, I don't like Hanks or Damon. Damon is sort of smartass, big-headed yob, just like in Good Will Hunting (why did everyone like that movie?). And Hanks is just being Hanks. He's just reprising his Philadelphia persona, but at least it was original back in 1993. You know, he's all goody two-shoes, all honest and pure, and he's a tad over-weight, I hate to say it. He's almost as twee as in Castaway, which is a dreadful movie. I've only enjoyed watching Tom hanks in two movies: Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. At least in those, his performances were original!<br/><br/>It's a shame that Spielberg leaves realism behind halfway through 'Ryan', and turns to sentimentality and sappiness, because the beginning announces great stuff. A shame. 5/10<br/><br/>Uppers: 1)Great camerawork; 2)Realistic battle scenes; 3)Great sound; 4)Dramatic portrayal of the chaos of war; 5)The supporting cast<br/><br/>Downers: 1)Hanks and Damon are a four letter word rhyming with trap; 2)Riddled with cliches; 3)Upham's character: what a stereotype; 4)What is this, The Dam Busters? Why don't they just run up screaming ""Filthy krauts!"" and ""Dirty Jerry!""? What a manichean portrayal of the Germans! Quite tasteless; 5)The ending is downright trite!<br/><br/>A quick note: It's amazing how, in the U.K. and France at least, Spielberg avoids severe certificates. Jurassic Park easily warranted a 12, it is a PG-13 in the U.S. After all, a man's arm does get ripped off! In Schindler's List, we witness the horrendous mistreatment and murder of Jews, plus several scenes of nudity, yet it remains a 15. And in 'Ryan', people are disembowled and shot to bits in grisly detail, yet it is also only a 15. I agree that we need to be more liberal, but why does Spielberg alone get this special treatment. I see it as a tribute to his talent as a director (apart from Saving Private Ryan and E.T.)."

","Saving Private Ryan is a very good movie. It isn't entirely historically accurate, but it is a movie and doesn't really bother me.<br/><br/>I'm Canadian, {For anyone who is wondering what country a Canadian comes from it is Canada, the one above the U.S.A.} and it does bother me that there isn't a Canadian or British soldier in sight. Truth be told only Canada reached its D-Day objective, though it was a single tank unit. Anyone who is fuzzy on history, there was more than one landing at D-Day, there was five in fact. Two by Britain, two by American and one by Canada. So other than omitting the existence of two countries that was fighting WWII long before America got into it, I liked the movie. Also Tom Hanks was in the movie and, I think he will go down in history with names like Gregory Peck or Jimmy Stewart. The Omaha Beach invasion is most definitely the goriest scene in any movie in history. Even last years Gladiator doesn't even come close. A spectacular scene that is breath taking in the fact that it actually happened and real men were doing what Tom Hanks did. This is a very good movie. Simply put it is the best World War movie I have ever seen {Not saying much I'm young}."

","I typed a comment about this before, and now I've had time to rethink it. There is only one major source for my distaste for this movie - Robert Rodat. He trashes almost every country he can when he can except America, which he tries to make out as brilliant and valiant and heroic etc. I mean, where were the other armies at the D-Day landings? It wasn't just the Yanks who landed there! And Monty overrated? Come on Robert! The fact that this guy wrote The Patriot only shows his ignorant Brit-dissing even more. Randall Wallace is another culprit of this super duper pro-American-anti-everyone-else sentiment. I mean in Braveheart the Brits are made out to be totally evil, which is just pure rubbish. Plus he scripted Pearl Harbor, which did its damnedest to make the Americans not look stupid over the attack - the only good movie about Pearl Harbor is Tora! Tora! Tora!, which got it's history correct down to the smallest detail.<br/><br/>My major gripe said, this film is gripping from start to finish. The tension really builds up in the landing craft at the start, and the landings really do stun you. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork is a great defining feature of this movie and deservedly won an Oscar. John Williams' score wasn't very apparent, but when it was it was effective enough but rather repetitive. The characters and the moral question behind the story are also well put out to dry, as in why several soldiers for one? And Captain Miller's last words really do express how he felt about going to save Private Ryan.<br/><br/>All in all by my reckoning, a half decent war movie that is needlessly pro-American and disses other countries. Mind you, this is probably the main reason it won any Oscars."

","Warning spoiler alert!<br/><br/>
	You can't fault one for claiming that every thing that occurs after the tumultuous D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan is anticlimactic.  True one supposes, but not really apposite.  The remainder of this Spielberg tour de force would have made an exceptional film, but the opening sequence must truly be judged sui generis.<br/><br/>
	That particular maelstrom on the Omaha beach is as impressive a display of controlling disorder as any in filmmaking.  The obstreperous milieu, the frenetic panic (adroitly interspersed with slow motion to show the effect of the fulmination), and the recherché violence (to the point where many vets have claimed that the auteur went beyond the actual level of blood and gore) are all here in sobering collusion and detail.<br/><br/>
	The rest of the film is still well worth viewing, it simply cannot carry the same weight in motion picture achievement that the D-Day beginning does. The plot and dialogue are good and the acting is well done (no standout performances, the historical background is the star).  Also several scenes are striking: General Marshall's eloquent reading of President Lincoln's letter, the mother losing her strength on the porch as she meets the announcers of her children's demise, the morphing of the young Ryan into the older man.  It is a fantastic picture overall, but just doesn't seem to reach the epic standard of, say Braveheart, that it seems to be reaching for."
"StorytellerK","Null","0","1","3 June 2001"," What a toss....
","Okay, I'll start with something positive.  Those scenes - you know, *those* scenes, which everybody would not stop crapping on about being so bloody brilliant, that is the opening battle scenes of the D-Day invasion - are done, yes, almost brilliantly.  Perhaps it was merely the choice not to pull any punches in portraying graphic deaths and mutilations, (or maybe it was just the fact the volume was cranked up to extreme rock gig levels at the cinema I was in), but the battle scenes of this movie were actually done very, very well.  I - and I say this as one who has watched one hell of a lot of war movies over the years - was quite impressed.<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the movie was an utter crock of s**t.  I've probably seen worse, but when it's accompanied by the kind of hype this one came hand in hand with, it's hard to remember that fact.  I think the problem for me was that it purported to be so much *more* - more of what I don't know, 'art' maybe, or serious historical narrative, or cinematic realism, perhaps - but really, it wasn't even just a good old shootem'-bangem' war movie.  Personally, I like my war movies best when they're high on the intellectual ponderings of the ambiguous nature of good and evil and all that pretentious style jazz.  However, I'm also rather partial now and then to a good old, superficial war action flick with lots of fake violence and intriguing plot twists of the Alister Maclean variety.<br/><br/>This film failed on all accounts.  It tried to be an intelligent, thoughtful movie about the horrors of war and the nature of heroism, but frankly, it stank.  Here's the litmus test for this film - take out the aforementioned well done battle scenes, and what do you have?  A tired, old, extremely cliched, badly written, and above all, boring, war movie of the kind we all thought the war movie genre had moved on from decades ago.  But hey, I shouldn't just bag it out without some reasons, now, should I?<br/><br/>Firstly - if you're going to hype up about historical accuracy in the promotions for your movie, at least make sure the damn thing actually is historically accurate.  Yet, as far as actual history goes, this movie is so inaccurate they may as well claimed WWII consisted of martians invading New York and the Americans fighting them off (oh, hang on, that was the season before's blockbuster).  Now, I understand that this is a movie, not a documentary, and certain dramatic elements are necessary to sustain interest, (not that they worked).  It's fiction.  Fine, I'm happy with that - in fact, I'll go as far to say that in normal circumstances I don't give much of a toss whether it has any historical accuracy at all.  Only in this case historical accuracy was one of the selling points of the damn film.<br/><br/>For all you kiddies who may get your history lessons from the movies, let me just repeat - this movie is very, very badly HISTORICALLY INACCURATE.  If you want to know exactly how, as I don't have time to go into every detail here, go look it up.  You know, in a *book*.<br/><br/>(Scary aside here: I used a military metaphor with a bunch of fifteen year olds recently, who looked at me blankly at mention of the Gulf War and had no knowledge whatsoever of the social, cultural and political circumstance surrounding WWII.  Yet their eyes all lit up with recognition when, in desperation, I turned to Saving Private Ryan to illustrate my point.  Ugh.)<br/><br/>Yes, before you ask, I have studied the period.  Extensively.  And frankly, if the Germans were as dumb as they were portrayed in this movie, why did it take so long for US to win the war?  Oh, and another thing - just where was everyone else?  I know criticisms of Hollywood being overly US-centric are so common as to be cliched themselves these days, but really, as far as I can see from this movie, the Americans were the *only* ones in the war. I'm sure they only let the Germans in because to have Americans fighting Americans would have produced just a tad too much ambiguity, and we couldn't have that, now, could we?  (I must admit, I'm getting a bit bored with the whole America saves the world again thing... though at least in 'Armageddon' I could laugh at Bruce Willis' sacrifical ending.  One of the top ten hysterical film moments of the decade, that one.)<br/><br/>The acting was pretty much as you'd expect, Hanks was fine, the rest backed him up without any major problems, I didn't truly notice the performances to tell you the truth, either good or bad.  The sets were, of course, wonderful, to back up the elaborate battle scenes.  The rest, well, what else can I say?<br/><br/>Characters were cliched, badly so.  The nature of war was reduced to a very superficial good Americans versus evil Germans, and - *shudder*, dread I say it, - a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.  Not even cheap, b-grade action flick war films rely on that foolish mantra anymore.  We've seen it all before, it's boring, and it's above all, *dumb*.<br/><br/>(Talking about dumb, another scary aside:  Walking out of the cinema after seeing this film, a twenty something couple were walking arm in arm just ahead of us.  She asks him: ""What war was that?""  He replies:  ""The Vietnam War, baby.""  Oh, the humanity.)<br/><br/>All in all, maybe I'm a fool for expecting something worthwhile to come out of all the money and effort spent on this film - I should know better, big budget blockbusters rarely, if ever, deliver.  This one purported to be more than just a blockbuster, however.  It promised thoughtful intelligent treatment of the subject matter.  Unfortuantely, it failed. Miserably."

","I commend Steven Spielberg on this spectacular movie. Saving Private Ryan is, or at least it should be, one of the best war films ever created. From the beginning and until the end of the movie i hardly blinked (or even breathed during some scenes). One of the reasons which made me appreciate this film more is that i saw it with my grandfather... who happens to be a veteran of WW2. Even though he wasn't at Omaha Beach, or even saw as much action as the men in the movie did, i could tell how he felt by looking at how he watched the movie with his eyes and how his posture was. This movie was also one of the only movies i have ever seen him not fall asleep during. That is only one of the many good reasons why this film was enthralling. The characters were also well picked despite the fact that alot of the actors in this movie were actors that don't star in many films. Not only that but Spielberg made these actors live as actual soldiers lived at that time so that they would get the feel of how a soldier really felt. Tom Hanks was also phenomenal  for his part (as always)and each other actor acted so well that you feel terrible when one of them gets killed or hurt because you like each one of these soldiers... err uhh actors i mean. The cinematography was top notch and that goes for costumes,sound,graphics,backgrounds, and any other things that would make a movie worth seeing over and over again. Of course this film isn't for everyone... especially those of you who are squeamish or sensitive and this probably isn't for children either. But for those of you who are in the mood to see an amazing, well-done, action packed, heart felt, movie then rent this one anytime. Oh yeah this is also one of those movies that are alot greater on big-screen.. if you know what i mean. Enjoy every scene!!!"

It looked very good and the direction was well done, but it just seemed a bit trite to really push it beyond the average.<br/><br/>The story was pretty lame, and all through the movie you get beaten over the head with morals and messages about how war is bad and peace is good. The big battle scene in the beginning starts out well but by the end it becomes a case of ""yes, we all know war is bad. Could you get on with the movie now?"".<br/><br/>The characters seem pretty false and boring. They have the usual hollywood moments (when they want tension they make the characters yell a lot, when they want a big cathardic climax they have string music and a short, ""deep"" sentence) which make it seem less a serious work and more a money-making device that uses ""tricks of the trade"" to make audiences think they are watching a good movie.<br/><br/>And all the jingoistic flag-waving was a bit monotonous ( i don't think American filmmakers realise how scarily fanatical it makes Americans look).

Perhaps Spielberg was a little bit too preoccupied with making the battle scenes realistic, or maybe there's just something wrong with me, I don't know.

When you observe the two bookend scenes of the old man and his family, and the American Flag--it says much.  I think it is a question of values and morals.  Far to many people watch Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" and can only think that war is evil, and anything that goes back to WWII is graphically irrepressible.  While ""Platoon"" is a great adaptation of the Vietnam War and I'll endorse it for that conflict, and why we should never have been there, all one has to do is see Spielberg's earlier epic of ""Schindlers List"" to realize why WWII was right for America to be in.  All too often these politically correct values that came out of the Vietnam War era seam to go against what often are traditional American Values such as home and family.  ""Nothing is worth losing one's life for"" I think is a bad attitude that has resided in our society for the past three decades or more.  ""Make Love not War"" seams to have replaced any moral values we once had as a society.  ""The risking of the lives of eight men"" to find one is a scenario that troubles those who think in this purely secular way.  I'm certainly greatful to those of that earlier generation that were called upon to fight.  Something I don't think the later could do even if confronted with such a threat to personal freedoms that Nazi Germany represented at that time.<br/><br/>This is a great show for older Teens (14-15 and older).  To those who feel this show should have received an NC-17 rating take a look at your thinking as stated above.  If the MPAA had a split R rating as most other Nations Ratings Boards have, Mr. Spielberg I'm sure would argue and I would agree that it should go into the lower of the two (MA or M-14). If you're a moral person you'll like this show and the story of heroism, courage and honor it brings to the screen, but if you're a purely secular person with more humanist values you won't.  I too feel it was the greatest heist that ""Shakespeare in Love"" narrowly edged it out for best picture for 1998.

Shakespeare in Love is a good movie, but nowhere near as powerful and thought-provoking as Saving Private Ryan.  The fact that this movie didn't win Best Picture is a crime.<br/><br/>I have seen War Movies such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and The Thin Red Line, and none of these movies reaches quite reaches the standard established by Saving Private Ryan (though they are all excellent movies in their own right).  The acting, dialogue, and action is top notch.  Though some of the movies do come close ,but Saving Private Ryan presents the most disturbing images I have ever seen in a movie of this genre.<br/><br/>A friend of mine complains that Speilburg is too cheesy in how he show the American Flag at the end of the movie.  There is nothing cheesy about that at all.  The flag represents among other things, the people who fought and died in all wars past and present.  I hardly call that cheese.  He also claims that because it is more uplifting than Full Metal Jacket, that it does not convey to full lengths the reality of war.  I agree that it is more uplifting than Full Metal Jacket (though war movies in general are anything, but uplifting), the setting and mood of the war reflect each individual film.  Vietnam was the most unpopular war in American History.  It had very little support by the masses and the outcome was horrendous for America. The fact that we lost the war at the cost of thousands of lives gave this war a more naturalistic outlook than movies based upon World War 2.  In that the war the good guys won as America had a more moral cause to defeat the Axis powers and free the imprisoned and avenge the victims of the Nazi's genocidal regime.  This mostly explains why Saving Private Ryan was not as naturalistic as movies that took place in Viet-Nam such as Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.<br/><br/>If there was one movie I would ask anyone to see it would be this movie. Saving Private Ryan fulfills masterfully the mood and tragedies of war, and the price of American sacrifice.  A masterpiece."

","This is one of the greatest films ever made.  It came out providing competition to another good war film ""The Thin Red Line"" but for those who know what they're talking about, it's obvious the latter didn't even put up a contest.  The first 28 minutes of SPR are a work of art.  If you think otherwise then try and do it better yourself.  The manner in which it is filmed has influenced other films such as ""Gladiator"".  In regards to the comments some make saying that the film is to ""USA"", have you noticed that the film follows A GROUP OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS!!!  It is about their struggle amidst certain events like D-Day. As for cliches, what isn't a cliche today?  To say that human struggle when young, watching your friends due around you, not knowing if it's your turn to die tomorrow, watching not just people's homes but their lives destroyed by a war is not a cliche and for those who think differently, get a humanity transplant.<br/><br/>This is a gripping film that makes you part of the group, a compatriot in this mission and not many films allow you to get so close to the characters. A cliche ridden film is the remake of ""The Thin Red Line"" by Terrance Malick, but true masterpiece, true emotion is found in the story of Capt. John H Miller, a man who has lost so many men under his command, who tries to save one."

"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","1","10 September 2000"," One of the most realistic WWII movies ever made
","This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time.  It was very good, but nowhere near that good.  It probably qualifies as the one of best WWII films made after 1970.  There were dozens of great films with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds.<br/><br/>The story was about a rescue mission to find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive, because all his brothers had been killed in the war.  The platoon was commanded by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who had to take his men through enemy controlled territory to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  It is a combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than about Private Ryan himself.  Other than Captain Miller, there wasn't very much character development, but there was a good deal of time devoted to the human dynamics within the platoon, which was excellent. <br/><br/>What really stands out about this film is the direction.  Steven Spielberg has created probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made. The scenes on the beach at Normandy were terrifying.  This should be required viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle.  Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is unparalleled.  <br/><br/>The entire ensemble cast did a terrific job.  Tom Hanks, as always, was masterful as Captain Miller.  He struck just the right balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were going through, and the hard-nosed military man who had to force them to do a job they didn't want to do.<br/><br/>I rated this film an 8/10.  It wasn't the greatest WWII story ever told, but it may have been the greatest telling of such a story.  This film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally gory.  It is definitely not for the squeamish."
"chrisbrown6453","9","0","1","7 September 2000"," What a great epic war movie this is!
","I'm not saying that Shakespeare in Love wasn't a good movie, just that epic films such as Ryan are almost always due the Academy Award for Best Picture.  The names Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks already have the term `Academy Award winner' in front of them, and when you get both of those big names together, you get the best picture made in 1998.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, a high school English teacher sent off to fight in the war.  The movie opens with a very dramatic 15 minute `massacre' on the beach.  Miller, along with his company of troops, takes out a group of German soldiers manning a huge gun spraying bullets on the rest of the allies.  <br/><br/>After the battle, Miller learns of his new orders of seeking out a soldier by the name of Ryan.  It seems this Private James Francis Ryan is the last of 4 sons sent to fight in the war.  The other 3 sons have been killed and the U.S. Army deemed it necessary to extract the last of the Ryan brothers before he is ultimately killed as well.  There is a very poignant scene where Ryan's mother receives a message delivered by some Army diplomats telling her that 3 of her sons have died.  This is a very well put together story, all the way down to how difficult it would actually be to find a paratrooper in WWII.<br/><br/>Tom Sizemore (Sgt. Michael Horvath), Vin Diesel (Pvt. Adrian Caparzo), Giovanni Ribisi (Medic Irwin Wade), and Matt Damon (Pvt. James Ryan) round out this star-studded cast.  By far the best performance is by, of course, Tom Hanks.  His ability to act in any surrounding; be it on top of the Empire State Building (Sleepless in Seattle), in cyber-space (You've Got Mail), or in a department store jumping on a large foot piano (Big) Tom Hanks is definitely one of today's greatest actors. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan takes us on a trip across the battlefields to find Pvt. Ryan and get him home to the states.  The film has some very dramatic sub-stories and a few slightly funny scenes.  Steven Spielberg very carefully created a movie that will have you shocked from the seriousness of the opening scene, to laughing at some of the lines, to crying from some of the very sad moments of this film.<br/><br/>The vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski made this epic film what it is. The camera angles used created the feeling of actually being there next to Vin Diesel as he is taking out the enemy sniper.  <br/><br/>Due to the heroics shown in the opening sequence, we develop a likening with the main characters especially Capt. John Miller, and throughout the film, we are told more and more about their backgrounds.  Another very cleaver addition to this film if that the Captains men have this continuing bet going about Capt. Millers personal background; and by the middle of the movie we are told what it is he did before being sent to fight in this war. <br/><br/>
When the Academy Awards handed out the award for Best Director to Steven Spielberg, I was happy, and just waiting for them to announce Ryan the Best Picture also.  However, when they called out Shakespeare in Love as the Best Picture winner, I was stunned!  To reiterate, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, just that if Spielberg was deemed the best director, how come his film wasn't considered the best of the year?  It's no surprise that I'm not a fan of giving the Best Director award, and Best Picture award to two different pictures as they have done in many years including 27-28, '56, '81, and most recently '89.  It just doesn't sound right to me. <br/><br/>
With all that said, there are a few mistakes in the film as every movie does; however Saving Private Ryan is definitely one of the greatest epic films joining the ranks of Braveheart, and Schindlers List.  This movie must not be missed by anyone who calls themselves human."

","I remember the day I went to see First Blood in the theaters.  I thought that it was a good movie with plenty of character development and a simple storyline.  However, when Rambo II came out...there was such an outcry because it was being racist in the way it portrayed the arabs.  It was much too violent too.  There were protests in the street and news articles in the magazines devoted two-page spreads on the ravages of war.  Enter ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I finally saw the movie and was left with my mouth open. Don't get me wrong...I love war movies and I love movies that have a sense of purpose to the killings that go on during the film.  However, with this movie it was different.  I was left empty.  Absolutely no feelings whatsoever once it was over.  I really didn't care after a while seeing soldiers die or explode for that matter in the heat of battle.  It was kinda boring after a while.  It's funny, I get more from watching ""Scarface"" then from seeing this movie.  This movie did not have one iota of character development.  Not one tiddle.  You think that with all the hoopla during the Oscars that it was a good movie...now I know why ""Shakespear In Love"" won Best Picture...because it was entrenched in emotion and the audience cared for the characters.  In Saving Private Ryan I got to the point where I said...who cares.  It was long, drawn out and boring.  Speilberg should stick with dinosaurs...he gets more responses from them then the actors in this movie (shoot, the dinosaurs were digital or mechanical...there's a clue).  What I can't get is that the movie won Speilberg all these world awards for bringing people to the awareness of the ravages of World War II (ah...yeah).  ""The Thin Red Line"" did that too...I didn't see that director honored for his achievement...hmm, maybe because he was trying to make a movie that actually was good and not appealing to award councils.  Oh yeah, when I said I got more out of ""Scarface"" it wasn't a joke...in fact, ""Goodfellas"" was even better than this movie...and Saving Private Ryan had way more violence then both these 2 movies combined.  Anyway, I think that Speilberg should stick with E.T.s and let other directors do the war stuff. Oh yeah, when this movie was over I thought...""Gee, all I have to do is make a movie with a historical context and I be a famous director"".  Nah...I'd rather go back and watch Rambo movies, they are much more docile."

Too many war movies try too hard to grind an axe;  we are the good guys, or war is bad, or war is heroic, or something.

"JAM-31","10","0","1","15 May 2000"," Still Great, despite criticisms (some spoilers)
","This is my favorite movie of all time, and it is a great one.  Like all great movies, it has unfortunately become prone to backlash and criticism. I think that almost all of it is unfair; the movie is brilliant, and it is not supposed to be a `typical' war film.  Instead of talking about the film itself, I actually feel compelled to defend this masterpiece.<br/><br/>First of all, what people bash more than anything are its `bookends' in the military cemetery.  Every war movie has its own theme-`Full Metal Jacket' was about men dehumanized into killers, `Gallipoli' was about soldiers as individuals, and SPR is about the sacrifices that WWII veterans made that we no longer appreciate.  The `bookends' would not have worked in `The Thin Red Line,' or `Apocalypse Now,' but they are necessary here.  True, they are a little overly sappy, and the Ryan family's girls are so attractive it is distracting.  But one of the major points of this movie is that many of us have forgotten what the veterans of this war did for us, and that we no longer appreciate the sacrifices they made.  Far too often do younger people look at those from the war generation with indifference and disrespect.  I am a WWII buff, and ever since I started reading about it in high school, I was always bothered by the fact that nobody seemed to care about it.  The faded flags that open and close the movie are not symbols of patriotism-they are our fading appreciation for WWII veterans' sacrifices.  I am happy that SPR brought a renewed interest in this subject.<br/><br/>SPR is about the American GI's experiences in WWII Europe, and Spielberg is not claiming with this film that people of other nations did not help or die fighting fascism with us.  The Second World War almost covered the entire globe.  I would never complain about the lack of Americans in `Soldier of Orange,' or `Hope and Glory,' two great films that are about the Dutch and British experiences, respectively.<br/><br/>SPR is not as black and white as many people claim it is.  The Germans are not all `EVIL MONSTERS' in this movie; Isn't it Americans who sadistically shoot Germans (actually Czechs) who are most obviously surrendering?  The `Steamboat Willie' Character is just a soldier doing his job--he later comes back and shoots Americans, after Miller's squad released him (and NO, he is NOT the SS Trooper that stabs Mellish with a bayonet!)  Miller made the mistake of letting `Steamboat Willie' go, because it seemed the `decent thing to do.'  But was it?  A POW who is let go cannot be expected to surrender--what do we expect him to do?  Tell his army upon meeting them that he can no longer shoot at Americans? According to the Video Hound book on war movies, the SS Trooper who stabs Mellish tells him, in German, `Don't fight it.  Soon this will be over.  You're going to a better place.'  He is mercifully killing his enemy. He also lets Col. Upham live, since Upham poses no threat to him.  This soldier is a good soldier, unfortunately on the opposite side.  To many, it may seem like the Germans are depicted as monsters in this movie.  But we must look deeper, and remember that men under fire don't really care what nice guys their enemies are outside of war.  And comments like, `The German army were not Nazis.  They were just soldiers' are as much generalizations as saying `all Germans were Nazis.'  There were plenty of Nazis in the Wehrmacht.  As far as I know, SPR was well received in Germany.  Spielberg was honored with an award there shortly afterward.<br/><br/>This movie is anything but unrealistic.  I think I even saw a claim on the IMDB that it was fake because `Soldiers would never storm Normandy without air and artillery support.'  Guess what?  They did!  Normandy was an awful mess!  Heavy cloud cover and fear of killing their own soldiers prevented the US from defeating the defenses at Omaha, and lead to the ultra-realistic slaughter depicted in the first half-hour of the movie.<br/><br/>Some have called the actions of the Germans in the final sequence (one of the greatest I have ever seen), `unrealistic,' and `unintelligent.'  At this point in the war, the German army was in no position to carry out proper by-the-book battle tactics.  They were under Hitler's stubborn orders to `hold at all costs' and were sent on many suicidal missions like this one.  It was so bad that by the time of the Battle of the Bulge, Americans were appalled at the way that German soldiers marched right up a road, in broad daylight to the front.  Historian Steven Ambrose said that Americans had no choice but to open fire on the columns, and mow them down ""like a scythe cutting wheat!"" Besides, Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, and Privates, etc. on both sides make horrible mistakes, and this war was no exception. As for the plot of this movie, one historian described it as `Very possible, but not very probable.'  Take the case of Fritz Niland of the 501st PIR.  All three of his brothers were killed in combat, in different divisions.  Luckily, high officials in the US army knew where he was, and they had him sent home, immediately.<br/><br/>I don't see how anyone could not be affected by the opening sequence on Omaha Beach.  It is clearly amazing.  Actual veterans have offered their medals and patches to Spielberg because of it.  The climactic battle sequence is absolutely unforgettable.  I've seen it so many times, yet it is still difficult to watch.  It is incredibly suspenseful, frustrating, explosive, horrifying, and shocking, yet it is all beautifully and coherently filmed.  When Miller tells Ryan to `earn this,' he is also speaking to us, to the generations born after WWII, who have to respect what the veterans have done.<br/><br/>Most of us haven't `been there,' and we will never be able to say that we know what combat is like.  But Spielberg has pleased veterans in creating a movie that depicts their experiences as well as a movie possibly can.  SPR is a wonderful movie that will always be remembered, and that's worth more than any Oscar award it could have received."

","This film is excellent. Except for one respect. The toning in of the Stars and Stripes at the beginning and the end. Unnecessary, egocentric and downgrading. Most people who fought and died in WW2 were Europeans...<br/><br/>The thing that really made this film, is the opening sequence. The first 30 minutes are brilliant, horrifying and historical. Never, ever has war been depicted in such a realistic manner. It's genuine and true - not John Wayne waltzing out from the landing craft with the bullets whipping past him and his brave men. This is what it was like.<br/><br/>Other than that, this film is not too original. Most of the Germans are anonymous and disgusting, and even though the poor sod who gets to dig his own grave turns out to be a real b****rd. And there is one part I REALLY don't like: why on Earth does the guy they're looking for want to stay? It's irrational and unthinkable.<br/><br/>But all in all - this is a great movie. Not all too believable - but nonetheless, a realistic war movie. Just get rid of those flags, you guys!"
